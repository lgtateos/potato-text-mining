29th Congress, a. To. Of Reps2d Session/ /ANNUAL Report Of The Commi Ssi   Oner Of Patents. Reportotthe Commi Ssi   Oner Of Patents, For The Year 1846. January 23, 1847. Head, and referred to the Committee on Patents. Patent Offi Of, January, 1847. Of   R In conformity to the provisions of the act of Congress relating to this office, approved March 3, 1837, the undersigned has the honor to submit his annual report. During the year ending December 31, 1846, the whole number of applications for patents received, is twelve hundred and seventy-two. The hole number of caveats filed during the same time is four hundred andrtyeight. The number of patents issued in 1846 is six hundred andieteen, including thirteen reissues, five additional improvements, andrnrie designs; classified and alphabetical lists of which, with theirs of the patentees, are annexed, (marked G and During the same period, four hundred and seventy-three patents have expired a .it of which is annexed, (marked Three applications for extensions were made during the year; two of which were rejected, and one is still pending. Two patents have been extended by Congress during the same period. The claims embraced in the respective patents issued during the year 1846 and also annexed, (marked Jsthe receipts of the office during the year 1846, including duties and fee said in on application for patents, caveats, reissues, additional improvecid127nents, extensions, and for copies, amount, in the whole, to   $50,264.16;df which sum,   $11,086.99 have been repaid on applications withdrawn1iod for money paid in by mistake, as per statement marked The expenses of the office during the year 1846 are as follows, viz salaries,   $16,142.97; temporary clerks,  $5,685.61; contingent excid127, i, including postage and the fees paid to counsel in two suits in equity4eeCt pp pending against the Commissioner, in the United States district out in the eastern district of Pennsylvania, $7,485.19; compensation of the district judge,   $100 library,  $675.96; agricultural statistics, ritchie & He iss, printers. $3,610.68; amounting in the whole to the sum of  $33,700.41, as per statement marked B. There was also expended during the last year, under the act of March 3, 1837, for the restoration of records and drawings, the sum of  $786.31, and for duplicate models, the sum of  $585, as per statement marked C. The aggregate of expenditures under the different heads above enumerated, including money paid back on withdrawals, and for the restoration of records, drawings, and models, is  $46,158.71, leaving a balance to be carried to the credit of the patent fund of $4,105.45. In the first day of January, 1845, the amount of money in the treasury to the credit of the patent fund was   $182,459.69, which, with the balance paid in during the year 1846, will, on the first day of January, 1847,amount to   $186,565.14. Although the balance which the office has been able to place to its credit in the treasury during the year just past, in consequence of the decreased amount received on applications for patents, caveats, &c, (there being fewer foreign applications during the last year) and the additional amount refunded to applicants on the withdrawal of their claims, is not so great as that of the previous year, yet it is more than the average balance of former years, and indicates the flourishing condition and prospects of the Patent Office. Thus far the office has more than sustained itself, and fully realized the anticipation of Congress when it was reorganized upon its or- .ing. And if a conclusion may be drawn from the activity of the inventive genius of our countrymen, as exhibited in past years, we may rely confidently in the belief that this useful and noble institution of the government will never become a charge upon the treasury. The reports of the two principal examiners, giving a very interest i review of the inventions patented at this office, during the past year, annexed, (marked D and In reference to them, it will be seen that the year just past has not 1 without its valuable discoveries, which, if they do not surprise and del the mind with their novelty, and brilliancy, will contribute much t~ at convenience and welfare of man. It will be seen that almost every 'of invention and discovery has been explored by our in genius, persevering, and indefatigable countrymen, and many very valuable improvements in machinery, and processes of manufacture, brought to light; all contributing more or less to the improvement and progress of society. The operations of this office during the past year prove, as the circle of every year proves, that the inventor is ever the benefactor of his race, His genius bestows its favors on all. The manufacturer, the mechanics, the agriculturists, the merchant, all are the recipients of the benefits which are ever flowing from his toils, energies, and sometimes his great and sublime conceptions. To theme is more interesting for contemplation than this, and there is none which more deeply impresses the mind with a sense of the continued and onward progress of society in the grand career of civilization. I I n my last annual report I embraced the occasion to bring to the notice of Congress the embarrassed condition of this office in consequence of the great increase of its business, without a corresponding increase of its clerical force, particularly in its scientific department. When the office was reorganized in 1836, the Commissioner was allow. red but a single examiner. By the ll th section of the act of March 3, 1837, an additional examiner was authorized to be appointed; and by the act of March 3, 1839, two assistant examiners were provided for; since which time no addition to the examining corps has been authorized, and none has been made. In 1840, the first complete year after the last addition to the examining force was authorized, the number of applications for patents received was 765, the number of caveats filed 228, and the number of patents granted 475. During the year 1846 the number of applications for patents was 1,272,the number of caveats filed 448, and the number of patents granted 619. During the same year the number of applications for patents Which He reexamined and rejected was 398. Thus does it appear that, since the last addition to the examining force in 1839, the business of the office has increased nearly one hundred percent. It has increased beyond the physical ability of the present examiners and assistants to keep up with it, although constantly and industriously engaged in the performance of their onerous and fatigueing duties. The consequence is, that business accumulates i upon their desks; applicants are delayed in having their cases examined, often to their great detriment, and always' to the injury of the office; which is complained of for its delays by persons not knowing the condition i of its business and theijkkuacay of its force, let in it is constantly exerting itself to the utmost to accommodate the public; as well as to relieve itself from inconvenience resulting from a pressure of its duties. When it is 1 considered that the Late it Office derives its revenues entirely from the inventors, and sustains itself without charge upon the treasury, the justice of their complaints cannot be; denied nor evaded. Flat I am confident they cannot attach to the Patent Office, nor to any of its officers. The state of its business was fully presented to Congressinmy last report, and again in a subsequent communication addressed to the chairman of the Committee on Patents and the Patent Office of the Men at the last session. :did 127) It is therefore respectfully submitted, whether, i in view of the fact that its revenues are a 'pale for the increased expenditure, which will in that event be required it is not expedient for Congress to authorize the addition to the examining corps which the present state of the business of the office imperatively demands. By the 11th section of the act of Arc i 3, 1837;I am authorized to employ all necessary 'temporary clerks for writing and i copying, at a compensation of ten cents for every hiuntdredivords. This provision enables into provide for any ex agency in the i lexical department of the office. To addition, therefore, is deemed necessary to this branch of service in the office. . In connexion with the subject of an increase of the scientific force of the Patent Office, I would &again respectfully suggest the propriety andexpedienicy of increasing the salaries of the, principal and assistant examiners. This subject i as brought t the attention of Congress by my predecessor in his last annual report arid its experience and justice portrayed with great for c :as well as earnestness. Convinced, from my, own observation, of the justice of his recommendation, I cordially concur red with him in the views Which he expressed, an rid enforced the reconmriendatio0
with such additional reasons as my own, experience had placed at my command. Seeming it unnecessary to repeat the reasons in favor of the proposition, which I again submit, I would respectfully refer to the last report of my predecessor previous to his retiring from this office, and to my own of the last year, for all the information which is deemed necessary to enable Congress to come to a correct conclusion in relation to the subject. But I would again refer to the able and interesting reports of the examiners attached to the reports of the Commissioner for the last two years, and to this report, for proof of the talents and scientific qualifications requisite to enable the incumbents to fill those laborious and responsible desk with credit to themselves and usefulness to the country. The remark may be safely hazarded, that there are but very few offices in the government which require more ability for sound and nice discrimination, more extensive and varied acquirements, and, it may be added, more in flexible integrity of character, than the office of examiner of patents. The revenues of the Patent Office are ample for the proposed increase of force and salaries in the examining corps; and the interests of the public, as well as of the inventors, require that it should be made fn my last annual report I had the honor to submit to Congress a proposition for certain modifications of the existing patent law, which 1 deemed important and necessary for the protection of the inventor, as well as the public. A bill, embodying most of the modifications suggested, was reported in each House, by the committees having the matter in charge but, in consequence of the great amount of business pressing upon Congress at the last session, it failed to become a law. The bill provided for two important and essential changes in the existing law in relation to patents. One of those provisions was, that in all, suits brought by the patentee for infringements of his invention, the letters patent securing his invention should be received by the courts trying the same as conclusive evidence of his right to recover damages, until they were set aside by the institution and prosecution to final judge of a process for their repeal. The other was a provision for the institution of a process for the repeal of letters patent which had been obtained by fraud, his representation, or upon fall* suggestion, or which were void, in whole or in part, for want of novelty, or other cause. The very inadequate protection afforded to the patentee by the present law, seems to me to furnish sufficient reason for the proposed modification. After the vigorous and searching ordeal through which every invention passes at the Patent Office, it certainly seems reasonable that the letters patent, in der the seal of one of the offices of the government of the Unitedstates, should be received in courts of justice as conclusive evidence of the title of the patentee to his invention, and his right to recover, until his patent shall have been revoked and annulled for good and sufficient cause, by a tribunal competent to investigate the matter . But the present law extends no such protection to the patentee. It present his letters patent are only presumptive evidence of the novelty of his invention, and of his right to recover. Consequently, the validity of his patent may be, and for the purposes of embarrassment often is, put in issue in suits for infringement, and he is compelled to prove the novelty of his invention over and over again, as often as the de predator upon4
5his rights, whom he seeks to punish, is disposed to put him to that trouble. Any instances of this, wanton aggression upon the rights of the meritorious inventor have come to the knowledge of the undersigned since he has had the honor to be a it the head of the Patent Office. And many of these instances of aggression proceed from wealthy and powerful companies and corporations, and the subjects of them are the inventors of the most useful and valuable machines and improvements. The more valuable the invention, the in ire liable is it to pray and infringement. These wealthy and powerful bodies know well the benefit to them of the laws delay, and its ruinous expense to the single handed individual who dares to resist their unlawful and unjust invasion of his rights; and hence, in the end they hope to win, either by the defeat of the patentee by means of some trifling defect in his title deed, or his inability to procure the necessary evidence to substantiate his right, or by a compromise, in which he will be forced to sacrifice a portion of his claims in order to relieve himself from the embarrassment and expense of the unequal contest. As the law now stands, the great burden of the controversy falls upon the patentee, and not upon the wanton violators of his rights, as it should. In this view of the matter, I think all candid men will agree that when a patentee has established, in the judgment of the office or tribunal whose duty it is to pass upon his claims in the first instance, a right to letters patent of the United States, that document should be his shield and protection until it is shown by others, who dispute his title, that he has no right to it. I am aware that there if a prejudice existing in the minds of a portion of the community (small I believe it is) against the claims of inventors. I tis contended by some that patents securing exclusive rights to the discoverers of now machines or processes of manufacture are monopolies, operating to the detriment of the best interests of the community, and existing against the true policy of all just governments ; and, therefore, are to be regarded with suspicion, construed with great strictness, and defeated if possible. I am fully persuaded that, on a little reflection, such a view of the rights of inventors will disappear from the minds of candid and reasonable men. What are the grounds on which all civilized and enlightened governments grant to persons making valuable discoveries in the arts and manufactures a limited monopoly of the benefits of their inventions The main ground is to encourage discovery and invention those great agents of social improvement by securing to those who make them the profits which result from them, in order to enable them to remuneratethemselves for their toils and expenditures, and to induce others to explore the vast and limitless field of invention. Very new discovery in science and art contributes to the wealth, convenience, and comfort of individuals, and to the improvement of society. Some of the inventions of the last few centuries have burst upon the world with the brilliancy of the morning sun, changing the whole aspect of society, and conferring incalculable benefits upon the human race. I need mention only the art of printing, the discovery of gunpowder, the steam engine, the cotton gin, the spinning jenny, the power loom, the steamboat, the railroad, and the magnetic telegraph. These great discoveries in science and art have revolution sized the condition of the civilized world, and 6 their influence at this moment is probably more potent and more sensibly felt than ever before. I mention these great discoveries as striking instances of the effect of the labors of the inventor upon society and civilization. There are others of less note, producing their due influence upon the condition and welfare of the world. Even the most humble discovery contributes its due proportion to relieve the human family of its burdens, and administer to its comforts, and to accelerate and aggrandize its unceasing and triumphant progress in the improvement of its condition, and the expansion and perfection of its lofty nature and destiny . Therefore, there is ample reason why society should reward and encourage that class of its benefactors whose claims I am now considering, by securing to them, for a limited term, the exclusive enjoyment of the fruits of their genius and labors. But it cannot be denied that, upon the principles of abstract justice, the inventor has a complete and unquestionable claim to the fruits of his discoveries until his labors and sacrifices are adequately regenerated. Any valuable and profitable discoveries in the arts are the result of a sudden and lucky conception in a happy moment; but twos, y of them are the fruits of days and years of incessant toil, anxious and harassing thought, and great pecuniary sacrifices. His: toil, this mental effort, and these pecuniary sacrifices, establish, a title to the product which is their offspring, as sacred and irrefragable in the eye of justice as the title to his farm, his workshop, or his merchandise, which a man has acquired by his labor, skill, and economy. To clear and convincing is this view of the right of the inventor to the fruits of his genius and labor, that argument in its support would seem to take from its strength. Met the reasons are equally strong that the inventors exclusive enjoyment of his discoveries should not be perpetual, but should be permitted only for a limited period. All inventions, great and small, generally have their period of birth, growth, maturity, and perfection, if the latter term be allow able. ,and if one mind conceives and gives birth to the first idea, many assist in its development and expansion. Probably no piece of mechanism was ever made which was perfect in all its parts at its first creation. The steam engine is an interesting and beautiful illustration of the gradual progress of an invention, from its first conception in the mind of the inventor to its present wonderful state of perfection and efficiency. It first appeared in a rude form, un wield and dangerous to those who dared to operate it a thing designed more for experiment than utility; and now, after passing through nearly two centuries of improvement, and taxing the highest intellectual energies of thousands of, ingenious and skilful men, it appears to us with a perfection, in the nice and delicate adjustment of its machinery, which astonished and delights us, and an efficiency and power of action which enable it to confer the greatest and most lasting benefits upon mankind. ,the history of this wonderful engine and instrument of civilization i shows as clearly and conclusively that: the claims of the inventor to the fruits of his genius should not be .perpetual, as it does that he should be permitted to enjoy the nm until he is adequately regenerated for his labor and expenditures. For, if his right to his invention were perpetual and exclusive, no other person could improve it, because he could not use his. 7 improvement with the original invention, and therefore not at all. His would immeasurably retard, if not wholly prevent, all improvement of original inventions, and would result in incalculable injury and mischief to society. Hence, while admitting the unquestionable justice of the claim of the inventor to the fruits of his genius for a period of time sufficient to enable him to regenerate himself adequately for his toils and expenses, it is absolutely necessary, for the progress of improvement and the welfare of society, that his exclusive right should then cease, and his invention become the common property of the public. Others will then have an opportunity to remedy the defects of, and to improve and perfect, his original creations. And, in: accordance with this view of the subject, the constitution of the United States authorizes Congress to enact laws for the promotion of the useful arts and the protection of the inventor in the enjoyment of the fruits of his genius and skill for. a certain period, the duration of which is limited to fourteen years; at the end of which time, in consideration of such protection, his invention, and the secret of it, shall become the property of the public. I have been thus particular in setting forth the general principles of the patent law, because, as before remarked, a prejudice prevails to some extent in the community against the justice of the claims of the inventor to temporary protection in the enjoyment of the fruits of his labors. am, however, happy to see that juster sentiments are growing more prevalent in relation to the rights of that valuable and meritorious class of citizens. During the past year courts of justice have displayed a more earnest desire to give protection to the inherit or, as evinced by the liberal construction which they have given to the present imperfect patent law, whenever questions relating to patents have come before the mr for adjudication. The bills reported by the respective committees of the two houses contained other provisions less important than the two which I have been considering, deemed, however, to be necessary modifications and improvements of the existing law in relation to patents; but as they were particularly explained in my former report, it is' unnecessary further to consider them. I n' connexion with the subject of the amendment of the existing patent law, I would respectfully suggest the experience of making some new provision in reference to the applications of the citizens and subjects of other countries for letters patent in the United States. By the existing law a subject of Great Britain is required to pay intothe treasury a duty of    $500 before his application can be examined. The citizens and subjects of all other foreign countries are each required to pay into the treasury a duty of  $300 on their respective applications. These duties were designed to bear some proportion to the duties required of American citizens making applications for patents in other countries, and on that ground may, perhaps, be justified and defended. The effect of this provision is unquestionably to prevent the introduction into this country of many useful and valuable discoveries, which would otherwise be patented and introduced. Similar high duties have the effect to exclude American inventions from other countries. Thus all countries are injured by this system of taxing genius for the exertion8
of its powers, in order to obtain comparatively a very small and trifling amount of revenue. It affords no protection to the American inventor to keep out the discoveries of his foreign emulation (not rival) in the arts, by taxing the emanations of his genius with high duties, while the country would derive much benefit from their introduction. Therefore, it is respectfully submitted whether it would not be expedient, if Congress should make the amendments to the patent law already proposed, also to provide contingently for the reduction of the duties required on application for patents by the citizens or subjects of foreign governments to thirty dollars, whenever it shall appear that corresponding reductions have been made, by those governments, of the duties required of American citizens. I have reason to believe that the proposition would be received with favor by some, if not all, of the European governments. As constant inquiry is made, by citizens residing in all parts of the Union, for information in relation to the laws of foreign governments respecting the granting of patents, I have, for the accommodation and convenience of such persons, caused abstracts to be made of the legislative provisions and ordinances of all foreign governments of which this office is in possession, which are here to annexed, marked F. The law providing for the admission of Texas into the Union failed to make provision for the transfer to this office of the records, models, and drawings of the patent office of Texas. For has there yet been made by Congress any provision by which patents granted in Texas, before the admission of that State into the Union, shall be valid in the United States. Under the new relations of that State to the Union, it would appear to be necessary for the public convenience, and the protection of those citizens of Texas who obtained patents under the government of that State when existing as an independent republic, that the contents of the patent office of Texas should be transferred to this office, and that such legal provision should be made by Congress as may appear to be necessary to secure the validity of all patents granted under the authority of that State prior to its annexation to this republic. Congress, at its last session, having declined to make the usual appropriation for the annual agricultural report made by this office, I regarded the act as an instruction to me not to prepare a report of that character for the year just past, and accordingly none has been prepared, and none will, of course, be made to Congress at its present session. Whether or not such a report as this office has been required to make for some years past upon the state of the crops, the amount of agricultural products, and the discoveries and improvements in the science and practice of agriculture, is of any value to Congress or to the country, it is not for the undersigned to affirm. Met it is respectfully submitted that from no other source could so much accurate and valuable information in relation to the condition and progress of agriculture be obtained, as from the reports of this office upon that subject; of course, not referring to the report of last year. The remark, I am confident, may be safely hazarded, that from no other source could such accurate estimates of the amount of agricultural production of each year be obtained as from the reports of this office; as the statement of a few facts, showing the ground on which those estimates were made, will clearly prove. 9 n the first place, the office assumed the returns of the census of 1840 as the basis of its estimates. It then observed the progress of the growth of each crop in each succeeding year in every district and county in the Union, from the planting of the seed until the harvest of the matured crop; carefully noting, day by day and week by week, all the causes which operated favorably or un favorably upon it; the effect of the weather, the ravages of insects, the effects of <a name="blight0"><mark>blight</mark></a> and <a name="mildew0"><mark>mildew</mark></a>, and decreased or additional cultivation. This extended system of observation it was enabled to adopt through the aid of agricultural and other newspapers and journals, and of letters from distinguished practical agriculturists, received from every neighborhood in our widely extended country. To show the extent of this system of operation, it is only necessary to state the fact that the great number of 5,000 newspapers, journals, and letters were carefully read and examined in making up the report for the last year. It may, therefore, be. safely assumed that no institution or association of individuals in the country had such extensive means at command for estimating the amount of agricultural products within the Union as were in the possession of the Patent Office. Of course, it is not pretended that the estimates of this office were mathematically precise and exact, for in relation to such subjects precision and exactness are absolutely impossible. It is only assumed for them that they approximated as near to precision and exactness as the nature of the subject rendered it possible to approach to certainty. But their general accuracy and value are sufficiently proved by the fact that they were received in this and foreign countries as the best and most reliable estimates of the amount of, the agricultural products of this country that Would be, obtained from any source. And they are cited and referred to in public documents, and in the leading journals of trade and commerce, as the only authentic estimates of the crops of, the United States worthy of reference and confidence. Assuming the general accuracy of those estimates, it is hardly necessary to speak of their value. The time has gone by when legislation for great communities is to be based upon theories or abstract axioms in political philosophy. Acts, now, are deemed the only solid foundation for the super structures of the modern statesman. And without a knowledge of the statistics of a nation, which embrace every fact relating to its condition and welfare, physical, moral, or political, it is almost impossible to legislate wisely for its interests. And no statistical knowledge is more important than that which exhibits the resources of a nation, as indicated by the products of its labor. An important part of that knowledge the agricultural estimates of the Patent Office were designed to furnish. Another object of the agricultural report of the. Patent Office was to collect and embody every fact within its reach, which tended to show the improvement and progress of agriculture in the United States during each year; and, in order to accomplish this result, so desirable and so valuable to the agriculturists, every new discovery in the science of agriculture, and those kindred and auxiliary sciences from which it derives its most essential aid namely, geology, chemistry, and botany and every new improvement and experiment in the practice of agriculture, in this and all foreign countries, were carefully noted, collected, and embodied in a form which enabled every intelligent citizen to see and comprehend the progress of that10
greatest and noblest occupation of man during the year. In order to perform this portion of its duties, this office was amply provided with the ablest and most approved publications of this country, England, Scotland, France, Germany, and Russia, not only relating directly to the science of agriculture, but to all branches of science with which it had immediate or remote connexion. It also availed itself of the labors of eminent experimenteds in our own country, who kindly and generously communicated to the head of the office the results of their labors and experiments. All this mass of valuable information, collected from a thousand different sources, was embodied and presented in a comparatively narrow compass to the American agriculturists, and at a comparatively small expense to the treasury. I think it may be safely affirmed that in no other country in the world was so large an amount of valuable information collected and presented to the people at so little expense, the annual appropriation to this office for the purpose not exceeding  $3,000 per annum. In proof of this remark I would refer to a single fact. The importance of the potato crop the annual value of which is equal to one half the value of the whole cotton crop of the Union which has, during the last three years, been greatly injured by the ravages of that remarkable and fatal <a name="disease0"><mark>disease</mark></a> which has assailed the potato in the northern and middle States, and in most of the countries of Europe, rendered it, in my judgment, expedient to collect and embody every fact which would tend to throw light upon the origin and progress of the <a name="disease1"><mark>disease</mark></a>, and if possible point out the remedy. With that view a large portion of the report of the last year was devoted to that subject, and a large amount of valuable information respecting it collected, and at very little expense. During the same year a commission, composed of eminent scientific gentlemen, was appointed by the British government to proceed to I re land and investigate the potato <a name="disease2"><mark>disease</mark></a> as it appeared in that island. The expenses of the commission amounted to nearly  $90,000 ; yet the results of the labors of that enlightened committee, which were very valuable, were all embodied in the agricultural report of the Patent Office, with twenty fold as much more upon the same subject. The alarming nature of the calamity which had befallen the potato attracted the attention of many of the governments of Europe, but from none emanated publications containing so large an amount of valuable information upon the subject as the report from this office. The industry of this office in collecting information in reference to this subject enabled it to answer the inquiries of many of the governments of Europe. It is unnecessary to refer to other subjects connected with agriculture which were embraced in the reports of this office. It is believed that the value of the services of this office in relation to the interests oifagricultireare appreciated by that great and intelligent class of the people engaged in agricultural pursuits, as would seem to appear from the expressions of numerous letters and public journals received at this office. Of Congress had deemed it expedient to continue the report, several valuable improvements and additions to it were contemplated. A larger field of inquiry had been marked out than had been previously investigated. It was designed to embrace within the scope of future invest it ion additional crops and products, the amount of cultivated land in the Union, the statistics of the movements of agricultural products from the interior to the commercial parts and their export to foreign countries, the
11prices of agricultural products, the wages of labor, &c, &c. which, connected with the information previously furnished in a more condensed form, would not have failed to add to and increase the value of the report. I am aware that it has been objected against the agricultural report of the Patent Office, that it was unauthorized by the constitution, and that, if permitted to be continued, it would endanger the liberties of the people. Of collecting and laying before the country valuable statistical information is unconstitutional, I have no argument with which to meet the objection; and I am equally unable to comprehend how the operations of this office, connected with agriculture, can endanger the government or the people. It has not its thousand agents scattered through the country, to impress its influence unduly upon the public mind; it has but little money to expend, and no patronage to bestow; its operations are silent and unseen, and they are as harmless as they are silent. I to whole expenditure in this branch of its duties amounts to but a few hundred dollars, and most of that small amount goes in payment of clerks, the purchase of seeds, and in subscriptions to agricultural publications : but these objections require no further answer. For should it ,e forgotten that the Patent Office has been instrumental, within the last few years, in introducing into the country many varieties of grains and vegetables ; and it has aided much in introducing intothe newly settled portions of the Union valuable varieties of grains and vegetables well known in i those portions of the Union which have been longer settled, and are more highly cultivated and, although the popular names of the varieties of seeds it has distributed have given occasion for ingenious irony and dignified ridicule, from sources evidently but little acquainted with such humble yet important matters, no seeds have received names at this office for the purpose of in position or deception, and none have been distributed which have borne names not familiar ly known to every intelligent farmer and horticulturist in the country. All the varieties of grains and vegetable seeds distributed from this office may not have been valuable. Any, from want of adaptation to soil or climate, may not have been successful perhaps not terminated ;but, if one valuable variety of either is introduced from abroad, or disseminated in parts of the Union in which it was not before known, the trifling cost of the operation is a million times repaid, and the cause of agriculture is promoted. It has also been objected that the agricultural duties of this office have been assumed without authority of law, and were therefore a grave abuse and usurpation of power. It is not proper, perhaps, for me to vindicate the conduct of my predecessor under whose administration of the office it was introduced. It will not, however, be irrelevant to remark, that the subject had been a matter of serious consideration by the committee of the House of Representatives upon the Patent Office during the session of 1839 40, and the Commissioner was then requested, by: the able chairman of that committee, to communicate to the committee (a( any information relative to the collection and distribution of seeds and plants; also, the practice ability of obtaining agricultural statistics, with the addition of any suggestions deemed important in relation to those subjects that inquiry was answered by the Commissioner in the liberal and enlightened spirit in which it was made, and the collection of agricultural 12 statistics and the distribution of seeds and plants by the Patent Office were sanctioned and provided for by Congress, by small appropriations made each year, with one or two exceptions, since. That a department or bureau of government should devote a portion of its duties to the important interests of agriculture, is no new thing in the history of nations. Most, if not all of the leading governments of Europe have departments charged with these responsible duties, under the supervision of officers called Ministers of the I interior. And such a department seems to have been contemplated by President Washington and the earlier statesmen of the republic. In the message of General Washington to Congress, in December, 1796,an agricultural or home department is recommended by that revered and illustrious statesman and patriot. In 1812, it was again recommended in a most able and enlightened report, drawn up and presented to the House of Representatives by the On. Dam Herbert, chairman of the select committee appointed to inquire into the state of the Patent Office. And again, in 1817, tie subject was considered by a select committee of the House of Representatives, which, through one of its members, the On. M. Hulbert, reported in favor of the establishment by Congress of a National Board of Agriculture. The views of the committee were expressed in the following brief and emphatic language: " The extent of territory, and the richness and consequent productive ness of the soil of our country, can never fail to invite and employ in the cultivation of the earth far the greater portion of American industry." The interests of agriculture must therefore be primarily important to the people of the United States, and must at all times deserve the warm support and liberal patronage of government. The committee observe, with pleasure, that President Washington, in his speech to Congress of the 7th of December, 1796, recommended to that body the interests of agriculture, and the establishment of a national board to promote the same." In different parts of Europe, as well as in several States of this Union, such boards have been instituted under the auspices of government, and have diffused much useful information, and contributed largely, as the committee believe, to the public welfare." After due consideration of the subject, the committee are of the opinion that it is advisable to establish at the seat of government a national board of agriculture, and report a bill for that purpose t is not recommended, nor is it desired by the undersigned, that any such department, or national board of agriculture, should be instituted by this government. The practices of other enlightened governments are referred to only to show that the exercise of such functions by government is not without precedent, nor without utility. The concur ring testimony of a very large number of intelligent citizens from every State and district in the Union, received at this office, furnishes convincing proof of the beneficial influences of the agricultural reports of the Patent Office. They have been distributed, through the agency of Congress, to every district in the Union; they have penetrated every neighborhood, and been read in almost every family; and they have awakened an interest upon the subject of agriculture among the intelligent farming classes of our population not before exhibited nor felt. Of they. 13 have not always led to efforts to improve, they have produced in the mind even of the humbler agriculturists a conviction of the true dignity of his noble a vocation, and of its first and transcend ant importance among the great interests of his country. Of they had produced no other effect, the money which they have cost would not have been idly expended. For should it be forgotten that it is the only expenditure which has been made by Congress for the especial benefit of the agricultural classes; the only expenditure for an interest in the pursuits of which tenfold the amount of capital is invested that is invested in any other pursuit; many times the amount of value annually produced that is produced by any other interest ; and many times the number of persons employed that are employed in all the other great interests of the country put together. Met how much is expended, and how much time is employed, in legislatingfor those other interests, and how little for agriculture. All which is respectfully submitted.

During the year 1846, the whole number of applications presented to the office is 1,272. Of these, 648 have been apportioned to me for examination. At the commencement of the year 1846, there were on hand, of my classes, 127 applications upon which no examination had been made. In the 1st of January, 1847, there were on hand, of my classes 147 applications un examined. As every application which is not finally disposed of upon the first examination, may be the subject of re examination at any time thereafter, a large proportion of the time of your examiners is taken up in such re examinations. The whole number of my examinations and re examinations during the past year is 1,101. But of these, 360 have been reported favorably, and ordered to be patented. For 18 of this number, ordered to issue at the close of the year, the letters patent have not yet been completed; and consequently these, in the general official report, will go upon the list of patents for 1847. The number of rejections is 363. The actual number of applications rejected is less than the number patented, as many of those patented were rejected upon their first examination, in consequence of the applicant failing to specify what was really his invention, and laying claim to what was neither new nor patent able. Such cases are not of un frequent occurrence. It often happens that two or three rejections are recorded upon one application; each re examination requiring new investigations and elaborate reasoning to meet the new claims and views of the applicant and to sustain the decision of the office. Of the cases reported by me, two have been the subjects of appeal from your final decision. The first of these cases of appeal to the chief justice of the district court of the United States for the District0of Columbia was 16 by Solomon C. Earner, from you t decision upon the case of Solomon C. Earner is. Charles Good year, for claims to certain alleged improvements in stirring I india rubber goods. The decision of the court in this case affirmed the decision of the office. The second case of appeal from your decision is yet pending, in consequence of the recent illness of Chiefjustice Branch. During the past year there have been nine cases of interference under my notice, eight of which have been reported, and received your final decision upon the testimony presented. The examination of testimony and preparation of report by your examiner, in one of these cases, occupied six days, to the exclusion of other pressing business. The <a name="loss0"><mark>loss</mark></a> to your department, and to myself personally, by the sudden death of my assistant, Mr. Henry Tone, added the labor of his official duties to my own for nearly three months. But notwithstanding the many embarrassments of the past year, your examiner has felt himself sustained by the extension of such facilities as were in your power to grant, and is gratified to find that the amount of unfinished business before him is not so great as was anticipated. The following tabular estimate will exhibit the amount of business which has passed under my hands during the year just expired, and also of all the unfinished business in charge of your two examiners Whole number of applications to the office for the year 1846 -1272Number presented for my examination -648 Number presented to the other examiner -624Number on hand in my classes un examined -147 Number on hand for my re examination -4151Number on hand in the other examiners charge un examined -99 Number on hand for his re examination -10109Number of cases on hand in my classes which have been examined, and are liable to be called up at any time for re examination -167 Same with the other examiner -237404Number of cases on hand which have been rejected by both examiners, and not yet withdrawn, (a portion of which may at any time be called up for re examination) -551 Whole number of cases on hand with both examiners un examined, and those examined which are liable to be called up for re examination -664Add to these, rejected cases not withdrawn -551Tpvps in h nan -a_ .1 21. a. 17 Whole number of actions upon cases in my classes for the year 1846 -1101The subjects, of applications for patents are comprised under 22 general classes, each of them embracing many subdivisions in some cases more than 20. Eleven classes of inventions are assigned to me for examination, and are as follows, viz 1st. Agriculture, including instruments and operations 2d. Chemical processes, manufactures and compounds, including medicines, dyeing, color making, dis tilling, soap and candle making, mortars, cement, &c 3d. Calorific, comprising lamps, fireplaces, stoves, grates, furnaces for heating buildings, cooking apparatus, preparations for fuel, &c 4th.

Surgical and medical instruments, including trusses, dental instruments, bathing apparatus, &c 11th. Hearing apparel, articles for the toilet, &c, including instruments for manufacturing. Agri Culturenumber of applications, 161 -number of patents granted, 78. This, the earliest of arts, receives but few yearly accessions of genuine value, though applications for patents under this head are still numerous. A large proportion of this class are rejected; and of the many patented, but few comparatively come into general use. The practice of some arts in our wide extent of country is strictly local; and that of others is confined to certain sections: in such cases, the contributions of genius to the respective wants of the artisans are known to all engaged in the particular pursuits for which these contributions are adapted. But the field of agriculture is the whole area of our republic, and the wants of the laborers are as various as the character of its surface and species of production. The improvements in this branch, therefore, are of two great classes : first, those Of a general nature, applicable, to a certain extent, in almost every part of our territory; and, second, those which are sectional. Of the later class are the many labor saving machines used in prairie culture, which cannot be elsewhere adopted with economy. For this reason applications in this class come from every part of the country, even the most 218 remote; and thus it often happens that devices which are old, very old are re invented by men who have little or no communication with the world, having actually contrived the thing to suit their own peculiar wants, and supposing that it could not have existed before. This is true of many other subjects of invention ; but particularly so of agriculture. It is somewhat remarkable, that in a science or art of such ancient date there should be at this late day so earnest a demand for improvement and definite information. The highly interesting discoveries of Lie big have not yet fulfilled their ample promises, and it will probably be many years before they can be generally known and appreciated. They have, to some extent, been carried out by the few who are possessed of the amount of scientific learning and skill requisite to insure their proper application, but at present are far beyond the reach of the majority of farmers. The enthusiastic speculations in gun no, poudrette, and artificial manures, have somewhat a bated, if we can credit the public journals, and but little is just now heard of the phantom of electro culture. Chemical science is doing much, and will do much more, for agriculture, but the prudent f r her will wait until the results of the experimenter find their proper level, and should never relax his toil in any golden dream of suddenly converting his barren wastes into fertile fields ; but, in the midst of all his facilities, must draw as largely as ever upon the" sweat of his brow" without which his land cannot become or remain fertile. Notwithstanding the many exceptions to be found in the new and extensive regions of our country, the old ad age must hold good, that farming is (a" uphill work Horse rake his instrument, one of the most valuable and extensively used of all the modern labor saving machines for the husband man, has, during the past year, undergone several improvements, both as to efficiency of operation and cheapness of construction. The elasticity of the teeth has been so regulated that the rake can scarcely leave a wisp for the "poor gleaned" upon the most uneven surface; and the revolving of the rake upon segment wheels, and catching it after the revolution, is so certain and manage able, that a boy may guide and operate one of the largest size. Cultivatorsthe cultivate or has been the subject of improvement in several points; and from the variety of these instruments already patented, it seems as if the farmer of almost any condition could find one to suit his purpose, however difficult. One especially seems to be deserving attention, in which the teeth are firmly secured, and the framework so constructed, upon the principle of the lazy tongs, that the teeth may be separated or approximated so as not only to apply to the culture of various crops, but to the working of the same crop in various stages of its growth. An improvement patented near the close of 1845, which escaped notice in my last annual report, presents its claims at this time more strongly, and may be briefly averted to as an economical and dura be mode of makirngcultivator teeth, by simply s wedding thick plate iron into the required form, which is such as to give it great strength, and at the same time admit of its being fastened securely to the beam with the: utmost facility, and as easily removed when necessary. Ploiighstwo inventions, and apparently valuable improvements in the plough, have been patentee-one for regulating the breadth of furrow slice, and the other for regulating both the depth and breadth' A patent has been granted for a potato dagger, which the inventor averse ill remedy the defects in instruments of this kind hitherto used. Of so, the has attained a very desirable end, as a labor saving machine for this crop is much needed. A fruit gathered, of very ingenious and simple construction, has been patented. It professes to be an improvement upon one heretofore patented, in which the same principle is used for seizing the fruit. This was effected by means of wire fingers, forming a kind of hand or cage attached to a pole i he fingers being closed over the fruit by means of a cord passing through loops upon their extremities. The improvement consists in so combining a long sack or tubular bag with the fingers, that the bag shall serve at the same time to close the fingers (by pulling upon it) and conduct the fruit, without bruising 1, to the hand of the person gathering. But very little appears to have been effected hitherto in Europe, from whence we have derived our best fruits, for gathering choice garden fruits beyond the reach of the hand; and either of the above named is far in advance of the awkward contrivances of foreign gardeners for this purpose, Two improvements in far fiery have been the subjects of patents-one by which that simple implement the carry comb has been still further simplifies and cheap end ; and its principal recommendation appears to be the prevention of choking by giving it an open back: the other purport ed to be an advantageous mode of treating picked horses. Doubts were entertained as to the propriety of granting letters patent for what was supposed to encourage a cruel practice; but, upon full statements by the inventor, and careful consideration on the part of the office, it was concluded that the introduction of the invention would rather tend to diminish than increase the amount of brute suffering, and the patent accordingly issued. The device in question, by means of frame work attached to a saddle, allows the animal subjected to this " barbarous sport of fashion to lie down in his stall, when under the old treatment he was kept for weeks in the standing posture until his wounds were healed. In this connexion may be mentioned an improved ox yoke, patented during the past year; the contrivance renders the burden lighter to the oxen, and prevents them from worrying each other by want of agreement in their move men to. See moth lantern one of the devices hitherto invented for preventing the ravages of the bee moth ha ve proved entirely effectual. The" bee moth lantern" patented during the past 'year is a simple and useful instrument, and will be found efficacious not only in diminishing the numbers of the bee moth, but for destroying great numbers of other noxious insects, and is expected to be of great utility in tobacco fields. Boths themselves are harmless; it is a prior stage of the insect in which the destructive powers are recognised. As each female moth deposites vast numbers of eggs, it is evident that the destruction of the moth should be the prime object of attention. The bee moth lantern is simply a small lantern with glass sides, made to slope inwards towards the bottom, which is surrounded with a trough containing oil. As insects are attracted by the flame of the lamp, they come from a great distance around, alight upon the sloping glass sides, and continue flying or crawling up and down until they get their wings caught in the oil, when they are at once crippled and fall down into it. The most apparent difficulty in the way of its usefulness is, that unless employed extensively it might (by reason of its attraction for the insects) entice many more than could be destroyed; but if by common consent it could be generally adopted in neighborhoods, it would evidently be productive. of great good. A: difficulty of this .kind has: always existed with the limited use of insect traps of various kinds. Chemi Stry. U mber of applications, 44.--Number of patents granted, 24. It needs not my testimony to prove ,that chemistry is at present more rapidly advancing than any other department of human knowledge. The provisions, made in the several schools of Europe for instructing practically whole classes of pupils in analytical chemistry, are already developing their importance in pouring upon us a whole flood of: chemical discoveries many of them immediately applicable to the arts. While the number of applications for patents in this branch; seems to have kept pace with the general progress of the science, their importance and interest exceeds that of the previous year. In this respect the invention of gun cotton is pre eminent. It is at present the popular theme ; and every issue of the numerous scientific journals, every newspaper and periodical, is rep let with observations upon gun cotton. It becomes me to speak only of the history and some few of the characteristics of this material, as the report upon its claims, for the purposes of the government in firearms, &c, belongs to another department, and has already, been given. The great degree of public and private interest manifested in this matter, the numerous publications from various quarters, asserting. for different individuals priority and originality of invention or discovery, seem to make it necessary that a full statement of facts in possession of the office be given in relation to this new product. It may be premised here that patents are granted for new and useful inventions, or discoveries; and that, as a general rule of patent law, the mere applications of discoveries or inventions are not patent able subjects. But when such applications involve invention or discovery, patents maybe granted. It does not appear that Prof. Schonbein, of Basle, was. the discovered of the fact that certain organic substances formed singular and explosive compounds with nitric acid, nor the first to suggest the use of such compounds as substitutes for gunpowder in firearms. In the Comptez End us for 15th October, 1838, we have an account of some experiments by Pelouze, of which the following is a summary: He commences by stating that Braconnot, many years before, had discovered a new compound of starch with nitric acid, to which he gave the name ofxyloidine; that the peculiar properties of this substance had not been investigated, or excited the attention which they merited. Xyloidine was produced by dissolving starch in nitric acid of specific gravity 1.5, and then precipitated by the addition, of water. The starch, he considered, acted as a base to the nitric acid, forming the compound xyl6idine, which was found to be very combustible, burning with great vividness at the temperature of 1800 cent i grade. He further found, that by treating paper, linen, and cotton cloth with the concentrated acid for two :or three minutes, they became stiff, or like parchment, and when well washed became very combustible, from the presence of xyloidine, M. Pelouze remarks, that the " combustibility (or explosive character, we may call it) of xyliidine led him to some experiments which he believed susceptible of certain applications, particularly in firearms." His precise language is given in a note below, that it may not be -mistaken* and particularly to compare it with his recent statement made to the meeting of the French Academy of Science on the 2d November last. (see London Mechanics' Magazine forNoyember, 1846.) M. Pelouze states as follows: "I ascertained and this think is a; very important result in the history of the application of xylaidinethat instead of dissolving the cell close substances, it might be obtained with infinitely greater facility and economy by simply impregnating with concentrated nitric acid paper, cotton, and hemp; and these organic matters, thus treated, took fire at 1800 cent i grade, and burnt almost without residuium, and with excessive energy; but I think it right to add, that I never for an instant had an idea of their use as a substitute for gunpowder the merit of this application belongs entirely to M. Sschi3nbeincomparing this avow al of Pelouze with his communication in theComptes Rendusit must be inferred that it was only the /xyloidiue, as obtained from starch, that he contemplated applying to purposes of ordnance. It further appears that, although he operated upon linen and cotton in the form of cloth and paper, he had never tried cotton wool, I Had the question been asked, at the time of pelouzes experiment" Would ,the result be the same with cotton wool" the reply would, doubtless, have been in th'e affirmative, as the principle applied to organic matters generally. But had Pelouze happened to have tried cotton wool, it is most likely he would have seen a result pointing him very plainly tosorethinig of practical value. Coptonwool, of all known organic substances, seems to be the best calculated for the production of this curious compound, and it is the use of this substance that M. Sch5onbein claims. But he further claims a process which, apart from the result, is highly interesting. When the organic matters are to be treated in nitric acid it must be of a high degree of concentration, viz: specific gravity 1.5, which is very difficult to obtain in commerce. Of the acid be weaker, these matters are dissolved, forming ox alice acid, carbonic acid, and other compounds. By mixing sulphuric with the nitric acid, the sulphuric seizes upon the basic water of the nitric acid, and thus presents nitric acid to the cotton and other organic substances in :the state of highest concentration. The concentrated sulphuric acid, alone, would destroy these substances, but it appears -to exert no action upon them when mixed with the nitric acid. -M. W Schhnbein, therefore, claims the treatment of organic substances generally by such mixture. There are several modes in which the nitric acid may be presented to the cotton, but in all such cases the result seems to be uncertain, and generally a compound of inferior practical value to the material produced by Schonbeins process. In a private letter from Professor Are, recently received, he states, " that the compound had bee informed by the action of the vapor of nitric acid upon the cotton( Ai de at d it clue la xylidine result e de ]a combination de laid on avec les elements de lacidenitrique, ces t -en que l que sort e un s el dans sequel laid on re split, relative men a la side nitric que, le rose de base: aussi est else tres combustible; .une temperature de 1800 cent i grades, else pre nd feu, be le pre s que sans residue et avec beaucoup de vivacity.

The claims of Professor Schpnbein, upon which letters patent were issued, cover the following particulars: "a. The use of cotton wool prepared by nitric acid, the process for treating organic substances generally, in which sulphuric acid is mixed with the nitric, and lastly the impregnationof the substances as above prepared with solution of nitrate of potassaUpon the practical value of this invention the public must decide. Very laboratory and apothecaries shop in the country, every tyre and expert in chemistry and pyrotechny, will testify to the interest it has excited. I have examined the products of Schinbeins process with reference to certain particulars, and find that the gun cotton explodes upon heated mercury at various temperatures, from 370 Fahrenheit to 4000, according to certain variations in the preparation; that it is a non conductor of electricity, and does not explode with the electric spark like fulminating compounds; that it does not absorb moisture so readily as un prepared cotton, and requires more time under similar circumstances to deprive it of hygrometric moisture; that the discharge of a Key den jar explodes it, but, like gunpowder, it can rarely be exploded without inter losing in the line of discharge a wet thread or some other medium of resistance, such as a body of water or a long wire; that when enclosed in small quantities in tubes of paper or metal it does not communicate igni t ion or explosion, owing to the low heat produced; that immersion in water at 2000 Fahrenheit for 12 hours did not materially affect its combustibility; that when slightly impregnated with saltpeter ant thoroughly dried it might be closely ram med in a pistol, which it could pot be otherwise, and that its power under these last conditions, as far as could be inferred from perforation, was three times that of gunpowder; and finally, that it cannot be ranked among detonateing compounds. The following notice fromBrandes Manual of Chemistry bears closely upon this subject: " Artificialbitterby digesting indigo, silk, and a few other substances, both of vegetable and animal origin, in nitric acid, an intensely bitter matter is formed, called by Felt her the yellow bitter principle inn. de Oh, xxix. Chevreul has rendered it probable that this is a compound of a peculiar product with nitric acid. It is crystal liable, burns like gunpowder, and detonates when struck with a hammer The commonly received opinion that the gun cotton would be liable to spontaneous combustion has no foundation whatever in chemical philosophy; and I may add here that one advantage is claimed for the gun cotton over gunpowder that its explosion is unattended with smoke the combustion being nearly perfect. I to uses for blasting have been fully tested, and it has already been extensively adopted for that purpose. The following extract from the Lowell Courier will give some idea of its value in this particular: . From the Lowell Courier. Run Cotton. Col. Schouler: I send for insertion in your paper the following account of my trials of the effective force of gun cotton. These were made at the powder works of C. M. Cripple, esq, who readily afforded me every facility; and with his aid and that of Mr. T. B. Dawson, the well known artist of this city, the following experiments were made on
November 30: The eprouver te, or proof mortar, carries a ball of 24 pounds of iron. I to elevation, 450. I to chamber holds one ounce of gunpowder and about half an ounce of gun cotton, when that is ram med hard. Two24pound balls were used. No. 1 has Th, and No. 2 -th inch wind age. The last, in powder trials, falls always a few yards short of No. 1. I twas found by trial, as will appear below, that the projectiles force depended much on the mode of charging. The best effects were obtained by loosely filling the chamber with gun cotton, leaving the greater portion as a bed, at the breech of the mortar, on which the ball rested. Your qualities of gun cotton were used: No. 1, 25 minutes' dip in the mixed nitric and sulphuric acid; No. 2 is No. 1 dipped, after drying, 25 minutes in freshacidNo. 3, dip 25 minutes, and then a new portion of mixed acids added, and the dip continued 25 minutes; No. 4, blasting cotton, dip 35 minutes in the acid. The particulars of the preparation need not be stated. Two discharges with Mr. Nipples best rifle powder, Ffff, were first made. The charge was one ounce for each. No. 1 threw the ball 288 yards, No. 2 threw the ball 272 yards average 281- yards.

. My next trials were in blasting the ledge of argillomica slate, now excavating for the new canal in Lowell, by the contractors, Messrs. Moody, <a name="loss1"><mark>Loss</mark></a> & To, in, that section, under the supervision of Mr. William E. For then, civil engineer. I am indebted to these persons not only for the privilege of making these trials, but for all the details and conduct of the experiment. The first trial was in the tough est and hardest portion of the ledge the st ratification is here imperfect, and nearly vertical. The rock presented a perpendicular face 9 feet high. Give and a half feet from the face hole was drilled; and at the distance of 12 feet from this, and 6 feet from the face of the rock, a second hole was drilled. These holes were 11 inch in diameter, and about 9 feet deep. The gun cotton was quality to. 4 in the preceding mortar trials. It was enclosed in cartridges of cotton cloth, 1 inch diameter, and respectively 2 feet 10 inches and 5 feet long; holding 9 and 11 ounces gun cotton. A little dry sand was put in the bottom of each hole, then the cartridge let down by its attached fuse, and covered with a tapping of dry sand, 5 feet over the one, and 6 feet over the other. The fuses being lighted, the explosions occurred; one within a few seconds of the other. The report was sharp, but not loud, and very little smoke. This chiefly blew out at the fissure made by the explosion at the bottom of the rock, and some appeared at the top, over the mouth of the drilled holes. It appeared to Or For then, who was in a position to see it, as dust. This will be referred to again. In examination, the result was perfectly satisfactory to the contractors and the engineers, Messrs. Francis and For then, who then measured the mass of rock moved. I to dimensions were, in feet, 25 x 5 X 911 25 cubic feet. The rock weighs a ton to 12 cubic feet. We have at least 90 tons moved by 20 ounces of gun cotton. The contractors stated that they should have used 10 or 12 pounds of powder to have made a similar fissure for their intended se am blast. The effect, then, is as 1 to 8. A second trial was made by the same parties, on December 4th, in the same ledge, at a place where the rock is more slay, and more distinctly stratified, with a northerly dip of about 950. The rock is here softer and shiver y, and showed a perpendicular face of about 20 feet. The hole was 5 inches diameter, 9- feet deep. 41 is. 14oz6dr, or 78 dr. 6 oz. gun cotton, No. 4, were enclosed in a " vulcanizedI india rubber cloth case 5 inches diameter, and 3 feet long. It was let down, as before, by its fuse, and covered with 6 feet of dry sand. The explosion took place with a very little report, not louder than a muskets hot. The mass moved was, in feet, 45 x 10 x 9 about 350 tons. The seams were wider and more numerous than at the first blast. Besides the main fissure, running parallel with the face of the rock, there were others di verging from the hole diagonally, from 15 to 20 feet long. The effect for a following se am blast was a little too great, for it required 100 pounds of powder to fill the are vice. The blister employed by Messrs. Moody, <a name="loss2"><mark>Loss</mark></a> & To. said he should have used about 20 pounds of powder to have effected the object he wished. We have here moved a mass proportioned to the increased quantity of gun cotton, for 20 : 90 :a: 75: 350;but the actual result was, a greater distance moved, and more breaking up of the mass. I was in a position to watch the smoke, if so it may be called. It consisted of watery vapor, and of orange yellow fibrous acid. 25 vapor. -the de ut oxide of nitrogen, as it escaped from the hole, seized on the oxygen of the air, and was changed to orange yellow vapor. There was a faint smell of fibrous acid about the rock. Pieces of the I india rubber cloth were found near the hole, thrown off but unburnt. It was, I presume, this yellow fibrous vapor which appeared as dust in the first explosion. The smoke lasted about one minute. The gun cotton used i in these trials was perfectly dry, and well cared after it Preparation. It was made from cotton carded by a machine, and was prepared by myself, by the principle of the process :discovered by Mr. A. A. Hayes, of the Rbxbury laboratory. In a slight notice in your paper, a few days ago, of some successful trials made in Lowell with gun cotton, you have inadvertently awarded to myself the honor of the discovery of the mode of its formation. I cannot clay :this desirable distinction. This 'belongs exclusively to Mr. Hayes, who ,was the first in Boston, or its vicinity, not only to discover, but, with that courtesy so often u united to true science, the first to publish his results. Lie immediately informed me of his success by a letter dated Thursday morning, November 19th, which 1 received the next day at noon. It enclosed samples of his gun cotton, :which, with his letter, were forthwith shown to several persons here. I ni the, evening of the 19th November, in r. Hayess gun cotton and processes were exhibited by his friend Teschemachetrat a meeting in Boston of several gentlemen devoted to science, or interested in all that. certains to its application. It was at this meeting that the first gun cotton, prepared either in Boston or its vicinity, was exhibited, and its mode of preparation detailed in a written communication. Miiundtes were copied from this by at least one person present. The day follow wig there appeared in an evening paper, in Boston, accounts of success in forming explosive cotton; but there was no allusion to the light by whose borrowed rays had been obtained even partial success. Had the process of Mr. Hayes been followed as implicitly as it had been freely disclosed, the preparation. would have equalled that which had already been exploded in several public places in Boston on Friday morning November 20th, and which was prepared by Or. Hayes. In Saturday, the 2 1st multi mo, appeared a letter from Mr. H. in the Boston Daily Advertise r, which, with plentiful samples of gun cotton, had been sent ,to its editor on the preceding Thursday, several hours before the assembling of: the meeting to which I have referred. :the preparation of explosive and of gun cotton has been discovered by several persons in Europe and in America, since Schonbein first made the world acquainted with this singularly wonderful -compound.  These all may be re discoveries of his mode, for of that we as yet know nothing; but, they are not the less original, nor less honorable, nor less i dear to the scientific character of their authors. I am happy to embrace this opportunity, to state the true claims of my friend Hayes. 'a. I have had other trials made with gun cotton by experienced riflemenThey: show that its power is from four to eight times that of the best rifle powder. These experiments are as yet unfinished, and will' form the subject of a future communication. With regard, your obedient servant. Samuel Of  Dana. Lowell, December 7, 1846.286 a. Alleviation of pain during surgical operations The discovery patented under this caution presented itself as one of extensive moment, and the patent ability of the subject was predicted upon grounds similar to the last named discovery, viz: gun cotton. The process is one of exceeding simplicity, being merely the inhalation of the vapor of sulphuric ether, to prepare the patient for painful surgical operations. It has been knownuformany years that the vapor of ether, when freely inspired, would intoxicated to the same extent as alcohol taken into the stomach ; and that i while the effects of the latter were lasting and hazardous when carried to stupefaction, the former was temporary in its power over the system, and usually left no uncomfortable feelings after the first effects had subsided- It .has also long been the practice of surgeons to administer opiates previous to severe operations, the materials employed varying according to circumstances in some instances, opium ; in others, alcohol in some form; these two being most generally adopted. It is possible that in such cases some rash hand may have carried the effects of these drugs even to the entire subversion of sense, but such has never been ad missile or reasonable practice ; the dose given, on the contrary, operating only to the, extent of a palliative. The fact has stood forth upon the pages of science for many years, that the inhalation of sulphuric ether was productive of temporarynarcoticstimulant effects, and it was also known that the excessive use of this stimulant had, on some few occasions, been followed by alarming symptoms. But, notwithstanding this familiar record in the possession of every surgeon, it was never attempted to substitute this for the palliatives in common use previous to surgical operations, nor was it known to what extent it rendered the system insensible to pain. It is doubtful if the n arctic effects of either alcohol or opium could render a person insensible to the pain of a surgical operation such as the amputation of a leg, unless the exhibition of the dose were such as absolutely to endanger life. In view of the above and other considerations, a patent has been granted for this discovery. Such has been said for and against the introduction of this discovery, but the weight of authentic statements is decidedly in its favor.  The testimony of individuals, or bodies of men, is rarely necessary prior to the grant of a patent, and but seldom regarded the question of novelty being that usually entertained; but as this patent has been granted upon proof of novelty, it may be well to cite a few remarks from the high authority of Dr. J. C. Warren, professor of anatomy in the Massachusetts Medical College. After detailing a number of surgical operations, he closes a communication in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal of December 9, 1846, as follows: "1 st. The breathing of the e the real vapor appears to operate directly on the cerebral system, and the consequent insensibility is proportionate to the degree of cerebral affection." 2d. Muscular power was for- the time suspended in some cases ; in others its <a name="loss3"><mark>loss</mark></a> was partial, and in one instance was scarcely sensible. The great relaxation produced by a full dose :of the application leads to the hope that it may be employed with advantage in cases of spasmodic affection, both by the surgeon and by the physician." 3d. The respiration is sometimes stertorous, likecid127) that of apoplexy 4th. The action of the heart is remarkably accelerated in some cases, but not in all." All these changes soon pass off without leaving any distinct traces behind them, and the ordinary state of the functions returns. This :has been the course of things in the cases I have witnessed, but I think it quite probable that so powerful an agent may sometimes produce other, and even alarming effects. I would therefore recommend that it should never be employed, except under the inspection of a judicious and competent person. Met me conclude by congratulating my professional brethren on the acquisition of a mode of mi ligating human suffering, which may become a valuable agent in the hands of careful and well instructed practitioners, even if it should not prove of such general application as the imagination of sanguine persons would lead them to anticipate." Boston, December 3, 1846."' The following testimonials from Dr. A. L. Heirs on, a distinguished surgeon of Salem, Massachusetts, we find in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, and it will suffice upon this subject. He concludes a special account of two amputations, and the removal of a deep seated, tumor, as follows' From the results I have seen at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and in my own practice, I am led to expect the following advantages from its exhibition: " 1st. Uniformity of its effects, unlike any mode of intoxication w by stimulants in the stomach, or respiration of fibrous oxide gas. My three patients were as unlike in age, temperament, and habits, as could be imagined, yet all exhibited the same appearance of passive endurance 2d. There was no instinctive or voluntary resistance, which is so embarrassing to an operator. This, next to its power of preventing the perception of pain, is the greatest merit claimed for it." 3d. The securing the patient from the severity of the great shock which a capital operation inflicts on the sufferer. It was quite noticeable in all the patients I have seen, that there was none of that extreme depression which sometimes follows a severely painful impression on the nervous system." 4th. I to effects pass off rapidly, and, as far as I know, no bad results follow." 5th. It can be repeated several times during the operation, except the mouth or jaws are the parts to be operated on. The repetition of the dose is always sought by the patient with aridity." 6th. The last and most important of its effects is, that it either wholly annals pain, or destroys the consciousness of it, so that it is not remembered ; and thus the sentiment of fear is wholly obliterated. The patient appears to have been dreaming, and in the second case said that he "was in a distinct existence" (i. e, distinct from his former experience) thus illustrating the theory of double consciousness. There are recommendations enough to insure it a fair trial among the humane and enlightened members of our profession, and for their decision we must wait, and by it be governed in its future use. Dr. Norton and Dr. Jackson, at least, are entitled to the hearty thanks of the profession for their discovery, and the liberal manner in which they have offered it to all the subjects of surgical operations, both in and out of the hospital. Of some hunter up of obsolete theories should prove that such a thing had before been thought of or tried, still these gentlemen are entitled to the credit of having made 8 it for the first time perfectly available to the suffering, and submitted it to the test of those competent to decide on its merits, without being content to rest its pretensions on non professional credulity or popular notorietyA. L. Pei Rsonsalem, November 26, 1846."From all the accounts published upon the uses and effects of this vapor, it must be seen that there is some chat ice of injury attending its exhibition, even in skilful hands, in the present state of knowledge on the subject. This, however, must de tract but little from the merit of the application. After the fearful result from a single dose of exhilarating gas a tale college, professors might well desist from the illustration of its effects upon the human system; and yet it continues to be inspired with impunity by thousands of persons every year, for the mere sake of pleasurable excitement. But when it is considered how many persons expire under the surgeons knife from the shock inflicted upon the nervous system, often at the time morbidly sensitive to pain, it may be inferred that the chances of life would be in favor of its administration under skilfilpractitioners. I to utility has been more extensively tested in the practice of dentist by than any other branch of the healing art. Caoutchouca patent has been granted for softening caoutchouc preparatory to grinding, by exposing it to the vapor of turpentine combined with steam. Composition for woulds, (cid127umbrella handles, <c patent has been granted for this invention, which is designed to supersede the necessity of carving, turning, and otherwise working handles, by moulding a composition, which becomes very hard and susceptible of a fine polish. Theingredients are starch and mahogany sawdust or fine wood ashes. The specimens exhibited were very beautiful. Candle mcid127akingA patent has been granted for making candles of tallow, &c, by forcing the material, in a liquid state, through a tube around the picking, and thus discharging a continuous candle, which is to be cut into the required lengths. Soap patent has been granted for a process of making soap, by which the off al of slaughter houses is completely sap unified, furnishing a good brown soap. Another process for soap making has been patented, which appears somewhat complicated. The ingredients are as follows west yellow soap -900 lbs. Later -2 100 "to rate soda -75Muriate soda -37 "blue, (best) -15 calm oil -10 "the particulars of the process for compounding are contained in the inventors specification. Dyeing hair and wool simple and effectual process for dyeing furscid127, has been patented. The skin (with the hair downwards) is stretched underneath a frame of wires, and the hair immersed in the coloring liquor to the depth desired, the getting of wires serving to protect the skin from injury from the heated liquor. Reserving meat, 6. A patent has been granted for a mode of imDoG. No. 5.pregnating meat, &c, with bring, in which the vacuum is produced- by the well known Torricellian mode, which, although not the patent able feature, presents some peculiar advantages in this connexion. Relic and st eric acids n the separation of these constituents of fats it has been found difficult to obtain them pure, for the reason, chiefly, that the heat was apt to be raised so high as to melt the s tearing. The invention provides for placing the material under pressure in a causing or chamber, which, by means of heated air or liquid, is to heat the mass gradually and uniformly, and preserve a constant temperature. Sugar from the cane novel mode of managing the cane has been patented, which the inventor states will realize nearly the same per cent age of sugar from the cane as is given by chemical analysis, which is far greater than that usually obtained. A considerable portion of sugar is lost in the squeezing operation, and also during the process of defection. To obviate these losses, the inventor cuts the cane into thin slices, and dries them; after which, the process of extraction by maceration can be undertaken at any time. Scientific ally viewed, there are obviously advantages in this mode; but it seems to be a formidable undertaking upon a large scale the economy of which, however, will in due time be decided by those interested. Sugar pan Several patents have been granted for improvements in the evaporating apparatus connected with sugar pans, which must be considered as valuable acquisitions to the art. Sugarthe process of making sugar in places where fuel is scarce has been very much economized during the past year. A patent has been granted for certain improvements, by which the heat of condensation, and steam from evaporation, are both taxed to their utmost limit of usefulness; and so much so, as to draw forth the expression from an eye witness, that " not a particle of steam is seen to escape from the engine, or sugar apparatus patent has also been granted for a mode of treating the cane juice, which is decidedly novel; and though entirely contrary to the usual practice, and prescribing just what has been hitherto studiously avoided, yet it brings philosophy to its support. In the first operation of clarifying the cane juice, great care has been taken to avoid raising the juice to the boiling point, although the temperature was raised as nearly to it as possible without risk. The inventor proposes to raise the cane juice above the boiling point, under pressure, and thus rapidly coagulate the albuminous matters, and precipitate the impure ties. Preventing the incur station of boilers patent has been granted for a mode of preventing the incur station of boilers; and though of great simplicity, is contended for by the inventors as entirely successful, not only for the prevention of the <a name="evil0"><mark>evil</mark></a>, but the removal of incur station already formed. The concrete sediment which attaches itself to the inner surface of steam boilers is not only the cause of great waste of heat, but frequently of dreadful accidents. The inventor throws mahogany or other hard wood sawdust into the boiler, and affirms that it will clean a foul boiler, and entirely prevent incur station. The inventor adds, that although such is the fact, he cannot explain it, but that experiment proves it true. The action is doubtless entirely mechanical: the constant agitation of the particles of sawdust might give rise to sufficient attention to produce the effect 30 a. Le aching paper pulp The specimens of paper pulp accompanying the application for letters patent for this invention were of a beautiful appearance, although made of the poorest material, and were in every other respect as good as pulp prepared in the usual way. The pulp, instead of being bleached in the engine in the usual mode, and then removed to large vats to drain, is bleached in large masses in the vats, which differ in construction somewhat from those in ordinary use. I mpregnating timber patent has been granted for a mode of impregnating timber, in which the timber is submitted successively to the action of steam, operation of exhaustion, and impregnation by various substances; and is also sometimes saturated with and slightly charred by boiling oil. Daguerreotype pictures Three patents have been granted for modes of coloring these pictures. Ordinarily, the attempt to color these beautiful "engravings of light" have proved very in artistic al, and often have been resorted to for the purpose of hiding a defective picture. In some of the specimens presented, the effect is good; more particularly where the color is laid upon the back ground alone, relieving very much the metallic glare of the plate. The best effect is from the process in which the colors, mingled with some resin out material, are deposited from a state of floating dust upon uncovered parts of the plate; and when in sufficient quantity, are made to adhere by slightly warming the plate. The melting, of the resin out particles not only causes the colors to adhere, but gives atransparency to them, which is the most desirable point to attain. The usual mode of s rippling on the colors is very apt to injure the delicate shades of the picture. Calori Of C, Number of applications, 129.-Number of patents granted, 68. I inventions in this class have exhibited much less of interest than formerly. Some very ingenious devices for wick tubes for lamps have been patented, which seem to furnish almost all that is desirable in the management of hand lamps. The flat wick, raised and lowered by means of a small opinion attached to a thumb screw, was a decided improvement, as affording a very convenient means of moving the wick; but the flat wick to which this improvement was peculiarly applicable is objectionable on account of the flame being so readily blown out by slight currents of air The improvement in question consists in applying the opinion and thumb screw to double wick lamps with tubular wicks. By simple contrivance the wicks are so managed that one or both may be raised at pleasure, or the two wicks may be level led by one operation. Furnaces for heating buildings The openings from these furnaces, in the floors or walls of apartments, are usually covered with a kind of revolving valve, called the register. As these valves, at times, must be entirely closed, it is evident that the open spaces can never exceed half the area of the register. A patent has been granted for an improvement in this article, by which much larger openings can be obtained within the same circle; the openings being covered by two valves or wings resembling the well known butterfly valves, which are controlled by a can m movement. Stovesmarny attempts have been made to surround cooking stoves entirely with a blue space, by making the oven doors hollow or of double Dec. 6. 652.31plates, and carrying the smoke through them by means of valves, which closed when the door was opened, and opened when it was shut. They have all been more or less complicated, and liable to derangements. Livery ingenious method of effecting this purpose has been patented, in which the hinge post of the oven doors was 'made hollow, and each door made apart of the general blue space; and this condition being the same whether the door was open or shut, it not only dispenses with ;the valves, but is not liable to the escape of smoke into the apartment or the oven. Mathemati Cal And Phi Losophi Cal I Nstruments. Number of applications, 26.-Number of patents granted, 13. Clocksseveral patents have been granted for improvements in clocks, most of them aiming at economy in the construction of the clock. In a conversation with one of the applicants, he stated that cheap ening the cost of a clock I to cents was a thing of the greatest consequence to the Connecticut manufacturers. One improvement patented consisted in dispersing- with the clock weights, by making use of the weight of the clock as the moving power, the clock, after being wound up, descending through the space of about one foot and a half. This clock may be strictly said to, run down." -another improvement patented is for a turrets clock. The patentee proposes, instead of making the whole clock work of the usual ponderous size, to make only the striking part of large size, and this to be regulated by a small independent clock for the time part. Starving machine: plan for carving upon wood or stone has been patented, by which a person may trace any figure or pattern, and carve at the same time. It differs from the common pent a graph principally in this respect that the tablet upon which the tracing or carving is to be made is placed upon a frame having universal motion. Magnetic telegraph Two patents have been issued for improvements in the electro magnetic telegraph, and one patent re issued. The extensive introduction of Horses telegraph has brought its several improvements under the inspection of almost every person much interested in the subject. Patent has been granted for an electro magnetic telegraph for printing the Woman letters. His invention is more complicated than the printing telegraphs which had been known before, but gives evidence of great ingenuity in the adaptation of the several contrivances to the ends proposed, and is quite interesting in its details. Lever And Screw Power, &e. Number of applications, 27.---Numberof patents granted, 7. But few contributions to the arts, of novel interest, have been made in this class during the past year. A substantial improvement has been effected in the jack screw t, for which letters patent have been granted. Great number of, applications under this class have' been presented and rejected, particularly for modifications of presses for cotton, hay, tobacco, cheese, &c, The mechanical powers have become so well known, and most of their modifications public property, that but little yearly advance can be expected in this branch 32 Abc. No. 52. Stone, Clay, And Glass Manufactures: &c. Number of applications, 17.berofaaer of patents granted, 9. But few applications have! been patented under this class, most of th'emhaving been rejected for want of novelty. Those of the patented which have? the highest claims to importance are for the melting and working of glass. One of them, for melting glass, is for an improved mode of setting the glass pot or crucial e, by which the fire has access to much more of its surface than before. Leather, Tanni Of, &c. Number of applications, 29.-Number of patents granted, 15. Travelling trunks in improved mode of making travelling trunks has been patented, which may be the means of protecting the property of travellers from the many injuries caused by the merciless handlings of their baggage. The usual mode of making strong trunks is to fasten the covering to a firm frame work, usually of iron, making the article very heavy, and a bruise or blow upon them generally leaves a permanent indentations. The inventor makes the skeleton or frame work of his trunk of whale bone, cane, or other elastic material, and so secures the ends of the ribs that they do not require any riveting. The trunk is thus made light and elastic to a sufficient extent to prevent permanent injury from a blow. Nail bags patent has been granted for an improvement in mail bags, in which the principal feature is, that letters may be put into the bags on the way without unlocking them, and at the same time the letters within cannot drop out or be extracted without cutting or unlocking thebagsBreaking hides and fanning- Several modes of working hides have been patented. That which appears most deserving of notice is a foreign invention, the novelty of which, though slight, is nevertheless decided. A patent was granted many years since for working hides by sewing them together to form an endless belt, which was made to run upon two rollers or drums ; one of them being in the vat of t an liquor, and the other out of it. By revolving the upper roller the hides were carried in and out of the liquor, and on passing over the upper roller a considerable portion of the absorbed liquor was squeezed out to make room for a fresh absorption. The improvement consists in using a series of rollers and a long endless belt of hides, one half the number of rollers being placed in, and the other half out of the vat. At first sight this would appear as merely a multiplication of the rollers to suit an extension of the belt of hides, but it will be seen that a new effect is here produced. Upon the first mentioned plan, the same side of the hide mustalVaysbe in contact with the surface of the rollers; and as the hide is revolving, the side opposite to that in contact with the rollers is more in contact with the liquor, and has its pores or grain more expanded. The result of this would be an unequal fanning of the leather. There the rollers are multiplied, as in the invention before us, it is evident that as any portion of the endless belt passes from one system of rollers to the other, that side of the hide in contact with the surface of one roller becomes on the next
33outside or opposite to that in contact with the roller, and thus an equal iting operation is obtained. Horse hamesSeveral patents have been granted for improvements in horse james, and this part of harness seems all at once to have become the subject of improvement. The clumsy contrivances hitherto used in this and many other parts of horse trappings, the frequent galling of the animals, have at last become objects of attention, and within the two past years more improvements have been made in harness than perhaps in the twenty years previous. The improvement in the james is one by which the tugs or traces are kept from the flanks of the horse, while the strain of the collar and james is so distributed as to prevent chafing. Stretching leather band such difficulty has hitherto been experienced in the use of large leather bands for machinery, from stretching of the leather, and it has been found expedient to prepare the leather for this purpose by submitting it to great tension. The leather is wetted, and stretched by means of screws and clamps, and retained in a state of tension until thoroughly dry. Safety stirrup number of contrivances have hitherto been essay ed to prevent the catching of the riders feet in the stirrup in case of a fall, but they have been usually at the expense of the strength of the stirrup. A patent has been granted for an improvement in the safety stirrup, consisting in a method of securing one of its sides by means of a catch and spring, so that the stirrup readily opens by a fall upon that side. Household Furni Ture. Number of applications, 52.-Number of patents granted, 24. Sofa beds patent has been granted for an improvement in sofa bedsteads, which combines a complete arrangement for a bed of sufficient size for two persons, with a neat looking sofa, in such manner that its double purpose could not be suspected from its general appearance. Very many devices have been hitherto made for sofa beds, but in most cases, where they were made to serve as a double bed, the beauty and strength of the sofa have been sacrificed. Another advantage possessed by the improvement is, that the whole of the fixture, when prepared for the bed, is, provided with entire head and foot boards, while in most others these boards extend only one half, or at most two thirds, of the width of the bed. Cotton mattress est n the last report of your predecessor in office mention is made of the importance to the cotton growers of the discovery of some new mode of consuming the excess of the produce of this staple. Suggestion is made of the advantage of making beds or mat tresses of cotton, and much is said of the comfort, cleanliness and cheapness of such an article. A patent has recently been granted for an improvement in the cotton mattress, which so clearly recommends itself at first sight that it seems deserving of your special notice. The inventor, an American citizen residing abroad, states that he met with the Patent Office report in Europe, containing the suggestions which induced him to investigate the subject. Being concerned in cotton manufactures, he had an opportunity of judging of the fitness of cotton for mat tresses, and soon found that in its ordinary condition of cotton wool, whether carded or not, it could not answer the purpose, as by repeated pressure the cotton would mat and gather in knots, from the interlocking of its fibres. This has been the334
experience of all who have used cotton mat tresses in this country. To remedy this difficulty he invented the following method" Cotton patting, well sized upon both sides, is used in successive layers, to the extent of thickness required (after compression) to fill the packing the usual mode adopted being to employ a continuous sheet of it, laid back and forth to a height or thickness much above the thickness of the mattress when finished. The pile of patting is submitted to pressure, so as to attain a sufficient degree of spring or elasticity in the cotton, and then enclosed in the sac king. This very simple device produces a mattress possessed of the softness and warmth of a feather bed, if desired, of greater elasticity than hair or moss beds, and entirely free from unpleasant odor. As proof of its extraordinary elasticity, the small mattress presented to the office, which is about six inches thick, has been repeatedly reduced by a hydraulic press to the thickness of three quarters of an inch, and on relieving the pressure it immediately resumed its original size. The seizing upon the separate layers prevents the interlacing of the fibres, and thus preserves the elasticity of the cotton. It has been stated that the manufacture of gun cotton has been commenced in Pennsylvania upon an extensive scale; and should the introduction of these two inventions be fully established, the cotton growers may hail them with enthusiasm. In order to present the subject fully, the following extracts are made from the official report for the year1844COTTON Beds. From the Jackson (mississippi) Southron. Encourage the home market Curious calculation, showing h how two entire crops of cotton in the United States may be disposed of, The sub joined letter to one of our fellow townsmen from a planter in our vicinity is worthy of serious consideration. The greatest <a name="evil1"><mark>evil</mark></a> the cotton planter has to meet now is that arising from the over production of cotton; and just so long as we continue to produce as we have done, without taking care to encourage an increased consumption of the article, this <a name="evil2"><mark>evil</mark></a> will not be remedied. As to the sub joined letter, we think the writer unnecessarily fearful that he may be considered extravagant. He can see nothing impracticable in the scheme, and we look forward with confidence to the time when we shall learn that half the people in the United States are sleeping on cotton mat tresses, in preference to any of the various articles now used for bedding. Either do we think he has enumerated more than half the advantages it possesses. In addition to those mentioned by him, we would name superior cleanliness; ver min will not abide in it; there is no grease in it, as in hair or wool; it does not get stale and acquire an unpleasant odor, as feathers often do, to eradicate which they are sometimes put into an oven and re dried; moths do not infect it, as they do wool; it does not pack and become hard, as moss does; nor does it become dry, brittle, and dusty, as do straw, hay, or sucks. Besides its advantages in all these cases, it is in many cases medicinal. For example: it is well known that raw cotton, worn on the parts affected, is one of the best and most effectual cures for rheumatic affections. Sleeping upon it merely with the intervention of cotton ticking and a cotton sheet, would not prevent its medicinal action. Again: added to the great advantage over every kind of bedding (except
35hay or straw) mentioned by the writer of the sub joined letter, (namely, its cheapness) it is the best, most easy, and most health full bed of any. It is certainly superior to all, except feathers; and it possesses over feathers the advantage that it does not cause that lassitude and inertia produced by sleeping upon the latter. Of any one doubts that it is one of the easiest beds he has ever slept upon, let him spend a few nights in one of the clean, nice, comfortable beds under the careful supervision of the tidy landlady of the " Linsey House" in this city. They are used generally in that neat and comfortable establishment, and, we believe, altogether. We have known many lodgers in them there who, never having heard of cotton beds, supposed they had been sleeping on feathers, and not only that, but the best feathers too. We were deceived ourselves in the same manner; and the prejudice we are certain we should have entertained against cotton beds, had we suspected we were to be lodged in one, was thus overcome, and much to our surprise, when we found that we had been sleeping upon cotton. We therefore advise every one, especially all those interested in the growing of cotton, to try cotton beds. But cotton is preferable, altogether preferable, not only for the bed itself, but for the covering. To a great extent, we believe, it has already been employed in what are variously called " comforts" and " comfortables, "and apt names they are to designate the article. These are nothing more than a thick layer of cotton, carded into what are called at the north cotton bats" between envelopes of calico or muslin. Thirty cents for the cotton, and one dollar for the calico, will make one of these " comforts sufficient to over spread the largest bed, equal to three woolen blankets worth four dollars and a half, and decidedly lighter and more pleasant in every respect. To our friends at the north we say, try the cotton bedding. You have an advantage over us in the cheapness of the ticking and calico, and in the labor of making it, which would more than pay for the freight on the cotton, and make them cheaper than we can. You would have an advantage, also, in the quality of the articles thus made, by subjecting the cotton to the operation of your machinery, which we do not possess. You would have an advantage in the cleanliness and buoyant y of the cotton for beds by running it through the machine called a "picked" in your cotton factories; and in carding it for the "comforts" with less trouble and more evenly, by means of the carding machines driven by water or steam power. We are aware that there is a prejudice against such changes as we propose in articles of every day use. We do not believe it would be an easy matter to get the effeminate occupant of " beds of down" and " downy pillows" to give them up in favor of so cheap a substitute as so common an article as cotton; but, by persons in moderate circumstances, and those who have use for all the activity of which the body is capable, and still like a good comfortable bed, the superior cheapness, and the unimpaired elasticity of the frame arising from the use of cotton beds, we feel confident the proposed change will be considered of and tested. To cotton planters and cotton manufacturers we say, you are particularly called upon to give the cotton beds a trial: to the first, that everything with them depends upon an increased consumption of the article to the latter, that we of the cotton growing region, particularly we of Mississippi, the largest cotton growing State of the Union, are determined to sustain you. You will see, by the calculations in the following letter, how86
very much you may assist us in disposing of the surplus of our crops for several years to come; while, as we confidently believe, you will be be ne fitting yourselves, and adding to the comforts of hundreds of thousands. Near Jackson, October 11, 1844. Iear Of   R : In a casual conversation with you a few days since upon the subject of our great staple, cotton, its present and probable continued depreciation in price, the gloomy prospects of the cotton planter, and other subjects connected therewith, we fully agreed that its over production was the principal cause of its present low price; and that, unless some new source for its consumption could be found, the planter had nothing to expect but its continued ruinous depreciation. The article of cotton, like all other productions of labor, is governed in its price by the general law of commerce, demand and supply. In our conversation I mentioned one source of consumption which is now little used, and which, if believed in and adopted by the American people, will add very much to the consumption of the raw material, and consequently cause an increase in its prices mean i its use for bedding. You wished my views upon the subject in writing, which I now send you. Receive them for what they are worth, and nothing more. I set out with the proposition that cotton is the cheapest, most comfortable, and most healthy material for bedding that is known to the civilized world. In making this broad and bold assertion, I know I subject myself to the imputation of extravagance and presumption ; but there is no truer maxim in practical life than the quaint old one, that " the proof of the pudding is in the chewing of the bag." That it is the cheapest, I submit the following calculation or statement, for the correctness of which I appeal to every reasonable and practical man. I will first state, however, that the materials which are generally used by the civilized world for bedding are the following, viz: hair, wool, feathers, moss, sucks, straw or hay. The most costly is hair; next in value is wool; next, feathers; next, sucks, (when properly prepared ;a) next, moss; and last, straw or hay. I have not the means of ascertaining with any degree of certainty the relative quantities of the different materials above mentioned that are used in the United States for the purposes of bedding. I hand you a statement of the cost of a bed or mattress made of the different materials 1 have mentioned, and also the cost of a good mattress the price at which they can be made, and furnish a reasonable profit to the maker. Of there is. any reason or truth in the calculations I have made, you will readily perceive the immense consumption of the raw material it will lead to. New sources for the consumption of cotton are being discovered every day. I to peculiar adaptation for uniting with other fabrics, such as flax, silk, wool, &c, has added much to its consumption for the last few years. Very avenue should be opened, and every encouragement should be given to new sources that may be opened, to increase its consumption for in that consists the safety of the southern planter. Statement- -but of a hair mattress They are generally sold by the pound, and cost from 50 to 75 cents per lb; 30 to 40 lbs. will cost from  $15 to   $20. Fool 30 lbs. of wool, at 30 cents per lb, $9; 12 yards ticking, at 121 cents per yard,  $1.50; labor, thread, &c,   $2.75. Total,   $13.25. 
37Feathers40 lbs. of feathers, at 30 cents per lb,    $12; 15 yards of ticking, at 12 cents per yard,  $1.871; labor, &c,   $2.75. Total,   $16.621. <a name="loss4"><mark>Loss</mark></a> mattress, ready made,    $12; shock do,    $12. The labor of properly preparing tile sucks constitutes its main cost, and which cannot be done for less than the above price, and all materials furnished. Cotton 30 lbs. of cotton, at 8 cents per lb,   $2.40; 12 yards of ticking, at 12- cents per yard,  $1.50; labor, thread, &c,   $2.75. Total, $6.65. I say nothing of straw or hay, as they are but little used. You thus see at a glance the relative cost of a bed, or mattress, made of the different materials. In point of cheapness, the cotton is far preferable in durability it is equal, if not superior, to any of them. Six years use of them convinces me of the fact. As to the next branch of my bold assertion, their comfort and health i ness. I am, you know, as fond of a comfortable bed as any one. Mybelfand family have used them for the last six years, and we prefer them to either hair or wool for both winter and summer. Any of our acquaintances about Jackson have used them for several years, and to them I appeal for the correctness of my assertion. Before I close my letter, permit me to indulge in a speculation of the probable effect the universal use of raw cotton for bedding, if adopted by the people of the United States, would have upon its production. The United States, at this time, is supposed to have 20,000,000 of inhabitants. It is fair to presume that, upon an average, it requires a bed for every three persons. This, then, would give, (say) in round numbers 7000 000 beds or mat tresses. To make that number, then, at 30 lbs. to the mattress, it will take 210,000,000 lbs. of cotton, which, at 400 lbs. to the bale, gives 5,200,000-more than two of the largest crops of cotton ever raised in the United States. But it is not by any means to be expected that the people of the United States would at once dispense with the beds which they have at present in use. I am not fully informed at what periods or length of time bedding made of hair, wool, and other materials mentioned, have to be laid aside, and their places supplied by the same, or materials of a different sort. Some persons think -years, according to the value and durability of the materials of which they are made. I have not the means of ascertaining; but, if the cotton grower can succeed in convincing the people at large of the correctness of these views, it rust inevitably lead to a gradual substitution of raw cotton, to the exclusion, in a great degree, of other materials for bedding. The annual amount consumed will depend upon the confidence in the cheapness, comfort, and health i ness of the article. While I am speculating on this subject, indulge me in another. Suppose Europe, which now consumes four fifths of our raw cotton, should embrace these views, and substitute it as an article of bedding; imagination could hardly conceive, and arithmetic could hardly calculate, the amount it would take to supply the demand. But I tire your patience: I will close. It is an interesting subject to the planter. I could write a homely upon it (and a sensible one, too, I think as long as a modern political dissertation upon the tariff. I claim no merit for the originality of these views or suggestions. Oublie attention was called to this subject several years since in a series of numb 8 obers published in the " Clinton Gazette" and attributed to the pen of our worthy countryman, Dr. W. W. New if correctly, I know not. Hours, respectfully, Of Of Arts. Number of applications, 26.-Number of patents granted, 19. Musicsince the first successful combination of the accord ion or metallic reeds with the piano for te, a great degree of emulation has been manifested among inventors to improve the instrument. The metallic reeds do not require tuning so often as piano for te strings, but if they should get out of tune, are much more difficult to regulate. It might also be necessary at times to reduce the tone of all the reeds to accord with the piano. Several devices have been patented for tuning the reeds, one general principle running through the whole, viz: to shorten or lengthen them as occasion requires. This has been effected by sliding back and forth clamps, or something similar, upon the fixed ends of the reeds, or causing the reed, with the frame holding it, to slide between the clamps. Fellows for musical instruments in ingenious arrangement of fellows for operating the metallic reed instruments has been patented, in which the blast of air is rendered very uniform, by making the fellows to exhaust the air, and not to force it through the instrument, as usual. Over pointed pencil Several patents have been granted for improvements in this article. One is for a self feeding pencil, in which the leads are placed in a receptacle, in such manner that, by turning the top of the case, they are forced in a continuous supply to the point, and save the necessity of removing the parts for the insertion of the leads, as in the common pencil. Two others, in which the gold pen and pencil case are combined in such a way that the whole is not longer, and in one much shorter, than the ordinary pencil case. Substitute for type metal very novel invention has been patentee for making stereotyped blocks for all kinds of printing. The inventor takes clear and tough clay, mixed with s il ex, reduced to an impalpable powder in sufficient quantity to prevent cracking, and this mixture is worked into a strong putty, in order to form the matrix or <a name="mould0"><mark>mould</mark></a>. The composition used for the type metal is made of a mixture of shell ac, tar, and sand. The type metal presented to the office, together with a great variety of blocks for printing, and specimens of printing and engraving, bore full testimony to the genuine ness of the invention. The material, when prepared, is very hard, without brittle ness, and is not liable to soften in warm weather. The great cheapness and facility of working the material are eminently in its favor. Surgi Cal I Nstruments, &c. Number of applications, 56.-Number of patents granted, 18. Spring lance to patent has been granted for an improved spring lance t, which is in a convenient form, being about the size and shape of a common pencil case. The blade is driven by the force of a helicalspring placed within the case, and the depth of the incision is easily regulated by means of a screw operating upon the spring to increase or diminish its motion. 
9Two improvements have been patented for the combined spring lances, or scarificators, both presenting novel modes of operating the blades and regulating their depths. Trussesa considerable number of trusses and abdominal supporters have been rejected for want of novelty. A very simple yet effective construction of truss has been patented, in which the truss pad moves back and forth upon a common screw attached to the main spring, which motion allows of its lateral adjustment, and the pressure is regulated by means of a nut moving on the same screw with the pad. Bathsseveral forms of bathing apparatus have been patented: one, a shower bath, is quite novel in one respect the bat her stands upon two small platforms, which are respectively connected with the pistons of pumps; and the bat her, by resting alternately upon his right and left foot, works the pumps, and thus obtains a constant shower. Weari Of Apparel. Number of applications, 16.-Number of patents granted, 16. Sailors' she arson improved s hears has been patented, in which one of the blades has a broad and flat back, designed to slide along evenly upon the table while cutting, the other blade being of the usual form. Ladies' skirts in improvement has been patented for arranging the cords or springs of the skirts in such a manner as to break up the horizontal lines, thus giving elasticity to the garment longitudinally as well as laterally. Desi  Gns. Number of applications, 67.-Number of patents granted, 59. A great number of designs have been patented under the new law, principally for stoves. The protection of this class of inventions, or productions, has operated favorably to improve the appearance of stoves, and other cast iron work, without adding much to the cost. The specimens presented to the office would seem to indicate that it had been the means of essentially improving the art of iron casting, The past year, event full in many respects, has recorded for science and art more signal discoveries than perhaps any other in the history of man. Conspicuous above all others stands the planet Leverrier, revealed by the sublime st efforts of mind as one of the sister hood of mother earth, while she has been lending us hitherto her feeble aid, accredited only as a " star of little magnitude." It would not be appropriate to this report to notice the many discoveries of the past year of a purely scientific character; nor can presume, in the haste with which the above review has been prepared, to have done justice to those discoveries and inventions of a practical nature which have come immediately under my own examination. The press and hurry of business in your department during the past year has not allowed such time to your examiners as they could wish for the thorough investigation and appreciation of the many inventions of importance and interest daily presented. Knowing that you are fully aware of their present embarrassments, and will do all in your power to facilitate their official labors, they abide in the hope that such assistance will be provided as will enable them to bestow as much time upon each invention as the merits of the case may justly demand 40 a. The inquiry is frequently made, Now is it that applications for patents multiply so fast ?a? I s there so much room left for improvement in this or that branch of art ?a? Superficial observers are apt to be looking for consummationnot only in individual branches of art, but in the whole range of human productions. They regard the wants of man as limit able, his mind as exhaust able, and, with an air of sagacity, will point to a time when the overgrown wings of genius will retard and finally check his career. A look at the past would mirror in its true light this distorted view of things but even this is not necessary. A liberal survey of the present, a glance at the depths of mind, and the restless workings of the inward man, all proclaim the command, " increase and multiply" to be stamped upon his intellectual as well as his physical nature. The multiplying products of intelligence are no hindrance to his onward movement; and those seemingly formidable accumulations of innovations offer no effective resistance to the wheels of invention. They are rather so many stepping stones, over which genius is striding up the hill of perfection, whose summit is beyond the confines of time. Respectfully submitted. Chas. G. Page, Examiner of Patents. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. a. 41. Patent Offi Of, December 31, 1846. Am: In reviewing the business which has been trans acted at my desk during the current year, a few prominent facts of a general character present themselves, to which I have thought it proper to call your attention before entering upon the analysis of the patents which have been subjected to my examination. It appears, by your last report, that during the year 1844 the number of applications for patents suddenly increased nearly twenty-five per cent above that of any former year, which, of course, required and produced a corresponding increase of exertion on the part of the examining corps. By reference to the records kept by examiners at that time, I find that at the desk which I now occupy the number of patents granted in 1844 was -211 And the number of rejections was -197 taking an aggregate of -408 n 1845 the number of patents was -215 And the number of rejections -226 taking an aggregate of -441 During the present year the number of patents is -289 And the rejections -385 taking an aggregate of -a. 674By comparing these results, it will be perceived that the aggregate of patents and rejections at my desk for the current year exceeds those of any former year by more than fifty per cent. It is hoped that this simple statement of facts will satisfy all who have complained of delays at the Patent Office that the cause of complaint is not to be found in a want of exertion on the part of the examining corps, but in an overwhelming increase of business, to which their powers and endurance are not equal. It also appears, fro an the foregoing statement, that the number of patents does not increase in proportion to the number of applications, but that the number of rejections increases in a much greater ratio; and, by reference to your last report, it appears that in 1842, when there were only 76 1 applications, there were more patents granted than in 1844, when there were 10 45 ; and this occurred under the same Commissioner, and with the same examining corps. The causes which have produced this result still exist, and will probably continue to exert a steadily increasing influence throughout the future operations of this office. In every section of the country may be found worthy and ingenious men, whose energies are directed towards inventions and discoveries in the arts. Some of these are sufficiently informed of what has already been done, in the particular department to which their attention is directed, to avoid, in some good degree, the beaten track; but the number and variety of inventions already made are so great that few can enter upon a career of invention with sufficient knowledge to avoid a succession of re inventions, which add nothing to the arts, and which it is the duty of this office to reject. Of course, the attention of the un informed inventor is directed to discoveries of an elementary character. These are necessarily limited in their number, and the field has every where been preoccupied by thousands of every variety of mind ; and whatever he may fix upon is already public property, or has been appropriated by some one who has preceded him. As invention is rapidly progressing in every part of the civilized world, each year will trench still further upon the only department open to un informed inventors; and as their number is likely to increase rather than diminish, rejections must inevitably be multiplied ; and, unfortunately, the consequences have often fallen, and must continue to fall, upon men whose industry, talents, and perseverance deserve, and if well directed would be rewarded by, distinguished success. While the threshold is thus thronged by the multitudes who are treading upon each other, the field beyond, to the eye of those who can explore it, is almost limitless. Very discovery which is made appears to shed light upon others hitherto enveloped in obscurity: each furnishes the key to a group, and the things to be discovered seem to multiply in proportion to those already discovered 1 have stated, above, that 385 rejections have been made at my desk during the current year. It should not be understood that so large a number of applications have been finally rejected. The first examination of an application is intended to be as thorough as the condition of the papers and models will admit. Of the claim cannot be allowed, the machine is carefully examined to discover whether it comprehends any other feature or combination which would justify the grant of letters patent. Of any thing patent able is discovered, the papers are returned to the applicant, with such suggestions as will assist him in amending them and properly modifying his claim; but if nothing patent able is discovered, the application is at once rejected, and the necessary references given; a sit is deemed worse than useless to put the applicant to the trouble and expense of amending and perfecting his papers, when it is believed that no amendment could avoid a final rejection. But this office, from its reorganization, has been liberal in re considering rejected applications. The applicant is always permitted to amend his papers, and to present new or amended claims, which renders it necessary again to examine the application as if it were new. Of it is again rejected, this additional rejection is entered upon the record kept by the examiner, and is counted as a rejection. There are instances in every years experience of eases being represented with different claims two or three times, each change raising questions entirely new, and requiring the same examinations and consideration as would be required by so many distinct applications. All experience of the examining corps has shown the importance of making these re examinations, as it sometimes occurs that, owing to the imperfect manner in which the papers have been prepared, a patent able feature of the machine has escaped the notice of the examiner. From the foregoing facts it clearly appears that the number of rejections is always greater than the number of rejected applications. The number of rejected applications probably amounts to more than three hung. 43 dred; which added to the patents, shows about six hundred applications to have been finally disposed of at my desk during the current year. In the first of January, 1846, there were about one hundred new applications upon my desk awaiting action. Since that time 62 4 more have been referred to me, of which ninety-nine are still un examined ; but this does not give a full view of the business belonging to my desk which has been completed, or which is still pending. From the reorganization of the office down to the present time, applications have daily been partially examined, and returned to the applicant for such amendments as were necessary to a final examination. These applications are often retained by the applicant not only months, but years; and during the present year applications have been examined which were filed in 1837, and every year, from 1837 to the present, has furnished its quota of applications patented and rejected during the current year; and a part of the applications of every year since 1836 are still pending, and liable to be called up at any moment, though they are in such condition that this office is compelled to await the action of the applicant. There are nearly two hundred and fifty of these cases which belong to my desk alone, which are daily coming up in detail for examination. For delay in these cases the applicant is alone responsible. It will readily appear, from the foregoing statement, that the business of the examining corps for any year cannot be determined by the number of applications filed during that year, but is made up, to a considerable extent, of the unfinished business of all preceding years since the system of examinations was instituted. The foregoing remarks I have considered necessary and sufficient for a full understanding of the progress and condition of the business confided to my charge. It affords me pleasure further to state that no appeal has been taken, and no bill in equity has been filed, for the reversal of any decision upon an application referred to my desk since I have been examiner of patents. Of the 22 classes into which applications for patents are divided, the following 11 are under my charge, no considerable change having been made in the division of cases since 1845 1st. Metallurgy and the manufacture of metals 2d. Manufacture of fibrous and textile fabrics, and all machinerytherefor3d. Steam and other gas engines 4th. Navigation, comprehending naval architecture, pro pellets, marine implements, &c 5th. Civil engineering and architecture 6th. And conveyance, comprehending all kinds of vehicles and implements of travel and transportation 7th. Hills, comprehending all kinds of mills for grinding and crushing horse powers, and other means of pro telling them 8th. Machinery for working in lumber, comprehending sawmills, with their implements, planing machines, state machines, single machines, boring and mort ising machines, ve peering, &c 9th. Firearms and implements of war 10th. Hydraulics and pneumatics, comprehending water wheels, wind mills, machinery for raising water, fire engines, filters, &c 11th. Miscellaneous, consisting of such cases as cannot be placed in any other classes 44 a. I shall now proceed to review the improvements which have been patented during the current year in the above classes, under their appropriate subdivisions, commencing withMETALLURGY And Manufactures I N Metals. This class has many subdivisions, as may be inferred from the fact that it comprehends the various modes of obtaining the different metals from the ores, &c, together with the multifarious modes of preparing and applying them to use in the arts. The subdivisions will be presented in their order. The importance of improvements in this class cannot be over rated. The use of one of the metals iron exerts a controlling influence over the condition and advancement of society. To nation ever emerged from barbarism without its use; and it is not claiming too much for it to say that civilization would not long exist without it. I improvements in manufactures of iron have always kept pace with, and presents the surest index to, the progress of man. In some branches of metallurgy inventions have been numerous, while others present but few improvements. Goldbut one patent has been granted for separating gold from itsimpurities. It is an operation involving but little difficulty, and that of a simple mechanical character, and therefore improvements are but rarely to be expected. The following extract from the patent will fully explain the character of the invention : " By the ordinary and common processes of the separation of gold and silver from their ores, by washing with water and amalgam at ion with mercury, there has always been a <a name="loss5"><mark>loss</mark></a> of both gold and silver, as well as of the mercury. In the hand rocker and semicircular, though usually worked by hand, the quantity of sand and gravel which these machines can work is small; consequently, when that contains but little gold or platino m it cannot be worked with profit; and in these machines there is a great <a name="loss6"><mark>loss</mark></a> of both gold and platino m, as well as quick silver, (when that is used) because the motion is half the time in one direction and half the time in another, by which the gold, &c, is prevented from subsiding, and consequently passes off with the water and sand. In the In ke rocket there is yet a greater waste of quick silver and the precious metals. I n the Tyrolese bowls the sand and gravel subside too soon to the bottom, and prevent the contact of the gold and silver with the quick silver. By machine, I believe, will obviate all these practical evils, which heretofore have attended the extraction of the precious metals from the ores and earthy or stony mixtures. These objects I effect in the way and manner following: " I form a frame of wood, or any suitable material of convenient proportions; near each end of this frame there is a vertical shaft; these shafts have each two sunk cranks, and formed on them at right angles to each other, and at equal heights on both shafts to the lower cranks, an oblongrectangular horizontal frame is coupled, so as to partake of and describe circles in each and every part of the frame, equal to the circles described by the cranks when they are moved. To the cranks above there is a connecting rod which serves to secure the proper rotation of the lower cranks and frame in the same direction. The whole may be put in motion by
045any convenient and proper motive power, transmitted through the intervention of an additional shaft, also vertical, and consequently parallel with those above described, the velocity being regulated by cones, connected by a band which is moved up and down at the will of an attendant, by a lever or other contrivance, a device well known to mechanics. A band on the additional pulley connects it with the prime m over. The frame is kept in a horizontal position by means of chains, or any other convenient mode of suspension, attached to its corners and extending up to the stationary frame above. By thus suspending the frame it is evident that, however much weight may be placed upon it, the cranks will not support it, and thus leave them at liberty to convert all their received power into rotary motion without much friction, In this frame are placed any convenient number of pans of circular form, with flat bottoms, or with bottoms grooved in concentric rings. To the bottoms of these pans are affixed four (more or less) legs, which fit into holes let into the frame to receive them. The legs on one side of the pans are made longer than those on the other, so that the side which has the longer legs can be elevated by inserting a block between it and the frame, to enable the operatives to cleanse the pans speedily. The longer legs are opposite the gate; so that when the sides of the pans are elevated, the amalgam, &c, will be readily taken out. In each pan a gate or sliding piece is fitted, which can be made to slide down or up, so as to permit the water, sand, &c, to escape." By the above description it will be seen that the motion effected by my machine in the pans is precisely similar to that of a person planning by hand ; which motion, all who are in the least acquainted with the operation of extracting gold, &c, know to be the only one which will safe all the precious metals" In using this machine for extracting gold, silver, and platino m, it is necessary that the metals be disengaged from their matrix, and free to obey the law of gravity; therefore, ores that contain gold and silver must be ground to powder, so that these metals may be free to descend by their weight to the bottom of the pans rout few improvements have been patented for improvements in the manufacture of iron and steel ; but some of those have been regarded as presenting great advantages. The problem of obtaining pure malleableiron directly from the ore is still in progress of solution. Of the numerous processes heretofore resorted to, none seem to give entire satisfaction, or command general confidence. The following extract from a patent this year presents a process possessing novelty and plausibility ; but it is impossible, for reasons set forth in my last report, to determine a prior i what will be the practical results of any process, however well digested. Experience alone is the proper test; and even when perfectly successful with one kind of ore, the process may wholly fail when applied to another. Now far the following process may have succeeded 1 am not fully informed; but its friends have appeared full of confidence in its merits: "by improved process is applicable to the treatment of oxides of iron only; and this I effect in reverberatory furnaces, although some parts of the process may be applied in furnaces without the reverberatory feature." It has long been essayed to reduce the oxides of iron directly into the metallic state by heating the ores mixed with carbonaceous matter, with the view to produce de oxidation, and then to transfer the mass thus treated to the pudding process; but in all these, which have so far been 46 unsuccessful, the upper stratum only of the mass of ore and carbon was exposed to the direct action of the heat and flame, instead of the whole mass; and to avoid this <a name="evil3"><mark>evil</mark></a>, it has been suggested to apply heat to the mass of ore and carbon below as well as above, by placing the fire grate directly under the furnace hearth or floor, and then reverberating the flame and passing it over the charge. This modification, while it removes the leading objection of the process above indicated, introduces practical difficulties of such magnitude as to defeat the contemplated object." My improvements effectually avoid these difficulties, and consist in exposing the mass of pulverized ore, mixed with carbonaceous matter, to the combined action of a gentle flame or heat; and currents of heated air passing through the mass, which in their passage not only agitated the mass, to aid the mechanical liberation of the gases evolved, but aid involving the gases from the oxide and carbon, which in their nascent state combine and revive the metallic particles." The mass is then subjected to the combined action of a more intense flame, and to highly heated currents of carburetted hydrogen gas, that pass through the mass and take up the remaining oxygen of the ore, and revive the metallic particles; and then the mass passes to the pudding process, where it is subjected to a still more intense heat, and to the action of jets of highly heated atmospheric air, to consume the carbonaceousmatter, and free it from other impure ties. For the application of my improved process, I have made important modifications in the well knownreverberatory furnace, which for this purpose is made of much greater length than those heretofore used Letters patent have also been granted for ah improvement in furnaces for reducing iron ores, whose objects are to facilitate and economized fuel. Two stacks are placed side by side, with a blast for each, which, as occasion requires, may be diverted in such a manner that nearly the whole blast may be directed to one of the stacks, while the charge in the other preserves sufficient heat for its stage of the process. It is believed that extracts from the patent are unnecessary. Steeltwo patents have been granted this year for improvements in the manufacture of steel. The process resorted to by the first patentee is simple, and the rational e obvious. He obtains iron of the quality of pig iron directly from the ore, in the ordinary way, and preserves it in a melted state. The liquid iron has a larger proportion of carbon than is contained in steel. Knowing by experiment the relative proportion of the iron and carbon in the melted mass, he dilutes it, if such a term may be used, with pure mall table iron, which melts with the mass, until the iron and carbon acquire the relative proportions which are found in steel. The mass is then drawn off and allowed to cool. The product of this process will doubtless possess in combination all the elements of steel; but whether all parts of the mass will be equally impregnated with carbon, or whether a portion of it will be steel and other portions pig iron variously carboniced, are questions which iron masters and others will not fail to ask, and the value of the alleged improvement will depend upon the answer. The foregoing invention was made in England, and first patented there. The particulars of the above process will be understood by the following extract from the patent: " The process now universally in use for making cast steel is to reduce
pigiron of suitable quality into bars of mall table iron: to convert these bars into blistered steel, broken into fragments, in close cruciales, and to pour the fluid steel into I r on moulds." The expense attending these different processes is enormous. I f the cost of pig iron of a quality suitable for good steel be 8 a ton, the cost of cast steel, in in gots, made from such pig iron, by the usual process, will amount to upwards of -30, or four times the cost of the pig iron. I have discovered a process by which the conversion of pig into bar iron, of bar iron into blistered steel, and the use of cruciales for melting the blister ed steel, may be dispensed with, and cast steel may be manufactured at a cost far below that of the old process." This is done by melting together a mixture of pig iron and malleableiron in such proportions that the fluid mass arising from the mixture shall contain just that amount of carbon which, when combined with iron, forms steel." The process I now use is described as follows: The pig iron to be converted into steel may be melted in a cupola, or it may be run direct from a blast furnace used for smelting iron ore ; but the most suitable apparatus I consider to be a common cupola furnace, blown with hot air, in order that the metal, when run from it, may retain its highest possible temperature. The fluid pig iron shall be run from a cupola or other furnace into a receptacle, made of any material capable of with standing an intense heat, similar in form to a common refine by, or to the shallow well of a reverberatory furnace for melting pig iron, and the quantity of fluid pig iron used for one operation should occupy about one third, or whereabouts, of the capacity of the receptacle. The interior of this receptacleand its contents should be kept at the highest temperature that can be produced; and I find a very ready and convenient method of producing this high temperature to be by currents of igni ted carbonic oxide gas, conveyed through pipes placed round the top of the receptacle, slightly inclined downwards, so as to bear upon the surface of the fluid metal. A sufficient temperature for this purpose may also be produced by a current of ox y hydrogen gas, produced by directing a stream of atmospheric air into a current of hydrogen gas, formed from the decomposition of water allowed to trickle upon mall table iron brought to a high heat. In order to burn the carbonic oxide, it is necessary to introduce along with it a current of hot atmospheric air; or, if a more intense heat is required, a current of oxygen gas. In either case, however, care must be taken that the proportion of atmospheric air, or of oxygen gas, does not exceed that which is required to convert the carbonic oxide into carbonic acid, as any excess of oxygen in the blast would have a most injurious effect upon the melted metal in the receptacle." The carbonic oxide may be obtained from the waste gas from the cupola employed to melt the pig iron, or from a blast furnace, or it may regenerated in a separate apparatus by the imperfect combustion of any fuel and the application of it maybe in any of the numerous and well known methods already in use. The proportion of hot atmospheric air, or of oxygen gas necessary to form carbonic acid, may be exactly regulated by means of stop cocks or valves in the pipes by which the hot air or oxygen gas is conveyed into the streams of carbonic oxide' In order to decarburate the fluid pig iron in the receptacle to the degree necessary to form steel, I mix with it a certain portion of malleable48 Doc. Too 52.iron, more or less, as I wish to make steel softer or harder; but for cast steel of a medium degree of hardness, such as is used for general purposes, I find that about equal proportions of pig and mall table iron answer best. The proportions in which the pig and mall table iron should be mixed, however, will much depend upon the quality of the former. Of gray pig iron is used, it will require more mall table iron to be mixed with it than if white pig iron is used. This is a point, the exact determination of which can only be arrived at by testing the quality of the mixed fluid metal in thereceptacle at intervals' 'l The mall table iron to be mixed with the fluid pig iron in the receptacle may be in scraps, or in any convenient form ; but by far the most economical, convenient, and purest state in which the mall table iron can be used is in the granular form, produced by reducing any perfectly pure oxide of iron to small fragments, and then submitting them to the well known process of cement at ion in a common converting furnace, such as is used for converting bar iron into blistered steel. The iron ore in small fragments is mixed with just that proportion of carbonaceous matter which is sufficient to combine with its oxygen at a red heat in a close vessel and when the process is finished, the mall table iron is obtained in the purest possible state." Before adding the mall table iron to the fluid pig iron, the former must be brought to a white heat, and this may be done in a separate furnace but I find the most convenient method is to place the mall table iron on a bed between the receptacle which holds the fluid pig iron and the chimney up which the waste heat from the combustion of the gas passes. The mall table iron, when at a white heat, is raked into the receptaclecontaining the fluid pig iron, and the whole is kept in fusion and stirred about for a sufficient time to produce intimate mixture and uniformity of composition into the fluid mass; and when the as says taken from it show that the steel is of the desired quality, the contents of the receptacle are run off into moulds of any form or size requiredFoundingThree patents have been granted this year for improvements in founding, one of which I will describe. This patent is for improvements in patterns for making moulds. It will be readily understood that when a great number of small articles are to be cast of various shapes, the operation of moulding would be much facilitated by uniting the patterns in groups, in such a manner that many may be moulded and cast at the same time. This advantage has already been attained, where the patterns possessed that kind of symmetry which would allow them to be imbedded in wood, plaster, &c, having a general plane surface. But many of these small articles are of such form that but one or two could be thus connected with a plane surface without destroying the <a name="mould1"><mark>mould</mark></a> in drawing the pattern, and such articles are obliged, therefore, to be cast in the old way, by themselves. To obviate this difficulty, and to extend the benefits resulting from grouping to almost every variety of casting, the patentee resorts to the following process for making his patterns. He fills a flask with soft plaster of Paris, or some similar substance, and in beds the patterns in it, in such a position that if the plaster were removed from the upper surface of them, and the whole group applied to a flask of sand, the whole would draw. He then allows the plaster to dry, and removes all that lies upon the tops of the patterns, so that each one will draw from the plaster in a direction perpendicular to the bottom of the flask, care being taken to cut. 49 away the plaster in such a manner that its various points will draw, which is easily done. The various patterns will then be found, with the remaining portion of the plaster, to present an irregularly curved surface, the whole of which will draw. Another flask, corresponding with the first, is then. filled with soft plaster, and placed over the first, which contains the patterns ; and when the plaster becomes hard, this flask, with its plaster, is removed, leaving the first flask of patterns as it was. It will be obvious that each of the patterns in the first flask has -formed a cavity in the plaster of the second flask; and in each of these cavities a duplicate pattern is firmly placed, and the second group of patterns is completed. Oil, or some other substance, is used to prevent sticking, &c. To obtain the <a name="mould2"><mark>mould</mark></a> for the group, a flask of sand is ram med upon the first flask of patterns, and they are drawn. Another flask of sand is then similarly applied to the second flask of patterns, and they are drawn. The passages for the admission of the melted metal are made in any convenient way and placing the two sand flasks together, the group of moulds is complete, for casting. The flasks containing plaster and patterns are retained as permanent patterns for any desired number of moulds. The principle is capable of very extensive application, and promises great advantage to thefo6tnder. A particular review of the other two patents for improvements in founding is deemed unnecessary. The art has already attained a high degree of perfection. Temperingone patent has been granted for improvements in treating edged tools for tempering. The edges of these tools being much thinner than the backs and other parts, if they are at once. placed in a fire suitable for giving the proper heat without <a name="loss7"><mark>loss</mark></a> of time, the different parts will not be equally heated, and the edge may be injured before other parts have received the proper degree of heat, and other inconveniences may arise very pre judicial to the success of a process so nice. These inconveniences have been felt, and means resorted to to obviate them. The plan adopted by the patentee is to place a rack at some distance above the tempering fire, which will hold a considerable number of the tools to be tempered ; which rack is filled with them, and they are heated slowly by the tempering fire. When they are considerably heated, they are taken one by one from the rack, applied to the tempering fire, and heated to the proper degree for tempering. As each is removed from the rack to the tempering fire, another is substituted in its place, so that a sufficient number is constantly undergoing the preparatory operation. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in machinery for rolling hoop iron, which consists principally in returning the rod to the operative, to undergo further rolling, without the intervention of another workman. A patent has also been granted for feeding furnaces by a plunge r; ,forgiving form to various parts of ploughs, by dies and gauges; and another for a saw dressing machine; which it is not necessary to describe. They will be understood by referring to the list of claims. Miles patent has been granted this year for an improvement in round or rat tail files. These, like other files, have heretofore been generally cut by chisel, from which mode of cutting certain irregularities result, which it is the object of the patentee to avoid, and also to facilitate the operation of cutting. The patentee produces his file by cutting upon its surface, from 450 point to thank, right and left hand screws. : The threads :of 'each i s prepare intersected by the groove between i the threads of the b the r in such a manner as to form teeth of equal length, and at proper intervals. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in machinery for cutting flat files, which is intended to obviate the mischief which results from the unequal .hardness of the blank at different points. The blow of the hammer in file cutting has never been made to vary with the varying hardness of the blank; i and it is impossible, perhaps, tie give it this variation. The object wolf the inventor, therefore, is to .obviate the evils which result from it his and: some other difficulties -Whidchseemincident to file cutting: by .machinery. i The following extradtofrom the patent will present the nature of the invention as clearly as ivan (cid127WI el be done without drawings: "I n driving machinery for. cutting files a difficulty hittel to : insurmountably has been experienced, which results from the variation in the hardness or density of the metal at different points of the ' blank l to- be wrought upon; or, to state the difficulty more practically ,nd specifically, when the piece of metal or' blank' is softer in some points than others, the chisel will cut deeper in such points; and as the feeding motion is regular, the chisel at its next descent will strike in the groove previously made, aid merely widen said groove .without forming another tooth. The serious difficulty. has also been met' with in accommodatingthih chisel edge to the wind' (so termed) of the blank, or the imperfectionTiof its surface." These difficulties are avoidediandisurmounted. byuyimprovementsmy machine being so arranged as to imitate or perform automatically, a sit were, the manual process i which is now in vogue for cutting fig les; and which consists in placing the chisel edge in advance of a tooth which has been formed, and on the smooth part of the blank, and drawing it back until the operative feels the said tooth; when r the blow is immediately given with a heavy hammer, which forms i the succeeding tooth and its adjacent groove. lit ~n my machine this function is effected i by so :arranging the chisel that for each groove and tooth it i cutting edge is. made to reach out and slide. back, i di a man her s Substantially- analogous to the manual process above specified, the movements of the chisel' being produced by mechanism i which will be explained in the sequel( I now come to those parts of the machine .which ll embrace my improvements, and I shallhpreeed to show: their distinguishing characteristics these parts having relation to the method of sustaining and operating the chisel. I n- many or most of the: file cutting machines which have hitherto been i invented, so. far As I am informed of their construction and operation, the chisel has been held firmly either in the hammer r striker, or in a vibrating arm under the same, and the blank has been dwown along under the edge f ll the chisel k by- any proper and regular feed motion, ,so as to present it: at proper points to be :cut by the chisel :at the successive blows of the hammer. Both of these modesofartangement, for the reason hereinbefore stated of the varying hard dnssof the (cid127blaLnkhave been found inadequate and unsuccessful (cid127in ,forming good or perfect files." Therhisel is arranged so as -to fmetupand down and shift; its position in the rectangular slot of .thechiselifr ame, being guided and actuated in its movements by the long 'bent spring, in front the -vertical bent Doc -to. 52, 51 spring in its rear; the horizontal bent spring having a button fixed at it send, said bit to be a ill against the rear force of the chisel near its top, and the wedge shaped stud or projection standing on the front face of the chisel near its top, and also the front face or lip f the chisel frame. Thebi it spring performs one of the most essential functions, in operating the chisel in a manner similar to the manual process herein above suggested which function is i pulling the Chisel out after each blow of the hammer in front of a tooth previously formed, preparatory to its being drawn or pressed back by th e li, as -ecid127reinafter explained, against the same for the formation of a succeeding groove and tooth. The upper end of this spring is confined to the projection from the top of the chisel frame, while the lower end passes through a slot in the lip or front piece of said frame, and through a how in the chisel (vi were it: assumes or has the shape and office of a pilot or pin for the support of said chisel) to the rear side of the same, where it is bent do in in such a manner as to tend to hold the chisel against the inner face of the lip, and also to press said chisel down. By this arrangement of the parts above described, it wilt; be seen that when the chisel frame is in the process of rising, (which process will be explained in the sequel) the chisel will not begin to rise until the top of the lip of the frame reaches the stud; accordingly the lip moving first, and the feed motif o containing, i the front face of the chisel will /ave a tendency to be separated a little from ,the lip; but when the chisel does begin to rise, aid n is raised out of the groove and" see of the tooth. just formed, the spring will pill the edge of the chisel forward against the lip and in front of such tooth. This will give the chisel a position in which its front face will form an angle more out use with the remaining plain face of the blank than before; the wedge shaped stud assisting in this operation of throwing, or moving the chisel edge forward. But when the said frame descends again, the chisel edge will first come in contact with the face of the blank; and 'as the frame continues after this to descend, its lip or front piece will press the chisel edge back until it comes against the tooth last formed, while at the same time the spring, by pressing its button against the -rear of the chisel, will bring the front face of said chisel to a fair bearing against the inner face of the lip; and then the chisel I will e in proper position for the blow of the hammer, and theformatioiiofaniother tooth. The back spring is intended to assist in guiding and: steadying the chisel in its movements; though it might be i perhaps entirely dispensed with, without n materially affecting the operation of the miachineThe chisel frame is supported in the formed ends of the s wives frame, by meansboftfhe journals on the sides of said chisel frame, and the confining nuts b. said journals. This s wives frame turns on a proper hinge or pin in the end' of this vibrating lever or arm; and by turning this s wives frame round on the pin to various positions, the teeth~ may be cut on the 'blank either straight across or in oblique lines. The vibrating lever or chisel arm, as I shall term it, turns on a proper fulcrum or pin, in the upright frame piece which piece is fitted in an elongated slot, cut through the rocket shaft; being confined in any position in said slot by a binding screw. The rear end of the chisel arm is connected, by i means of an arm, (which turns freely on a pin fitted in said end) to an arm or lever .arranged I in the elongated stint he st in the shaft, which I de nominate the chiselactuatirrgshaftthis arrangement of the arms being such as to form an L joint, as it were, from the end of the chisel arm to said actuatingshaft. This shaft derives its motion ,from an eccentric on r the driving shaft, which ,eccentric, wo or against the end of the arm fixed on said shaft; a counteracting spring is also connected to said shaft, through the medium of the lever and cord, the combined operation of which spring with the eccentric and arm will be readily understood, while it will be as clearly seen how the turning of said shaft will vibrated the chisel arm, and thereby alternately lift the chisel edge from and carry it down to the face of the blank to be cut, 'the elongated s lots above mentioned as being formed respectively in the shafts allow the chisel arm to be moved, so .that oblique teeth can be cut on the blank in a reverse direction. The rocket shaft and chiselactuatingshaft have suitable bearings in the sides of the framework, and the former shaft is held in any position by the following contrivance i( The cord passes from an upright arm on said shaft to a spring at the rear of the machine: this arrangement of said cord, spring, and arm, has a tendency to pull or turn the rocket shaft backwards; but this tendency is counteracted, where there is no other strain, by the hatchet sector on the top of the arm attached to said shaft, the teeth of which hatchet engage with the spring pall, secured at one end to the cross bar i or rod. The arms are arranged at opposite ends of the rocket shaft, and the teeth on the hatchet sector are so formed and connected with the pall as to permit the shaft to turn forwards, or towards the fr t he ft o the machine, when sufficient strain, by reason of the resistance which the chisel meets with against a tooth, when one larger than usual has been cut on the blank, is exerted on the upright frame piece, throw go the medium of the chisel arm, to overcome the resistance arising from the arrangement of the cord, spring, and arm, as above specified. Now, when, as I have herein before suggested, the chisel comes. to a soft place in the blank, it will form, as stated, a wider groove and a larger tooth than where the blank is harder; .and when the chisel is again raised and directed; out in front of said tooth, as above explained, it will, in having its cutting edge pulled back by the lip, meet the tooth previously formed sooner than ordinarily; and being kept down in contact with the blank by the long spring, the resistance which it meets with against the tooth draws the chisel arm and upright frame piece forward, ver coming the resistance of the spring, and turns therockdrshaft proportionately, aid consequently moves the sector hatchet so that the pall engages with another tooth of said hatchet, and thereby keeps the hatchet and rocket shaft in the position thus assumed, and preserves the gain on the feed motion thus made, in a manner which will be readilyunderstoodAnother mode in which I have contemplated the application of the principle of the above described mechanical arrangement for preserving thegcid127nh ii the feed motion, is as follows : I arrange the metal in bed piece in t lye 'city or trough of the feeding block, so that it may slide along in the same; a retarding spring being placed in rear of said bed piece andfeediigeblock, which is a detail elevation of said parts; a frame piece is fastened to the front of the ed piece, and in a slot in this frame piece ahelixshaped hatchet is arranged l so as to turn; there is also a coiled spring on the side of said hatchet, and a pall attached to the front of the feeding block, which pall engages with the teeth of the hatchet. Thishelix shaped hatchet is set with its tooth, w hi. : is it the salle. distance from i its axis, in connexion with the pall, awcid127d when the icel edge pull Doc . No. 2.against a t both on the black, it ,vill pull the bed piece and its frame piece forward, and thereby dis engage the hatchet from its pall, while at the sane tie the coiled spring will pull the hatchet round for down, 'until a tooth more remote from its axis engages with the pall, and thus the gain on the feed motion is preserved by a mechanical arrangement analogous to that before described There is another mode of effecting the result just above specified, theprieniple of operation being substantially the same as in those above described. In this case the chisel farm is arranged so as to slide in a vibrating frame, which should be secured to the rocket shaft by its ends; a retarding spring, operating like that above referred to, is placed at the rear end of the chisel arm, one end of said spring being connected to the frame, (it being understood that the s wives frame, with its appendages, is connected to and turns on the circular head piece of the chisel arm) A helixshapedratchet similar to that above described is arranged on the small shaft, which has suitable bearings in the frame. The hatchet turns in a slot in the chisel arm, the front edge of which slot is chafe red off so as to operate as a pall and engage with the teeth of the hatchet. A coiled spring is arranged on' te side of the hatchet. so as to draw and, turn it down when said hatchet is free to move, so that when the chisel edge, coming in contact with a tooth on the blank, pulls the chisel arm forward, the gain thus made of the feed motion is preserved by the helixshapedratchetNothing farther upon this subject has been patented within the year. Foresfive patents have been granted within the year for improvements in blacksmiths' forges, but none of them are of commanding importance. Two of them have for their principal object the prevention of c logging by cinders, and differ but little from others for similar purposes. One is for a bell owns of novel: construction. It consists of series of fellows arranged about a drum with which they communicate, and through which the air is discharged. The whole revolves about an axis, and each fellows is operated by an arm connected with an eccentric near the centre of the machine. The novelty of the fellows being admitted, its utility must be tested by experiment. Two of the other patents under this head are for improvements in tu teres. It is well known that different kinds of work require forge fires of different sizes; and to adapt the blast alternately to large, medium, and small fires is the object of both patentees. The one effects his object by placing a hollow cylinder horizontally by the side of the fire, in which there is another cylinder worked by a crank. The inner cylinder fits the outer one, except where portions are cut from the side of the inner cylinder, to allow the air to pass through an elongated opening in the outer cylinder to the fire. The portions, are cut from the inner cylinder at such points, relatively, that by turning the cylinder in one position, air will be allowed to pass out the whole width of the opening; in another position, about one third- of the blast will be cut off; in another, two thirds; and finally the whole blast will be cut off. The other patentee makes use of two. nodules, which he connects with the main pipe on opposite sides of the fire in such a manner that they can be adjusted and brought nearer to each other for a small fire, or withdrawn further to accommodate a large one. Most of the application is which have be et had e for the last few years54
for letters patent for improvements in this department of the arts have been rejected for want of novelty. I tis proper to remark that the patent granted two or three years since, for improvements in steam hammers has been surrendered and re issued. It has been the subject of appropriate remarks in former reports, and need not here be described. Head pipe But one patent has been granted for improvements in making lead pipe within the year, and that is a re issue. Although the patent is an important one, it does not require particular notice, as it has made part of a former report. Spikes and nails give patents have been granted this year for improvements in machinery for the ,manufacture of spikes and nails. One is a re issue of an old and well known patent, which need not be described. Another is for improvements in machinery for feeding plates of iron to cutters for making cut nails. The machine carries the plate forward to the cutters; and, after the separation' of the nail, with draws and turns over the plate and again carries it forward to the cutters in this reversed position, in order that a head and point may alternately be cut at the same edge of the plate' The machine possesses but little novelty, the same object having been before attained by means differing but little from those resorted to by the patentee. A spike machine has been patented this year which evinces considerable ingenuity ; but, upon a careful examination of it, I find it too complicated to be understood without drawings and references. It does not, however, possess such advantages over other machines in use for similar purposes as to render a description here particularly necessary. A nail machine for the manufacture of wrought nails has been patented, which is principally characterized by drawing out the thank of the nail by rollers working in arms extending from a revolving shaft. The hail is rolled out by being pressed between the rollers above named and a bed plate, resting upon a powerful spring. Several devices are united in the combination, which it is unnecessary to mention. The remaining patent under this head is for a horse nail machine, whosepectiliarities cannot well be set forth, and are not deemed of very great importance. Good nail and spike machinery has long been known and used, and some of the patents granted this year are for different machinery, rather than for that which is better than the old. Screw. -one patent has been granted this year for an improved pointed screw, and eight for improvements in machinery for the manufacture of screws. It is unnecessary here to describe the improved screw, as it will be understood by reference to the description herein after given of the machine by which its threads are cut. In manufacturing screws there are several operations very different from each other, and requiring machinery of corresponding diversity. The rod or wire is to be cut into proper length for the screw, and each blank headed; the head is then to be dressed into its proper form; it is then to be picked, which completes the head; and, finally, the thread is to be cut to a the thank, which completes the screw. These various operations require different lengths of time. The machine for cutting off and heading the blanks wcid127otuld supply blanks for several picking or dressing machines, and one picking machine would perform its duty for several thread cutting machines. Economy in machinery, therefore, requires that
55these operations should .be performed by distinct machines, in order thattheicid127rumber of each kind in the factory may bear such proportion to the others as will keep the mr all constantly employed. The operations of cutting off and heading the blank should be performed by one machine, dressing or turning the head by another, picking by a third, and cutting the thread by a fourth. a Patents have been granted during the year for improvements in machinery for each of these operations. One patent has been granted for a machine for cutting off and heading the blank. This machine operates upon the same principle with rivet machines, and is capable of general application where similar operations are required. Heretofore, in machines of this character, each c utter has been combined with a separate header, the two operating alternately; the header, therefore, is in operation while the c utter is cutting and carrying the blank: to it, and also while the c utter is going back for another cut. It is evident, therefore, that the header might perform double ,its usual duty. The inventor of the above mentioned patented machine has so arranged the parts as to combine each header with two cutters, each operating upon a different rod or re el of wire, and each of which brings the blank it has cut to the header as the other c utter is withdrawn. Thus each c utter performs its usual duty without the <a name="loss8"><mark>loss</mark></a> of time, and the header per forms double duty. It is evident that by this device each machine will produce nearly double the number of headed blanks that would be produced in the same- time by the ordinary machine. There is some novelty in the mechanism by which the combination is effected, but is not of such importance as to require particular notice. A patent has been granted for a machine for dressing, and another for picking the heads of screws, which possess considerable novelty; but, as the principal novelty consists in the parts and combinations of parts which are found in a machine patented by the same inventor for cutting threads on screws, it is not necessary to describe them here. They will be described when the patent last mentioned is noticed. Give patents have been granted for improvements in cutting threads on screws. One of them is a re issue of a very old patent, which is too well known to require notice in this report. One of the above mentioned patents is for cutting the threads on screws and nuts. The cutters a replaced at the opposite ends of a revolving shaft. In cutting the thread on the screw this shaft is made to advance, end wise, the distance to which the thread extends upon the thank. In order to dis engage the screw from the c utter or die, the motion of the shaft must be reversed. The blank nuts are placed in a self acting fee der, hear the opposite end of the shaft, which feeds one at each advance of the shaft into a position the reached by the tap on the end, which is intended to cut the thread in the nut at the return of the shaft. As the shaft returns to dis engage the screw, the tap at the opposite end enters the nut and cuts the thread in it. When another screw blank is placed at the screw end, the shaft advances to cut the thread on' it, the tap drawing the nut after it till it comes over an opening; and as the shaft advances, the tap is screwed out of the nut, which falls into a proper receptacle. Thus the time which would be lost in withdrawing the finished screw is, devoted to cutting the screw in the nut ;and the one is sure to fit the other, and the feeding and clearing the nut are effected in a simple and convenient manner. In another of the patented machines for cutting screws, the rod upon56
which the thread is to be cut is held by a self cent ring clamp attached to a sliding carriage. The end of the rod is seized by divided revolving dies, which are pressed upon it by self cent ring clamps. Thus, in every adjustment the centres are preserved. The dies are of the ordinary kind for cutting screws, but have an additional c utter combined with them to finish the thread. The bolt or rod is received by the dies, is by: them, smoothed, and the thread partially cut and fed to the finishing c utter. The machine, hereinbefore alluded to, for cutting the threads on pointed screws, possesses some peculiarities which are worthy of notice, and which, it is believed, will be fully understood by a perusal of the following extract from the patent: "screws have heretofore been formed gradually tapering at the core from where the thread starts to the end, by dressing the thread at each turn; and tapering screws have also been formed, but they have been found not to hold as well as those of common construction, by reason of the taper of the main part of the core; but the nature of my improved screw consists in forming on a screw of the ordinary shape a conical point, and extending the thread of the screw with the same pitch, but gradually diminishing in width to the end of said point, by which means the screw can be entered into the wood without boring, unless the wood is very hard; in which case it follows better, works straight, and, holds more firmly than any other heretofore made The nature of my invention consists in moving the cutters which cut the thread of a pointed wood screw alternately with an accelerated and retarded motion as they approach the point, so as to leave the thread of the proper form down to the point and at a regular distance apart." The construction of our modification of machinery for this purpose is as follows: The series of cutters act one at a time consecutively on the screw blank; they are all so attached to a frame or carriage that slide s parallel with the screw blank as to be brought up against the blank: at the proper point; this is effected by a curved stationary plate or groove, in which the rests that the tools are fastened in slide. This plate, or stationary can, is so curved as to bring each tool up to the work as it arrives at the proper point by the progressive motion of the carriage, and thence runs parallel with the screw blank to the conical point. It is then gradually pushed forward till it arrives at the extreme apex of the point, where it leaves the blank. Each succeeding c utter is made to move forward by the regular progression of the carriage corresponding with the gain: of the thread to be cut, till it arrives at the conical part of the revolving blank. At this point the first c utter is somewhat retarded as it moves along to the point. When the second c utter arrives at the conical point its motion is accelerated, and so on successively each alternate c utter is accelerated or retarded, the effect of which is to cut a fine and even thread to the apex of the conical point, and maintaining them (the threads) e qui distant all the way. The motion is effected by a can that acts upon the end of the carriage, where there is a friction roller interposed; this can moves the carriage forward regularly. There is a small indentations in the can, by which the motion is retarded till the first tool leaves and the second is brought into action, thence the can is regularly progressive to the point, where, by a projection from the face of the can, the motion is accelerated till the second c utter leaves, and so on through the series, the number corresponding to the number of cutters used. 57" It is necessary icid127n working a series of tools, thotighI   sufficietitto' cut the thread, to bring one only on to the blank at a time, and at the' ihcid127taritthe other leaves, so as to keep a continued action upon: the blank above named. Of the attempt is made to cut a screw by having the blank surrounded by cutters, as in some machines, a perfect thread cannot be made, as some of the cutters will be sharper than others; arid if one tool only is used, all its defects are transferred to the screw thread, which is not the case when a number of cutters are used The screw cutting machine, to which allusion has been made, for the manufacture of common wood screws, and as possessing several of the features found in the machines above mentioned for dressing and picking screw heads, possesses much novelty, and is too complicated to be fully understood without drawings. It ought not, however, to be omitted, and it is believed that the following extracts from the patent will give a general idea of its characteristics: " The nature of my invention consists, first, in arranging the screw banks in a continuous row when thrown promiscuously into a hop per, and delivering them one by one without the necessity of an attendant, which is effected by means of two inclined rollers, placed far enough apart to permit the thanks of the screws to hang vertically between them, so that by their rotation and inclination they cause the blanks to arrange themselves side by side, with the heads resting on and the thanks hanging between them, and thus gradually to force them towards the delivery end." My second improvement consists in taking the blanks from the ends of the rollers and delivering them into a vertical conveying tube, by means of a slide which has an aperture in it that admits the blank, and by its motion and the oblique side of the aperture faces it horizontally and in a vertical position to the aperture of the delivery tube, down which it descends, at the same time checking the further descent of the blanks between the rollers until its return, the aperture being so formed' as to permit the descent of the blanks into it from the rollers before the repetition of the delivery operation." My third improvement consists of a pair of spring conveying fingers, which are presented to the lower end of the vertical tube down which the banks descend, and slightly opened by coming in contact with a projection from the lower end thereof to receive the end of the blanks as it descends, and which is griped by the fingers as they are moved away; the conveying fingers projecting from a shaft, so operated by a slide and a series of came and levers that it rotates through a part of a circle to bring the blank in a horizontal position, and then horizontally to present the head of the blank to the grip mrs preparatory to cutting the threads." My fourth improvement relates to the employment of grip mrs jointed to a chuck or head on the end of a hollow mandrel, arid connected to one end of a sliding rod within the mandrel, the other end being connected with a slide governed by a can, the sliding of which causes the grip mrs to take hold of the blank just within the head, to rotate it whilst under the operation of the chasing tool, when this is used in combination with a turn screw that slides within or on the sliding rod, and forced towards the had of the screws by a spring, so that if the blank should turn in the grip mrs, in consequence of the ,bite of the chasing or Dec. No. 52.threading tool, the turn screw will be forced into the nick in the head; and there bold it. , : .by fifth improvement relates to the arrangement of the threadcutteror chase r, and the sliding rest, the latter of which is secured to a sliding chasing frame or carriage, for the purpose of preventing the thanks of the screw from yielding while under the action of the chase r; which latter is also properly secured in an adjustable tool holder or head, spirited by it slower end to the chasing sliding frame, the upper end sliding on a rod secured to a sway bar, one end of which is jointed to an adjusting slide, and the other governed by a can which gives the requisite taper and point to the screw. The chasing frame is governed in its motion by a chasing can groove on a cylinder, the groove being so formed as to move the chasing slide to carry the c utter gradually from the commencement of the thread towards the point, with a motion so regulated relatively to the rotation of the mandrel as to give the pitch of the thread, and then moved back again for another cut, one part of the groove crossing the other for this purpose; and that part of the groove. which moves the chasing slide for chasing the thread is in the form of a felix, and at the end thereof it crosses the felix with a sudden curve to run back the chase r, and at the end of the felix the groove runs into another groove, the junction of these two being provided with a sliding switch, connected with a sliding rod within t the chasing can shaft, and so governed by another can, called the index can, that when the thread is chased the switch is shifted, which opens this latter groove to draw the chasing frame and chase r far enough out of the way to admit of the operation of the conveying fingers to supply a new blank. 'by sixth improvement relates to the method of adjusting the motions of the chase r to the varying lengths of blanks, and to the different form of points, so as to insure the formation of good points on the screws by making he can which governs the motions of the sway bar adjustable on its shaft And my last improvement relates to the mode of changing the came that operate the conveying fingers the griping can and the chasing cabby means of an index came, which operates sliding twitches, through the intervention of sliding rods, within the hollow mandrel and the camshaftsBy means of these improvements I constitute an automatic machine, which performs all the operations of arranging the blanks in regular order, supplying them one by one, conveying them to the grip mrs, chasing the thread with any desired taper and point, and discharging the chased screw, with no other human labor than is necessary to keep the mechanism in order, and to throw a large quantity of blanks into the hop per at given intervals The feeding apparatus of the above described machine is used in the machines patented by the same inventor for picking and dressing the heads, with such modifications as are necessary to adapt them thereto. :the screw machinery of this country has already attained a degree of perfection which is truly en viable, especially as it gives character to so important a branch of our manufactures; and it is highly gratifying to perceive that the genius of our inventors is still rapidly adding important improvements to a department of machinery already highly elaborated and refined. a. 59 Sheet metal right patents have been granted this year for improvements ;in n machinery for working in sheet metal. Operations in this branch of manufactures are necessarily of a simple character ;and after so much has been done, it does not appear to furnish room for inventions possessing striking novelty.  Three of these patents are for s hears for cutting tin, &c. One of these is for cutting oval shapes, the tin being guided in its motion towards the cutters by a pattern somewhat upon the principle of turning irregular shapes. The other two patented machines have a double lateral bend at the middle of the main bow, and the cutters are connected with an additional half bow, adjustable and sliding upon the main bow. The shafts of the cutters are both inclined to the surface of the sheet to be cut, and the bend mentioned in the main bow allows these shafts to be always nearly in the same plane with the axis of the metal holders, or clamp. The points of novelty are divided between the two patentees, the machines being substantial y the same. I n making vessels, such as cups, pails, &c, of that material, it has always been difficult to do the double beaming by machinery. Several patents have already been granted for improvements in double steamers, and this year two more have been granted. The following extract from the patent will give an idea of the one of them which seems to possess the mostnoveltySI   proceed to describe the working machinery; noticing, first, the two harbors, which are connected by cog wheels and turned by the crank. Two heads are affixed to the ends of these harbors, and between these heads the double beaming is performed. A pan is placed over the head on the lower harbor, so as to bring the upper edge, which is to be seamed, down between the head and a small roller hereafter described. The shape of the head should be carefully noticed. This head consists of alan ch projecting from a cylindrical surface, similar to some other machines now in use. This cylindrical surface is terminated by a shoulder that connects with a conical moulding. The level surface of the head bears first upon the edge of the pan, which is sustained by the head, (the shoulder above named coming against the bottom) and the edge is forced to yield to the level of the head, as this is screwed down upon it by means of the screw; and should any part of it be inclined to slip out towards the top of the pan, (as this edge is always composed of three thicknesses) it is prevented from so doing by the little roller attached to a collar that surrounds the harbor near the head. At this stage of the operation the crank is turned, the pan revolves in the machine, and the edge is turned down as far as' the level part of the head will turn it, while the shoulder prevents the edge of the pan from l bending too far down towards the centre. After this the head must be raised a little by turning a screw attached to its box, and then the lever is brought into use to move the harbor inwards, by which, the cylindrical part of the head, which is parallel with the outer surface of the lower head, is brought over the same, and .then screwed down towards it by said screw, when by again turning the crank the work is completed. The outside shoulder of the upper head keeps the bottom of the pan close against the lower head. The lever passes through an aperture in i the top of the frame, where it has room to be moved back and forth, and places are fitted to receive it when so moved, into which it is throw in by a spring or by its own elasticity. It also passes between 60 two shoulders on the upper harbor, and its lower end is cor infected with the frame by a ii vot. I to use has already been i explained. There to aslidiniggaige for the purpose of holding in proper position firing articles, such as the path, There the bottom needs to be thrown out for a perpendicular with the harbors, in order to bring the body of the pan i parallel with them. This gauge consists of a thank that is attached by a screw to the frame, and is terminated by a head that is just under the lower 'head. The bottom of the pan is held out by this gauge resting against the inside thereof, which keeps the work steady While being acted on. This is found to be indispensable when the work 'is made flaring. The gauge is fastened, when set or placed right, by a thumb screw, and the end thereof is also provided with a soft surface, which prevents its rubbing the tin to scratch or mark it. When it is not desirable to move the gauge, the work will rest against the lower head, which is faced nearly to the edge wit ii leather, (although other materials may be used) to prevent its rubbing the tin. There is a collar, with a lever attached thereto. The collar part of it is fitted upon the harbor, allowing the a roi to turn freely in it, while the upper end passes through a loop in the frame to keep it in an upright position, and below the Collar is fastened upon a pilot the little: roller The only use of the loop is to bring the roller to be ai properly upon the work; and to secure this the better, the lever is made crooked at the top, so that by pressing it down, this part of it is brought towards the frame, and consequently the roller is moved up, and vice versa. A spring is' applied to throw the collar back as it rises up. In order that the screw may not only keep down the upper harbor by acting upon the' box, but may also have such a connexion with it as to raise it up when its own action is reversed, a bow is provided, which receives the harbor and passes up through the box and the frame, and is connected by a yoke to the top of the screw, of which the crank turns freely in the yoke. The object of raising and lowering the upper harbor has already been explained One patent has been granted for a mode of punching sheet metal, particularly adapted to punching sheathing for vessels. Short punches insufficient number, and in proper position, are attached to the convex surface of a sector of a cylinder, and openings to correspond are made in the convex surface of a similar sector; these sectors are placed together upon shafts ; the sheet to be punched is laid upon the bed sector, and by a partial revolution about their axes the sectors carry the sheet between them, and thus punch it. Letters patent have been granted for an improved mode of manufacturing spoons from sheet silver; for a new mode of casting wire into the hand les of spoons; and for an improvement in machinery for polish ing cutlery. These inventions all appear to be use a: and ingenious. Letters patent have been granted within the year for an improved device for holding plates of metal while undergoing the process of polishing: it is equally calculated for holding plates for filing. Very worker of metal is aware of the extreme difficulty of filing a surface perfectly flat or plane and the same difficulty is found in polishing plane surfaces without wearing them off more at one point than at another. The mechanics who can do either must be master of his business indeed, it is matter of such difficulty that it is never attempted except in cases of imperious necessity and, when necessary, it requires a degree of care and skill which belong to few, and is of course always very e pensive. The device alluded to
61seems to, remove, every obstacle, and filing or polishing a flat surface is tendered so simple and easy that it may be performed by an apprentice, with no more care than is necessary in ordinary filing. The patent ed device is as follows: The holder of the plate to be polished rests upon the hollow side of a bell crank, which is supported in a. horizontal positionbygudgeons revolving freely in vertical supports. The holder has variousljustments to adapt it to the size, &c, of the plate to be polished. The plate is so adjusted in the holder that its surface is in the horizontal plane passing through the centres of the dudgeons of the bell crank, and that aline passing through the centres of the dudgeons will divide the plate into equal parts. As the polishing tool or file is applied to the plate cross wise, its pressure must be the same on both edges of it, because any inequality of pressure would be immediately equal sized by the motion allowed by the bell crank; and thus if the. file or polisher is not properly brought to the plate, the plate immediately adapts itself to the tool. The principle is capable of very extensive application, and comprehends much more than has yet been developed. The last subdivision of this extensive class which I shall mentioncomprehendsLocks, fastenings, N5cnineteen patents have been granted during the year for improvements in this branch of metallic manufacture, several of which are well worthy of notice. Right patents have been granted this .yer for locks, but unfortunately they are generally of a character toocomrnpicated to be understood without elaborate drawings and descriptions and I shall therefore be compelled to pass over several possessing great merit and novelty. Of those locks which are deemed worthy of notice, there is but one whose characteristics can here be made intelligible. Thelqck in question is intended principally for chambers in hotels, &e c, where it promises great usefulness, with less expense than those heretofore used for similar purposes. Several devices have been resorted to for the purpose of preventing the keyhole, on the outside of the door, from being used for picking the lock, looking into the room, &c. Two locks in one case have been used, whose inner and outer keyholes are not opposite plate shave been used to cover the holes these plates being operated by independent devices; but those who understand the lock could remove them. In the lock above mentioned, a plate is so connected with the inside of the lock as to lie against the plate through which. the outer keyhole is made; and when the door is locked from the inside, the slide moves forward, entirely covers the outer keyhole, and prevents it from being used .for any purpose. When the door is unlocked the. plate sides back. When the door is locked from the outside. the plate remains stationary. Over al very perfect locks have been patented during the year, and the improvements made are highly creditable to their inventors. Six patents have been granted for patches and other similar fastening for doors, windows, blinds, &c. A latch for the doors of houses has been patented, which recommends itself by its simplicity, compact ness, and thees with which it may. be attached to and removed from the door. I t can becid127ndqrstood by a peru sa of the following extract from the patent: "I n making mort ice lathes, much difficulty has been experienced in giving a form to the case to. suit their doors, and at the same time adapted to the reception and working of the mechanism, and the fitting of a mort is e made entirely by boring, to avoid the labor of mort ising with a chisel. a." This end has been sought by substituting the cylindrical forth square form; 'but to adapt this to the i reception of I properly formed tumbler, requires too great a diameter to suit a median thickness, or thindoorsaut by one of my improvements I attain this desideratum by forming the carss section ofshflee case of three circles; one in th. middle to form the thickness of, and two small ones one: on each side of and bisecting the middle one, to form .this width of o the case, so that a hole formed by boring one large hole and two small ones will receive the latch case, the diameter of the large one being sufficient to give to the axle of the tumbler the required length, and the: two small: ones giving sufficient width for the working of the levers of the tumbler and the Kings of the latch bolt on which thetumiibler acts to operate it: My second improvement consists in so locating the he local spring, which protrudes thdcid127bolt within a recess therein as to have one portion of it rest on a flared h connecting the two sides of the bolt, and the other end on a shoulder of the stud against which the permincid127) ut en of the spring rests by means of which arrangement, n much of the f fiction and consequent wear of the spring against the case is avoided' From the foregoing it will be perceived that when the case is et intothe door, the whole strain on the old of the door is along the i surface of the small circles, and &e bar to their junction with the large one, thus leaving a much greater thickness and t strength of wood than if the strain were along the surface of the large diameter, and that therefore the wood of the door will retain much more strength than if the latch were round or square; for: :i the b former, to attain t 'required room for the 'working parts, the entire diameter of the case would urecessarilybe equal to the diameter of the three circles united in mine, and in the latter (the square the thickness of the whole case would be equal to the diameter of the large circle, so that the strain (cid127oiuld of course come on the wood at the corners of the mort is e, where there would of course be less thickness than on each side of the small circles , mine, besides the inconvenience of making the mort is e with a chisel instead of by boring it simply. It is well known to carriage makers that the fastenings used ordinarily for carriages 1 are very liable to be broken i, palcrtikcUlarly' during their transportation from the factory to those parts of the chantry where they are -to be used, in consequenced of the protrusion of i the knobs or handles of thefasteni16gs, and e area 'the :been, fastenings. And when thus broken, the broken fixtures cannot be removed and new ones substituted wVithoiit considerable difficulty and injury to the carriage. Letters patent have been granted this yea for f a new device for :fastening, which' r moves the liability to break age, by removing the handle, and leaves the permanent parts of the fastening in such condition that if broken they are i removed and others substituted with great facility. The following extract -from the patent will sufficiently explain the invention: "I n the common carriage door lock, the bolt which, when turned, projects from the door plate into th hasp -has two journals, one turning in each plate, with the spring attached to the case, and acting of the catlike form of the back of the bolt to hold it when either turned in or out, thespiridle- passing through a squarcid127socket in the bolt. The lock case is made of two parts, the fro it platetcid1274nd: there nd and two side plates, in which the journals of: the bolt turn .the three latter being made of one piece of sheet i metal, bent and secured to the front plate, the spring being secured between the two side plates.

The liability of breaking or otherwise injuring the handle by trans pp rtiatiocid127nbecause it cannot be removed conveniently on account of being secured on the inside of the door, and within the lining: and the difficulty of repairing the lock which can only be taken out after the spindle has been removed ; and, finally, the difficulty of making the case of cast mtefalBwhich would greatly reduce the cost of manufacturing locksAthse defects are avoided by my improvements which consist, first in casting the lock case in one piece, with. the exception of one of the side plates; second, in making the bolt with :a journal on one face only ; third, in securing the spindle of the handle in its place by making it with a projection on the inner end, which, after passing through a groove in' the not, and a corresponding one in the lock plate on that face of the bolt' which has no journal, and -then turning the spinndtl- partly round, s .retained 'by the lock plate; and, 6 fourth, making this lastnentiohed plate iv i th da in like projections i and providing the spindle with a spiral spring t te: thesibonof which draws the :projection on. the inner end of the spindle towards the plate, and causes the spindle and bolt to turn around ind either direction .from the highest part .of the said catlike projectionnAliwhich the projection slide six. very simple device has been patented for holding o down :the ordinarythrumblatch: fr fastening, by a can lever, bearing upon the upper screw of the keeper in such' manner as :to operate with certainty in fastenihganid un fastening the door. and in either position to give and ornamental finish to the latchiSeveral imrprovemensd' have bee n patented for improvements in door knobs, and in the manner of connecting them with their thanks and with the locks to which they belong. Of the inventors of these improvements have successfully aimed .at .neatness, simplicity, c and economy i aid the results of their labors are valuable additions to t his- branch of -manufacture. I must dismiss t the subject of metaliurgy and manufacture, i ri totals. A glance only is necessary at the developments made this year 'at this office, to satisfy the most skeptics l that rapid strides towards perfection bhvebeen taken in this: comprehensive and important class of nmanutfactureFI Brous And :TEXTI Of Substancs :AND Fabri Cssi   n this branch of the arts inventive genius is still active, vigorous, and successful. I to range is so extensive, and its details so numerous and minute, that a host of inventors find ample scope within its circuit; and its variety furnishes gratification to every diversity of inventive taste and skill. Such inventions. as revolution i ze a department of the arts are rarely to be expected; but those which evince great ingenuity, and promise extended usefulness, are al no sit daily :coming to light, d and entering -upon their course with a steady step. Enough has been developed within the year to stimulate the hopes and sustain the high reputation of the gifted land persevering inventors whose exertions are devoted to this department. This class has many subdivisions, which will be noticed in their order 6 44 a. Breaking and dressing hemp, flax: ccThree patents have been granted this year for preparing hemp and flax for: the manufacturer. They possess but little novelty. In breaking hemp and flax there is great danger, of injuring the fibre by breaking it in bundles which are too thick and strong, the fracture being so sudden as to break the fibre with the wood part of the stock; and if this be avoided in the old fashioned machine, with stationary, and vibrating knives working between them, the fibre is much injured by being dragged over the several edges of the knives as it is forced by the vibrating down between the stationary knives. Letters patent have been granted this year for a machine whose object is to obviate both these difficulties. The first is obviated by giving a convex curve to both sets of knives, the effect of which is to spread the bunch of hemp towards both ends of the knives; and the other, by causing the centre knives of each set to stand out further towards each other and the hemp than the outer ones, so as to strike the different points of the hemp in detail. The object of breaking the hemp is to loose n the wood y parts from the fibres, so that the fibres may he retained, and the wood y part shaken out. It will readily be perceived that if this refuse be dragged or scraped out of the fibre in the direction of its length, the refuse will, to some extent, rub and break the fibres. This inconvenience is, to some extent, obviated by a machine patented this year, constructed as follows: A series of arms are arranged around the cicuamfererices of two parallel circular revolving dies; and at equal distances from these dies, and at equal distances from these disks, and between, is another disk, whose edge is cut' out into came; a rest over which to break the hemp is placed in front of these armed dies, and as they revolve the hemp is broken by the arms. Directly below the rest is a series of spring whippers extending from the ends of it to the centre; and as the breaker revolves, and breaks the hemp, it hangs down between the breaker and the whippers, and the came on the central disk cause the whippers to operate rapidly against the broken hemp, and, without scraping, to shake out the refuse. Further notice of hemp dressing machines is unnecessary. Cotton ginsTwo patents for improvements in cotton gins have been granted within the year, both of which deserve notice. The one is for an improvement in one of the nicer points, and the other for general improvements upon the cotton gin, considerably modifying and changing its character and operation, The following extract from the first above mentioned patent sets forthwith sufficient clearness the <a name="evil4"><mark>evil</mark></a> which the improvement is intended to obviate, and th. remedy applied by :the inventor: " Any efforts have been made so to improve the saw gin, as to separate from the fibres of cotton notes and other impure ties, By some this has been essayed by means of rotating brushes, which act on the fibres as the saws carry them from the grate to the stripping brush, the more brushes rotating in the reverse direction of the saws; and others have substituted for the rotating more brushes stationary brushes, through which the saws carry the fibres to be stripped of the notes and other impure ties. The objection to these methods is, that the more brushes act on the fibres whenheldbythe teeth of the saws only; and, therefore, instead of separating the -notes and other impure ties from the fibres to which they adhere sometimes with considerable force the fibres are drawn out with the. 65 notes, thus occasioning a considerable <a name="loss9"><mark>loss</mark></a> of cotton. The object of my improvement is' to avoid this <a name="loss10"><mark>loss</mark></a>, which I effect by so placing a permanent brush that it shall hold on to the notes or other impure ties as the fibres are stripped from the saws by the stripping brush, the fibres being under the operation of the two brushes at the same time. The more brush has the effect also of more effectually stopping the current of air genera ted by the rotation of the stripping brush from acting on the fibres before they are cleaned, than if located at a greater distance from the point of action of the stripping brush. The improvements secured by the second above mentioned patent appear to be of great importance to the cotton growing portion of the community. It is impossible immediately to determine what may be developed by experiments long conducted upon an extensive scale; but, so far as appearances may be relied upon, the improvements now under consideration are among the most valuable which have been made upon the cotton gin since the days of Whitney. The following extracts from the patent are sufficient to convey a sufficiently clear view of the nature of the invention: "the ginning of cotton with the saw gin has for a long time been attended with much difficulty from the very nature of the fibre, its condition in the god, and the operation of the instruments employed to separate the fibres from the seeds, to which they adhere with more or less tenacity according to the quality. These difficulties have led to many modifications of the gin, with the view to remedy the evils, but so far little improvement has been made in that most valuable of all modern inventions. The fibres are united to and surround the seed, forming ponds, which contain notes, particles of dead leaves, and other foreign matter very injurious to the gin, and particularly to the staple when passing through the gin, with the fibres; and the tenacity with which the fibres adhere to the seed, and to each other, renders it very difficult to separate them without either cutting or breaking, them, or otherwise injuring them by abrasion. When the fibres are not properly loosened, preparatory to their being drawn through between the ribs by the saws, they are liable to coil around the upper part of the ribs, and are there cut by the saws, and choke the operation of the machine. Again, after the fibres have been properly separated from the seeds, much difficulty has attended the removal of them from the teeth of the saws by the rotating brush, which, by the action of currents of air drawn on both sides of the gin by the rotation of the brush, force the fibres towards and c log in the middle, so that the action of the brush fails to act equally in removing them from the saws and from the bristled and at no time does the brush comb out the fibres, and separate from them the foreign matter, which is always found with cotton in great quantities The object of my improvements is to avoid these serious evils; first, by combining with the saws and ribs a rotating cleaner, consisting of one or two harbors placed parallel with each other, and provided with pins projecting therefrom radially and- playing between each other and between permanent teeth, so that by their rotation they act on the ponds of cotton, loose n the fibres and separate from them notes and other impure ties, which fall through the grated bottom of the hop per. From this cleaner the cotton falls on to the saws and is acted upon by the teeth; but if the ponds are not sufficiently loosened, they are carried up and again acted upon by the cleaner, and thence again fall on to the saws. In this way 566 the ponds are not only freed from all impure ties, but the fibres are sufficiently loosened to be separated from the seeds without injury to the staple or the liability of breaking the seeds, the particles of which, when carried through by the saws, are very injurious to the staple. Second, in making the upper surface of the ribs or grates between the saws without a double bevelled surface, with a series of transverse projecting ridges from the bottom to the top, and also in having their lower ends attached to a hanged frame which rests on springs, the effect of which is that, as the ponds are carried up from the bottom of the hop per, they strike against the projecting ridges or teeth, which causes them to roll up, at the same time giving to the ribs, in consequence of their spring attachment, a tremulous motion that greatly facilitates the action of the saw teeth on the fibres, as the ponds are thus carried towards and from the teeth, which have the action of combs to loose n the fibres. Third, in providing brushes below the rotating brushes and placed parallel with the axis thereof, and slightly inclined in the direction of the rotation, for the purpose of combing or brushing the fibres which are caught by the stationary brushes and acted upon by the rotating ones; and when properly brushed, and the notes and other impure ties separated from them and discharged through a grating below, are liberated from these stationary brushes and delivered in the usual manner. And fourth, in providing the ends with spiral fans, which draw in a current of air from each end and force it out by centrifugal action equally from end to end of the saw cylinder, to liberate the fibres from the brushes, and to generate an outward current to carry off the notes and other impure ties below the stationary brushes and the concave, on to which the cleaned and brushed fibres are delivered The foregoing extracts will enable those familiar with ginning cotton to judge of the character of the improvements. Fool carding Three patents have been granted for improvements it, machinery for carding wool. In the ordinary carding engine the wool is fed to the carding cylinder on one side, and is carried by it over to the opposite side, and in its passage it is constantly operated upon by cards or toothed cylinders to complete the carding. In the side of the engine, opposite to the leaders, are placed d offers, for removing the wool from the cylinder. One of the machines patented this year receives the wool from the feed rollers, and instead of carrying it over to the opposite side it carries it under, and an entire revolution of the carding cylinder, subjecting it constantly to the action of strippers and workers, or to cards, and in ally delivering it to the d offers directly over the point where it was received. Another of these machines receives the wool in the usual way, subjecting it, as it is carried over, to strippers and cleaners; and on the opposite side are placed two d offers, the one above the other. Beyond is another carding engine. The first or upper d offer partially strips the first cylinder and communicates directly with the second cylinder; the second doffercompletes the stripping of the first cylinder, but does not directly communicate with the second cylinder. Between the two d offers is a strip per, which strips both d offers and carries the wool to the second cylinder which carries the wool over and subjects it :to a second 'adding process i the ~s sal way; after which the cylinder is subjected to twoddofferscid127havingsegmst :strips of: teeth u and equal segments without teeth extending length wise of the d offers, and these segments having such relative pot. positions that the strips of wool left by the first d offer upon the cylinder will be removed by the second. The machine possesses merits which will be appreciated by the manufacturer, but to which I have not time to allude. The third machine above mentioned is intended to card wool upon the same principle with the old fashion of hand carding, and is said to possess great merit; it certainly possesses the merit of simplicity, and there are but few obvious defects. The inventor stretches two or more endless belts of ordinary cards each upon two driving and distending rollers ; the faces of these cards are placed in contact with each other, and with then t both so bent as to work together; supports are placed behind the belts i a such manner as to keep their whole faces in contact. The wool is fed to one of them in the usual way, and the belts set in motion by their rollers. Thus the wool is carded over any extent of surface that may be preferred. The doffing is effected in any convenient way. But I must hasten to another branch of this class. Papertwo patents have been granted this year connected with the manufacture of paper, but they do not possess that kind or degree of novelty which calls for notice in this place. Cotton battingOne patent has been granted this year for improvements in the manufacture of this fabric, but it was examined in 1845, and was noticed in my last report. To new applications have since been made. Manufacture of hats Three patents have been granted this year for improvements in machinery for making hat bodies. One of the patentees combined the old bow string, worked by machinery, to throw the fibres upon a perforated revolving cone, with an exhausting fan below. The merits of this improvement will be readily understood. Another of these machines possesses much novelty, and produces work of a very perfect character, and with great expedition. It is perhaps the first machine which succeeded in forming the hat body upon the perforated cone in a uniformly satisfactory manner, and is worthy of particular notice. It will be understood by the following extract from the patent: "I t has long been essayed to make hat bodies by throwing the fibres of fur, wool, &c, by brush or picked cylinder, on to a perforated cone, exhausted by a fan below to carry and hold the fibres thereon by the currents of air that rush from all directions towards and through the apertures of the cone i and thus form a bat of fibres ready for hardening and felting ; but, from various causes, all these attempts have failed. I have, however, so improved this machine in various important particulars, as to remove all the objections, as proved by the test of experiment. 14 y improvements consist in feeding the fur, (called the stock) after it has been picked, to a rotating brush between two endless belts of cloth, one above the other, the lower one horizontal and the upper inclined, to gradually compress the fur had grip e it more effectually where it is presented to the action of the rotating brush, which, moving at a great velocity, throws it in a chamber or tunnel which" is gradually changed in form towards the outlet, where it assumes a shape nearly corresponding to a vertical section passing through the axis of the cone, but narrower, for the purpose of concentrating and directing the fur thrown by the brush on to the cone this causing being provided with an aperture immediately under the brush, through which a current of air enters, in consequence of the rotation of the brush and the exhaustion of the cone, for the purpose of more effect us 68 ally directing the fibres towards the cone which is placed just in front of the delivery aperture of the chamber or tunnel, which aperture is provided at top with a bonnet or hood hinged thereto, and at the bottom with a hinged flap to regulate the deposit e of the fibres on the cone or other former, with a view to distribute the thickness of the bat wherever more is required to give additional strength, as the fibres are only held to and on the cone by the pressure of the surrounding air in consequence of the exhaustion of the cone or former. Preparatory to the suspension of this pressure, some means must be adopted of holding and retaining the fibres composing the bat; and it is obvious that this delicate web thus formed has not sufficient tenacity to admit of moving it from the cone or former before the hardening process; and, therefore, my invention also consists in covering the bat, before it is removed from the cone or former, with felted or fulled cloth, and then employing one or two perforated metallic cone s-one to put over the bat after it has been surrounded with the moist felt or cloth, for the purpose of making pressure on the fibres, and to admit of the circulation of hot water where the whole is immersed therein to hard en the bat preparatory to felting, and the other to be placed within the perforated metallic cone on which the bat has been formed, and which is necessarily thin and weak for the purpose of resisting the pressure of the surrounding water consequent upon a partial vacuum produced within, when the whole is withdrawn from the water Letters patent have also been granted for a modification of the chamber through which the fur is thrown or blown up on the perforated cone. Two vertical partitions are placed in it longitudinally, in such a manner as to be adjustable; and by changing their relative positions, the fur is more or less concentrated upon particular points of the cone, as circumstances may require. Spinningseven patents have been granted this year for improvements in this branch of fibrous manufacture, some of which are of great importance. In my last report I had occasion to notice an ingenious and valuable improvement in the mode of depositing moving in cans. Letters patent have since been granted for an improvement upon this invention, which renders it capable of greater variety and perfection of operation. Letters patent have also been granted for an improvement which is applicable to most kinds of spinning machinery. As the moving is fed to the flyer or other device for spinning, it is well known that some of the fibres will extend out from the moving, and thus partially escape the proper twist, and render the thread less perfect. To obviate this inconvenience, each moving is caused to pass over a better, revolving in a direction opposite to the motion of the moving, which lays the protruding fibres, or removes them. The cap sinner has also been modified by giving the motion of the traverse rail to the cap, to avoid the unequal action of the band upon the bob bin waves, which would result from the motion of thtbobbin. In spinning, even ness of the thread is a matter of primary importance ;and when the thread is spun from moving which is regularly fed, if the moving be uneven, the thread will inevitably be uneven also. To secure the necessary equality in the moving many devices have already been resorted to. Within the year letters patent have been granted for a self regulating combination for the accomplishment of this object, which is well worthy of notice. I to character will be understood by reference to the following extract from the patent The nature of our invention consists in making each section of the first or back set of rollers conical, that the supply of cotton, &c, to the other rollers may be more or less to increase or decrease .the draught on the fibres, and thus regulate the size of the yarn; and also in combining with this guides, connected with the condensing tube, which is on the upper end of a vibrating arm, the connexion between the guides and arm of the condensing tube being made by means of levers, so arranged that when the yarn is too large and binds, the tube shall be drawn towards the calendar rollers, which operate the guides to carry the hoping towards the smaller diameter of the circuit rollers to diminish the supply; and when it is small, to permit it to be drawn back by a weight or spring to move the guides back towards the large diameter of the rollers Letters patent have been granted this year for an improved self acting mule, differing widely from those which have heretofore been in use, and evincing a degree of ingenuity and skill rarely found or required in any branch of fibrous or textile manufactures. :the operations necessary in the self acting mule are so various, and require such multiplicity and complexity of parts, that any description or representation would fail to render it generally intelligible. The following extracts from the patent, however present the characteristics of the machine with clearness, precision, and force, and will be sufficient to convey to those acquainted with mule spinning an outline of the invention: " The motions of the mule may be divided into three series, which are sub divided in the action of the apparatus. The first series consists in the drawing out of the carriage, the revolving of the draw rollers, and the whirling of the spindles, by means of which series of motions the rovingsare drawn out and the threads spun and twisted. The second series consists of backing off, as it is termed ; that is, turning the spindles the reverse direction, to un coil the threads from the points of the spindles to the corps, and turning down or depressing the front faller; at the same time, to place all the parts in a proper condition for the third series of motions, which consists of putting or running in the carriage, winding on the yarn or threads, by giving a varying motion to the spindles corresponding to the form and size of the cops, and operating the faller to give the proper shape to the cops." The first series of motions is regular. The carriage is drawn out by a regular motion, effected by a train of wheels from the driving pulley to a line shaft, which carries endless chains connected with the carriage at different parts of its length to insure steaminess of motion. Durirlg this, the draw rollers are rotated to give out the staple as it is spun by another train of wheels, deriving motion from the same source as the preceding, and in man per substantially similar to other mules; and, at the same time, the spindles are Whirled or rotated by a band, receiving motion from a pulley on the shaft of the driving pulley, as in other mules. This completes the first series of motions, in which I claim nothing new." At the end of the first series of motions, the threads that have been spun are coiled on the spindles from the cops to their points; it is therefore necessary to un coil them, (called backing) preparatory to winding on, and at the same time to depress the front faller, to place it 'in a proper position for winding on. The second series of motions effects these purposes, and the various parts of the mechanism are put in a proper condition to effect this by the momentum of the moving parts at the end of the first series of motions. This constitutes the first part of my invention. As the carriage, approaches the end of the out motion, the driving belt is shifted from the first driving pulley to a loose pulley by the side of it, to permit the momentum of the moving parts to complete the movements and so soon as these are accomplished, a balance weight is carried beyond the vertical line, and falls over, which shifts the belt from the loose pulley to a second fast pulley on the same shaft with the others; at the same time, the trains of wheels that operate the carriage and the draw rollers are liberated by the shifting of a clutch, and at the same time a friction clutch is brought into action, thereby connecting the band that drives the spindles with a sliding rack, (called the 'top sliding rack) which, in consequence of this connexion, is carried by the momentum of the spindles sufficiently far in one direction to give by its return the required motion to the spindles in the reverse direction, to un coil the threads from the upper part of the spindles. Whilst the rack is thus moved, the second fast pulley sets in motion, by a train of wheels, a crank pin that works in a slot in a connecting rod, and this crank pin, when set in motion, is a little below a line passing through the connecting. rod and the axis of motion, so that the crank pin moves a short distance before it begins to move the connecting rod; this period of time is sufficient to permit the momentum of the spindles (as above stated) to draw the sliding rack to the distance required, to be in a condition, by its return movement, to give the ' backing off' motion to the spindles. The crank pin, then, in making a semi revolution, carries the connecting rod with it; and this being in connexion with the lever of a rock shaft, provided with a toothed pulley, around which passes a chain attached to the end of the sliding rack, draws it (the rack) for a short distance in a reverse direction, and thus causes it to give the backing off motion to the spindles, to un coil the threads, at the same time depressing the front faller to bring the threads in a proper position for winding on; this latter being effected by having one end of the shape r or coping rail jointed to a lever on the rock shaft above mentioned. The chain attached to the rack, and which communicates motion to it, is kept tight by being passed over a pulley and having a weight suspended to it. When the top sliding rack is carried forward by the momentum of the spindles, at the end of the first series of motions it is gradually arrested, and with it the spindles, by means of a spring brake of a peculiar construction, viz : In the rock shaft there is a bent lever, to one end of which is connected a he local spring, also attached to an arm jointed to the other end of the bent lever; and by the side of and attacked to the toothed wheel, around which passes the chain on the end of the sliding rack, and which turns freely on the rock shaft, there is a hatchet wheel, and by the side of it a camp late provided with a hand or catch, by means of which the hatchet and toothed wheels are carried around, when the camp late is carried around, by the action of the spring brake on the can form of its periphery. And when this has been carried far enough round, the catch is liberated, to permit the return of the parts, ty means of an arm or, lever jointed to one end of the bent lever, which is made to lift the catch from the teeth of the hatchet wheel. As the cop s increase in diameter, it is evident that the backing off motion must be diminished, and this is effected by making the connecting rod above mentioned in two parts, the first connected by one end (as above stated with the crank pin which actuated it, and which works in: a sot a to give. 7LmotiQn to the rod in one direction only, (the crank being then at liberty to turn without imparting any motion longitudinally to the rod) and the, other end being jointed to a curved arm, that vibrated on a steel pin, and the other part of the connecting rod is jointed to the arm of the rock shaft, and to a slide that works in a curved groove in the vibrating arm, so that as this slide is moved from or towards the axis of motion of the arm, the rock shaft will be vibrated more or less; and this slide is moved in or out by being in connexion with the mechanism that operates the motions of the coping rail, and which, therefore, will be described under the third series. At the end of the backing off motion, the vibrating arm of the connecting rod is hooked and held by a catch until the carriage is run up, and then liberated to permit the parts to resume their appropriate positions preparatory to a repetition of the operations. It the end of the second series of motions the third series of motions commences, and these constitute the second part of my invention. The carriage is run in by a crank motion, which has the effect to gradually start it from a state of rest and accelerate its motion to the middle of its course, and then gradually diminish its motion until it is brought to a state of rest; thus avoiding all tendency to break the threads consequent upon all sudden motions. This is effected in the following manner, viz :when the shipping lever is operated at the end of the first series of motions, a clutch on a shaft carried by a second fast fully is shifted; and as this clutch has but one tooth he, the shaft is thereby permitted to make part of a revolution, during which the second series of operations takes place before it (the clutch) begins to act, and then it communicates motion to a large cog wheel provided with a crank pin, that actuated a connecting rod jointed, to a rack, (below the top sliding rack above described) the teeth of which take into the teeth of a opinion on the shaft of one of the train of wheels that communicates motion to the carriage, thereby imparting the desired movement. The winding on of the yarn during the running in of the carriage is effected by the top sliding rack, which for this purpose is carried by the rack just described, by means of such connexions as admit of modifying the motions of the top sliding rack, which drives the spindles in winding on. Motion is communicated from the bottom to the top rack in the following manner: In the end of the lower rack, and by the side of it, there is a stud pin on which turns a stroll can, and to that part of its periphery which is nearest the axis is attached one end of a chain, which passes from thence around a roller that turns on a stud pin at the side of the lower rack, and is then carried back and attached by a short arm to the top sliding rack, so that when the lower rack slides, the top rack will move with it, provided the stroll can remains immovable on its axis; but the motion of the top rack, during each operation, must have a motion accelerated relatively to that of the lower rack, to increase the rotation of the spindles as the threads are wound round on a gradually diminishing diameter of the conical form of the cops. This is effected by causing the stroll can to turn on its axis during the motion of the rack, by having a wheel attached to and turning with it, to the periphery of which is attached one end of a chain that passes round it, and is attached by the other end to another part of the machine, so that if this part of the attachment remains fixed, a regular accelerated motion will l be given to the top rack relatively to the motion of the lower rack, and necessarily the spindles will have their rotation accelerated relatively 7 to the motion of the carriage. These relative motions of the two racks, as described, are such as are required after the base of the cops has been formed, for then the threads are wound regularly on a cone; but in forming the base of the cops the first winding is on the naked spindles, at which time the motion of the spindles should correspond with that of the carriage; and from the commencement until the base is formed, the accelerated motion should be gradually brought into play to give the conical form to the cops. This is effected by having the chain that winds on the wheel that turns with the stroll can attached to a slide that works on a screw in a vibrating arm, the outer end of which is jointed to another arm of equal length that turns on the end of the stud on which the scrollcam and wheel turn, so that when the slide is at the lower end of the arm the two arms being of equal length the motion of the wheel with the rack will not cause it to wind up the chain, but, as the slide is drawn up towards the axis of vibration of the arm, one end of the chain will necessarily move through a less space than the other, and thus cause the wheel with the stroll can attached thereto to turn on its axis, and thus to vary the motion of the top rack, and thereby adapt the motion of the spindles to the varying diameter of the base of the cops. The screw in the vibrating arm that carries this slide is in connexion, by means of appropriate cogwheels, with a horizontal hatchet wheel, which is free to move when the arm vibrated in one direction, but held by the hand or catch when the arm vibrated in the reverse direction, for the purpose of turning the screw to move the slide; and this hand or catch is governed by an apparatus called a butterfly, which is acted upon by an arm from the counter faller when the tension of the threads is too great, and thus throws the hand into the teeth of the wheel, that the vibration of the arm shall operate the slide, the hand or catch being disengaged at each running out of the carriage. The last of the third series of motions is the operation of the coping rail for operating the faller, which, being essentially similar to others, needs no special notice here." At the end of the running in motion of the carriage, a pin, on an army projecting from the shaft of the crank that operates the under rack, liberates the catch that holds the connecting rod, by which the backing off motion is effected; and so soon as it is liberated, the weight of the machinery attached draws it back; and to prevent any sudden jar by this operation the crank pin which operates the connecting rod in one direction is so governed in its revolutions as to be nearly a semi revolution from its point of departure at the commencement of the backing off operation, so that the force required for carrying it back to this position is sufficient to ease off the motion of the returning parts. This crank pin is held in the position just indicated by a brake within the second fast pulley, and this brake is connected, by a joint link and lever, with the arm of the connecting rod of the backing off apparatus, which, when drawn back, forces the brake in contact with the pulley, and arrests the train of wheels and this crank pin in their appropriate place." When finishing the cops, it is important to wind the threads on tight at the point, particularly as the upper ends of the spindles are tapering. This is effected by forming the connexion between the chain and the end of the top sliding rack by means of a vibrating frame, from which projects another arm that has a chain jointed to it extending to and winding on a harbor, which harbor has a hatchet wheel on it, which is carried a part of a
73revolution at each operation of the mule by a hand on the arm of the connecting rod of the backing off motion; and this auxiliary chain is of such length that it continues to be wound upon the harbor without affecting the operations of any part of the machinery until the cops are nearly completed, and then it becomes so short as to be brought in contact with a permanent arm towards the end of the winding on operation; and when thus brought in contact with this arm, it suddenly shortens the chain that forms the connexion between the two racks, and necessarily increases the rotation of the spindles, which, as a necessary consequence, draws the threads tighter on the spindles t is gratifying to look upon this machine as the invention of one of our own citizens, and to compare it with any machine for a similar purpose of trans atlantic origin. Cordagethree patents have been granted this year for improvements in this branch of manufacture. One of these patents is for an improvement in spinning hemp. In this machine neither the bob bin nor fly er has an end motion, but the thread is distributed on the bob bin by a travelling guide on one arm of the flyer. It will be perceived that, with this arrangement, when the guide is moving in the same direction with the thread, a part of the thread will be held between the point of the spindle and guide, and therefore it cannot be wound upon the bob bin so fast as when the guide is returning and giving off the thread as fast as it is spun, and also the slack which it held in its forward motion. To remove the inconvenience which would otherwise exist, a self acting brake, whose action is intermittent, is applied to the bob bin to retard its motion when the guide moves forward, and to allow freedom of motion as it returns. A machine for rope making, which evinces considerable ingenuity, has also been patented. The machine is complicated, and the novelty consists in a combination of details, which would not be understood without drawings and a minute description. Letters patent have also been granted for an improved wire rope. The article is very flexible and beautiful, and of great strength. The following claim, extracted from the patent, is sufficient for an understanding of its peculiarities: " First, forming each strand by winding wires spirally around a flexible core without twisting the wires, and forming the rope by winding of such, strands in the same manner around a similar core, the core of the strand being about equal in size to the wires; so that every wire in the spiral of each strand shall be laid e qui distant from the centre of such strand, and every strand e qui distant from the centre of the rope." Secondly, a method of inserting a fresh wire or wires, or a fresh strand or strands, into the rope made as above, when six wires are used in making the strand, or six strands used in making the rope leaving- Fifteen patents have been granted this year for improvements in looms, many of which possess much novelty and importance, and two for novel fabrics. One of these fabrics is a peculiar kind of getting, which would not be understood without a drawing, and the other isa material for skirts, having shivers of un twisted si sal hemp woven in at intervals with the filling; its object is obvious. Two patents have been granted for getting looms, upon which fish nets and other similar fabrics are woven. In the net woven by these looms, the weavers or fishermans knot is tied to join the meshes. One of these 74 machines is operated principally by hand, but the other operates by poweroThe last mentioned machine is believed to be the first operated by power exclusively, which produced? getting by tying the weavers: knot. It possesses: much important novelty, and the ingenuity manifest in its construction is highly honorable to the inventor ; but it is impossible to convey an adequate idea of it by any description I could here present. An old and well known patent for a loom for weaving coach lace, Brusselscarpeting, &c, has been re issued. It has long been in successful operation, and is well known to weavers. Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in rivet ting pickets. The improvement is a simple one, but seems to possess an importance which entitles it to notice. The following extract will be sufficient on this subject: " The great strain to which the pickets of looms made of raw hide are subjected in driving the scuttle, renders it indispensable that the parts constituting the stem should be united by rivets passing through the stem at its junction with the bow, and in the curve formed by the bending of the hide at that point. When the common rivet is employed for this purpose it cannot be carried sufficiently into the curve of the bow, and by leaving too much space between it and the bow the picked soon yields to the strain of the blows and becomes worthless ; and besides this, that part of the head towards the bow cuts into the hide at the curve, which breaks off small particles of hide, that are by the violence of the blow scattered in all directions, and by the direction of the blow carried towards and woven in the web. These particles are so small as to escape the attention of the weaver, and, in the weaving of cloths intended for printing, the passage of these between the printing rollers destroys their delicate surfaces, which can only be replaced at great cost: To avoid these and other serious inconveniences, pickets have been united by substituting for the common rivet a piece of wire, both ends of which are bent over in the manner of a clinch; but although this avoids the inconvenience of breaking off small pieces of raw hide, it does not give the requisite strength, for on examination it will be seen that when the picked strikes the scuttle the strain tends to open the stem; and as the upper end of the stem is secured by a rivet, the only force required to open the picked at the junction of the bow and stem is slightly to bend the clinch rivet, which readily and with little force assumes a curve, and in so doing breaks off small particles of iron, which are woven into the cloth and do more injury even than the small particles of raw hide." The object of my improvement is to avoid this as well as the other objection, which I effect by making the rivet used at the junction of the bow and stem with heads on one side only, the thank on the side opposite the heads being straight, instead of forming a curve as in the clinch. By this form of rivet the heads take the form of the curve at the junction of the bow and stem, the head less side being towards the bow, which admits of putting in the rivet nearer thereto; and as the tendency to open the picked under the strain is in the direction of a curved line, which has for its centre the middle of the rivet at the end, the angle on the head less side constitutes a head to resist the opening of the picked; for if the thank of the rivet is imagined to be in the direction of a curved line, it will be seen that the angle constitutes a head to such a thank; hence, so long as the end of i the stem be held together by a rivet, or by any equivalent
75therefor, making the rivet with the heads on one side only will fully answer the purpose of riveting with the heads all around, at the same time avoiding all the inconvenience arising from the use of the old rivet was well as the clinch Letters patent have also been granted for an improvement in weavers harness. A great deal of ingenuity has been exercised upon he doles, and many improvements have been made; but, notwithstanding their apparent simplicity, none have been in use which appear for all purposes to give entire satisfaction, particularly in weaving very fine fabrics. The meddle used in the harness above mentioned is made in the following manner Six threads are braided together until the point is reached at which the loop is to be made. The strands are then divided into two parts of three each, and braided separately the length of the required loop; they are then all braided together again, the length required for the meddle. The process is simple; the work may be done by machinery; and apparently a very excellent article is produced. There several scuttle boxes are used, a difficulty frequently arises in changing the boxes from the hanging of the scuttle to the picked. After the picked has been used for a length of time the steel points of the scuttle penetrate it, and when the scuttle is sent home the point frequently remains in the perforation in the picked; and as the picked is stationary, while the scuttle box with the scuttle rises or falls, there is great danger of breaking the boxes. A device has been patented this year whose object is to remedy this inconvenience, and consists simply in giving such form to the pickercam as to cause the picked to .move forward a short distance immediately after the scuttle is sent home, which carries the scuttle forward out of the way, and to retire to the proper position for allowing the boxes to be changed immediately. The remedy is simple and appears effectual, and the inconvenience it obviates is very considerable. A patent granted, several years ago, for the conservation of power and prevention of shocks in throwing and stopping the scuttle, has this year been surrendered and re issued. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in looms for weaving in grain carpeting and other fabrics where a great number of colors are used. The chief characteristic of this loom is arranging the parts in such a manner as to accommodate and operate four sets of scuttle boxes. The machine is too complicated to be understood from any description I might here give. I will, however, present it so far as its general characteristics are given in the following preamble extracted from the patent: " The nature of my improvements in machinery for weaving two or three ply in grain carpets consists, first, in the manner in which I construct and combine the came for operating the lay, so as to give to it a vibratory intermittent motion. Second, in the manner in which I combine and operate four sets or series of scuttle boxes, said four sets or series being so arranged as to enable me to operate two of said sets or series only or the four together, as the fabric to be woven may require; the number of scuttle boxes in each set or series being varied at pleasure Third, in the combination or organization of mechanism for raising and lowering certain of the aforesaid series of scuttle boxes, in the manner required to produce any given pattern or figure to be wrought. Fourth, in a certain combination or new organization of mechanism for operating the76
picker staffs or levers, by which the several scuttles are thrown in the order required. Fifth, in a certain peculiar mechanism or combination of parts, by which I am enabled to arrest the operation of the loom whenever the scuttle is thrown and does not properly enter the scuttle box intended to receive it. Sixth, in certain movable or turning guide plates applied to certain parts of the loom frame, in order to prevent accidents from occurring to the loom or a scuttle whenever the latter projects from a shuttleboxAn improvement has been patented this year in looms for weaving t willed goods, whose simplicity and importance entitle it to notice. The following extract from the patent renders it unnecessary for me to describe it: "I n weaving t willed fabrics it is known that the sets of harness have to be shifted in succession, whether consisting of three or more, commencing with the first, the second, then the third, &c, and back again to the first; this has generally been done by a series of came, one forcedtreddle requiring the can shaft to move very slowly, and rendering an additional can shaft necessary either for the harness came or the shuttlecams. To obviate this, I make the harness came to slide end wise on the shaft, and provide them each with a cylindrical hut, the periphery of which has as many grooves cut in it as there are tread les to be worked by it in succession; these grooves run in the direction of the circumference nearly the whole circuit, but towards the end the first takes a diagonal direction and runs into the second, and in like manner the second runs into the third, and the third then crosses the second and runs into the first, the inclination of the groove uniting the third and first and crossing the second being greater than that which unites the first and second and the second and third. These grooves receive a feather, which turns on a stud pin projecting from the frame, so that as the can shaft rotated (supposing the feather, to be in the first groove) the first groove runs on the feather, and when it becomes diagonal to run into the second the feather turns on the stud and runs into the second groove, thereby shifting the can to the second t meddle. In like manner it is shifted to the third and then back to the first, the ends of the turning feather being rounded to prevent catching on the billets between the grooves, where the third groove crosses the second to run into the first Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in the jacquard, which is entitled to particular notice. As the whole duty of arranging the warp for the production of the figure devolves upon this auxiliary to the loom, the endless variety of its operations naturally introduces great complexity, and corresponding liability to derangements. These evils should be guarded against with a watch fulness ever upon the alert; and, to obviate them without impairing the versa utility of the jacquard, the inventor of these improvements has successfully exercised his ingenuity. Fortunately, the following extract from the patent will shed sufficient light upon the invention to enable the weaver to understand its distinctive features' In the jacquard frame, as heretofore made and now used, the trap boards through which the tail cords pass, and by which they are lifted, are each operated by separate levers, thus requiring as many levers and separate operations as there are trap boards; and in the mode of mounting to form the harness as at present practised, each division of the tail cords all that pass through one trap board I will call a division) is in con next. 77 on with one color only, (it will be understood that when I speak of one color only, I mean also the threads connected with the mails of one pair of lifteds) and that, as a necessary consequence, when the threads of one color (or combination of colors in a pair of lifteds) are to be used to inter weave the picks, the cards must be shifted and a new card presented for each pick' The object of my improvement is to simplify the structure and operation; first, by connecting all the trap boards, by horizontal slides, with a vertically sliding frame, operated by one single lever, so that all the trap boards are lifted together, the lifting of the tail cords being governed by the sliding of the trap boards, that are provided with notched holes through which the cords pass, so that when the trap boards are shifted (which is done by came on a rotating shaft turned by the sliding of the trap board f rams, or any other in permitting movement) the knots on the tail cords, which have been shifted by the needles, are caught and lifted; and, secondly, by connecting the tail cords that pass through one trap board with the mails on two different pairs of levers, so that the mails of each lifted of one color, or one set of colors, are connected with two trap boards, and so of the other colors. The advantage of this arrangement is, that one card only is required for each lash, as the inter weaving of one color can be effected by one card, in consequence of the connexion of the mails of each lifted of one color, each with two separate trap boards, while, by the old plan, it is necessary to shift the needles to inter weave the same color, as the shifting of the threads of one color can only be done by shifting the needles by a change of cards, in consequence of the connexion of all the mails of one color or set of colors with one trap board must here close my remarks upon looms and upon machinery for the manufacture of fibrous and textile fabrics, with sincere regret that the complicated character of the machinery has in many instances preclude the possibility of doing justice to valuable interesting and beautiful inventions, highly honorable to the inventors, and full of promise of future important developments. Of Of Arms And I Mplements Of War. In this class but one patent has been granted within the year, and that was for improvements in the machinery for welding wrought iron or steel cannon. The sections to be welded are prepared in the form of rings, which are welded in a matrix, and around a core, by a piston operated by a hydraulic press. When the welding has progressed the length of the matrix, that portion of the gun which is already welded is removed, and states, properly prepared, are placed around the interior of the matrix, reducing its diameter sufficiently to adapt it to the next section of the gun. The welding then goes on as before until the second section is formed, when the matrix is again reduced as before to adapt it to the third section, and these operations are continued until the welding is finished. As the interior of the matrix is the f rust rum of a cone, it is readily perceived that the states may have such relative proportions of length and thickness as to preserve the proper taper of the exterior of the gun. There are many details of the parts and operations given by the inventor which, in this place, are unnecessary. The ordinary mode of giving the welding heat appears to be adopted78
by the inventor; and the injury which the iron is liable to sustain in heating is in no way guarded against. There are doubtless great obstacles in the way of welding large masses of iron or steel, independent of those which arise from injury in heating, some of which are removed by the inventor; but this is not enough to insure the safety of large wrought iron guns; and until the quality of the masses to be joined can be depended upon, no process of welding can give security. Each imperfect ion in a wrought iron gun is increased by every strain by every discharge and a gun which might be safe in ordinary use might be rendered un safe by the very trials which are resorted to for proving it. The fact that a wrought iron gun has sustained the shock of heavy and repeated charges is often the very reason why it will never resist another. It is a perfectly well established fact that wrought iron, by repeated jars or strains, ceases to be fibrous, and becomes crystal line; and a bar of the best wrought iron may be subjected to tension until, when struck by a hammer, it will fly into small pieces. It is often observed in chain cables that those which have resisted the severe st trials are broken by an inconsiderable strain, and the fracture is crystal line. I f, therefore, in welding, success is perfect, the iron will constantly deteriorate by the strains incident to discharges until its strength is destroyed, and it bursts after repeated trials have won for it un wavering confidence. Among others, there is this important difference between cast and wrought iron powerful shocks cause wrought iron to deteriorate, while cast iron, under similar circumstances, remains substantially the same or breaks. A shock, therefore, which cast iron has once resisted, it will probably resist again; but when the strain is great upon wrought iron, it probably will not resist the same strain again; and the gun which has resisted the severe st trials is perhaps the least likely to be safe. Navi  Gati Of And Mari Of I Mplements. But few improvements belonging to this class have been: patented within the year. Ships and boats Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in the patches of ships. With all the precaution which can be ,used, water will sometimes in situate itself under the hat ch. The object of the inventor is not to prevent this, but to discharge the water which accumulates around the hat ch upon the deck. To effect this the groove into which the bed on the hat ch fits is made to communicate with several holes through the curb or hat ch frame, opening on the outside. I f, then, the water gets under the edge of the hat ch, and into the groove, it will immediately be discharged through the above mentioned holes upon the deck. To prevent the entrance of water through these perforations, each is furnished with a valve opening outward only. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in portable boats. The frame of the boat consists of four hollow I india rubber cylinders, connected together in a rectangular form. When used the cylinders are inflated with air, and a strong water tight cloth is placed under them, its edges being brought up over the cylinders, and fastened in some convenient way. When the cylinders are not inflated, the boat can be folded for transportation in any desirable way. Steeringan improvement has this year been patented in machinery for steering vessels, which is important in preventing such sudden jerks. 79 upon the steering apparatus as are occasioned by the slack of the tiller rope. The improvement will be understood by reference to the following extract from the patent: "the nature of our invention consists in the employment of two groove rollers, mounted in appropriate bearings, one above the other, on the helm, the upper one being on the shaft of the tiller wheel, and mounting the tiller rope, by first attaching one end of it to one side of and near the extremity of the helm, passing it through a block attached to the side of the vessel; then through a block attached to the same side of the helm; then over the upper drum, and in the first groove; then under the lower drum then around the upper drum, and in the second groove; then around the lower drum, in the second groove, and so on to the end, each time crossing the rope, to insure the right thereof; and then from the upper drum to a block attached to the side of the helm, and just opposite to the attachment of the rope on the other side; and thence carrying the rope through a block at the side of the vessel; and then tying the end to the helm, at a point just opposite the block on the other side, so that by this arrangement of the grooved drums, and the disposition of the tiller rope, it (the rope) is prevented from slipping and overriding, and at the same time it is prevented from making slack as the helm vibrated, for the slack is taken upon one side as fast as it is made on the other, and the rope is also prevented from chafingPropellersThe subject of pro telling, heretofore so fertile in inventions, appears within the last year to have received but little attention. But five patents have been granted for improvements in pro pellets, and comparatively few applications have been rejected. Those patented this year do not possess a commanding importance. One patent has been granted for a peculiar mode of pro telling, by discharging jets of water from the stern. The mechanism is quite ingenious, but complicated to a degree that renders it difficult to describe, without possessing the degree of usefulness which would justify the effort. As the speed of the vessel, and the velocity with which the screw prop elder revolves, require for advantageous action the floats at different times to' stand at different angles with the shaft, a mode of adjusting the angles of the floats according to circumstances has been invented and patentee within the last year. The device differs, but little from those resorted to for adjusting the wings of wind mills, to adapt them to similar variations. Will mention one other improvement in pro pellets, which has been patented. The vessel is principally proper led (according to the theory of the inventor) by any ordinary means; and his improvement consists in placing a reaction water wheel at the bow of the vessel, with its axis parallel to the feel, and so constructed as to receive the water at the centre of the wheel, and discharge it at the sides between inclined floats, so as to give a revolving motion to the water wheel, and the power of the water wheel is then communicated to the main shaft of the paddle wheel in any convenient way. The foregoing descriptions will give an idea of the character of inventions patented within the year in this department. A great improvement is still demanded in pro pellets for .sea going vessels; and it is to be hoped that skilful and judicious engineers will not dismiss the subject until the desired object is attained, and. the government is in possession of an un exception able prop elder for its steamships 8 . a. Harpoons, (cid127Scid127Two patents have been granted this year for improvements in harpoons, and one for a whale is lance. Both of the harpoonspatented have double flakes. In one of them the upper or auxiliary flakes revolve upon the thank; and after the harpoon has entered the whale, its withdrawal will be resisted by the primary and auxiliary flakes at different points, and of course its hold will be much firmer than that of the ordinary harpoon. In the other harpoon the auxiliary flakes are jointed near the thank to the ordinary flakes, with a firm support in addition to the joint pin. When the harpoon is entering the whale the auxiliary flakes lie close to the shaft; but when any draught comes upon it the flakes spread far wider than those of the ordinary harpoon, and take a much firmer hold. The lance above mentioned is constructed as follows: A hollow metallic" tube is made, capable of containing a considerable charge of powder. The point of the lance has a thank at its reverse, and fitting the muzzle of the tube. This thank has a shoulder, to prevent it from entering the muzzle too far. At the opposite end of the tube there is connected to it a smaller tube, to contain priming. When the parts are put together, the appearance of the instrument is that of a common lance. When properly prepared, and the prime r igni ted, it is thrown into the whale, and the explosion of the powder sends the point of the lance, like a ball, further into him. Nothing further has been developed at this office connected with navigation and marine implements which require particular notice. Land Conveyance. A considerable number of patents have been granted this year for improvements in this class, some of which indicate much ingenuity and possess an importance deserving notice. Wheelsfour patents have been granted this year for improvements in car and carriage wheels. In one of those wheels the improvement is in the construction of the tyre. In making the tyre a bar of steel is welded between two bars of iron, in such manner that the whole flat surface of the steel is covered. The bar thus formed is subjected to appropriate rollers, and rolled into the form of the tread and french of the car wheel. It is then bent and placed upon the wheel firmly, after which the outer surface of the wheel is turned in a lathe till the outer coating of iron, which is made as thin as possible, is removed, and the steel tread and french appear. The object of this process is easily understood. Any inconveniences arise from the ordinary mode of shrinking the tyre upon the common carriage wheel. The wheel is often burnt in such a manner as to support the tyre but badly, and the charred part of the fellows being pulverized and shaken out, allows the tyre to bend and become loose. Letters patent have been granted this year for an improved mode of attaching the tyre, which obviates the above mentioned inconveniences. The tyre, before its ends are joined, is heated barely enough to expand the iron, and is then placed around the wheel. A chain clamp is then applied outside of the tyre, and extending entirely around, with means of lightning it to any desired degree. When the tyre is thus pressed and drawn tight upon the wheel, its ends, which lap over each other and are properly chafe red, are drilled and rivet ted together. The clamp is then removed. a. 81 Another improvement in springs patented is as follows: Strong strips of the most elastic preparation of I india rubber are stretched along supports from one end of the car body to the other. These supports a replaced at short distances from each other, so that collectively they resemble a rack. Another similar rack is attached to the car body, and so located upon the I india rubber strips that the teeth fall between the supports. The effect is obvious. Upon the same car other springs for bump er scare used, wherein the elastic power of I india rubber elicited by compression is resorted to. Carriage brake spine patents have this year been granted for improvements in fixtures for arresting the progress of cars and carriages under various circumstances. The above mentioned brakes are generally self acting. One of these patented improvements consists in so arranging the parts that whenever the brake operates, the shoes will be pressed with equal force against opposite sides of the wheel, increasing the effect of the brake and preventing the injurious strain upon the axles always experienced when the brake is applied to but one side of the wheel. Self acting brakes have heretofore always been found inconvenient when it became necessary to run the carriage back, as the pressure on the shaft necessary for that movement brings the brakes upon the wheels and prevents them from moving. Several devices have been resorted to this year to obviate this inconvenience. They consist generally of some device for temporarily dis connecting the brakes from the shaft. It often happens that when a train of cars are furnished with self acting brakes, they operate: imperfectly, and cease to act at the time when they may be most needed. Of the locomotive comes against an obstacle the brakes will operate on all the wheels of the train so long as the cars by their momentum have a tendency to move faster than the locomotive. But if the locomotive were to be thrown off the track, and down a bank c, the brakes up sn the cars would operate only while the locomotive was resisted by the obstacle, and the wheels would be left free the moment the locomotive had overcome the resistance, when the brakes should be in powerful operation. To obviate this inconvenience an improvement has. this year been made and patented, which consists in combining with each of the series of brakes a paw l working into a hatchet, which, when the brake is forced upon the wheel, will hold it there until released by hand. The parts, however, may be so adjusted that the brake will not be set and held against the wheels by any of the ordinary and harmless concessions so frequently met with. Rakes in ordinary, wagons generally operate upon the hind wheels but as it is often necessary, for various purposes, to lengthen or shorten the reach, a corresponding modification of the connecting parts of the brake becomes indispensable. Letters patent have been granted this year for bringing the brake to bear upon the fore wheels, in such a manner as to obviate this and other inconveniences. Devices similar to brakes have this year been patented for application to sleighs. They operate, of course, upon the ground, and assist the horses in holding back, but are so constructed as to cease their operation the moment the sleigh ceases to run upon the horses. It may as- well be here mentioned that an improvement in sleighs, principally connected with the dashboard, has been patented this year. The raves are carried in front in such a form as to furnish a frame for the68
dashboard, and they are connected by a cross bar. The dashboard is then attached upon the front of the elevated raves, which allows it to be extended out each side at pleasure a matter of much importance. Defenders are then brought up in front and the ends are screwed through the dashboard to the raves, and the ends of the runners are bent over and attached through the dashboard to the cross bar above mentioned. The affair is particularly neat, compact, firm, and easy to repair. Railroad cars Great strain and consequent injury to railroad cars result from the rigid manner in which the various parts are connected. I tis evident that if the cars are so constructed that they cannot yield to the various inequalities in the road, and to such slight obstructions as are ordinarily found, every such inequality will strain and injure the cars. Any devices have been resorted to to remedy this <a name="evil5"><mark>evil</mark></a>. Letters patenthavbeen granted this year for a system of connexions for this purpose, which cannot here be fully set forth, but which consists of a perfect system t of joints upon the ball and socket principle, extending to every part to which it is applicable, and in such changes of the ordinary parts of the locomotive or car as are rendered necessary by the mode of connexion. A fuller notice of this invention cannot be given without drawings, Several patents have been granted this year for improvements in the mode of hanging the bodies of railroad cars, which are worthy of consideration: but they differ so little in the arrangement of their parts from those already in use, that their distinctive characteristics could not be understood without drawings and a detailed description. One patent has been granted for improved coup lines for cars, which I do not think it necessary to describe. Several applications connected with coup lines have been rejected within the year. The old principles appear to have been applied in all the various forms of which they are susceptible, and a new track is not yet discovered. Some years ago locomotives were furnished with six driving wheels upon parallel shafts, the wheels being of the large or ordinary size forlo0motives. These were found to be defective in turning curves, as theflatches of the wheels would over ride, the track and leave it. Even giving f the axles an end wise motion was. found to be insufficient, owing to the ease with which the wheels would run off. Letters patent have been granted i within the year for two modes of obviateing these serious difficulties, and the simplicity with which they have been removed is highly creditable to the inventor. In the first place, he ascertained that the flahchof the small car wheel did not rise upon the track with the- same facility with the french of the large wheel, a fact demonstrable in theory and proved in practice; and it was found that the difference between them in this particular was such, that substituting the small wheel with the softflapjah and tread, and a shaft having an end motion, rendered the locorittive safe from running off the track. But the large wheel for locomotives was everywhere in use, on account of the much greater speed that could be obtained by it, and it was soon ascertained that: small wheels could only answer the purpose where speed could be dispensed with. It became necessary, therefore, if possible, to obviate the difficulty and still retain the large wheel, and this important object was attained by simply chilling -the blanches. It i as found that the hard or chilled french r when, it struck, the rail, would slip downbyjthe side of it, while the soft french in -ordinary use would cling' to it, S
83override, and run off the track. The softness of the tread so useful in locomotives could be retained, and the hard french did not interfere with the draught. The wheel thus constructed, with the end motion of the axles, was found to answer the purpose; and thus an <a name="evil6"><mark>evil</mark></a>, which at first appeared almost insurmountably, was obviated by the simplest device, and almost without a sacrifice. And carriaesSeveral patents have been granted this year for improvements in carriages of various kinds, but generally they do not possess much importance. One patent has been granted for a one wheeled horse carriage, so constructed as to depend upon the horse for the preservation of its equilibrium. It is, in a word a horse wheel barrow, possessing the advantages and disadvantages of that variety of vehicle. Letters patent have recently been granted for an improvement of considerable importance in attaching horses to wagons. The <a name="evil7"><mark>evil</mark></a> experienced, and the remedy applied, are well set forth in the following extract from the patent: "the nature of my invention consists in transferring a portion of the load to the collars of horses, or the yokes of oxen, only in the act of drawing." The amount of weight to be borne by the team depends upon the degree of rise to be ascended, or the weight to be drawn. It will readily be perceived that this bearing is in proportion to the weight to be drawn, and entirely ceases (reverting back to the load) when the team ceases to draw thereby leaving them un encumbered when drawing is unnecessary. The nature of my invention consists in increasing the power of teams, whether horses or cattle, by extra weight, which gives them more firmness and ability to perform their tasks. When two horses are harnessed to a wagon or carriage, this weight is to be applied to their harness or collars consequently to them. Of cattle are used, the weight will of course be applied to their yokes; all of which is to be done by the use of the lever tongue, which operates to transfer a portion of the weight of the load to increase the he ft of the team only in the act of drawing. The steeper the hill, the more he ft the team requires, and the more the tongue presses down; as the draught decreases, the tongue lightens up. It sometimes happens that on rising hills, horses and cattle are choked down by the rising of their collars and yokes; by this improvement that difficulty is done away, as in all cases where drawing is necessary both collars and yokes are borne down, so that the throats of the team are left free to receive the air. It maybe proper here to states that no extra weight will be borne by the team, except the collars are pressed back to the strong part of the neck, which can only take place in the act of drawing. Steam And Gas Engi Nes. Seventeen patents belonging to this class have been granted this year but although the patents are more numerous, the inventions secured by them appear to be less important than those patented last year. Last year there were several patents granted that were calculated to influence radically this important agent; whereas the useful improvements developed this year belong rather to the class of refinements upon what was already known. Farnaoesone patent has been granted for improvements in boiler 84 furnaces. I to object is the more perfect combustion of the gases arising from the coal, and causing the heat to operate more directly upon the boiler. The following extract will illustrate the invention: " The nature of my invention consists in combining with the usual fireplace of a steam boiler one or more reverberatory chambers or auxiliary fire places, having air or oxygen ducts, the same being for the purpose of retaining and revolving the volatile products which escape from the burning fuel, and supplying them with a due degree of oxygen, and by so retaining and revolving them, and supplying them with oxygen, obtain a more perfect combustion of them than is generally effected by any of the common modes of erecting furnaces( As the smoke, gases, or other volatile products of combustion pass from the fireplace into the reverberatory chamber, they are retarded and revolved therein, and thrown upwards against the boiler, in consequence of the peculiar shape of the bottom of the said chamber. A portion of them will be burnt in the chamber, and the remainder or surplus will pass over the top of the box, or between it and the boiler, and will com mingle with the atmospheric air which rushes through the upper plate of the air box. The said air will supply the said surplus with the quantity of oxygen necessary to its whole or partial combustion; and owing to the peculiar inclined position of the perforated plate of the air box, the air rushing through it will impel the combustible and burning volatile gases and other products, in numerous jets or streams, upwards against the part of the boiler which is over the said plate." These streams or jets of flame, in striking against the boiler, are to a great extent deflected by it against the rear curved part of the chamber, and by it reverberated or turned downwards, and coursed back or towards the perforated plate of the air box. Thus a rotation or revolution of the gases or volatile matters is kept up in the chamber Such portion of the gases, &c, as are not consumed, pass into the next and succeeding chambers, until by being so revolved and supplied with fresh air, they become nearly, if not entirely, burnt up. By my improvement I am enabled to effect a very important saving of fuel, as most of the gases which are generally lost or pass off through the chimney are by the said improvement consumed under the boiler, and made to serve the purpose of heating it Letters patent have been granted also for a b lower for boiler furnaces. Although b lowers a few years ago were scarcely used, they have of late some to be considered of indispensable importance, and an ordinary fixture of the furnace. Their convenient application having been found to involve considerable difficulty, engineers have turned their attention to the subject; and the one patented possesses much merit, especially for its simplicity of construction and application. It will be understood from the following extract: "the fan b lowers now used in steamboats for blowing the fires in the furnaces are generally made from two to three feet in diameter, the latter being the maximum; and to obtain the required quantity and velocity of blast necessary to supply the combustion, very high ve lo cities are required nd therefore it has been necessary to resort to the use of a belt from :a large wheel, or the crank shaft of the auxiliary engine, to a small pulley on the shaft of the fan. These dimensions and ve lo cities have been the source of so much annoyance on steamboats, as almost to counter balance. 85 their usefulness. They occupy much room on account of the length of belt required to communicate motion from the crank shaft to the lower and the current of air which enters the causing to supply the volume and velocity required must pass the apertures and be deflected by the fan sat such high ve lo cities as to produce a humming noise truly distressing to the passengers particularly to persons of delicate temperament." It is not deemed necessary, in addition to these objections, to enumerate others; such as the constant difficulty of keeping the belt tight and of retaining it on the pulleys, and the necessity of frequent repairs arising from the breaking of the machinery by the slipping of the belt; the two pointed out above being the most prominent and essential." To avoid these objections, has been the subject of much reflection amongst engineers and others. The fans have been variously shaped and curved; wings have been adapted to the apertures in the causing to defect the entering currents, and thus prevent the humming noise; but all these attempts, whilst they have added greatly to the original cost and repairs, have not proved effectual These ends I have attained in the most simple and effective manner by my said improvement, which consist simply in increasing the diameter of the fan lower, and attaching it to the crank shaft of the auxiliary engine, so that the required volume and velocity of blast may be acquired by a much less number of revolutions; and the air is admitted and deflected under ve lo cities which avoid entirely the disagreeable hum and noise of other b lowers, at the same time bringing the number- of revolutions within the capacity of the crank shaft of the auxiliary engine, so that the fans can be attached directly to it; thus effecting economy in the room occupied, and in the original cost of construction and repairs, by dispersing with the belt and pulleys heretofore employed in forming theconnexiori between the crank shaft and b lower, which are so liable to derangements, and which add much to the noise One patent has been granted this year for a mode of feeding boilers, in such a manner that the resistance of the steam to the ingress of the water is avoided; and the pressure of the steam is also made to regulate the dampers for increasing and diminishing the draught of the furnace. The devices need not here be described, as they are but slight modifications of those already in use. Two patents have been granted for safety apparatus for steam boilers. The one is for the combination of the alarm whistle with the safety valve, and the other is for a device to avoid the evils which result from the safety valve becoming sealed. Further notice of them is unnecessary. One condenser has this year been patented, which operates nearly upon the same principle with others heretofore in use. In this apparatus the steam enters the condenser or hot well, and is condensed by a jet of water; part of the water of condensation is pumped from the well to the boiler, and the rest into a reservoir, from which it passes through a long coil of tube which is surrounded by cold water, directly from the outside of the vessel. By this means the water of condensation becomes cold, and is carried back to the hot well to finish the jet for condensing the steam, and is then again pumped out intothe boiler, or passes again through the refrigeration g tubes. Thus it will be perceived that the same water is constantly used for the generation and condensation of steam, and no addition of water is necessary except a small quantity to supply 86 waste. When the water, as in the ocean and some rivers, is such as to injure and produce incur station in the boiler, it is evident that this mode of economic sing the water which has been properly prepared for use is of very great importance. Slide valves Two patents have been granted this year for improvements in balancing slide valves. When the valve is closed, the steam entering the steam chamber will press it forcibly against the valve seat, so that great power is required to cause it to slide, and the valve and the valve seat soon become injuriously worn. To balance the valve and avoid these inconvenience has long engaged the attention of engineers, and many devices for that purpose have already been invented. But those patentee within the last year sufficiently differ from those previously in use to deserve notice. In one of them, the proper balance is attained by the use of a blind or auxiliary valve, connected with the valve proper, and working against the top of the chest in such a manner as to receive upon it stop the pressure of the atmosphere. The device patented is very similar to one already in use. The following claim extracted from the patent will sufficiently set forth the invention: " The described means of neutralising the effect of the pressure of the steam (or fluid, as the case may be) upon the back of the valves, andequalizing the pressure of the atmosphere on the upper side of the blank valve and on the under side of the valve, thus preventing friction and allowing the valves to move with perfect ease when under a pressure, asset forth, viz: by attaching or applying the blank valve to the commonly used slide valve, as described, in combination with the false aperture and the aperture to the atmosphere, through the cover and the inverted seat, as described, and all operating as mentioned and set forth The other apparatus balances the valve by the manner in which the steam is let on, and will be understood by reference to the following extract from the patent' In constructing our balanced slide valve, we so arrange the respective parts thereof as to cause the steam to operate equally on opposite sides of the sliding part thereof, allowing the steam to enter into and to escape from the cylinder equally on each side of said valve. In effecting this, we sometimes cause the valve to slide between two stationary check pieces, in each of which are contained three openings, operating in the ordinary way for the induction and eduction of steam." I instead of the two stationary check pieces above named, we sometimes employ one stationary valve seat, which is embraced on each of its sides by the slide valve, the stationary valve seat being furnished with three steam openings on each of its sides, so arranged as to produce the same result with that first named, and in a manner substantially the same; the two modes being mere modifications of one principle One patent has been granted for improvements in pistons. The patented pistons differ but little from those formerly used, and need not be described. Reciprocating einginesThree patents have been granted this year for improvements in engines of this variety. One of them is for improvements in the double cylinder or twin cylinder engine, similar to one noticed in my last report, for working steam ex pensively. The engines however, differ from each other in important particulars, which will be understood by comparing the following extract with the description given, in my last report, of the engine patented in 1845. Doc. No. 52. The inventor says he has "invented and made certain new aid useful improvements in the mechanical arrangement, construction, application, and combination of the parts of steam engines that are intended to work by the action of steam, admitted into one cylinder at a given pressure, and !in the progress of the stroke or half revolution the communication with the boiler is cut off, and the steam is allowed to pass into a second cylinder and work ex pensively, which has been done before by others, but not in the manner invented by me, the first difference between my herein after described invention, and nearly all that have preceded it, being that I use two parallel and equal sized cylinders set alongside of each other. The second difference is, that with these two cylinders I use only one induction steam pipe from the boiler, and one eduction pipe from both the cylinders to the atmosphere, or a condenser. The third difference is that the steam is admitted, by a proper induction valve, to about the half length of the first cylinder; the induction valve is then closed, and an expansion valve simultaneously opened from the first to the second cylinder. Thus the operation of the steam commencing at the same end of both cylinders forms the fourth difference between my plans and those of others, and the expansion valve is sustained open, so that the steam shall act ex pensively during the remainder travel of the first piston, and shall also proper the pistons both in the same direction, during a large portion of the travel or stroke of each, without reacting from one piston upon the other, which constitutes a fifth difference between this invention and others which have preceded it. The exhaust valves operate to exhaust both cylinders to the air, or to a condenser, at the same time, from the same end of each cylinder to the same said pipe, and this constitutes a sixth difference between this and other plans preceding it, a large portion of these ends being attained by placing the piston rods in connexion with two cranks on one main. or driving shaft; which two cranks are to be placed either at right angles, or at some acute or lessening angle, less than ninety degrees apart, which is believed to be the seventh clear and distinct difference between these arrangements and any that have preceded them. I tis well known that double engines have been made to act with either equal or unequal cylinders, upon cranks set :at opposite points in the same line, with valves and openings that pass the steam from the top of the first piston to the bottom of the second, and vice versa; and threefold engines, having cranks more than ninety degrees apart, have been used; and marine engines with cranks set at ninety degrees apart, each operated by a separate and unconnected cylinder, are in common use; yet no one of these operates in the manner herein proposed; the nearest approach to which has been made with two cylinders and pistons operating on a pair of right angle cranks, the valves set to admit the steam from the boiler only when the first crank had passed upwards or downwards to an angle of forty-five degrees, and at one hundred and thirty-five degrees passing the steam ex pensively from the first to the second cylinder, to the end of the stroke of the first piston, and thus making the second piston carry the first crank past the dead centres, each piston travelling without steam operating on it during the first quarter of each stroke. All these and many other modifications of steam engines, for the same end, are variant from my invention and improvements, by not acting in so direct concert to produce an expensive, direct, and continuous action of the steam in the same direction, or both pistons through the relative positions of the cylinders aid cranks, and the arrangement and combination of the acting parts 8 a. Another double cylinder engine has been patented which works upon a different principle. The engine is of a very simple variety; but in some particulars, and for some purposes, it seems to possess advantages, and I will therefore present its peculiarities in the following extract from the patent: " In the steam engine as now constructed, the piston must be accurately fitted to the cylinder, and packed; the cylinder is then provided with a head or cover accurately fitted and bolted, and provided with a stuffing box around the piston rod; and then the end of the piston rod, where it receives the connecting rod, is either provided with a sliding head working on ways, or with a parallel motion, which are not only very expensive, but either of these methods occupy much room ; for there must be, between the upper end of the cylinder and the beam or other connexion room sufficient for the length of piston and connecting rods, which, in many instances, is a source of great inconvenience, as, for instance, in steamboats, Any of these objections I avoid, and render the engine cheaper and less liable to derangements by making the piston a long hollow cylinder, the outer diameter of which fits either accurately or loosely the inside of the steam cylinder, the upper end of which is provided with a snuffing box which surrounds the, hollow cylindrical piston: that is, therefore, made of greater length than the steam cylinder within which it works thus avoiding the necessity of a packed piston. The inner end of this piston cylinder is closed to form the piston head, and to the inner surface of it is attached the connecting rod, which extends to the crank. By this arrangement, the unequal wear of the piston and cylinder by the vibrations of the connecting rod is avoided. The steam, of course, in this arrangement can act only in one direction, and therefore will be only single acting; but when it is desired to make a double acting engine, then two such single acting engines a fe so arranged as to be connected together by a crank shaft, having two cranks on opposite sides of the axis, so that the moment one ceases to act the other commences, the valves alternately opening and closing the induction and eduction valves" It will be obvious that this engine may be single acting by having but one cylinder and its appendages; double acting, as above described; threefold acting, by having three cylinders with the cranks, making an angle of 1 200 with each other, so as to divide the circle into three equal parts, the threefold acting being the best for working the steam expansivelyby means of cut off valves, as the steam will at all times be acting with its full force in one, and ex pensively in another' By constructing an engine on this plan, but one packing will be required for each cylinder, and that a stuffing box which admits of adjustment much more readily than a piston which can only be repacked by taking the engine apart. It dispenses with the necessity of a sliding head or parallel motion, the cylindrical piston performing that office by having the connecting rod jointed to it within and at l the bottom, at the same time saving the room occupied by the piston rod in the conmon6engine; and what is of great importance, the piston can always be kept oiled by simply oiling the stuffing box, which is not the case in engines as heretofore made Letters patent have this year been granted for a reciprocaling engine which receives and rejects the steam through: the piston rod and piston. The piston rod is a cylindrical tube opening into th~ interior of the his. a. 89 loi; the openings in t the piston have two valves in them, with stems extending from them through the upper and lower faces of the piston; as the piston reaches either extremity of the cylinder, the stems strike the ends of the cylinder, and operate the valves in a manner which can be easily understood, so as to admit and discharge the steam at each end of the stroke. Letters patent have been granted for improvements upon a gas engine which was patented several years ago, and consist principally in devices for retaining and equal iting the temperature of the parts. There are several points of claim; but the invention does not possess that striking originality which requires particular description in this place. Rotary engines your patents have this year been granted for improvements in rotary engines. In one of them the mode of operating and timing the valves in such a manner as to be opened in equilibrium is a principal object' In another the valves are made to receive the pressure of the steam upon their faces, and resist it, by resting against a pilot so located 'that the valve has a slight tendency to rest against the edge of the interior revolving disk which operates them, and against which they press with sufficient force only to prevent the escape of the steam. In another the parts are so arranged that the steam operates by successive impingements and reactions throughout the circumference of the engine. I t appears to me unnecessary to extract from either of the patents for rotary engines, or to give the subject of steam engines a more extended notice. Lumber, And Machi Nery For Operati Of Therei N. I improvements in this class of machinery have not been numerous. I t will be readily understood l that machinery for working lumber is mostly of an elementary character, and that for a long series of years a great portion of the inventive talent of this country has been exercised upon it, and has carried it to a high degree of perfection. It is not remarkable, therefore, that but few new inventions should be made in proportion to those which are re inventions, and that as a consequence more applications should be more frequently rejected each succeeding year. Very little has been developed this year in the higher varieties of this branch of machinery; indeed, there is already excellent machinery in use for performing almost every conceivable operation upon lumber of which it is susceptiblenSawmillsAbout five patents have been granted this year for improvements in sawmills, some of which I deem it proper to notice. In ordinary sawmills the saw v usually does not entirely separate the board from the log, but saws it nearly off, and the carriage is then moved back, and the log set for another cut. Awed in this way, the boards atone end are of course imperfect, and much time is lost in running back the carriage for each successive cut. To remedy these inconvenience sand defects, an improved combination of parts has been made and patentee within the year a gang of saws sufficient in number to saw the whole log in boards. ,the log is placed upon a carriage and moved up towards the saw, much in the usual way. After the sawing has progressed considerably, the log is seized by another apparatus on the back side of the saws, and carried entirely through, while the first carriage returns to receive another log, and present it to the saw as soon as it has finished saw 90 Doc. No. ,52ing the first log, and so on for any number of logs. -Thessaws are kept constantly in action, losing no time: for running back, and the boards are entirely separated from each other. Several patents have been granted for improvements in the feed of sawmills. The usual mode of feeding by a hand acting upon a hatchet wheel is somewhat imperfect, as the hand will in some instances slip, and thepavwl will also allow the hatchet wheel to slip. The several improvements patented this year are intended to remedy these imperfect sons. One of these inventions will be understood by reference to the following extract from the patent: "these clamps are not formed in the ordinary manner, but are mathematically formed by striking a rectangular line across the direction of the motion, at the centres of motion of the clamps, and two longitudinal lines in the same points ; then p retracting lines, in an angle of about fifteen degrees from the centre of motion of the clamps, towards the centre of the machine, di verging in the same direction with the motion of the material operated on; and at the point where the diagonal line intersects the intended faces of the clamps, a line parallel to the centres of motion, and intersecting the two longitudinal lines, will, give the centres from which to strike segments of circles forming the faces of the clamps. When so formed and thus applied, however the thickness of the material may vary, a line drawn as a radius from the face of the clamp at the point of contact with the material will always make nearly the same angle with the direction of the feed, and thus maintain a nearly equal pressure upon each side of the material that is to be fed in." By making the clamps according to these directions, they will act uniformly to slip the material, and progress it to the tool. But if a larger angle than about fifteen degrees is taken, the clamps will pass forward without holding the material, and if a much less angle is used they will slip by from not having sufficient hold. In some cases a single eccentric clamp, thus formed, may be used on one side of the material, with a fixed fence on the opposite side Several patents have been granted for improvements in head and tail blocks, which are intended to facilitate the setting of the log for each successive cut. They are, however, very much like those in common use. One of them, however, I will notice. :when the dogs which hold the log are attached to a hatchet slide, operated by a lever and paw l, to set the log, irregularities sometimes arise from the fact that the slide is held only from retiring against the paw l, but is not prevented from moving in the other direction. The patentee obviates this inconvenience by combining two p awls and levers with each other in a such a manner that at the moment one of them has carried the slide the proper distance for the set, the other rises and catches into an inverted hatchet wheel, where it remains; and thus the two p awls hold the slide from moving either way, injuring the equal thickness of the boards, and preventing such accidents as might arise from un steaminess in the log. The precise details of the machine used cannot be here presented in such a manner as to be understood ; and the same is true of other improvements in head blocks patented this year, which I am therefore compelled to pass overShingle and late machines- One patent has been granted this year for an improved single cutting machine. The improvement consists in: so arranging the knives upon the gate that two singles will be cut .at each downward motion of the gate the singles being separated -from the block by a drawing cut from butt to point, the butt coming from alternate ends of the block. One patent has been granted for improvements in late cutting machines, which, however, does not possess the kind of novelty which would entitle it to notice here. Barrel machinery Three patents have been granted this year for improvements in machinery used in the manufacture of barrels, &c. One of these is for an improvement in jointing states by bending them over a bed piece and applying to the edges a plane having two cutters, each cutting from the centre to prevent cutting against the grain. Another of these machines is for dressing states; possesses considerable novelty, and deserves particular notice. I to characteristics are fully set forth in the following extract from the patent, to which reference is made : " The dressing and jointing on lived states by machinery are operations which have heretofore presented much difficulty, an d of the various attempts to attain these important ends by means of rotating planes none have, so far as I am informed, been successful. The difficulty arises from the fact of the uneven and crooked condition of the lived bolts, which must be dressed with the grain of the wood, and of equal thickness, and the necessity of jointing the curved edges of the states to give the bulge to the barrel or case by a continuous movement. The dressing of states has been essayed by two rotating planes-one to plane or dress the cone ave, and the other the convex surface; the planes being placed one forward of the other, so that the states pass from the one to the other; but in this there is no method by which the planes can adapt themselves to the bends and brooks of the bolts. Attempts have also been made to joint the edges with rotating planes by placing the state, after being dressed, on a reciprocaling carriage, provided with guides to cause the rotating planes to approach towards and recede from each other, to give the required bulge to the states." The improvements which I have made, and which I wish to secure by letters patent, remove these difficulties, and consist, first, in hanging the two rotating planes one above the other in a vertically sliding frame, to receive the bolt from the feeding or guide and pressure rollers, and pass them to other rollers which deliver or conduct them to the jointing operation, the frames sliding up and down to adapt the planes to the bends or brooks of the bolts, the sliding of this frame being effected by two sets of rollers hung in the frame, one forward and the other back of the rotating planes; and, second, in giving to the frames in which the jointingcutterheads are hung, and run, reciprocaling movements towards and from each other by means of can grooves, eccentrics, cranks, or other analogous device, as the states are fed forward by a positive motion; the continuous feeding and reciprocaling motion of the c utter heads being made to correspondPlaning machines But two patents have been granted this year for improvements in this department. One of them is for an improved mode of holding and adjusting plane irons, and will be understood from the following extract: " The method of fastening plane bits or irons to their stocks (now generally in use) is by means of a wedge, which requires hammering to drive it in or draw it out, which in a short time injures the stock and disadjuststhe set of the cutting edge. Various other devices have been suggested and essayed to avoid this difficulty, but they have so far all failed, either in consequence of complexity and cost, or the occupying of too much room in the throat of the plane, and therefore impeding the discharge of shavings. But by my improvement, which is simple, cheap, and not liable to derangements, I avoid all these difficulties. It consists in the employment of an eccentric metallic roller, which has its bearings in the sides of the throat of the stock, and is situated immediately over the bit or iron so that by turning it the bit is either liberated or fastened. I to diameter is so small as not to afford the least obstruction to the free discharge of the shavings; and by the turning of this eccentric to fasten the bit, if it be turned in the direction of the cutting edge, it will tend to set for the cutting of a thicker shaving, and by turning it the other way the reverse effect will be produced The other patent is for an improved mode of planing seats for window blinds, &c. It is unnecessary to set forth its details. The great object of the inventor is to avoid planing against the grain. He therefore places his seats in a kind of hop per, from which they are fed in a proper direction, to the plane, which planes one side with the grain; the sat then falls down into another hop per, and is fed to another plane in the opposite direction to plane the other side. These motions insure the planing of both sides with the grain. Boring and mortisingFour patents have been granted within the year for improvements in this variety of machinery; but these are slight modifications of machinery in common use, and need not be described. Veneeringletters patent have been granted this year for improvements in ve peering, which, for various purposes, promises to be very useful. I to character will be learned by reference to the following extract from the patent: "the nature of my invention consists in inter losing between the veneers, or venter and body to which it is to be attached or united, or layers of wood to be united, a cotton or linen canvass, or other cloth, (the cloth and parts of the wood to be adjoined being first covered or prepared with blue or other adhesive material) and then placing the parts to be united injuxtaposition; the cloths prepared as aforesaid being interposed, and uniting them by any of the known or suitable modes of compression. The cloth thus interposed adheres firmly to every part of the adjacent wood, and prevents the venter from splitting or cracking with the grain of the wood, or leaving the body to which it is attached; renders two veneers minutely thin, thus united, stronger and more dura be than if united in the usual mode, and than solid wood of many times its thickness or size his invention is peculiarly adapted to the ve peering or formation of unequal surfaces, or to cases where the ve peering wood is required to be bent or compressed out of its natural inclination. It is especially adapted to the construction of wooden tubes or pipes. The mode I adopt in the constructing of tubes or pipes is the following: A venter or layer of wood is first rolled around a rod or shaft attached to a crank, and turning with it and compressed by a cord, (I have used) or other compression, into the required shape. The cloth, saturated with blue or other adhesive substance, is then rolled tightly around the venter thus shaped as above, and then another venter, or layer of wood, is applied upon the cloth and compressed, by the means above stated, into contact with every part of the cloth; by turning upon which, the :veneers are shaped or rolled over a furnace, and the blue or adhesive matter is made to penetrate every part of the fabric Nothing further has been developed this year connected with lumber, which is worthy of particular notice. Of Of  L Engi Neeri Of And Archi Tecture. A considerable number of patents have been granted within the year for improvements belonging to this class, some of which deserve notice. Excavatorseight patents have been granted for machinery used in making various kinds of excavations. One of the 'patents is for improvements in machinery for facilitating the operation of the scoop in dred going machines. The invention is not of a radical character, but is one of those modifications which need not be described. Several patents have been granted for ditching and em banking. In the western prairies these ditches and embankments are resorted to as substitutes for fences, and as such have become very important, and given exercise to much ingenuity, and improvements are constantly in progress of development. Those patented this year are generally but slight deviations from the inventions of former years. There is one of them, however, which I will notice. The machine is so constructed as to cut two parallel ditches, and deposit e the turf which is removed between them in the form of an embankment, in such a manner that the whole is covered with grass. The following extract will more fully elucidate the operation and the structure :of   t has heretofore been found, difficult .to form a fence of earth that would stand without a complicated and expensive process of throwing up the dirt from trenches on each side, and then nodding it over, the mound being formed by shading or sloughing, or both. The process of nodding being slow and expensive, has rendered this kind of fence objectionable, and often prevented its coming into use. By my machine, two ditches are cut parallel to each other, and a mound or ridge of earth raised between them all perfectly nodded, and more compact than the old method' The construction of my machine is as follows: In each side of a centre beam there is a <a name="mould3"><mark>mould</mark></a> board or twisted plane, so formed as to receive the sod and earth from the ditch from which it is cut, and thence gradually raising it up till the under and inner side is perpendicular, at which point both <a name="mould4"><mark>mould</mark></a> boards join and terminate. Therefore, as the sod leaves the <a name="mould5"><mark>mould</mark></a> board, that on each side meets the other, and is thus supported. Must beyond the front edge of the <a name="mould6"><mark>mould</mark></a> board there is an of long frame attached across the beam, having four runners attached to it parallel with the beam, on which it bears. From this frame two knives incline downwards and back to the lower corner of the <a name="mould7"><mark>mould</mark></a> board, where they join these knives, cut out the sod and form the ditch, the fence being elevated between them. Long the lower edge of the <a name="mould8"><mark>mould</mark></a> board there is a rim or sole attached nearly at right angles thereto, on which the edge of the sod rides as it is lifted; and again the upper edge of this sole has a ledge on it, which serves to keep the sod in place, and gradually direct the lower edge inwards as it rises to a perpendicular po 94 position. The front edge of this last named piece is armed with a c utter to cut off any projections on the surface of the sod ; the cap between the <a name="mould9"><mark>mould</mark></a> board projects a little over them. A suitable frame work is added to the above described parts to strengthen it, which may be varied with the size of the machine and the soil it is to be used in. When put into operation, it is drawn along by a cast an connected with the front end of the beam, and moved by any suitable power. The sod is cut by the knives, and then elevated by the <a name="mould10"><mark>mould</mark></a> board on to the space between the ditches, when it is deposited in an upright position and left with the grass out, forming a perfect sod bank or ridge Two snow excavations have been patented this year. One of them has a double series of <a name="mould11"><mark>mould</mark></a> boards-one above, the other which, where the snow is deep, very much facilitates its removal. It is often observed that banks of snow accumulate upon railroads in such a manner that one side of the ordinary snow plough scarcely operates at all, while a heavy bank presses against the other; thus endangering the position of the locomotive upon the track, and producing injurious strains. To obviate this inconvenience, an improvement has been made and patented in the snow plough. The apparatus consists of an inclined plan- for scraping up and elevating the snow, in combination with two vertical inclined planes meeting and forming a vertical edge in front, and firmly fixed together. These inclined planes are for crowding the snow, as it is elevated, to the side of the track. They are connected with the scraped by a pilot, so that when the bank is more on one side of the road than the other, they may immediately be so adjusted as to divide it in such proportions as may be deemed expedient. A patent has also been granted for an apparatus for cutting and removing ice from channels. The ice is cut by any convenient cutters; as the boat progresses, the ice is aided in the ascent of an adjustable inclined plane in front of the boat, by rollers having points upon them, which take into the pieces of ice. After the ice is sufficiently elevated, it is allowed to slide off over lateral inclined planes on each side of the channel, leaving the channel entirely clear. Miningone patent has been granted for an improvement in miningaugers. It consists of a combined bore r and screw, properly constructed for removing stones or earth. One patent has been granted for improvement a in fences, and another for a weather strip for doors, which do not require notice. Room derricksThe difficulty everywhere met with in machines of this kind is, that they are either insufficient in strength to resist the powerful dorsi ve strains to which they are subjected, or that they are too heavy and un wield to be conveniently moved from one place to another and set up. Letters patent have been granted this year for a boom de trick, which is intended to obviate one of these evils, without falling into the other. I to chief characteristic consists in substituting for the mast a tripodtrussel, and braced in such a manner as to give the particular kind of strength required, as the patentee alleges, with a less amount of timber than has heretofore been used, and at less expense. The machine is said to have been tested, and to give great satisfaction. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in building cisterns, improvements in c offer dams, improvements in dry docks, and improvements in stump extract ors, which it is deemed unnecessary to describe. a. Railroadsbut two improvements in railroads have been patented this year. One of them is for a device to prevent cattle from getting upon the road at the crossings, and is similar to other devices already in use. The other is for a method of preventing cars from running off the track in consequence of displacing the switch. For the accomplishment of this object, frogs are used having guards or grinders on their outsides, and double inclined planes up and down, by which the wheels are guided to the right track. Considerable importance seems to be attached to this invention, and it will probably answer a valuable purpose. Bridgessix patents have been granted this year for improve rents in bridges, and some of them are of considerable importance in t is well known that by long use and repeated strains the various parts of a truss bridge are loosened and weakened, and the bridge become sun safe' But, although the parts may be unable to sustain the kind of strain to which they have long been subject, they are still capable of resisting other strains; and if, therefore, the structure can be so modified that the parts will perform other duties than those they have been accustomed to, the bridge may again be rendered strong. For example, a tension rod or brace, which has bee in weakened as such, may be perfectly relied on as a thrust brace. Two or three patents have been granted this year for different modes of carrying out this principle. The bridges are so constructed that by a double system of nuts upon the rods ordinarily used in truss bridges, all the parts which have been. subjected to tension, are :made subject to thrust, and the thrust ties are subjected to tension; or the change, if desired, may, be partial. It will readily be perceived that a bridge possessing this versa tile character, which allows the parts thus to relieve each other, will be much 'more dura be than one of the ordinary construction. Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in the mode of, b racing bridges, and of enabling them to resist lateral as well as vertical pressure. As the character of the improvements is clearly set forth in the patent 1 ;refer to the following extract for their description' In the construction of arch bridges, with diagonal braces between the under 'and upper arch pieces, the practice has heretofore been to a but the braces against the posts and arch pieces at the junction of the two; so that the two braces, on opposite sides of each post, apply all the strain to the arch piece at one point. This necessarily tends to break it at this point, and does not transfer the strain from one part of the arch to other part sa result so important in a good bridge. " The object of the first part of my invention is to arrange the diagonalbrtesebetween the lower and upper arch pieces, or arch piece and its chord, and at a sufficient distance within the posts and vertical connecting rods, as to make that portion of the arch piece perform the function of a lever; the post or connecting rod being the fulcrum, and thus to transfer the strain applied to any part of the arch from one diagonal brace to another, throughout the series, and 'in this way give to the arch truss the greatest ar count of stiffness due to the amount of timber employed. It is also well known that bridges are exposed to much lateral strain from wind, tending to force the o arch trusses over out of plumbcid127) and aailcid127archloses much of its strength when out of plumb, it has, become a matter of great importance, to perfect a i bridge against i suchlteridenciesiThe second part of my invention consists in making 'the middle arch96
truss of the bridge in two parts, inclined in opposite directions, connected together at top and separated at bottom, so that they resist the action of the wind in opposite directions." 'letters patent have been granted for an improvement in anchoring suspension. chains for bridges. A platform. of timber is placed at the bottom, and the pier is built upon it. The anchor is placed under this platform, and between it and the platform another platform is placed, whose planks are at right angles to those of the first. The planks of the first have their length in the direction of the bridge. The chain passes up from the anchor through the pier. With this arrangement it will be perceived that any strain which would disturb the anchor must move the whole pier. This mode of anchoring appears at once simple and safe. I will there close may remarks upon improvements in civil engineering. Those remaining in this class are not such as require particular illustration.  Hydrauli Of And `PNEUMATI Of. Upwards of thirty patents h have been granted this year for improvements in machinery belonging to this class, and a much greater number of applications have been rejected. When it is recollected that hydraulic aridpneumatic apparatus, in almost every branch, has been in use for thousands of years, and that improvements have been progressing from century to century, it is truly astonishing that at this late period, and in a single year, so many new, and useful combinations have been brought to light. The various departments of this class, in which improvements have been made, will appear as I proceed hastily to review v them. Filters and stop cocks- Line patents under these heads have :been granted this year. I have placed them together, because most of these patents are for combinations of the two. Filters have been used from the earliest periods, and many varieties of form and purifying substance. One of the inconveniences incident to them arises from their becoming foul, and the difficulty of cleaning. To facilitate cleaning, one of the patentees makes his filter a comparatively: small fixture, either end of which can at pleasure be screwed to the pipe or cock from which the water is obtained. A filtering substance is placed within the case of the filter, and the water from the pipe, being obliged to pass through it, is purified. When the filter becomes foul it is taken off and inverted, and the first water which passes through will cleanse it, and immediately after pure water will be received from it. When it, again becomes foul it is simply to be re inverted. Various materials have been used as a filtering medium; and oneiwhichisfamiliarly known, is sponge, more or less compressed. One of the patentees uses sponge compressed to such a degree that the impure ties of the water cannot penetrate at all, alleging that when thus compressed the water is easily forced through, and that all the impure ties will remain upon the surface of the filtering medium, and will easily and immediately be removed by investing the filter and passing the water through it. Several of the patentees place the filter in the core of the stop cock. With this simple arrangement, when the core is properly turned, the water will issue from theistopcock already filtered. It was soon, however, perceived that the impure ties would collect in large quantities behind the core, and could not be discharged without removing the apparatus; Of his circumstance led to several ingenious modifications of the filtering cock, all having reference to cleansing. One of the patentees made an opening in the core below the filter, which, when the core was turned into a certain position, allowed the water to escape independent of the filter, carrying all the impure ties with it. The filter itself can be cleansed by simply reversing the core. Another of the patentees, instead of using the core, makes an inclined partition in the tube, with an opening in the tube on each side of it, and places the filter around the cock in such a manner that the water will pass into it through one of the above mentioned openings, and after passing round through the filter, will enter the other opening, and be discharged from the cock in the ordinary way, in a pure state. Of the filter be turned around, the direction of the water through it will be changed, and the impuritieswill be carried off and the filter cleansed, and can operate in that position of the parts until cleansing is again required. In a third position of the external filter the water is entirely stopped off. Other patents have been granted for devices intended to accomplish the same object; but they are similar to one or the other of those already noticed. Letters patent have been granted for two devices to be used in the pipes of hydra its, which operate under great pressure to prevent the bursting of pipes, and other evils occurring with the <a< water ram." Of a valve under great pressure of water is suddenly closed, the momentum of the water thus instantaneously stopped frequently occasions great mischief; and many devices have been resorted to for its prevention. One of the patentees above mentioned holds the valve down directly against the pressure of the water by a strong spring, so that if the valve is too suddenly closed the spring will slightly yield to the ram until the water becomes quiet. The other uses two valves eats and two valves upon the same stem. The first valve is perforated in several places to allow a partial passage of the water, and slides a limited distance on the stem. I immediately beyond each valve seat there is a swell, in the tube to allow the water to pass when the valves are forced from their seats against the pressure of the water. When the valves are opened, the water has free egress; and when suddenly closed, the perforated valve reaches its seat first by sliding on the stem, and partially shuts off the water from the other valve and breaks the shock. While upon the subject of the water ram, it is proper to remark that letters patent have been granted for an improvement in machinery, patented in 1845, for applying the water ram to the raising of water. I t consists simply in a device for giving greater certainty: to the action of the parts previously used, and would not be understood without drawings and reference to the original apparatus. Waterwheelsamong many unsuccessful attempts, several real improvements have this year been made in water wheels, which I hasten to notice. Letters patent have been granted for an improved wheel, which is intended to work upon a vertical shaft, and which receives the water upon it entirely around the hut. After the water reaches the wheel it is received into openings or tubes, extending a considerable distance around the wheel. 'the bottoms of these tubes incline downwards, and the vertical sides approach each other to such a degree that the areas of the cross7Doc: No. 52.sectioils of the tube are every where equal; and the water is finally discharged tangentially, in a comparatively thin a vertical sheet, immediately outside of the wheel. Another patent has been granted for a wheel very similar to the foregoing, involving much of the same principle, but varying in some of its details. All the patents which have been granted this year for improvements in water wheels are for such as differ but little from those in former use and I shall notice but one other of them. Horizontal wheels have already been used with several shutes, and the wheels so constructed that when heavily loaded the water would be discharged on the interior of the wheel, and operate partially by reaction and when lightly loaded the water would be discharged principally at the outside of the wheel. The water from each shut e should of course be discharged from the wheel, when moving at high speed, before the same buckets receive the water from the second shut e. Heretofore no considerable space has been prepared for the escape of the water, except under the wheel; and when the speed is very high, gravity is insufficient for the escape of all the water; but considerable quantities are carried around and interfere with the action of the succeeding shut e, To remedy thiseyilthe wheel is placed between three or more flames arranged, in "triangle, square, &e; each flame has a shut e, and at the angles of the combined flame there is sufficient space to discharge the water tangentially rose n the wheel; which is the only way to make the discharge per feet. Raising water line patents have been granted this year for improve rents in pumps for raising water; but so much has heretofore been developed upon the same subject, that few present striking features of novelty. Most of them are for slight modifications of other well known pumps; and often for differences, rather than improvements. There is one improvement in pistons, which I think deserves particular notice. I is well known that most of the injury which is done by the piston, or to which it is subject, arises from friction ; and the invention alluded to is intended to obviate these inconveniences, and is applicable to steam engines, &c, as well as pumps. It will be fully understood by reference to the following extract from the patent: " His tons for pumps, engines, &c, which have heretofore been made to slide in a cylindrical or other: formed causing, or worked with a hinged or loose flap, like a fellows, require much power to ever come the friction of the packing, whether made of i metal, hemp, or other elastic substance, or to overcome the rigidity of the substances employed to connect the flap. When metallic packing is employed, the rubbing parts have to be made with great care and accuracy, and still give much friction; and consequently wear very rapidly, and require frequent adjustment, and cannot be advantageously employed with fluids containing earthy matter. With other kinds of packing, the wear is not only very rapid, but, to prevent leakage, must be made very tight, at the expense of power and yet, when exposed for any length f time without moisture, it is liable to law. And, finally the fellows flap piston, which avoids the friction of the packed piston, is found in practice to be h more objectionable than the others, on: account bftjee rigidity of the substances employed to form the connexion i and its liability to crack and break particularly when exposed for any length of time98
without moisture, I a consequence of the magnitude of these evils, many unsuccessful attempts have been made to remove them. By improvement, it is confidently believed, will effect ally remove them n -I t consists in substituting for the .metallic or other packing, and the hinged flap, the rolling of metallic or other hard substances on each other, by making the piston of three, four, or more triangular parts, turning on rounded edges along the outer face of the triangles, the other faces being made in the form of segments of cones, and rolling on each other when moved together in the same direction, all the segments being jointed to one piston or connecting rod. 'T .effect of their vibration will be similar to the working -of the flap of a bellowsPatents have been granted for fire engines, wind mills, &c, which* I do not deem it here necessary to describe. Letters patent have also been granted for an improved baroneter, which appears to be of great importance in consequence of its exemption from those liabilities to injury, and even destruction, which render those in corn mon use so objectionable. It consists simply of a cup, with a disk placed over it, air tight, and the air o exhausted from the interior. The disk, which is of sheet metal, is made waving in concentric circles, and can therefore yield as the pressure of the atmosphere increases ; and by a very simple device the yielding of the disk operates a hand upon the dial or register. Those acquainted with the subject will easily understand the instrument from the foregoing remarks. It is carried with perfect ease, and is as little liable to accident as an ordinary pocket compass. To further remarks appear necessary, upon developments made at this office in connexion with the subject of hydraulics and pneumatics. Of Lls And. I Mchani Cal Move Ments. About twenty patents have been granted this year for improvementsiamachinery belonging to this class, some of which deserve notice, though many of them do not possess those prominent character ising features which would render a description of them useful in this place. Flouring apparatus. -I t is well known to millers that the exterior coating of kerseys of grain are apt to be too dry for grinding, so that when the grain is crushed between the stones, the hull, being very brittle, is ground fine, and mingles with the flour, and is with difficulty separated on account of its fine ness. To obviate this, an improvement has been made and patented this year: The wheat is subjected, as it is passing to the stone, to a jet of steam, which mo is tens and tough end the hulls in such a manner that they come off in flakes, and are afterwards easily separated, in the bolting apparatus, from the flour. There is one other patent for improvements in flouring mills, whose apparent commanding importance entitles it to particular notice; and if the patentee is correct in his theory, which is said to have been thoroughly tested in Oh rope, an important revolution in flouring establishments throughout the world must speedily take place. Whenever attempts have been made to drive the mills tone at very high speed, for the purpose of effecting a rapid production of flour, the heat generated by friction has burnt and injured the flour. This <a name="evil8"><mark>evil</mark></a> has beer of so serious a character as to limit the velocity of the stones. Variousattenipts have been made to sur mount this obstacle, some of which ha e 100 been partially successful; such as causing cold air to enter between the eye and periphery of the stones, for cooling, &c. The idea, however, seems to have prevailed that the progress of the grain and flour could not be materially hastened through the mill by artificial means without preventing it from being thoroughly ground; and the fact seems to have been overlooked, that the burning does not result from the heat of the stones so much as from the length of time the flour is kept in contact with them. Portions of the flour are frequently found flogged between the stones for a considerable time, and thus, becoming burnt, affect the whole mass. To obviate all these inconveniences, the patentee causes an artificial current of air, by any convenient means, (exhaustion is preferred) to pass in at the eye and out at the periphery of the stones, in such a manner as constantly to sweep the whole mass between the grinding surfaces directly towards the periphery, while the stones are running at very high ve lo cities- The speed of the stones secures thorough grinding, and the currents of air prevent all c logging, and cause the flour to pass so rapidly between the stones as effectually to avoid burning. To entirely is the danger of burning obviated, that a current of hot air may be substituted for cold, and by this substitution the flour is so thoroughly dried, as it passes through the mill, that the ordinary process of kill drying is wholly dispensed with. The process appears un objectionable, though collateral evils not papa parent may attend it. It is, however, well worthy of experiment, for if successful its introduction will nearly double the present results of flouring establishments, and more perfectly insure the quality of the flour. Patents have been granted this year for improvements in bolting machines. They very much resemble machines formerly in use. Several patents have been granted for grinding and crushing apparatus. In one of the mills patented the bed grinder is spherical, and the move able grinder is concave, to fit with an opening through the top for the feed. The shaft of this grinder has an eccentric connexion with the shaft from which it derives motion, which gives it a vibrating as well as a rotary motion; and a similar motion is of course communicated to the grinder. In shaping and dressing burr mills tones, the fragments which are broken off have heretofore been regarded as useless, although the material is of the most approved texture for grinding. Letters patent have been granted this year for grinders made of these fragments. They are laid in hard cement around the interior surface of a conical f rust rum, and the whole surface is properly dressed to fit a corresponding core. The frustrumand the core constitute the mill. As the mill becomes worn by use, the cement, being the soft est, will wear faster than the stone, and thus preserve that uneven ness of surface necessary for grinding. The grinder s may be made in other forms, retaining the same general character. I will notice one other mill for crushing and pressing sugar cane, which appears to be important, and is described in the following extract from the patentSThe usual method of crushing cane is to pass it between rollers, arranged with two on one horizontal plane, and a third making pressure on and between i them; and as the cane is of a spongy texture, the moment it is relieved from the pressure of the rollers, it expands and takes up much of the sac charing matter by suction and capillary attraction ;and to avoid this difficulty, a second set of rollers have been combined with' the first set, to re crush the cane after it has passed from the first; but experience 52. 101 has demonstrated that this will not do, for, after the cane has been crushedly passing between the first set, it forms a very thin layer, which, ifpassedtothe send rid set in that condition, will be ground or cut through by the pressure of the rollers, instead of being simply crushed or squeezed to throw out the sac charing matter. To obviate this difficulty is the object of my invention, which consists in so connecting the two sets of rollers as to cause the crushed cane to pass to the second set in a considerable body or thickness, to prevent the rollers from cutting or grinding it through, by so combining the two sets of rollers as that the cane shall be presented in the second set in a body much thicker than when delivered by the first set Several patents have been granted this year for improvements in horse powers. Some of the patentees have aimed at compact ness; others have sought convenient port ability; others have sought to obviate inconveniences .arising from violent shocks; and others have seemed to aim, in the abstract, at any thing new. It is unnecessary to give a detailed account of these patents, or to dwell longer upon inventions belonging to this class. Of Scellaneous. A considerable number of patents have been granted this year which are not properly comprehended in any of the foregoing classes, some of which deserve notice. Patents have been granted for improvements in pulleys, combs, traps, fish hooks, life preserves, fire escapes brush machinery, machinery used in the manufacture of tobacco, &c, which do not require a particular description. Letters patent have been granted this year for an improved mode of conveying, cleaning, and as sorting coal. It is applicable only when the coal is found at a considerable elevation above the point to which it is to be conveyed. The coal is placed in an inclined conductor, having at proper points grates or openings for the escape of impure ties and for the separation of different sizes of coal. A large quantity of water is then let into the conductor, which sweeps the mass along; and the impure ties escape through the above mentioned openings as the mass passes, and the smaller coal drops through these grates. Letters patent have also been granted for an improved enunciation, for ruse in hotels, &c. One bell only is used, and the machinery is compact and not easily deranged. The enunciators heretofore in use, with one bell, have been so constructed as to show the number of the room where the bell is rung; but each successive ring of the bell hides or drops the number previously shown, perhaps, before it has received attention. I n the enunciation patented this year the ringing of the bell does not affect any number previously shown, but it constantly remains visible until the attendant drops or covers it. The simple turning of a crank hides all numbers previously shown. This enunciation for large hotels appears to possess advantages over those now in use. A very beautiful and perfect sewing machine has been patented this year, which presents much originality and evinces great ingenuity. The following extract from the later it sufficiently sets forth its characteristics it cannot be here presented in all its details: " In sewing a se am with my machine two threads are employed, one of Doc. No. "52 which threads is carried through the cloth by means of curved needle the pointed end of which is to pass through said cloth; the needle used was the eye that is to receive the thread within a small distance, say an eighth of an inch, of its inner or pointed end. The other or outer end of the needle is held by an arm that vibrated on a pilot or joint pin, and the curvature of the needle is such as to correspond with the length of the arm as its radius. When the thread is e cried through the cloth, which may be done to the distance of about three-fourths of an inch, the thread will be stretched above the curved needle, something in the manner of a bow string, leaving a small open space between the two. A small scuttle, carrying a bob bin filled with silk or thread, is then made to pass entirely through this open space, between the needle and the thread which it carries; and when the scuttle is returned, which i is done by means of apickerstaff or scuttle driver, the thread which was carried in by the needle is surrounded by that received from the scuttle; and as the needle is drawn out, it forces that which was received from the scuttle into the body of the cloth; and, as this operation is repeated, a se am is formed which has on each side of the cloth the same appearance as that given by stitching; with. this peculiarity, that the thread shown on one side of the cloth is exclusively that which was given out by the needle, and the thread seen on the other side is exclusively that which was given out by the scuttle. It will, therefore, be seen that a stitch is made at every back and fort i movement of the scuttle. The two thicknesses of cloth that are to be sewed are held upon pointed wires, which project out from a metallic plate, like the teeth of a comb, but at a considerable distance from each other say three-fourths of an inch, more or less ; these pointed wires sustaining the cloth, and answering the purpose of ordinary lasting. The metallic plate from which these wires project has numerous holes through it, which answer the purpose of rack teeth in enabling the plate to be moved forward, by means of a opinion, as the stitches are taken. The distance to which said plate is moved, and consequently the length of the stitches, may be regulated at pleasure t is proper here to remark that several patents have heretofore been granted for sewing machines, but none of them operate in a similar manner, nor produce a similar result. The inventor has not followed the footsteps of his predecessors, but has struck out a track of his own; and it would be difficult, by any means heretofore known, to sew as fast or a swell as can be done by this machine. I must here close my remarks upon the improvements developed at my desk during the current year. I have not referred to improvements patented in foreign countries, however prominent and important they may be, for the obvious reason that I have had ample occupation with those which have been patented here. The history of this office for several years, in addition to a great and steady increase of inventions, presents also the fact, always observe able in the progress of the arts, that while some classes are receiving numerous and important additions, others appear to receive, little or, no- attention or, if efforts are made towards their improvement, they fail of seccessiiBut succeeding years produce an entire revolution; and those branches whose rapidity of progress had astonished the world, in their turn becometorpid, and improvements burst forth with unlocked for brilliancy from the dust and ashes which have accumulated upon a long neglected de 01 10 apartment of the arts. The main current, however, is always onward, a though at some points it appears to s magnate or retro grade. But let not the inventor be deceived or discouraged ; these are but the eddies. Met him per severe ; the eddy of today may be the torrent of tomorrow. At the commencement of this report :hoped to compress it into narrower limits; but the number of patents is much greater than heretofore, and their average importance is such that I could not in fewer words do justice to a subject which I know is highly interesting to you, and to multitudes in every corner of our widely extended country. Respectfully submitted by .-P. N :of Tzgerald- .a. Examiner of Patens104 Toe. No. ,52. F. Abstracts of the Patent Laws of Great Britain: c, France, Austria, and other European countries. Great Bri Tai N. Patents are granted distinct for England, Scotland, and I re land, arid the practice is somewhat different in each. ,the first step, however, is the same in all. A petition, containing the title of the invention, to the crown, accompanied by a declaration made before a master of chancery, that he has made such an invention, is the first and true inventor, that it is new c, is lodged in the office of the Secretary of the Some Department. This is referred to the Solicitor or Attorney General to consider and report upon. Of no caveat is found on file, it proceeds. Of a caveat is found a week from the time, notice is given to the caveat or to decide whether he will oppose. Of he decides to oppose, and pays in the costs of opposition within a week, a summons is taken out for a hearing, and the Attorney or Solicitor General hears, in private, first the applicant, and then the opponents. Should the opponents not appear, or the Attorney or Solicitor General deem the inventions dis similar and not interfering, he reports in favor of the application ; but if they interfere, he stops the application, or recommends a joint patent, and on their acceding thereto, reports accordingly. This report is taken back to the Secretary S office for the Queens warrant, which directs a bill to be prepared for her signature, providing for the enrollment of the specification, &c. It is now taken to the Patent Office. Of no caveat has been entered at the Patent Office, it proceeds. But if a caveat, either from the former unsuccessful party or any other, is found in the Patent Office, notice is given. And on the opposing party, within a week, returning answer that he shall oppose, and depositing -30 as security for costs, a hearing is appointed, and the Attorney or Solicitor General, at his discretion, stops the patent or permits it to proceed. Of the opposition be overruled, or there be none, the bill is prepared of course, at tested, and signed by the Attorney and. Solicitor General, and goes to the Secretary of States office for the Queens signature; and being counter signed by the Secretary of State, is next taken to the Signet Office, and letters warrant are made out, sealed with the queens signet, to the Word Deeper of the Or ivy Real, at whose office a warrant is made out to the great seal, is sealed with the or ivy seal, and directed to the Word Chancellor. Were again, a caveat, if entered, may oppose the contemplated patent. The Word Chancellor, however, is very averse to an opposition at this last stage, and will order costs to be paid by a party opposing on insufficient grounds, or not appearing to support his opposition. Of there be no caveat, or an insufficient one, the letters patent are made out or sealed of course. Of the applicant desires it, his patent may include the islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Older ney, Dark, and An, and all the colonies and plantations abroad, at an extra expense of 7. The time of obtaining a patent is from one month to six weeks, and the expense about 110. The reference in the case of an I wish patent is to the Word Lieutenant, and the patent, after being sent to the Queen, is granted under the great seal of I re land. a. 105 The time of obtaining the I wish patent is five or six weeks, and the expense .130. In Scotland a declaration is made before a justice of the peace. The reference is to the Word Advocate, and the letters patent are passed at Edinburgh, under the seal appointed, in place of the great seal of the union. The time requisite for a Scotch patent is about six weeks, and the expense 180. The whole expense for letters patent for the three kingdoms, exclusive of the cost of specification and stamps, is 350. The specification requires a stamp of 15 ; and if it contains 2,160 words or upwards, 1 for every 10 80 words over and above the first 1,080 words. The stamp on the specification for I re land is 1. When the letters patent have been sealed, they may be published without prejudice to the rights secured. A specification must be prepared, which must be enrolled, at the latest on the day on which the number of his months expire, exclusive of the day of the date of the letters patent. An endorsement of enrollment is made on the specification, the original copy of which is returned to the party as soon as enrolled. An act of Parliament only can dispense with the enrollment. Patents may bean mended for defective specification; disclaimers are also allowed, &c, till which amendments the patentee, &c, cannot recover for infringements. Leave for a disclaimer, &c, is first obtained of the Attorney General, Lordadvocate, &c; a hearing is appointed, &c. Of the defect cannot be cured by a disclaimer, &c, recourse must be had to the crown, who may exercise the powers granted by statute on report of the Judicial Committee of the Or ivy Council in favor of the same. Patents are vitiated by want of novelty and originality of invention. Patents may be extended by act of Parliament, where the patentee has failed to reap the benefits of his invention. Patents may be assigned, or licenses be granted, by the patentee, to use the invention, &c. Provisions also exist for the prosecution of infringements, and penalties are inflicted. Hills of equity and injunctions are likewise granted to protect patentees in' their rights, &c. Posts are granted the successful party, &c. Province of Power Canada. The petition to by presented to t the governor, lieutenant governor, or person administering the government of the province for the time being, "by whom letters patent are caused to be made out, "containing a summary of the said petition, and giving a short description of the said invention or discovery" &c. These letters patent are to be given for a term not exceeding fourteen years. They are next delivered to her majestys Attorney (or in his absence to her Majestys Solicitor) General in the province, to be examined, who shall, within fifteen days of such delivery, if they are found in accordance with the act, certify to this effect at the foot, and return then. to the secretary of the province, who (or his deputy) shall present them thus to the governor, &c, to have the seal of the government affixed. Patents are to be recorded in a book kept for that purpose in the office 106 Toe Roof the i secretary of the province.

And it is declared, " that simply changing the form or the proportion of any machine or composition in any degree shall not be deemed a: discovery over m inventor, before he can receive a patent, must swear (is, if a Quaker, affirm) " that he does verily believe that he is the true i inventor or discovered of the art, machine' &c. This oath or affirmation may be made before any justice of the peace. The inventor, on application, must deliver "a written description (sighed by himself, and n at tested by two witnesses) of his invention or improvement, and of the manner or process of compounding the same, in such clear and exact terms as to distinguish the same from all other things before known, and to enable any person skilled in the art or science of which it is a branch, or with which it is most clearly connected, to make, compound, and use the same; and in the case of any machine, he shall fully explain the principle of the several modes in which he has contemplated the application of that .principle or character by which it may be distinguished from other inventions." Drawings and written references, where the nature of the case admits, or specimens of ingredients, or of the composition of matter, sufficient for experiment, also a model, (provided the secretary deems a model to be necessary) are required. Certified copies of the description, &c. shall be competent evidence in all courts in cases touching patent rights. Assignments of an invention must be recorded in the office of the secretary of the province. In case of the violation of a patent, the violators of the same shall pay to the patentee, his heirs and as signs, "a sum- that shall be at least equal to three times the price for which the patentee, &c. have usually sold or licensed, or might have sold or licensed, to other persons, the use of the said invention" which may be recovered by action in any court of competent jurisdiction. Evidence is allowed to be brought by the defendant to prove that the specification does not contain the whole truth, or an addition made for the purpose of deceiving the public, or that the patentee *as not the original discovered or inventor. Of the defendant sustains such a declaration, the patent is ad judged void, and the defendant receives a verdict, with the costs of the suit. Cases of interfering applications are to be submitted to the arbitration of three persons, one of whom is to be chosen by the secretary of the province, &c; their decision in writing, or of any two of them, shall be final as respects the granting of the patent. Of either of the applicants fail or refuse to choose an arbitrators, the patent shall issue to the opposite party. Of there are more than two interfering applications, and the parties do hot all unite in appointing the arbitrators, the secretary, do. is authorized to appoint the three arbitrators.

By the last French patent law, patents are granted for any new invention or discovery; i. e. the invention of new manufactures or new means, or the novel application of known means, for the purpose of obtaining a result, or a manufactured product. Pharmaceutical compose 108 nations or remedies, financial or monetary plans or combinations, are, however, excepted, and cannot be patented. The br events of invention or patent& are granted for five, ten, or fifteen years. The tax prescribed is 500 francs for 15 years, to be paid by ann cities of 100 francs each, under penalty of forfeiture if a year elapses without payment. Applicants must deposit e under seal, at the office of the secretary of the prefect are where they reside, or by a representative resident in any other department, the following papers 1.

I immediately after the enrollment of the petition, and within five days from the date of the deposit e, the Prefect will transmit the documents, under seal of the inventor, to the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, with a certified copy of the certificate or memorandum of deposit e, the receipt verifying the payment of the tax, and the power or warrant, when required. These documents having arrived, the demands will be enrolled, and the patents delivered in the older they are received, without any previous examination. An order from the minister verifying the regularity of the demand will be delivered to the petitioner, and this will constitute the patent, annexed to which will be a certified duplicate of the description and drawings. The first copy of patents shall be given free of expense; subsequent ones 25 francs; and the expense of drawings to be de frayed by the patentee.

One half of the sum paid to go to the treasury, unless the petitioner produces again his petition within three months from the time when the notice of rejection is given, in which case he may have the whole. In case the object of invention or discovery belongs to the class which cannot be patented, the fees will be returned. A list of patents is published every three months, in the Bulletin despoil, The descriptions, drawings, specimens, and models of patents granted remain, till the patent expires, in the office of the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, where they will be open for inspection free of expense. a. Copies may be obtained at the expense of any person applying. After the payment of the second an unity, the descriptions and drawings will be published either wholly or in part. A catalogue, also, containing the titles of all patents granted in the previous year, will be published at the commencement of each year.

Patents for improvements on original patents cannot be granted to any one but the patentee or his as signs till after one year. The papers, &c, of another applicant may be presented within the year, but are kept under seal till the year has expired, when the patent will be granted; the preference, however, being given to the patentee, &c. himself, who may have proposed improvements, &c. I improvements, &c. do not entitle the patentee to work the original invention without consent of the original patentee or his as signs; and vice versa. Patents may be assigned in whole or in part. Assignments must be enrolled at the office of the secretary of the prefect are in the department where executed. A copy of the certificate of enrollment must be transmitted by the Prefect to the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce within five days from the date of the certificate, where a register shall be kept of all transfers of patents; and every three months all the transfers enrolled shall be published. Assignees, &c, to have the full benefit of all improvements, &c, and the patentee also to have the benefit of improvements granted to as signers, &c. Foreigners may obtain patents for inventions in France; but the duration of a patent already patented abroad cannot exceed that of the foreign patent. Patents are null and void when the invention is not new, or a proper subject matter for a patent; if founded on mere theory, without explaining the application to arts or manufactures; if contrary to public safety or welfare; if deceptive, or if insufficient of description; if obtained contrary to the law ; and improvements, also, which do not relate to the original invention. Any invention' sufficiently made public in France or elsewhere, to be put in operation before the date of the deposit e, cannot be considered new. Patentees may forfeit their patents for non payment of the annual tax, as prescribed, if the invention is not put to use within two years from its date, or if it be intermit ted for two consecutive years, if the patentee introduces into France similar foreign articles, except models which are authorized by the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce for obtaining a patent from abroad. Lines and penalties are inflicted on any one who stamps, &c. " patented" without authority of law. Patents may be repealed by proper legal procedure before the civil tribunals, by petition presented, &c. I invasions of patent rights are punished by a fine varying from 100 to, 2000 francs an ad on repetition of the offence, six months imprisonment. In this case, however, a previous conviction within five years must be 110 proved. I imprisonment is also inflicted on any one who obtains information, &c, from a workman employed by the patentee. Confiscation and forfeiture, &c, of all articles condemned as infringements, tools m apparatus, &e c, may be pronounced for the benefit of the patentee, &c. Austri A. By the law of Austria " no patents can be granted for the preparation of the means of food or drink, or medicine." I inventions and improvements from abroad are confined to those which are already patented abroad, and to the term of the foreign patent, and can in no case, except by special grant, exceed 15 years. The applicant for a patent must forward to the office of the circle where he belongs his petition and specification, and, when needed for illustration, drawings and models. Forms of the papers required are furnished in the published law. The specification must be in the German language, so drawn that any one skilled in the art can make the article invented, &c. What is claimed as new must be accurately defined. Nothing important must be concealed or added, &c. One half of the fee, according to the number of years a patent is desired, must be paid on application, . The priority of discovery, invention, &c takes effect from the day and hour stated in the receipt of the office accid127knowsldging the application for a patent, &c. Within three days after its reception the papers are to be sent to the registry office of the provinceLandstelle) where the question is decided whether the invention, discovery, &c, Will be of no public injury or against the laws of the land, and also whether it has been assigned, &c. It is either rejected or issued, according to the state of the case, and in the prescribed form delivered to the patentee, and so published in the journals of the district where here sides. In case the register office rejects the application, he may appeal to the imperial exchequer. The specification (unless the applicant requests it to be kept secret) is to be recorded as prescribed, and be op an to any ones inspection. But if the applicant requests it to be kept secret, it shall be so during the continuance of the patent, and shall only be opened in cases which concern -the state of health, and an accurate investigation is demanded by the medical faculty. In case the secret or sealed up descriptions are contrary to true policy, health, or the public interests of the realm, the grant of a patent is null and void. The patent protects the rights of the patentee or his as signs during the term of its continuance. It also authorizes the erection of workshops, manufactures, and places for the sale of the article patented. The patentee may sell, assign, beneath, lease, &c, his right, and also take out a patent in foreign countries. It extends only to the particular invention a or improvement, but gives no right to use improvements on the articles patented, except by the consent of the owner. The fees are for every year it' lasts :for the first 5 years 10 guildersonveati n money, each year, or 50 builders in the whole; for the 6th year, 15 builders; for the 7th, 20 builders, and so on craincrasing 5 builders more each successive year, so that the 15th year is 60 builders; or for the whole 15 years 425 builders or florids, (about 45 events for each guild i c. N, "a. her) Half th fee is pad at the: application, and the other half at the beginning of every successive year according to the number of years, &c Any one wh: has taken out a patent for less than 15 years may, before the expiration of the term of his .patent, obtain an, extension n even up to 15 years in a all, by paying, according to the above rate, half of the whole on the grant of extension, and the other half at the beginning of every year; on failure of which, any. year the patent to be forfeited. To part of the fee is -returned, though the patent may become null and void, unless the State annals the. patent for public reasons. : .a. Three builders is the office fee for every copy of the original patent. There is also a fee to be paid (not specified) for of fixing the seal, and also a fee (not specified) for examination concerning the hurt fulness, or the contrary, of the article to be patented. These are all the fees required of the patentee; and copies of the patent are afterwards made, as well as every other decree of privilege, officially, without payment. The longest term allowed for a patent (except by special grant) is 15 years. Special grants must be specially applied for. The patent takes effect from the date of its delivery ; but the penalty of infringement takes effect from the date of the publication of the patent in the public journals. The extent of the patent (as to domain) is to all the Austrian States, where it is legally published. The patent is vitiated whenever defective in accurate description ; when proved to be wanting in novelty at home, or, if of foreign invention, un patented or beyond the term of the foreign patent; when it interferes with a former one; when the patentee, within a year from its. completion, does not begin .to put the invention e, to use; when he intermits the use of it at any time of its term for a whole year without showing sufficient cause; when the second half of the patent fee is not paid as prescribed. and at the expiration of the term allowed. Patents, as above mentioned, are recorded. They maybe assigned; in which case certified notice of the fact must be, sent to the provincial register, who notes and confirms it on the outside of the patent, the change of ownership, and then gives the information to the office, under direction of the Minister of Commerce, to have it also noted in the principal registry. In case a patent is used under power of attorney, the true name of the owner also must be given, and the name of the attorney, with that of the owner, be placed on the register.

There is a general similarity in respect to many features of the other European patent laws to those of Austria. Especially this is the case with those of Bavaria, Saxony, Wiirtemberg, &c. In all, petitions, descriptions c, are required, and patents are granted for inventions introduced from abroad as well as those of domestic origin. Bavari A. Patents are granted both for inventions, discoveries, &c, of domestic and foreign origin. The term is limited, at the highest, to fifteen years, except by special grant for a longer period; and in case of the introduction of a foreign patent, the time allowed is the term still remaining of the foreign patent. The description must clearly distinguish the invention or discovery, and, if necessary, be accompanied with drawings. The petition must contain the full name and place of residence of the applicant, the characteristic marks of the invention, &c, and the term of years for which a patent is requested. The description may be sealed or left open, at the option of the applicant, the inspection of the same to be made by the proper officers. In the file enclosing the petition and description are marked the day and hour of its presentation, which determines as to the priority. The fee is, for the first five years 5 florids per year; for the next five years 10 florids each; and from the tenth year 20, 30, and so increasing each successive year 10 florids, the fifteenth year being 60 florids; in the whole fifteen years, 275 florids. Provision is made for guarding the rights of the patentee for re issue in case of defects, for extension, and assignment of patents. In the case of the transfers of patent rights, notice must be given to the proper office. Patents are also recorded, and the fact of their being granted published in the government journal; and they take effect from the time of such publication. A patent is forfeited if its novelty or priority is dis proved, and also if the payment be not made at the time appointed for each year. I infringements on the rights of patentees are punished by a fine of from 100 to 500 builders, half to the patentee and half to the poor fund, and the articles made are confiscated for the benefit of the patentee. Wurtemberg. In the kingdom of Wiirtemberg the duration of the patent is limited to ten years, except by special grant. Patents are granted both for inven1
113tions, discoveries, &c, of domestic origin, and also for the introduction of foreign patented inventions, &c. Except in cases of conflicting claims, for public reasons, public safety, e c, the specification is not made public without consent of the patentee. In the case of a domestic invention, however, it may be done in the last year of its term; and in the case of one introduced from abroad, after the first half term of the patent is expired. The fee required yearly is from five to twenty builders; half at the delivery of the patent, and the other half at the beginning of each successive year afterwards. Provision is made for punishing the violations of patent rights on corn plain of the patentee, and confiscation of the articles made, and the, payment of the value of what has been already sold, &C., for the benefit of the patentee. Punishment is also inflicted on the patentee in case that he has been guilty of wilful and intentional deception in his specification, &c. A patent is forfeited on i neglect to pay the yearly tax required, if the patentee does not put his invention, &c, into use in two years after the delivery of the patent, or at any time in the term allowed a like non use of, two years, if it is found to conflict with the public welfare, or be not novel in its character. Saxony. The patent law of Saxony limits a patent to ten years as the highest term, but it may be granted for a shorter term, and extended at the further request of the patentee. A petition, specification, model, and drawings are required. Patents are likewise granted for the introduction of foreign patents. Articular provisions exist, also, with reference to the countries embraced in the Toll Herein, on account of special treaties with the same. The, fees are regulated by the greater or less importance of the patent requested; in no case do they exceed one hundred. dollars at the first execution of the patent. The matter is referred to the Minister of the I nteriorThe above is all that we have been able to gather particularly respecting the laws of Saxony relating to patents. It is from the volume (in German) on the patent laws of various European kingdomsPRUSSI  A. The patent law of Russia allows patents for inventions, &C., of domestic origin, and also for the introduction of foreign patented articles. Application is to be made to the provincial government; a petition and specification, accurately defining the invention, &c, are required, accompanied with drawings, models, or examples, or all three if necessary ; also, specifying whether the privilege is requested for the whole or a particular part only of the kingdom, and for how long a period. The provincial government orders an examination by qualified persons, and reports the result to the Minister of Finance, who may direct another, examination or action on the basis of that of the provincial government; and decides as ; to the extent, duration, &c, of the patent to be granted, and directs the papers, drawings, and models to be carefully preserved8114
. The shortest period allowed as the term of the patent is six months; the longest fifteen years. Within six weeks from the completion of his patent, the patentee must, through the proper officers, publish the fact, and the places where he holds the patent; and also refer to the description deposited, &c. The patentee must also, within six months of the delivery of the patent, put it into use. Besides the usual expenses of of fixing the seal, (four dollars) the per qui sites (one dollar for each document) and the cost of examination, (from one to ten dollars) there are no official taxes for a patent except the expense of announcing it in all the official journals; which for a patent for the whole realm is about one hundred and thirty dollars. I infringements of patent rights are to be protected by a due course of law, the final appeal being to the Minister of Finance. The penalties inflicted are fine, confiscation, &c. Russi  A. The Russian patent law allows patents for inventions, &c, of home origin, and also for the introduction of foreign inventions, &c. The term of the former may be from five to ten years, but that of the latter cannot exceed six years. The petition or specification, clearly defining the invention, &c, is to be addressed to the Department of Manufactures and I internal Commerce, stating the time for which the patent is requested. The applicant must, at the same time, pay the fee required; which is, for three years, 90 silver rubles; for five years, 150; for ten years, 450 silver rubles; and in case of inventions or improvements from abroad, for one year, 60 silver rubles; for two years, 120; for three years, 180;for four years, 240; for five years, 300; and for six years, 360 silver rubles. The papers are transmitted to Council of Manufactures. Of satisfactory as to clear and particular detail, and it does not interfere with the public welfare, or cannot impair the revenues of the State, the Council reports it to the Minister of Finance, &c The patentee must use due diligence to bring his invention it use t least within the first quarter of the whole term of his patent. Provision is likewise made for the protection of the patentee in case of violation or infringement of his rights, so that he may recover damages, confiscation of the imitated articles made, &c. Belgi Of. The Belgian patent law is somewhat detailed and extensive, but in many respects is quite similar to those of the various German States. The following are the most essential particulars: Patents are granted for inventions, &c, of domestic origin, and likewise for the introduction of foreign ones patented abroad. The fee is from 150 to 750 florids, (3 1746 francs to 1,587.30 francs according to the time, the importance of the invention, &c patent of from five to ten years may be' further extended. In the case of a foreign patent introduced, the articles fabric a ted, &c, must be made within the realm. a. A patent entitles the owner to make, use, and sell, &c; to prosecute actions before the tribunals, and obtain a confiscation of articles made in violation of patent rights; also damages, &c. Accompanying the petition for a patent must also be a specification, sealed, with the necessary plans and drawings, which shall be published at the expiration of the patent, or sooner if required by the public welfare or for other important reasons. The petition, addressed to the King, must contain the full name and residence of the applicant, the term of the patent which is requested, and be addressed to the Register of the province, (Greffier, f c) who notes on the process verbal. or form prepared for the purpose, outside of the package, the exact date of reception this being signed by him and the applicant, to whom also a duplicate is given. It is then, together with the obligation of the applicant to receive and pay for the patent if granted, transmitted to the Commissioner General of I instruction, Arts, &c, by whom it is presented to the King, accompanied by his report, to be signed by the King. The King sometimes refers it, for further consideration, to the Royal I institute or the Academy of Sciences at Brussels. A request for an extension of the term of the patent can also be made to the Commissioner General of I instruction, &c. I improvements on existing patents are obtained with similar formalities. To assign a patent, previous permission must be obtained of the King. The transfer must likewise be registered in the registry of the province, and the same course of transmission be taken as in the obtaining of a patent. In case that, on the expiration of the patent or otherwise, the Commissioner General of I instruction, &c, does not deem it advisable to make the discovery, invention, &c, public, he reports it to the King, who decides the question. The Commissioner General of I instruction, &c, transmits the patent, after it has been signed, to the governor of the province, indicating also the price to be paid, as follows: For five years, 150 florids, (3 1746 francs for ten years, 300 or 400 florids, (63 492 francs or 846.56 francs) for fifteen years, 600 or 750 florids, (1 209 84 or 1.,587.30 francs) according to its importance, &c. For as signing a right or succession to any one, 9 florids (1904 france) is required. Should the patent at any time become null and void before 's term expires, the money paid is restored pro rat a. A registry of patents granted shall be kept for the inspection of applicants. The applicant signs an obligation to receive the patent if granted, and to pay the fee, within three months from the date of its issue, to publish it, and also put it to use in the time allowed by law, on penalty of forfeiting the patent. Holland. The law of this country very much resembles that of Belgium in most of its provisions. The term of duration is limited to five, ten, or fifteen years; and, in case of the lesser term, may be extended not, however, to exceed fifteen, years. Patents are granted for intentions, &c, of domestic origin, and also for introducing foreign patents 116 Dec. No. 52. The patentee or his as signs, &c, is entitled to make, sell, &c; to protection of his rights by; due course of law, &c; to recover damages, &c. With the petition must also be presented a specification, plans, drawings, &c, which, after the expiration of the patent, or for. important reasons previous, t shall be published. Of the patentee, &c, does not put his patent to use within two years from the date of its being granted, it is void. The petition to the King, specification, &c, stating the all name, residence, &c, are filed with the Register of the State, who endorses on the form prepared for the purpose the day of the reception, which is also subscribed by him, and by the applicant, who likewise receives a duplicate of the same. In ten days the package must be sent t to the Commissioner General of I instruction, Arts, &c, who transmits it, with his report, to the King. All assign rents must be by authority of the King; and, on penalty of the forfeiture of the patent, due notice be given to the chancellor of the States of the provinces. The same is the case respecting rights by succession or inheritance. Due. notice must be given to the provincial chancellor, who transmits it to: the Commissioner General of ,I instruction, Arts, &c. -a. The fees are the same as in Belgium. The provisions respecting the violations of patent rights, confiscation of imitated articles, &e, are likewise the same as in Belgium, already mentioned. Papal States. According to the patent law of the. papal States, the enactments ofvlhich bear the sanction of Cardinal Galeffi, patents: are granted for discoveries, inventions, &c, of domestic origin, or for the introduction into use of foreign articles patented or un patented for not less than five, nor more that fifteen years. I case, however, inventions, &c; already known from abroad by r printed 'works, are introduced into use, protection is granted only for from three to six years. The d eyes are determined by the importance of the invention, &c. ; also, the time of the duration of the patent is fixed by the same rule. A petition, specification, plans, drawings, sections, models, and examples, in duplicate, are required, signed and sealed by the applicant, having the date of presentation, &c. The office places on the outside the date of reception, in order to determine the question of the; priority, &c. When the term has been fixed upon, it is published in :the Via rio diRomna. The patentee is now entitled to use or .dispose of his rights too legal protection, &c. The patent is annulled or forfeited if a month elapses over the r prescribed time of payment without the fee being paid in, as well as for various other reasons similar to those of most countries. The tax or fee required is ten dollars for one year; and for the introduction to use of an already known invention, &c, fifteen dollars for one year. I I f an extension of the term be desired, one third more must be paid the first payment in all cases -to be: of the delivery of thepatenttthesecond within the first quarter of each successive year of its term.

I am aware that the fire backs of fireplaces have been made separate, to admit of removing them when burnt out; but I am not aware that that part of the front plate of the air chamber of a range which constitutes the fire back has been made separate from and to cover the hole in the front plate of the air chamber, which is cast in one piece, with the ends and part of the top and bottom. It will be obvious that a different result is attained by this arrangement, for the fire back, as heretofore made, is attached all around to the .fireplace, so that when the middle, which is subjected to the greatest range of heat, expands and contracts, the plate is much strained, and necessarily cracks in the middle or opens the joints; results entirely avoided by my improvement. I do not therefore claim simply making the fire back of a separate plate, for this would not attain the end contemplated; but what I do claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is making that part of the front and top plate of the air chamber, which constitutes the five back, separate from and attached to the front plate of an air chamber cast with the ends, top, and bottom, substantially in the manner and for the purpose specified.

Erastus Corni Of. James Of Orner. Doc.  To 2. No. 79. Having thus fully described my invention, I wish it to be fully understood that I do not claim the use of the galvanic current or currents of electricity, for the. purpose of telegraph in communication, but what I especially claim is may invention and improvement in making use of the motive power of magnet ism, when developed by the action of such current or currents, as a means of operating and giving motion to machinery, which may be used to imprint signals upon paper or other suitable material, or to produce sounds in any desired manner, for the purpose oftelegraphic communication. The only ways in which the galvanic current has heretofore been proposed to be used is by decomposition, and the action or exercise of the defective force of a current upon a magnetisedbar or needle, and the decompositions and deflections thus produced were the subject of inspection, and had no power of recording the communication. I therefore characterize my invention as the first recording or printing telegraph by means of electro magnet ism. There are various known modes of producing motions by electro magnet ism, but none of these have hitherto been applied to actuated or give motion to printing or recording machinery, which is the chief point of my invention and improvement. I also claim the system of signs, consisting of dots and lines, substantially as herein set forth and illustrated, in combination with the telegraph for recording signals. I also claim the types and rule, in combination with the signal levers, as herein described, for the purpose of connecting and breaking the current of galvanism and electricity.
