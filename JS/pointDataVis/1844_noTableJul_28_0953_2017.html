Ordered to be printed, and that 20,000 additional copies (omitting the lists of patents) be finished, 19500 of which for the use of the Senate, and 500 for the use of the Commissioner of Fatentspatent O Ercj, January 28, 1845. The Commissioner of Patents has the honor to submit his annual report or the year ending with the close of 1844. Give hundred and two patents have been issued during the year 1844,including seven reissues, twelve designs, and five additional improvements to former patents, of which classified and alphabetical lists are annexed, I marked N and O. I During the same period, five hundred and thirty-nine patents have ex i rd, as per list marked P. The applications for patents during the year past amount to one thousand land forty-five, and the number of caveats filed was three hundred and eighty. The receipts of the office for the year 1844 amount to forty-one thousand two hundred and twenty dollars and six cents, from which are to be deduced, repaid on applications withdrawn, as per statement marked A, ten thousand and forty dollars The ordinary expense of the Patent. Office for the past year have been, twenty-four thousand two hundred and twenty-eight dollars and four cents to which add, for library and agriculture, two thousand and; seventy-six dollars and forty-nine cents, leaves a net t balance of six thousand one hundred and sixty for dollars and seventy-three cents, to be credited to the a tent fund, as per statement marked For the restoration of models, records, and drawings, under, the act of March, 1837, the sum of two thousand eight hundred and twenty dollars and sixty-six cents, as per statement marked 0. The whole number of patents issued by the United States, up to January845, is fourteen thousand and twenty-four. Although: the number of patents granted the past year is .of so great as that of the year previous, it will be seen that there is an excess of applications to the amount of two hundred and twenty-six- , .a: : ;i The increase of models renders daily the transaction of business more 75 2 difficult. The models of the patented inventions are crowded so much as to prevent classification; while models of rejected applications, equally important for exhibition, to enable supposed inventors to settle doubts as to originality, are not exhibited at all. It has been hoped that the large upper hall, designed originally for models, would not be diverted to other objects without some substitute being furnished. The beautiful collection of curiosities, however, from various parts of the world, forming the iationalGallery, are too important and interesting to be crowded out. There seems to be no alternative but to extend the building. This can be done at a moderate expense, if the work is performed by contract, under careful supervision. To new plan need now be presented. The original design contemplated two additional wings, one of which, added on the west side, would give sufficient accommodation by furnishing continuous rooms for models and the gallery. The number of applications for the extension of patents during 1844 was twelve Two were granted, and ten rejected. The board of commissioners have extended seven patents since the act of Congress approved 4th July, 1836,Patenteesseem to think, that if they pay the fee required, and show that, they .have not made the patent profitable, (and especially if no objection is urged by the public against the extension) that the extension will be allowed as a matter of course forgetting that all patents granted prior to the reorganization of the Patent Office in 1836 were not subject to examination as to novelty; ;in other words, any applicant prior to that time, who was willing to swear that he was the first and original incid127ventor, could demand a patent, leaving the courts to settle questions of utility and originality. Any patents granted prior to 1836 do not, therefore, contain any merit, and an extension of the same would only end in disappointment, if the originality were tested. By reference to the decisions of the board of commissioners, composed of the Secretary of State, the Commissioner of Patents, and the Solicitor of the Treasury" it appears that extension of patents cannot be expected when the invention is trivial, and where the right to use and v end the same has been un molested; or where the machine is not complicated, and little expenditure of time or money is necessary to introduce it they believing, it is supposed, that it would be better thus to place before the patentee (who ca deprive the public of the use of the invention) the strongest motives to bring the same into immediate use upon fair and equitable terms, rather that delay with indifference fourteen years, thinking that he can :get an extension for seven years more. If patents were extended upon applications as a matter of course, it is evident most patentees would apply, and thus make the: duration of all: patents equivalent to twenty-one years crowding too, upon the board of commissioners, an amount of .extra labor which they could not possibly discharge. -of     t may here be remarked, t that, however desirous Congress might have been i to make the section of the patent law: under which patents are extended clear and explicit, much litigation has arisen upon its construction and I feel compelled e to .me lit ion the contradictory. decisions, that furliterlegislation may be had; if deemed expedientTlhe '8th section is, i the folio in: words: "A icid127d e it ftherinaed, That while never any patentee of an invention or discovery shall desire an extension of i hi patent beyond the : arm of its d imitation, e i ,may make applicavih n th.efor in writing to the Codn3 [a[ 75 missioner of the Patent Office setting forth the grounds thereof; and the Commissioner shall, on 0 the applicants paying the sum of forty dollars to the credit of the Treasury, ,as i the case of an original application for a patent, cause. to be published in one or more of the principal newspapers in the city of Washington, and in such other paper or papers as he may deem .proper, published in the section of country most interested adverse ly to. the extension of the patent, a notice of such application, and of the time and place when and where, the same will be: considered, that any person may appear and show cause why the extension should not be granted and the Secretary of State, the, Commissioner of the Patent Office, and the Solicitor of the Treasury, shall constitute a board to hear and decide upon the evidence produced before them, both for and against the extension, and shall sit for that purpose at the time and place designated in the published notice thereof. The patentee shall furnish to said board a statement, in writing, under oath, of the ascertained value of the invention, and of his receipts and expenditures, sufficiently in detail to exhibit a true and faithful account of loss and profit in any manner according to him from and by reason of said invention. And if, upon a hearing of the matter, it shall appear, to the full and entire satisfaction of said board, having due regard to the public interest therein, that it is just and proper that the term of the patent should be extended, by, reason of the patentee, without neglect or fault on his part, having failed to obtain, from the use and sale of his invention, a reasonable regeneration for the time, ingenuity, and expense, bestowed upon the same, and the introduction thereof into use, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner to renew and extend the patent, by making a certificate thereon of such extension, for the term of seven years from and after the expiration of the first term; which certificate, with a certificate of said board of their judgment and opinion as aforesaid, shall be entered on record in the Patent Office; and thereupon the said patent shall have the same effect in law as though ;it had been originally granted for the term of twenty-one years; and the benefit of such renewal shall extend to as signers and grandees of the right to use the thing patented, to the extent of their respective interests therein: Provided, however, That no extension of a patent shall be granted after the expiration of the term for which it was originally issued tt may not be improper here to notice the construction of this section by the board of commissioners, whose duties are defined by it, viz: that the benefit of the extension inured to as signers according to their respective interest in the thing patented, be it more or less, whether it be a right to use the specific machine or article sold, or a right to make and sell in a town, county, or State. Had the board doubted upon this point, I feel no hesitation in saving that they never would have consented, "having a due regard to the public interests" to the extension of several patents which have been extended. If the benefit of extension were confined to the patentee alone, assignees1however late their purchase, and however much they might have expended in fixtures, might, be at once enjoined even from using the very article purchase da result certainly wholly unexpected to the assigned when heebitered into covenant with the patentee. I n the district embracing New England, as signers have, by the circuijge: of that district, been enjoined fully, in numerous cases, and corn p a e to purchase even the right to use the invention aft i exteri6biiof the up a te tt .a." .a' *a* -a* -75] 4 n the district of Maryland, l however before the Chief Us tie o of the United States, the same point has arisen, and, after full argument and nature consideration, been decided directly to the contrary, viz : that the extension of a patent does injure for the benefit off the assigned. Various decisions have beer i made in circuit courts, where the same was held by the district judge, differing from each other. It is highly important, therefore, that the question of benefit of the extension should be speedily set tied by further legislation or by the Supreme Court . The success which i i as attended the efforts of American inventors, by taking out patents in Europe, will induce mi any others to secure the same privileges. Hence the frequent inquiry at the Patent Office, how can patents be obtained abroad ?a? Although willing to communicate all information on this subject that I possess, other duties do not permit me to reply ti letters received containing such inquiries. To gratify inventors, I have annexed a brief sycosis (marked E) of the general regulation for taking out patents in foreign countries. With pleasure will it be noticed, that in no country are p tents obtained so cheap, or with so little delay, as in the United States; and yet inventors here are proverb i ally impatient The increasing business of this office will soon demand additional force. In the mean time, I cannot omit to present to the consideration of Congress the claims of the scientific corps who conduct the business of the office to a more adequate compensation for their services. I do not allude to the salary of the Commissioner of Patents. Deep study and a knowledge of different languages, a minute acquaintance with the arts and sciences, and much experience, are all required, to fit an individual for the office of examiner and yet his pay is only             $1,500--less than is paid for clerical duties in many of the bureaus. The present compensation will be inadequate to induce those now in the office to remain, and much more to replace the assistance needed, if a vacancy occurs. One examiner has already tendered his resignation, and consented to remain, in the hope of further legislation. I beg to ask, if, while the income of the office is fully sufficient to meet all necessary expense, whether it would not be a matter of the deepest regret to part with experienced help, for new and untried hands. What blunders, what errors, what litigation, would ensue! The public, it is hoped, have some confidence in the office. If this confidence is lost, dissatisfaction would arise, and appeals take place. It is due to the corps in this office to say, that their pay is much less than is made to other officers in like capacities. The following sums are paid, viz :to the chief of the coast survey -a-    $6,000To one assistant .3500To two assistants -3500To three assistants .3500To four assistants -2000 To five assistants -a." -2000 To six assistants -2000 in weights and measures -2500 n the navy Engineers for planning engines -3000 Principal engineer for superintending and constructing steam engines -a- .a. 500 Chief naval construct or- -3o00Assistant -a' -2005 -75SUnited States mintCoiner -000Assayer- -2000 helter -a- -2000Egravr- -2000 Other instances might be cited. It must be admitted, that the discharge of the duties of several of the above stations does not demand the talents or acquirements necessary for an examiner of patents, who, must have a knowledge of the physical sciences, and understand their application to those branches of industry to which they are adapted: .possessing, also, a knowledge of the patent law, the decisions of the courts, and at least an acquaintance with: the French language. : -:-A reference to the report of the examiner of patents, transmitted with this and my last report will :show .their duties, and the abilities necessarytqdischarge them. .a. I tis a happy circumstance, that few changes have taken ,place in the effective force of this office since my connexion with it. We have every year enjoyed the benefit of accumulated experience. Of     have, however, to record with sorrow the sudden death of the late chief clerk, Mr. And, a few months since. His removal has been mourned by all his associates- He possessed pre eminently qualifications needed a this desk and has left an -example worthy of imitation, adding alo1therproof that a faithful discharge of public duties is not incompatible with the life of a devout Christian. .a. I have added to i my report the claims allowed on patents granted, and again requested the, re part of the examiners on the progress of the arts during 1844, (see F arid G,) believing the same will be read with interest, while they will remain on the archives of the office, to instruct those who survive in this department. :I this a matter of proud congratulation, that we witness the rapid advancement of the arts and sciences on this side of the Atlantic, and to hear how frequently the skill and experience, of our citizens are purchased by the wisest monarchs of Europe. The liberality with which our artisans :se compensated abroad is the highest proof of their superiority. Our manufactures are extending throughout the world. Thesocean and the land alike bear testimony to American ingenuity. Raise is but tribute due to her Constitution and the laws, which extend equal rights and i privileges to all. -a. :among the most, brilliant discoveries of the age, the eleetromagnetie, telegraph deserves a conspicuous place. Destined as it is to change as well as hasten transmission of intelligence, and so essentially to affect the welfare of society, all that concerns its further developments will be hailed with joy. Of     imagination can scarcely conceive what is now. accomplished by the electric fluid, when confined and tamed, as it were, to the purposes of life is, dance is annihilated thought has found a, competitor. For is it less gratifying that this invention is American. To a native citizen belongs the merit of the discovery; and it is hoped that the country of his birth will re, and ^him accordingly. The public, at first could scarcely believe it possible that intelligence can be sent at the rate of 188,000 miles in a second nor that the earth would suffice for half of the, current of communication ;en or that currents of electricity from opposite poles would traverse the[ 75 6 same wire at the same time, turning out as it wereiitn as sing east i other. Such are proved to be facts. One discovery presses upon the heeisofanother. The desideratum of furnishing electricity by mechanical iieaaisis at length found. This discovery, the hand maid of the telegraph, belongs to another of the sons of New England. The practice ability of this last invention has been fully tested for 40 miles, leaving no do blot that it will succeed wherever the battery would answer. :A i fuller description of this invention of.

Now this is done, will be seen by averting to the diagrams on the paper sub joined, marked I. The numerous requests for information respecting the telegraph since my former report are my apology for inserting in this report some facts mentioned hitherto, since all that is given seems necessary to a fulicoimprehension of this highly exciting subject. This report 'may go into new a hands, who cannot readily refer to a former one, and who: will be glad to find all condensed in the one now transmitted to Congress. The annual agricultural statistics, comprising the tabular estimate of the crops the past year, with accompanying remarks arid appendix, will be found sub joined, marked D. If the length of the document is objectionable, I will only say that I have deemed it more acceptable to the public to give the facts, established, than deductions i front them; more especially, as no conclusive opinion can be justly formed on contradictory statements respecting some important subjects. The science of agriculture has now become a study, and much greater improvement may be expected. Worn out lands, that ~have been, as it were, abandoned, are now being reclaimed, under scientific treatment. Guess work and 'hereditary notions are yielding to analysis and the application of chemical principles. The writings of learned: agriculturists in Europe are translated into the English language thus pouring a body 'of new: light upon the path of the husband man. Some extracts from the celebrated On: Hers Principles of Agriculture will be found in one of the appendixes to the agricultural report. They evince the deep research and patient investigation of that distinguished philanthropist. Littlecid127isaccomplished in any science without perseverance.

The truth of this general remark may be illustrated by a recent attempt to solve the' difficulty in granulating the sir up of corn s talks. Scientific gentlemen at First pronounced the sugar from corn stalk to be grape sugar only, and hencecrystallization could hardly be expected. Such disappointed in the result, I transmitted to Boston: some of the sugar made by Mr. :ebb, of Delaware, and' requested another analysis.

Laborsavingmachines are being introduced with still greater success. in owing and reaping will, it is believed, o ont be chiefly per for ed on smooth land by horse power. Some have regretted that modern improvements n make so important changes of employment but the march of the arts and sciences is onward, and the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the motto of the patriot. This is promoted by facilities in production i, h either in manufactures or agriculture; and, if we are to compete with the: for dat large, we must readily embrace the offer of genius and skill ; we miss it yield to competitors equal i fertility of soil, and win the race by superior industry and intelligence. There is, however, a dark 'loud which lowers over the Republic. Theinctbns debt has lost its terrors, and obligation carries with it little self reproach. Last experience is disregarded. The importation of goods intothe .united States during the last year will equal one hundred and fiftyhiinliofs of dollars. Happily for' citizens of this country, a portion of the goods imported have been sent on consignment, to be sold for the benefit of foreign manufacturers; and hence they must share in the loss. Still, these goods, if purchased, must be paid for in produce or specie. If importation s must be increased, it is deeply to be regretted that it should take place when the value of agricultural products has so greatly diminished. Unforituiately, American stocks, once sought by of reign capitalists, are now refused; confidence is lost. The Said of England is leaning its capital at 2. percent. per annum, while our State stocks, bearing 6,and even 7 per cent are fabelopar. Was not the time arrived for the South and the: North to cormtniencbe r entrenchment and practise more rigid economy- The wheel of fortune will not turn out prizes, nor can patents be granted for paying debts. These i must be worked out in the old fashioned way; and when the people shall take a sober estimate of life, and moderate their wishes to their circumstances, then, and not till then, will they find permanent relief.

The foregoing table 'embraces essultshich are founded of the safi general elements 'f estimate as were described in the reports of the two preceding years, and which need not be here repeated with particular it y. It can in be expected that in every case we should be able to arrive at correct results. Any things enter into the judgment of those on whose information we must in no small degree de p end, which will cause variations of opinion respecting the same crop in any particular district of country. Even in the case of the census, taken by persons especially appointed and sworn to the faithful performance of their duties, we find that perfect reliable accuracy is not always to be obtained. It could therefore hardly be expected that, in holding a fair balance between conflicting opinions, and thus deciding upon even an approximate estimate of the different crops, great difficulty should not be experienced Subsequent information may sometimes enable us to correct former data, and thus give a nearer approach to truth in particular cases; and no pains have been spared to accomplish so desirable a result. Some success has crowned these efforts, and an advance, it is believed, has been made in i his respect in the present report. An error has crept into the tabular i stimiateand has been continued down from 1841, in dropping the millionth period in the crops of I indian corn and sugar of New Hampshire. His has been corrected in the present report. A great mass of information has been collected from a variety of sources. Public journals from' every quarter of the country, including accounts from between 25 and 30 agricultural papers, have been carefully examined, and whatever related to the prospect or appearance of the crops, from the beginning to the end of the season, has been gleaned out and treasured up. These notices have been digested and i ma bodied with such other knowledge as could be obtained from personal conversation and observation, as well as from the circus 6 r sent fro i the office to numerous individuals who were presumed to be able to afford aid in effecting the object in view. Gilt his account, and because not the exact language is sometimes employed, it is not easy at all times to give the credit to the sources of our information ; and it is hoped that this will be remembered by the editors of the public journals, should they recognise the scraps which have been here and there cut from columns, and interwoven With others of various kinds. The columns in the table, for greater convenience, have only been i filled, in most cases, with round numbers, leaving off the fraction al parts, which were retained heretofore because they were originally found in the census returns, which were made the as is in b the outset of onstrutinthe tabular estimate. In the case of the estimated increase of population, we have adopted the actual census, as n mentioned in some of the public journals with reference to the States of Alabama and Missouri, and Wisconsin" and   own Territories. ' .further: in forming the columns of the table, with regard to th crops, reference has likewise been made to a variety of causes, which 'must' nm re or less influence the state of the markets, as well as also the fact of the attention being directed to particular crops. It is welt known that rid w and then a favorite crop, for reasons either apparent or otherwise lost its :interest with cultivates, and the industry before devoted to 'it il dire ted to some other crop or pursuit. The quantities raised in ,ad section of ;he co u try, or generally, should the blue prove notre extenisiveaf h 6ff ida of thQs1475the aggregate amount, is lessened. A ,familiar instant of this is the case of some of the grains which have been formerly used in the distillation of spirituous liquors; the comparative growth of which has ,beienhecked: by the stricter re gird fr the habits of temperance which have happily becopmesopQI h. more prevalent. in t would be a greet i mistake, also, to disregard the con t need a dance of agriculture by the means of improvement which are so steadily cherished by an increasing body of our intelligent farmers. There is a beautiful connexion .between the progress of the, mechanics arts and the development of the iiatiral productions of the soil. The, genius which puts into the hands of the agriculturists the .machine. by which he may plough, now. reap thresh, or shell out, ten times the usual amount performed by the same number of individu pals, of course is lifting him with increased power of turning his labor to advantage, provided the market keeps pace with such advance of product. The same may be said with respect to the great fertility secured by different compounds, which, by the aid of chemistry, have been applied to the soil, The, farmer may thus often spare himself much hard toi, while he is at the same time enabled to reap the more surely the fruition his labor. These changes are not so apparent from one year to another as by t aiding a survey of the state of things at an interval of perhaps some ten, fifteen, or twenty years, or more. Thus, to go back and re trace the appearance of implements of agriculture the modes of tillage, and the various relations of stock, breeds, <a name="seeds4"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and manures, to the .farmers domain, we. are struck by the improvement which has been obtained. And i we go balk still further, to the days of our Saxon, ancestors, it. would appear from the ancient manuscripts that the ploughs used then were as simple as those used in modern I india; and at as i ate a period as 1634, we learn that, in I re land, by the: act of 11 and -12 Charles I, an act was passed to this effect: " An act against sloughing, by the table and pulling, fool off living sheep such of this improvement secured is due to the enterprise of individuals in .war vous. sections, who have .set in motion agricultural societies and journals, imported <a name="seeds5"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, animals c, from abroad, as well as to the inventive power of the industrious artisans~ who in too many instances finds but a small return for his pains in contributing to the prosperity of the sons oft hi; icid127i. in farmer, should recollect, that for his plough, his harrow, rake, spade, and scythe, his reaping, threshing, and win no wing machines, &c, he, is indebted to ;the mechanics; and just in the degree in which, these instruments of his. toil are improved, may he find additional ease and comfort in his method f corn due acting his business. :a.

A comparison of these papers at the present day with those published some twenty years since will show how far the science and art of agriculture has advanced in t this period. The prejudice which improvements suggested by science have sometimes to combat is well described, though somewhat sarcastically, in the following extract from the He vue Scintglque, in an article on manures, which we take from an agricultural journal. The writer says : "among others, were collect the jokes, the epigrams, the vituperations, uttered upon Farce t, A mille Beauvais and his pupils, a few years ago, because they had the audacity to make the raising of silk worms a scientific affair. 'that said they, ' does not the south of France know how to raise silk worms, after having tried it for centuries ?a? I s it in the south of France that the fine folks know all about silk worms, because they have raised four worms in a little desk c 6 Oh fig! Mr. Farce t !a! Mr. Beauvais You are mere theorists !a! You are mere parlor farmers !a" However, (thanks to their noble studies !thanks to their perseverance !a) the silk culture of :the south of France is wholly regenerated. They now can work at it almost with certainty of success. Their production of silk is already doubled, and all the former chances of loss are diminished onehalfMr. Vol mats Observations on European Agriculture, in the course of publication, under a liberal patronage, may very probably add to the stock of knowledge, by contributing much material relating to the economy of the farm, based on long and careful experience, dire end to the aim of increased improvement. It is gratifying to observe, in the examination i of the notices and reports of the numerous agricultural societies, the very decided advance which is making in the various departments of agricultural labor. The premiums, either intrinsic ally valuable or merely honor are, have stimulated honest industry, and in many cases tracts comparatively barren have been rendered fruitful, and difficulties which seemed insurmountably have been readily overcome. It augury well for the hope of future extended benefits, that the number of those associations is increasing; and the numerous records of the pro directions of the soil, the dairy, the orchard, farm yard, and household, thus presented, slow that, the attention directed to these objects is not without effect. The gain of up any parts of our country, in consequence of these means, is estimated by good judges at not less than 2 or 30, and eve as high sometimes as 50 per, cent, Large ,crops, improved farms, and better <a name="seeds6"><mark>seeds</mark></a> implements of agriculture, manners and modes Of, plicatidiare the happy rest its the, difftoti f a generous spirit ofmiilatipn thus encouraged.

A fe cent foreign paper speaks of an agricultural convention held at It, Q tin ri, in the north of France, by the proprietors, which might be verypiofitably imitated on an extensive $ came in our own country. It was attended by the deputies, members of the councils general, and upwards of three hundred practical farmers, who passed three successive days in discussing the best means of improving the breed of horses and cattle of all kinds, the growth and importation of oleaginous <a name="seeds7"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, wool, hemp, and flax, the cultivation of waste lands, and other important questions. I twas also decided that a general association of the northern departments i similar to those in Normandy and Brittany, should be formed, and its first meeting should be held next year at Lamb ray. We cannot doubt that such measures among us would have a most happy effect in diffusing in, intelligence on important agricultural subjects; and it is. to. be hoped that many years will not elapse before the conviction of its beneficial effects will prompt to the enterprise. The great Father of his Country, who watched with an eagle eye for her welfare, earnestly recommended means for such an object, the benefits of which would be realized, as he says, "by drawing to a common centre the results every where of individual skill and observation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation Another cause, which deserves to be considered in forming the estimate, is found in the effect of a rapidly increasing population in portions of our country. In some of the new States the lands are becoming yearly more and more brought under tillage. Thousands of acres thus add to the amount of produce; so that the effect of the season, even in the years Which are most un propitious, is in some degree repaired. The number of persons landed in this country as emigrants, during the past year, is said to have been 84,674. To take a single instance, by, way of illustration : It appears, by the census of last spring, that the population of I own amounted to 82,000 ; and allowing to the estimate 10,000 increase a year, for the last three or four years, which is said not to be too large, it now amounts to not less than about 90,000. Of course, as most of these are- agriculturists, there' must have been a very considerable increase, of the quantity of land thus brought under cultivation iii that Territory. The same may be said of Arkansas, Missouri, and some of the other more recent States. This will affect the particular crops raised in those States. Besides this, there are other lands in the process of clearing up, which, for the first time, each year receive and produce a crop. These add very considerably to the amount, Notwithstanding, too, the low prices of the markets and the great surplus of produce, there is still a disposition to increase the amount sown, i in the hope, it may be, of some favorable change i the 'demand for the proud it. All these things tend to make il for loses from o the causes; so that, on the whole, there is no sens i .i diminution in many of the imstiniportant tops. S- The Season. An attempt has again been made to estimate the influence of the season, by ]collecting notices of the state of the weather, from i the earliest periodirnwhich the various crops could He supposed to be rich affected by the diversity of the same 17 75 in extensive examination has been entered into; and by comparing the journals of one month with another, published in many parts of the country, the following conclusions have been reached There appears to have been no very extensive injury from the effect of the cold winter or spring, though we meet with occasional notices of the grain being winter killed. Nothing like uniformity can be expected in so widespread a territory, embracing many degrees of latitude. While winter reigns in one section, spring may be breaking in another; and while heat is drying up the ground in one, in another refreshing showers may revive the drooping vegetation. A kind Providence has thus guarded us from the severity of either extreme of our climate. Seldom is it that we are called to notice any meteorological cause which has affected the whole country. During the past year, there has been, as usual, important alternations of the weather. Partial damage is now and then noted, as resulting from the occasional frosts of spring extended into summer ; but the injury has been quite limited. Thus we find notices like the following :michigan City, I n diana, May 21.-'" Last night we were visited with one of the severe st frosts ever witnessed here at this season of the year. Destroyed corn, <a name="potatoes0"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, vines, &c, and all kinds of fruit, and actually freezing the ground in some places. It is confidently asserted by some farmers today, that the wheat is greatly injured, if not in some sections entirely ruined; the truth of which I cannot decide, but a few days will determine Marshall, Michigan, May 23.-" For some days past, it has been cold and rainy; but on Monday it cleared up, and we were visited on Monday and Tuesday nights with very severe frost, which has doubtless destroyed all kinds of fruit in this region n other sections, at this early period, apprehensions are expressed on account of the want of rain, and yet in others rain was most abundant. Thusgreenville, South Carolinathe prospect of fine crops was never more flattering in the upper districts than at this time. In some neighborhoods, however, they have suffered severely from drought, and immediately under the mountains from too much rain. The wheat crop produced abundantly. Pass ville, Georgiafor eight weeks we have had scarcely sufficient rain to lay the dust. Drops are in a bad condition. The o at crop is entirely ruined. The wheat and corn corps will be cut very short. Watched, May 4.-" Unquestionably, and beyond the shadow of doubt, the prospect for the crops now planted has not been as un promising for twenty-five years. We have had the longest and severe st drought ever known at this season, causing a complete check to vegetation. There is nothing in the fields for insects to feed upon, and consequently the cotton is cut down by worms, cater pillars, and grasshoppers, as soon as it makes its appearance through the surface. 'I thousands and thousands of acres are now being ploughed and planted over, and the demand for cotton seed is great so great, that-one dollar per bushel has been paid for large quantities. He plant about two bushels to the acre New Orleans Picayune. It is certainly singular, that while the planters on the Mississippi are complaining of the drought, and many of them despairing of making anything like an average crop, those in the western part of Arkansas are in a predicament nearly as bad, from too much wet weather. The An Buren  intelligence r of the 4th instant says : " Perhaps there have been few seasons more un propitious to the farmer than the present. Pains have been 2[ 75] 18 frequent and excessive for two or three months, and the greeks and streams have been so extraordinarily high, that inter communication has been nearly cut off. We have heard that several mills have been swept away, and many farmers have not yet planted their corn. As for those on the river, they have nothing ahead but the prospect of an overflow, or actual ones where the land is low n the northern section of our country, for the most .part, the earliest period of the summer was favorable. In . I own, however, we find, mention of an immense quantity of rain in June: Such was the case in I illinois and parts of I n diana and Missouri, by which the Mississippi and its branches were much raised, and vast injury done. Large tracts of country on the Mississippi and its branches had their crops destroyed by the overflow. I n some parts of the South, the rains were likewise severe, while in other parts the drought exerted a withering influence. Thus it is said" Parish of He Soto, august 30, 1841.--I t is impossible to give you anything like a correct account of the loss occasioned to the .cotton planters here by the late severe seven weeks' drought. To my knowledge, crops in this immediate vicinity are reduced from 1,200 to 550, and even 400 pounds weight per acre, owing to the plant shedding the balls; and it is too late in the season now for new growth to mature and yield. The products of cotton r in the three parishes of He Soto, Natchitoches, and Had do, taken collectively, are cut short nearly one half." Again, atCheraw, South Carolina" This present month of July will be noted for intense heat and. protracted drought. The surrounding country has suffered incalculable for the want of rain. The corn crop is materially affected, and even cotton, which up to within a few days promised a most abundant yield, has commenced shedding its balls to an almost incredible length :or. Loud, of Alabama, says : " We experienced a most injurious drought in the early part of summer, which we supposed for a while had cut off the crops one half n some parts of the country, in July, the pastures and crops suffered from heat. Thus, a letter from Philadelphia of the 16th, says: In riding 50 miles in the country, we noticed the pastures drying up in every direction, &c. Towards the latter part of summer, in the months of August and September, especially of September, we find great complaint of a most extensive drought along the whole Atlantic coast. Considerable streams were dried up, and great fears were entertained for some important crops Notices like the following are frequent The Sang or (paine) Courier says: "he learn that in some of the interior towns of this county the drought is quite severe, many of the springs and brooks being dried up, and the cattle suffering The Farmers' Monthlyvisiter, of September 30, published in Concord, New Hampshire, says: .i The month of September has been both dry and hot. I need, there has been very little rain since July ; and for the last twenty days the streams have been dried up, the springs and wells below the surface have failed, and the earth has become like powder for several inches, "again, a Boston paper says." Cry weather has now continued several weeks, and vegetation iswhiheied and parched, and our wells and cisterns are getting low, while matter and other necessaryes of life are getting high. The streets and roads in the vicinity of Boston are enveloped in could$ of dust. Grapes are be 19 [a[ 75 coming prematurely ripe, and the hills and rivers in the interior are almost dried up, which of course diminishes the power of' the water, and checks the speed and puts a full stop to many mechanical and manufacturing operations. The Albany Org us says: "a. The country in this vicinity begins to be fairly baked with drought. Springs are so far dried up in the back towns in this county, that farmers are compelled to go half a mile to water their cattle. This drought exceeds any thing we have had since the summer of 1841. As might be. anticipated, the river is very low; the weather also continues very war in n a Rochester paper is the following description: " We are in the midst of an unparalleled drought. The earth in city and country is as dry as a powder house. Vegetation of all kinds looks as though it had been hissed by fire. We have had but two or three showers during the last four or five weeks, and they were light. The bed of the Genesee is nearly bare, and most of our mills are idle for want of water. Any of the wells in the city are dry, and all of. them are unusually low- Our principal public houses are not only obliged to go over a mile for every drop of water they use for cooking and drinking, but have to pay for it :i the barrel." Any of our farmers have already sown their wheat, but the seed will be a long time in terminating, unless we are favored with rain. The warm weather has hastened the' ripe king of corn, which is now entirely out of danger from the frost" The protracted drought under which the country is suffering has so dried the streams that the mills at Paterson have not, for the last few weeks, run at more than half speed, and one or two hard to stop entirely for want of water. The Paterson I intelligence r states that the quantity of water in the Assail is less at present than it has been since 1819. Not a drop has passed over the falls for some time. Little or no business is done on the Morris canal, for want of water. "newark Daily .advertise r. The learn that, so great has been the drought in the interior, that some of the transportation lines to Pittsburgh have stopped running their boats until the canals are replenished with water. The Schuylkill, at Hair mount, is now .lower than it has previously been since the dam was constructed Philadelphia North american." The surrounding country" says the Philadelphia Ledger, f is suffering severely from the long continued dry weather. At Line cum, but a short distance below the city, it is said that not a drop of rain has fallen for the last three months The Alexandria Gazette says: ' The drought is most excessive and injurious. A ride across the country, on Thursday last, in Marylandfromthe Potomac to the Patuxent, gave us an idea of what actual suffering there is on account of the want of rain.  Nothing like it has been seen in this section for many years, if at all. The Richmond Compile r says : "to rain yet in this section of the country, and we learn there is great suffering in a large section of the country bet when this and the Blue Ridge. It is now, we believe, a month since we had rain, or more than the merest sprinkle. Even the trees seem to be affected the foliage of many of our city trees displaying the s ere and yellow leaf. During the greater part of the drought, the weather has been excessively warm, and the heat of the sun so great as to march and blight al vegetation. Our markets exhibit the sad effects of this in a striking degree[ 75 320' The Norfolk Herald is rejoicing over a rain, which appears to have been much needed. It says the rain was very seasonable to the farmers, and has doubtless raised the water' in the canal, which, owing to the almost unprecedented drought, had previously decreased so much that several vessels were detained at both ends, for want of a sufficient depth to carry them through." The drought above the falls, at James river, except in neighborhoods favored by partial showers, has been most affliction and, for the period of its duration, severe beyond example. The corn crop, until it got into the roasting ear state as promising of a super abundant harvest as it could be, has been in various quarters of the great region between the head of the tide and the Blue Ridge, immensely curtailed possibly one half, and in many cases three fifths, or even three-fourths; leaving it questionable if a crop, which, in July, promised to bring corn down, for the first time, to             $1.25 per barrel, will now make bread for the country. This is more especially, according to our information, true of the south of James river perhaps equally true of the north side, after entering, twenty miles above this, the region which Olney predicted, when he passed through it, would, one day or other, from drought, become another Arabia Desert a." A gentleman, who has recently been in Range county, North Carolina, informs us that the crops between this city and H1illsborough are very indifferent, having been told by the planters on the road that scarcely half a crop will be averaged. It is attributed to the drought, which continued for several months, at a season when rain was most needed" The weather" says the Green ville (S. C.) Mountaineer of the 13th instant, ' during the past week or ten days, has been oppressively hot, dry, and sultry the thermometer ranging from 90 to 92 degrees in the middle of nearly every day. The streets and roads are so dusty that travellers and others suffer severely from its effects. The water courses are unusually low, and many wells and springs in the upper country have entirely failed. In fact, we have had the longest, most dry, and hottest summer experienced in twenty years. Since the first of February last, there has not been sufficient frost in this region to injure vegetation, and not rain enough thoroughly to wet the ground' The present drought" says the Georgetown (S. C.) Advocate, exceeds in length of duration, and consequently severity, any that can be remembered for twenty years. Very vegetable, from the stately popular to the lowly esch lent, looks shrivelled and sap less. Late <a name="potatoes1"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, in this region of country, will be a total failure; and whilst our Yankee providers a repacking up for market those serviceable and popular roots, let them not forget to add also as many cabbages and turn is as they can spare notice in a Tennessee agricultural journal, under date of September 26th, in referring to the Tennessee valley, says, of the first eight months of 1844 : "january was wet beyond precedent, and more land covered with water at the end of this month than ever before known. February was dry and mild, and enabled the planter to gather much cotton that we thought could never be gotten out. March, an average month. April dry, with the exception of two light showers about the 15th, barely sufficient to bring up the cotton. May, dry and warm to the last few days thermometer as high as 88 degrees on the 15th.

August, dry and hot throughout; thermometer ranged from 94 to 100 degrees. September, dry and warm to the 15th, then a good general rain, dry since to date From the following extract, it would appear that the quantity of rain which fell throughout the summer of 1844 was not quite two thirds of the mean, and but little more, it is said, than one half of the five preceding summers: "A writer in the Providence Journal gives a table showing the quantity of rain that has fallen in each of the last thirteen years, between the 2 1st of March and the 2 1st of September, from which it appears that the quantity this year has been only 11 inches and 55 hundredths; whereas, the mean of the whole thirteen years was 18.35. The smallest previous quantity was in 1836, 11.6t; the greatest in 1834, 25.32."The mean quantity for the whole of the thirteen years was 36.85, the greatest being in 1843, when the whole year gave 42.40, and the least in, 1835, when the amount was 30.06. The quantity fallen so far in this year (1844) has been only 21.45."Happily, however, the evil resulting from the drought, though severe, did not ultimately prove so great as was anticipated. Met there was, no doubt, a very considerable degree of loss. The tobacco crop, corn crop, and some others, were lessened from what they would have been on this account. The <a name="potato0"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, too, may have been very sensibly affected by it, and possibly the disease which has been so destructive of this crop in portions of our country, and which will be fully considered in its place, may be in a great degree attributed, in the circumstances in which it occurred, to this cause. Comparatively less damage has been experienced from insects than has often been the case. The weevil, which sometimes has been very destructive, seems to have somewhat disappeared in certain regions. In the other hand, some new insects have been noticed, as will be seen by allusions under the respective crops The fly, which is the most threatening enemy of the whole crop, still continues to commit its ravages, though perhaps more, confined in its range during this year than the previous one. It is said to be a fact, and it is not a little curious, that insects destructive of the crops proceed from the northeast to the west and south. Such has been the case of the Hessian fly and the weevil. Myriads of locus to are mentioned as having been seen in the early part of the summer in Wisconsin. To serious damage, however, appears to have been experienced from them. The rust has been less injurious also than during the former year, though, as may be seen under the proper head of the grain, in some sections the crops suffered from its ravages. Wheat. The greater portion of this important crop is raised by some ten or a dozen States. In two of the States or Territories this product scarcely deserves mention. In one of the New England States, also, the amount is comparatively trifling. Ohio takes the lead of all in the wheat. crop, then follow New Work, Pennsylvania, Virginia, I n diana, Tennessee, &c[ 75 ]a] 22 but of a mass of materials relating to this grain, we have selected the, following records of the progress of the wheat crop From all accounts, in the great wheat growing States, the country over, there was an immense breadth of land sown and had it all ripened, and if it had been gathered, the crop would have been probably superior to that of any former year. Little injury, in comparison to that of some years, was sustained by its being winter killed, and the spring in many sections opened with fair promise. As early as the 17th of May, we find the following statement respecting the crop in Ohio, with i ai the vicinity of Cincinnati: "from inquiries which we have been making for a couple -of weeks past, we are led to believe that the crops of grain within a circle of sixty to seventy miles around Cincinnati have very seldom if ever promised, more abundant yields at this season of the year than they do now Generally, the wheat crop looks healthy, and is of most luxuriant growth. In the great Diam i valley, we are informed this is particularly the case, and similar statements have been published respecting the A driver country. We learn from a gentleman from Middle town, well informed in all such matters, that in the large rich farms, of Butler county about one third more wheat was put in last fall than the year before and this without at all trenching upon the strong corn lands of the bottoms, which will be given as usual to the production of food for pork. The wheat looks extremely well, and is as yet free from every .manner of disease or ver min." . In another part of the State, the account under the same date is hot equally favorable: " Maybe regret to learn that this staple crop, which during the early part of the season promised so fairly, is now suffering considerably from the ravages of the fly. This is said to be the case in the Luck creek settlement. We have heard of three fields adjoining, the middle one of which remains uninjured, while the other two have been destroyed. There such facts are noticed, it would be well to institute an investigation into the cause of the difference; and furnish the result for publication month later, the wheat crop in many parts appears not to be equally promising. Thus it is said, early in June: "the grain crops throughout this. and the adjoining counties promise an abundant harvest, though injured in places by the flies; yet, we understand that there will be more than an average crop' Mianimi of the take, at Perrysburg." The fly is certainly making much greater ravages than we anticipated. Never has this section experienced so great destruction from the fly: before. Whole fields are entirely destroyed. Now much it will affect the aggregate crop is difficult to say. The quantity on the ground is doubtless greater than any former year." -Massillon Hazel le, The Sydney (ohio) Aurora says: c Heat. has not looked better here for many years. The great, danger apprehended is, that the forward state of the crop and the wet weather will cause the wheat to fall before it is ready for harvestingChillicolhe, June 17, 1844.--I t has raised almost incessantly for th east six days. The wheat is prostrated and the rust is taking it. With all 23 [a[ 75 the boasted prospect of good crops, I consider the chances five to one for its total destruction. Men days hence, the tone of the newspapers will be totally different from what they have been for some weeks past. The cry now will be, and justly so, no wheat" Sole do, June, 1 844.-The present appearance of the new wheat crop is not as favorable for a fine crop .as formerly. The fly and extreme wet weather will no doubt lessen the crop, in northern Ohio and I indiana and southern Michigan, at least onethirdThese injuries were not, however, universal, as we learn by the following notices from the public journals The Cincinnati It las, in der date of June 17, speaks of the "prospect of a good crop in the Diam i valley ;" that the "harvest never began so early and that, " though the weather was such as to induce rust, the grain was so ripe that no injury ,vas feared Again : The Chillicothe Gazette, of June 27, states ' that great progress has been made in gathering in the grain, the season being two weeks earlier than usual; the weather very hot. All things are, however, favorable to theharvesters5The Panes ville Republican mentions "that the wheat crop will be large more than an average. Early sown has escaped the rust; later fields somewhat injured by it.  The harvest commenced about the 22d. The season in the vicinity of the lake is considerably later than in the central portions of the -state. In the vicinity of Cleveland, the harvest is not commenced, though the fields begin to exhibit a golden appearance The Cincinnati Chronicle says. The wheat this year in Ohio is as good, and more in quantity, than in any other year whatever. The result we arrive at both from what we saw and what we heard. A gentleman informed us that in Like and Scioto counties there was more than four times the usual quantity of wheat. In Veins and Washington, the quantity of wheat sown is large, and the quality good. Were and there a field is rushed, but not to such a degree as to materially injure the crop. The same general statements are made in other portions of the State. The wheat crop of Ohio in 144 will therefore, in our opinion, be almost twenty millions of bushels, which is an advance of twenty-five per cent. on the crop of 1839 no more than a proper allowance for the increased quantity sownJulyThe farmers in this vicinity have commenced their labors in the harvest field in good earnest. The storm on Thursday prostrated most of the wheat that had been left standing by previous storms. The wheat is very heavy on the ground, and if got in safely the crop will be a largeoneColumbus (ohio) Journal. The wheat crops of Jefferson and Columbia na counties, also, are mentioned in July, in a public journal, as being "of the most promising aspect The general result is likewise stated in another account that, beyond Harrison, and entirely through to I indianapolis, the wheat crop is not only gathered in fine order, but is unusually large, exceeding any thing be foreseen in that quarter. I to weight will average 60 pounds; and fields yielding crops that in the green state of the berne l, weigh 62 pounds per bushel, are not uncommon. In White water valley, also, it is said to be uncommonly fine. There are contradictory accounts, however, of a later date. Thus: one writer states, as the result of his judgment, that the wheat crop in Ohio is said to be generally injured by rust. Others, speaking of their own knowledge, say the wheat crop is very good, uncommonly large. 75 ]a] 24 n Muskingum county, one writes, in August, that the wheat did not fill well; the straw was heavy, but the wet weather made it lodge; that there was considerable rust, though the hill land wheat was good, and there was also more of it. The information we have been able to gather of a subsequent date is of a similar diverse character. Thus, on the southwest, bordering on the Ohio river, and above, it is said there is " but a half crop." Again: somewhat further east, in the same direction, it is stated, by a good judge, that there was more than the usual quantity sown; but the yield, both as respects quality and quantity, was a very poor one, and some estimate it at not more than half a yield. Taking into consideration the amount sown, it would be correct to estimate it at about two thirds of last year. It promised very finely through the spring and early part of summer, but was very much injured by rust, which was probably occasioned by wet weather. In the central part of the State, the crop is thought to have been " about an average one" perhaps 10 per cent. better. In the northwest, central, it is likewise an average crop. Still further northwest, bordering on Michigan and I n diana, an informant says: " Heat has not yielded but about two thirds of the usual crop, in consequence of the extraordinary wet season, In many places it was destroyed by water; and in others, the wheat, although a large growth of straw, filled but poorly." In the southeast, it was injured by the rust, and is supposed to be at least 25 per cent. less. Northward from this last, in a central direction, we find it stated, that the wheat crop fell short this year at least 25 per cent. from what it was last year, when it was an average one, and probably 50 per cent. less than it would have been if it had not been damaged. The failure in this section is believed to be owing to uncommonly warm weather about the time of its blossoming and of the grain filling. In the region north of the Scioto, on the lake, it is estimated that "the amount sown was fully equal to that of 1842; the weather was good, nor did the fly affect it much." The crop was gathered early, and in fine order. The universal reply to inquiries is said to be, "good" better than usual; and probably it was 25 per cent, above that of 1843, besides there being a great improvement in quality. This description is said to be applicable to the region north of the Scioto, Diam i, and Tuscarawas valley. Little or no rust appeared in northern Ohio. In the north eastern section of the State, it is mentioned, in an account of this crop, that in the spring and fore part of the season the wheat crop promised more than an average. The growth is said to have been uncommonly large and rank but shortly after it was filled, and the kerseys had come fully into the milk, it was struck by the rust; and it is believed by many farmers that the crop was one quarter less than it would otherwise have been; but, owing to the large quantity put into the ground last fall, the amount raised will be about an average with the crop of former years. The variety of wheat called the Baltic escaped rust, and gave a fine yield. One person mentions having raised a bushel and a half from a half pint of seed sown two years ago, and the next year hopes to raise all he needs for seed, and intends to adopt it. After this survey of conflicting accounts, it is somewhat difficult to for man opinion as to the general crop of wheat in Ohio for 1844. Taking into view, however, that in the most important wheat growing districts this 25[ 75 ]grain k was more or less injured, considerable deduction must be made while, on account of the greater breadth of land brought under tillage for this crop, this deficiency will be nearly balanced, so that it will not vary a great deal on the whole from the crop of the previous year, and perhaps may be estimated at about 15 per cent. less. In an agricultural paper lately established at Cincinnati, and received since our estimate was formed, we find an article on the wheat crop of Ohio, from which we take the following extracts, as aiding still further in the estimate to be made of its product for the year 1844. The writer, one well fitted to judge, says: " The number of acres in wheat was greater than ever before, but the aggregate yield was still less than the year previous. We have made considerable inquiry, and are sure that the last years crop is less than that of 1843; that there is considerable increase in the western part of the State, but that is not sufficient to make up for the general deficiency elsewhere. The number of acres now annually devoted to this crop in Ohio is about two millions; and the average product, taking the whole State together, and one season with another, is only ten bushels per acres n the western part of the State, especially on new lands, there has been a considerable increase of the wheat crop for a year or two past; but this does not lessen the importance of the great facts which we wish to impress upon the minds of the farmers of Ohio, viz : that their great market able staple, the Wheat Crop of the State, has been annually Decreasi    Of for a number of years past, especially in the amount of its acre able product Taken as a whole, the wheat crop of New York appears to have been more prosperous. In the early part of the season, in May, the crop in Genesee county and that region is stated to be fine, "never finer" and that the farmers were compelled to reap off the top, for fear of the wheat growing too rapidly. Again: The Dans ville Republican of the 19th says: "he are informed by farmers in this section that the wheat in the ground promises better this spring than it has for many years; and we believe it appears equally well throughout the Genesee valley. If the weather should continue as favorable as it has thus far this season, there will be an abundant crop and an unusually early harvest n July, a similar account is given of the grain in the Genesee valley, one of the great wheat growing districts of New Work. Long the lake shore, a writer remarks, it was thought that it would average twenty bushels to an acre, though in some fields the rust was visible. In the vicinity of Buffalo, it is said, also, under date of July, that the wheat crop was secured in good order. The harvest was two weeks earlier than usual, and would give a large surplus-one third more than in 1843. As a general thing, more wheat is now raised on an acre than y was of corn five years ago. In the latter part of July, under date of Rochester, we are told that the wheat crop is fine; in some sandy places injured by the fly, especially the early sown. When sown before the 10th of September, it was thus more or less injured. Similar statements are made in the papers respecting this region; and the crop is pronounced to have been generally good ; better than for many years. In some late sown fields, there was some rust; but the average in the region west of Genesee river was thought by some equal to that of the best years equal to that of 1833. In the centre of the State, and near Onondaga county, the wheat is said, in July, to be[ 75 2 somewhat injured by the grain worm; but the damage was comparatively trifling. In Schoharie county, in the same month, we find complaints of the weevil, by which many fields, it is said, have been destroyed in  n Schenectady county, large quantities are said to have been sown but the ravages of the fly were so great that scarcely any, it was thought would be saved; in many fields, the crop was entirely destroyed. The same remark is made respecting this crop, likewise, in Albany county, (where this. insect was very destructive) and also in Columbia, But chess, and Ulster counties. In some parts of Columbia county mention is likewise made of the rust; and it is stated that the fields generally appeared poor, much winter killed; and that it suffered from rust and the maggot. In the latter part of June, a good judge says that much of the cropinDutchess county is cut off and destroyed. A little yellow worm in the head of the grain, and not the fly, destroyed it; but a new one deposited its egg in the young formation of the head and wheat berne l, producing worms, which devour the whole. In parts, likewise, of Range county, it is stated, under date of about the middle of July, that the wheat fields were attacked by a small worm (the weevil) previous to .heir ripe king. In some places it is mentioned that the fly which committed its ravages appeared to prevail "on the skirts more than in the middle of the field in agricultural notice, in a paper published in New York city for. July, says that " the early spring was favorable, and, as the harvest approached, the plants looked well; the harvest being in fine weather, the prospect was, there would be an average crop and secured in a good condition n an agricultural journal, under date of July 15, from Queens county, Long I s land, it is remarked ' the fly made bad ravages with our wheat all was injured; and many farmers have not more than half a crop. In other later accounts we are furnished with the following estimates n the western sections of the State, especially in Genesee and Wyoming counties, the wheat crop is estimated by a good judge and a resident there to have been at an increase of about 25 per cent. over that of 1843. In Niagara county the account is : " The wheat crop of 1844 was uncommonly large; more so than ever before in this county. The estimated amount raised in this county, this year, by those best qualified to judge, is 700,000 bushels. The causes of this increased amount are several 1st. Letter cultivation and a better preparation of the ground by tillage 2d. More care in selecting and preparing, and more effort in obtaining the best varieties of seed. 3d. A more general use of c lover and plaster, as the best application of manure to the crops. 4th. A very favorable season. The increase of the crop over that of 1843 is probably from 25 to 30,per cent. In Cattaraugus county wheat is thought to have been a fair medium crop ;not so good as in 1843, but more was sown than usual, so that the aggregate is larger than in 1843."SA public, journal for September, under date of Buffalo, has the following statement, which may seem. somewhat at variance with the above mentioned: " There is no doubt as to the crop of wheat being poorer than was anticipated in July and August. The yield, has been abundant, while the sample is generally more or less shrimped, requiring a greater quantity to make a bushel of flour than usual n Allegany and Stettien counties, it is thought to have been equal or 27 [75 somewhat above that of the previous year, "as there was a full crops n Rates county and vicinity, a person well qualified to form a proper estimate says: "there is an increase in the wheat crop .over that of 1843 of at least 33 per cent; and he as signs as the cause, "a very favorable time for seeing and a growing fall' " The wheat' he says, grew large before winter set in." I i Hayne and Seneca counties "the wheat crop was estimated by some of the best farmers at .10 or 15 per cent. more than a medium crop." The estimates for the central part of the State are, for Tompkins and Chemung counties, that there was quite an average crop. The breadth of the land sown was not so great, though the quantity was above the general average, but not equal to that of 1843." In Cayugaand Cortlandt counties, the crop is thought to have been " good, more than an average, 25 per cent. increase" in quantity ; and in Onondaga county, "good, equal to the crop' of 31843," and " of a very good quality' In Madison and Oswego counties, the crop is estimated at " 15 per cent. better than in 1843. Further north in Jefferson, Lewis, and It. Lawrencecountiesthe estimates of this crop are an increase of 15 per cent. on that of 1843,.' "a fair average" &c. The Central New York Farmer, published at Some, in One ida county, in August, says : " From the success attending the wheat crop in this vicinity, for the last two or three years, our farmers were encouraged to extend the cultivation, and considerable wheat was sown last year and, from the appearance of the fields in the early part of the season, we had every reason to expect full an average crop; but the depredations of. the grain "worm have blasted our hopes, as from many fields it is conjectured that little more than the amount of seed sown will be obtained. The worm li as been more prevalent this year than for several years back' Some pieces are badly struck with rust, owing to the late warm rains. Long the Mohawk valley, in the counties of Herkimer and Montgomery, the wheat crop is estimated to have been "25 per cent. less than that of the previous year, owing to the rust and insects n Its ego county it is thought to have been somewhat better than in 1843; while in Schoharie county there was " a small crop" because the weevil proved so destructive. I n. Rensselaer county, but little comparatively is raised. In the river counties the crop was less than in 1843. One well qualified to judge remarks, of Range county: " The lands here are not well adapted to the growth of this grain; there is probably seldom if ever more grown than is consumed by us. This year, however, the crop is uncommonly poor; the severity of the last winter seriously injured many fields. Some fields, which early in the season gave promise of a favorable crop, were ruined by the rust, and the weevil completed our disappointment by devouring nearly or quite one third of the gross product. By improved culture, our lands give a much larger product per acre than was formerly obtained from them; and fields which were uninjured have this year produced as well as at any former period. The best acre offered to the agricultural society for premium this year yielded thirty-two bushels, and the second best thirty-one bushels aid twenty-four quarts." In But chess and Putnam counties, it is estimated that there is not more than half a crop, compared with that of 1843Westchester county is thought to have produced I more than an average crop" and in Suffolk county, on Long I s land, there was, it is said[ 75 ]28" an average crop" though " in some fields the s talks were thinned out by the severity of the winter From the above notices we think the conclusion is warranted, that there was in the State of New York an increased crop of at least 20 per cent over that of 1.843, which it will be recollected was 10 per cent. better than the crop of 1842. The grain, it is probable, would not compare in plump ness with that of the previous year ; but the progress of improvement and the increased amount of land sown justify us in fixing the increase of wheat as we have done. The earlier notices of the appearance of the wheat crop in Pennsylvania, which we have been able to collect, are not so extended or varied as in the case of Ohio and New Work. We will mention a few of the most prominent. In May, speaking of the promise of this crop in Chester county, it is said that there " is a prospect of a heavy crop of wheat." I nan other account it is stated that, in east Pennsylvania, there was "considerable injury done by the fly About the middle of June the crop of wheat in Berks county is described as being a "fair one" but not so abundant as was before expected." In Bucks county, under the same date, the fields are said to have been full of promise; but the fly appeared, and became " most destructive One person says, that, where he expected " to gather 1,200 to 1,300 bushels" he " could not now hope for 300." In the vicinity of Run bury the wheat is said to be fine. The fly is not un frequently mentioned during the month of June, but it appears to have been confined in its injurious ravages to particular sections; and it was thought that there would be " a full average crop" in Pennsylvania, " and perhaps more Later, in the last week of July, the crop in the southwestern part of the State, in the vicinity of Union, is described as "' not equal to the expectations of farmers; there was much straw, but the grain proved to be small, and it was a good deal struck by rust The wheat crop of Beaver county is stated, in a public paper, early in July, to be "of a most promising aspect." In Germantown a new enemy is noticed a small, dark, ugly worm, three-fourths of an inch long, which crawl up the stalk, and devours the leaves." Later still, in Adams and work counties, "the crop" it is stated, is an average one" and was" well secured 9 though in some parts of this State it is .badly shrunk From other sources of information, also, we learn that the results of the harvest varied in different sections of the State. Thus, the crop in Erie and some of the northern counties is thought to have been 25 per cent better than that of 1843, as it was a fine growth, and was well gathered. In Beaver and Washington counties, in the western section, towards the south, we are told that " the crop is less than an average one, as it was much destroyed by the fly." A similar estimate is given with respect to. the counties of Union, Greene, and Gazette, in the southwest corner of the State. Any fields were not harvested, being too light and shrivelled to be worth cutting; but few fields of merchant able wheat i. e, which will weigh 60 pounds per bushel; some 50, 54, 58," &c. Some specimens of the Mediterranean wheat are mentioned as the best in that vicinity, " which weigh 65 pounds to the bushel." In Arm strong county, as appears from the reports of the commissioners of that county, the assessment list shows 19 2000 bushels, and the crop is supposed to have been lessened 10 percent. on account of rust 29[ 75 ]is we advance from these counties towards the centre of the State, there is great complaint of rust; and the injury is said to be so severe that in some fields not more than three bushels to an acre has been harvested. In some central counties, also, the mildew and rust lessened the crop at least one half. F In the central part of the State, in the counties bordering on the upper branches of the Susquehanna h, the crop is estimated to have been one third less than that of the year 1843, owing to the rust. It is stated, that a few weeks before harvest " the wheat crop promised to be very abundant but about that time it was struck with the rust, particularly the wheat on the river bottoms and in the valleys, which injured it at least 50 per cent The same complaint of rust meets us as we pass to the eastern section towards the northeast, where the winter wheat is said to have been somewhat injured by the rust, "but to have yielded an average crop Towards the southeast, on the Susquehanna, and in the vicinity of Harrisburg, the rust is also said too have much damaged the crop, so that it yielded not more than two thirds as much as in 1843. Still further on towards Philadelphia, Ve are told that in the rich county of Lancaster the crop was "an average one, both in quantity and quality." In Chester county, " the early sown was good, the late sown suffered by rust." In the vicinity of Philadelphia, the crop, on the whole, was "pretty good." From the best calculations we can make, we think that the crop in general fell off from 10 to 15 per cent. in Pennsylvania. In tracing out the progress of the wheat crop of Virginia, the next in order, a similar diversity in the various sections meets us. The earlier accounts of its appearance, so far as they have fallen under our notice, are quite promising. Thus we find it said of the crop in the vicinity of Wheeling, in the latter part of May: "drops never looked better, or promised a more abundant harvest. In counties bordering on the Potomac, also under the same date. the wheat crop is said to be "promising." In the vicinity of Winchester, early in June, the crops are described as "turning out well, though there may be, in some cases, partial failures." And, again, the remark is made of the wheat growing counties generally, that there is the " prospect of an abundant crop" " a fine season for harvesting" and the crop itself unusually healthy and advanced." There is some complaint of the fly; but the injury both in eastern and western Virginia is considered only partial confined to some sections. In the vicinity of Taunt on the crop is stated to be "good" and but little complaint is made of any injury there sustained. Under date of Wellsburg, July 3, a writer also says, that the crops in the upper part of the county are promising. There are some exceptions; for one account from Frederick county speaks of the wheat being "much shrunk, because of an excess of wet weather" and an article in the Wheeling Gazette thus mentions the state of the wheat crop in that neighborhood : "the wheat fields in this vicinity, in harvest, presented a most promising appearance; and it was supposed at that time that we would have a harvest rich and abundant beyond all former precedent. As soon, however, as the farmers commenced threshing out their grain, the discovery was made, that the flattering indications of an abundant yield above referred to were deceptive; there was, to be sure, an unusual amount of straw, but the yield of grain fell far short of the reasonable expectations of our worthy agriculturists. And it was[ 75] 30 also discovered that a great deal of the wheat was light and shrivelled, some of it requiring five pecks, in measure, to make a bushel of the standard weight. We also regret to learn that many fields were injured by the rust, Notwithstanding all these .drawbacks, we are inclined to believe that the aggregate. amount of wheat obtained this season in the agricultural region of the country adjacent to our city will fall but. little, if any, short of the average yield of former seasons for we are assured that much more wheat was sown last fall and spring than usual; and many of our farmers have, undoubtedly, harvested unusually fine crops Referring to later accounts, also from various sections, since the harvest, we gather the following particulars, which, in some parts, are less promising : .in the southeast, embracing several counties, including the I s le of right, Sussex, Norfolk, &c, there has been, it is thought, an increase of 0 per cent. over the previous year: "his is owing to the favorable effects resulting from the use of margin that region more attention having been. directed to this object than before. From this point, towards the centre, it is judged that there has been " an increase of 25 per cent, owing, among other reasons, principally to the growing of a more forward kind of wheat and a more favorable spring." In the east, from the centre of the State, in several counties bordering the Potomac and its vicinity, there seems to have been "scarcely an average crop" while on the southern central section of the State, bordering on Northcarolina, the wheat crop is represented as having" fallen off at least o 50 percent, on account of rust, caused by its coming up badly and a moist warm June." North of this last section, however, the injury seems not to have been much felt, as the crop is pronounced to have been, "both in quantity and quality, an average one." Further west, in the counties on the Kanawha river, it was likewise "an average crop Taking all the information within our reach into the account, we seem to be authorized to estimate the crop in Virginia in 1844 to be an increase of about 20 per cent. over that of 1843. The notices respecting the wheat crop in I n diana, in May and June, are of various kinds. Complaints, even at that early date, are made of the fly but the principal injury seems to have been occasioned by the severe rains, which deluged portions of the wheat growing sections of the State. Thus we find accounts like the following person, near Os hen, I n diana, writes: "I am almost discouraged the weather is very unfavorable for farming; very wet and rainy. The fly is taking the wheat here at a dreadful rate, destroying some pieces entirely. The crop here presents a most unfavorable appearance. Some fields have been ploughed up, and corn planted therein Again speaking of the prospect of the crop in the valley of the Wabash, especially the bottom lands, it is said : "there is every appearance, of a bad crop." Other accounts however, at this period, are more favorable. Thus the I n diana (rising Run) Blade, of the 18th of May, says: " The prospect of this portion of the country for abundant crops is favorable. The wheat is unusually forward, and we are informed by farmers that, from present indications, it will be ready to harvest by the middle of June, some two or three weeks earlier than usual And again : the Madison (I n diana: Manner, of June. 5th, after noting 31 [a[ 75 the bad condition of crops on the Wabash bottom lands, says : "I n Jefferson and Jennings, and all this region of the State, the wheat crop is more promising than it has been at the same time in any former year within the memory of man From another statement we gather the following Michigan City, (I indiana i) June 4.--" Heat still commands 65 cents but small quantities coming in. It is now considered that the frost we had about the 20th May did but little injury to the wheat; the fly has injured some fields, but the prospect now is of a fair crops n July the remark is made, that "the wheat crop, in various sections, has suffered from the fly." A similar diversity also exists in the later reports. In the central counties of the State, the accounts are favorable, and a large crop is spoken of." In the counties lying in a south easterly direction from the centre, and reaching on to the Wabash, the crop is .estimated to have " fallen short 33 per cent, on account of the rust." North of these, however, another statement gives the opinion that the crop is greater than an average one, and exceeds that of 1843 by 25 per cent. As we proceed still north, on the upper waters of the Wabash, " the rains proved so severe" as has been mentioned, that the crop is reckoned at " not more than half of that of 1843." In the southeast, inclining to the central south, bordering on the Ohio river, including the counties of Washington, Scott, Jefferson, and some of the neighboring ones, there is more than usual complaint of rust; and the crop has been estimated at " not half a crop, and less than that of 1843." North easterly from these counties, and bordering on Kentucky and Ohio, in Dear born, Ripley, Switzerland, and Franklin counties, and some others, there was likewise " a small crop ;" and the same cause, the " rust" is assigned as the reason. Still further north, and bordering on Ohio, and back towards the centre. the crop is estimated at 30 per cent in advance of that of 1843."I t must be taken into view, however, that a large quantity of seed was sown on a greater breadth of land than had been done the previous year and, when we consider this fact, it seems probable that, if we estimate the whole crop at about 20 or 25 per cent. less than in 1843, we shall not vary greatly from the true state of the case. We are inclined to think that the difference, either side, cannot be more than 5 per cent. Respecting the wheat crop of. I illinois, our earlier notices are somewhat more full; and these, as well as the later ones, lead us to the conclusion that this crop, though promising at first, suffered even more than in I n diana. Thus, in May, we are informed that " the fly is doing great injury in many parts of the State." And, early in the month, the Chicago Journal says" The Hessian fly has made its appearance on Hickory creek, in Will county. Several entire fields of wheat, both winter and spring, have been destroyed. The loss, however, occasioned by this insect is confined, thus far, to small sections of country. The r heat crop, as a general thing never appeared more promising in northern I illinois than at present Again, speaking of this and other States, the Prairie Farmer, published at Chicago, says : 'If there be not a larger wheat crop in the Unitedstates this season, or in the West at any rate, than ever before, we shall be disappointed. In our rabbles through I illinois, we have seen and been informed that more wheat was sown last fall than usual ; that, almost without exception, as far as we have been able to learn, it has been uninjured by the weather. The early opening of the spring will hasten its growth, so that there will be little danger from rust; and this being the chief cause of fear for wheat in this region, we think the prospect is good for a large crop it a short period after, however, we find the accounts more discouraging, and early in June the prospects of the wheat crop in I illinois are mentioned as unfavorable." In a It. Louis paper of June 1st, the fly is said to be "doing great injury" near Box river, in I illinois. Again, we have the following notice Little Sort, (I illinois) June 5.-After a rain of nearly six weeks, we have got a glimpse of the sun, and things begin to move. The season has been very un propitious for putting in the spring crops, and, in this section of country, there will not be so much spring wheat raised as in the preceding year. There is, however, an abundance of wheat in the country ; but the roads are so bad that very little gets to market. We are paying no we 69 to 6.5 cents for winter, and 50 to 55 cents for spring. The crops in the ground, look well, and every thing promises well Again, the Quincy (I illinois) Whig of the 3d instant says: " The rains of last week, it is feared, will have a serious effect upon the crops. Any of the farmers had commenced cutting their wheat, but were obliged to suspend their operations in consequence of the wet weather. Although the prospect, some weeks since, was very fair for a large yield, the continued wet weather has operated most disastrously, in many instances, upon the prospects of the farmers. Whole fields, we are informed, in this and adjoining counties, will yield little or nothing. The prospect for corn is even worse than for wheat, and, unless more favorable weather intervene soon, there is every probability of a failure in the crop Under date of June 3d, in Warren county, an informant writes us: " The season in this section is rather unfavorable. The wheat crop, I think, will be short of the expectations of all; the growth is most rapid it is already beginning to head ; but, whether from early frosts last fall, or their moderate and cold rains this spring, I cannot say. In inspection by myself and some of my neighbors, it appears to be about one third or one half less; our wells, ranging from 14 to 20 feet deep, are full to the top; the ground appears to be so much saturated with water, one would think it would never dry ; the rains have been so numerous, that, before the ground was sufficiently dry to plough, another rain would follow The Prairie Farmer of July says that " the wheat crop is in some places luxuriant, but has suffered severely in various sections by the fly." And the same agricultural journal, of September, speaks of it having " promised well" but that "it did not yield half a crop in middle I illinois ;" and that " much of it was not cut, on account of the wet and rust in Warren county, it is stated that the crop "fell far short of last springs promise. The rains were so incessant and in moderate since last March, that much fall wheat has been more or less injured by rust or scab Spring wheat, likewise, is said to be injured. Such of the wheat brought to market is stated to be " of a poor quality" and the same complaint is heard of injury by long continued wet. The following estimates have been received since the harvest has been gathered n southern I illinois, one person considers the crop "as acid 127: t as that of 1843." In the southwest tier of counties lying. along on the Mississippi, on the other hand, it is stated that it did not reach to more than two thirds of the crop of the previous year; and the -wet weather, and rust before 33 [a[ 75 ]the harvest" are assigned as the cause of this decline. North of this, reaching up to the centre, as compared with the crop of 1843, that of 1844 is placed as high as "100 per cent. increase" as the crop of 1843 was very small, and that of 1844 was a remarkably good one." In the southeast counties, on the Wabash, and running back towards the centre, the crop is pronounced to have been "a very indifferent one' having suffered much from long continued rains ;" while in the central counties, and on towards the north, we are informed that " the wheat crop bade fair in the spring to be an uncommon yield; but, owing to the unusual floods of June, it ran too much to straw, and rust injured the crop. Some fields were entirely destroyed, and most of them injured in quality Owing, however, to the large quantity sown, the crop may have turned out "an average one' In the northern part of I illinois, it is thought by one to be "a good crop" and towards the south "more injured by rusty good judge, speaking of the wheat crop in this State, says " The wheat crop in the vicinity of Chicago was a fair crop, though in quality it was poor, shrunk, and with a larger than usual growth of straw. It promised finely in the early season, but ran too much to straw." It was also injured in some of the counties of northern I illinois by rust and the fly, and was about the same as in 1843. From these various accounts of the crop in different parts of the State, we are inclined to believe that a decrease of 25 to 30 per cent. should be allowed for the whole crop. The wheat crop of Michigan has gained largely for two or three years past. This is one of those States where, owing to new lands being brought under cultivation, and a large increase of population by immigration, a greater extent of field is sown from year to year. Had there been nothing to injure the crop, the increase on that of 1843 would have been a large one. The earlier notices of the wheat crop in Michigan were somewhat unfavorable. A specimen of this appears in the following: "it. Josephs, (michigan) May 31.-Last week we mentioned the fact, that the fly was making sad havoc with the wheat crop in this vicinity. Since then, we have noticed that this enemy of the farmer infects different parts of this and the adjoining States. Still, the ravages of the fly appear not to be sufficiently extensive to affect materially the general crops n June we find this account of the prospect, and the causes at work to influence the decrease of the crop: "while at the east and south the weather during the whole spring has been unusually warm and pleasant, and vegetation far in advance of the season, with us, throughout the whole west, we believe, there has been almost continuous rain. Our streets, seldom present a worse surface in the early spring, and the roads in the interior, we are told, are in many places almost impassable." The effect of the heavy rain upon the wheat and spring crops has been exceedingly unfavorable; but whether so much so as to injure materially the harvest, cannot yet, we v imagine, be determined. We hear, too, that the Hessian fly is doing much injury in some quarters. We fear, therefore, that the wheat crop, especially, is less promising in this State than it has been for several preceding. years Detroit (michigan) Advertise r of June 7th. As an exception to this, it is said: a We are gratified to learn from theOakland Gazette that the wheat crop looks well in that county, especially in the northern part 334 n July, the accounts are not more favorable. Thus, from Centre ville, we are informed, "the harvest is just beginning; but our crop of wheat will be far below medium. The fly in early spring, subsequent and long rains, and now within a few days the rust, have destroyed much wheatAgainann erb or, July 24.---Farmers are now in the middle of their harvest. The crop appears to be an: average one. The straw is much rushed, but the grain appears to be but little shrunk n Monroe county, likewise, in July, the wheat crop is mentioned as being "nearly ruined by the fly." In other sections, it is said that the wheat is coming forward finely, and bids fair to be an average crop. The ravages of the fly have been confined to small districts, and on light sandy soils." In Pontiac, also, it is stated to be "an average crop." The Michigan Farmer of July also mentions that the crop was suffering severely in various parts by the fly, and says, by way of curing the evil, that " the mi the fly has appeared no wheat there grown should 'be used for seed, and when practicable old last years wheat should be sown The eye bright is also mentioned as likely hereafter to prove an enemy to the wheat crop, as it is increasing in some sections. Again: "Although the fly and worm have spread devastation and ruin over many wheatfields throughout the entire valley of It. Joseph, yet the prospect is that we shall have a larger quantity for exportation the coming year than ever. This will arise from the fact that there was a larger quantity sown last fall than in any previous years n the next month, (august) the following are some of the accounts which have been gathered respecting the wheat crop in Michigan: Themichigan State Journal (inn Erb or) says: "a. The aggregate crop of the country will be less than was expected. In many places, the grain is very much shrunk." Again: "jackson, august 15.-The wheat crop is almost an entire failure. The insects took it last fall, and the rust in the spring, and then again the insects a second time n Calhoun county, the crop is said to be "light ;" and the suggestion is made that the Michigan sub soil plough may be very useful; "but there is nothing like an average crop." Under date of Grass Take, at the same period, a writer remarks, that the crop there is "almost an entire failure, On me fields were not harvested, The following causes of this poor crop are assigned: " 1. The land has been run to wheat from year to year, without maturing or seeing it down 2. The sowing of the same seed year after year on the same farm 3. Owing too early or too later. The practical culture of many acres, rather than the thorough tillage of a few. 'later information corresponds well with the above. Thus, in the south eastern counties, we are told that there is :not more than one-fourth of the surplus of 1843, owing to the wet season and the ravages of the fly ; and that in son me cases "the injury was so severe that the farmers had to plough up their fields, and sow them over again n the north er tr and eastern section the grain is said to be "much shrunk en, from n rust ;a" and in the south part of this section it was "injured by the 35 75 ]fly ; so that, on the whole, the crop in this region "fell short of 1843 at least 25 per cent n the western section of the State the wheat crop was likewise much injured by the rust. "the early sown" is said to have been a " good crop but "the late sown" was nearly all ruined; not more than half a crop was obtained, and this probably did not yield more than half the usual quantity of flour From all these accounts, it is evident that, but for the increased quantity sown, a very large deduction must be made from the wheat crop of Michigan for 1844, compared with that of 1843; but, regarding this counter balancing consideration, we may fix it at from 20 to 25 per cent. less. To far as we can form any estimate respecting the wheat crops of Tennessee and Kentucky, where considerable wheat is raised, it is thought, that while there have been much blight and rust in the latter of these two States, so that in some parts it amounted to almost a total failure, and a falling off of 15 per cent, on the other hand, the same crop has given a more favorable result in Tennessee; and by some the estimate is of an advance of 25 per cent. on the preceding year. In the northwest section of the State, the estimate is, that there was not more than half a crop ; not so much was sown, and the wet weather, with the rust and smut, injured it. In the Tennessee valley, bordering on Alabama, it is mentioned, in an agricultural journal, that the " wheat was cut from the 15th to the 20th of May a light yield, and does not make good flour. For the whole State, we are inclined to fix it at from 10 to 15 per cent increase, and for Kentucky a decrease of about 15 to 20 per cent. As we have been disappointed in obtaining as full information as was desired on these two States, we do not speak with equal assurance as with respect to other portions of our country. In the State of Maryland, lying as it does contiguous to the States of Pennsylvania and Virginia, the crops will be likely to be affected by the same causes which operate in influencing the crops of those States. The harvest being as early, the grain crops must naturally have shared likewise in the advantage of the same warm and dry weather, which has been favorable to the wheat crop, already described. In referring to the earlier notices of this crop, we find, under date of June, at Hagerstown, that the prospect in the valley of Washington county promises well, though the fly appeared in some few fields. In Went county, in June, it was thought that the crop would be a "moderate" one. I n went and Montgomery and Queen Anne counties, a month later, it is pronounced to be remarkably fine and heavy. The Frederick Herald of July says, of the wheat crop: "he hear less complaint than usual; and although the rust and smut have done some little injury, we have but little doubt that the main objection to the wheat will be, that the grains are not sufficiently weighty, and are shrivelled, from the excess of wet weatherlatelyAgain: the American Farmer, during the same month, states, that notwithstanding there have been partial failures in some portions of the wheat growing regions, we believe that in the aggregate the crop has proved an abundant one. In August, in Baltimore and some of the adjoining counties, it is stated that there was an average crop, and well secured; and the general report[ 75 ]a] 36 of the journals seems to be, that there was a full crop; that, though there was some rust and fly, yet these causes produced less damage than usuaLThe harvest was earlier also, commencing by the 1st of June. Similar favorable reports are made from other sources. By one person the crop along the vicinity of the central counties is pronounced to be at least 12 per cent. better than in 1843, owing to the mild winter. Another estimates the product of the north eastern section of the State to be " a fair crop ;" while, by yet another person, the crop for 1844 is thought to have been, compared with that mentioned in the last census on the crop of 1839.full 40 per cent. increase. This increase is considered attribute able almost entirely to the improved system of farming, and the more general use of plaster, lime, and c lover; so that fields which, a few years since, were too sterile for profitable cultivation, are now some of the most productive parts of the district. This refers particularly to the counties of Baltimore, War roll, and their vicinity. In the whole, therefore, the wheat crop of Maryland was probably at least 20 per cent. above that of 1843. The wheat crop of North Carolina is described in the spring as being promising. Under date of May 25, at Red House, the wheat crop is stated to have never been more promising; the spring the earliest ever known there; so that even then they were preparing to cut their wheat. Subsequent accounts inform us that in these southwestern counties it is over an average, having had a good season in which to mature, the weather being dry and pleasant. In the northwest, also, the crop is supposed to have been about an average one. In the northeast, also, it is stated to have been good; while on the south, bordering on South Carolina, in the centre, owing to the injury received from the drought, the crop fell perhaps one third. Taking every thing into view, we feel authorized to place it for the State at an increase of 10 per cent. over that of 1843. Our information fr on New Jersey is scanty as to the appearance of the wheat crop. We find some complaints of injury by the winter season, and also from rust and smut; and by some the crop is thought not to be more than half the average one, especially in the northern central part of the State. In the south eastern section, towards the ocean, it is stated to have been " a good crop" while again in the northwestern it is estimated at 10 per cent less than in 1843. In the general crop, we think that a deduction of about 10 per cent. must be made throughout the State. The wheat crop of the New England States in general, for 1844, was better than the crop of the previous year. The weather was more favorable for its growth, and also for the harvest; so that it was secured in better order, and less injured by the fly and rust, or other evils, than usual. In this account, there was a general increase, on an average, of at least 20 to 25 per cent. throughout these States. Still, the amount raised in the whole is but inconsiderable, compared with that of many States. In Paine, so early as July, the wheat is mentioned in the agricultural journals as being in prospect uncommonly good; and the same information is given in August, about one month later. The wheat crop is stated to be of better quality than for many years; not so much injured by the weevil, except in Somerset and some of the upper counties; the cool nights have prevented the rust, as the summer was comparatively cool. The other accounts of the crop are equally favorable37By one, a good judge in these t matters, we are told that the wheat crop is " more productive than any since that of 1837 ;" and the reasons assigned are 6" st, decrease of the weevil, which, for six or seven years, has been the scourge of the farmers raising this grain; 2d, cool season while it was in growth and maturing; some fields, indeed, suffered by a worm at the root, but, on the whole, the crop was good." Again, respecting the crop in some of the northern central counties, it is stated to be "about the same in quantity as in 1840, perhaps 10 per cent. more; it was somewhat injured by the weevil, or it would have been 20 per cent. more he think, from all' the information we can gather respecting the progress of the crop in this State, that there has been an advance on the year previous, especially considering that there was then so great a falling off as 15 to 20 per cent, perhaps more. In some parts of New Hampshire the grain crops especially were injured by the drought, so that it has been estimated in the southeast section of the State as being one half less than the crop of 1843. In the central western, bordering on the Connecticut, this crop is spoken of as being much above the average one. Power down, towards the southern boundary of the State, our informant places its amount at " about the same as the previous year." Probably, if we allow an average increase of 10 percent. for the whole State, we shall be near the truth. From an agricultural journal, we learn that some sections of Vermont bordering on New Work, suffered from the fly called the ridge; yet this crop of wheat was thought to be the largest in 1844 which had been gathered for many years. In Franklin county, for instance, it was estimated at an increased value of ,10000 beyond the ordinary one; and the opinion is expressed, that there would be raised in that State almost enough for home consumption there. The average yield is considered by one person, in a letter to an agricultural journal, to reach to probably twenty-five bushels to an acre, while last year it would not amount to more than from 18 to 20. An instance is mentioned of 42 i bushels having been raised to the acre, which is certainly a large yield. The variety called the Black sea is a favorite one, as it appears to be well adapted to the climate and soil, and most productive. Similar to this is the information we gain from other sources; and the gain on the preceding year is estimated variously, from o 20 per cent. up to 50 per cent." There is no complaint of rust, and little or no damage was suffered from the weevil. The advance for the whole State, we think, will not be too highly estimated if we fix it at 25 per cent. Heat is considered a small crop, comparatively, in Massachusetts, Rhode I s land, and Connecticut, so that we are able to gather but little reliable information respecting it in these States. Some variation is observed. In some parts it is estimated at a loss of 5 per cent; in others, it is said to have been a full average for the quantity sown, and the quality very good. It is supposed that the general average increase may be about q 0 or 15 percent. There seems, on the whole, to be an evident falling off of this grain crop in Georgia. The estimates which are given from various parts are: "father short, owing to the drought in the spring." "moderate, though rather short." "short of 1843, owing to the drought of the spring." "Twenty-five per cent. short of last year, in consequence of the cold and ve t weather in January and February last, and drought in March, April, and July." Pass and Gwinnett present, however, an exception as we find the estimate of 75 ]a] 38 the former to be placed by an intelligent farmer as high as 75 per cent. increase on the crop of 1843, on account of the low price of pork and the almost no price to be obtained for corn. A good judge thinks that the product of the wheat crop for 1844, inGwinnett, must have been about 60,000 bushels, which was probably an increase of 20 or 30 per cent. over that of 1843. This favorable result is said to be owing mainly to the fact that the spring of the last year was dry a state of things which it is observed in that region always is favorable to wheat. In the whole, then, we believe that, from the best intelligence we can obtain, the wheat crop for 1844 in Georgia must be set down as 20 or 25 per cent. less than that of the previous year. As to I own and Wisconsin, adjoining Territories, to judge from the accounts of the progress of the wheat crop, though there is considerable diversity of opinion, it was a very fair one. Thus, in July, we find the following notices. A correspondent of a public journal, under date of July 5, at Looming ton, says that " the fall wheat is good, but that it is expected that the rust will injure the spring wheat he have just received a letter from one of the largest wheat growers in  own, dated July 28, which states that "the crop of wheat in that Territory has, been well secured, and the yield is full an average crop. The number of immigrants is very large, and all the bread stuffs will be needed for homeconsumptionMilwaukie, July 25.-" The harvest has commenced in our vicinity, and the prospect is of a good crop, and the weather is very favorable for ingatheringSouthport" The harvest has just commenced, with most encouraging prospects to the farmer. Some fields on the prairies have been slightly touched with rust, but those in the " openings" have not, and none will be greatly injured. Some beautiful samples of new wheat have been brought into market already. That brought in by Captain And, of Pleasant Prairie, is as fine as we ever saw. Heat commands 60 cents this week from ourbuyersThe Davenport Gazette of August 1st says "that the wheat crop in that country, under ordinary circumstances, would have been unprecedented; but the late heavy rains have caused rust to injure it, so that it cannot be called more than an average yield. Those who cut their wheat early rescued it from rust, but much of that left until fully ripe was scarcely worth the cutting Green May, July 16.--" The crops in northern Wisconsin (wheat and corn particularly) never looked better than at the present time Some later accounts, however, speak of the wheat crop oft low a as poorer than last year. In the northern section of the Territory, it is considered to have been very good; but in the southern it is said to freeze out more, and not to be equally large in proportion to the quantity sown. In the whole, as the cultivated tracts seem to be continually more extending, the crop in these Territories may be set down at an advance of 15 or 20 per cent. Though but a moderate product in comparison with other more favorite crops, yet the wheat crop for South Carolina, for 1844, (differently estimated as a "fair crop" "average crop" " one quarter more" wheat crop produced abundantly) probably was a general increase on the preceding year of about 20 per cent 39[ 75 Alabama, likewise, owing to the great attention paid to the cotton crop, raises but little wheat. The crop of 1844, on the whole, seems to have been a "pretty good" one, and may probably be set down as an advance of 10 per cent. above that of 1843. In Missouri, the earlier report in some places was favorable. In Madison, Washington, and Jefferson counties, it was thought that there would be an average yield of wheat; but the heavy rains destroyed a large proportion of the wheat crop, so that it is thought that there was not more than half an average crop; and we feel justified in placing it at 40 per cent less than the crop of the previous year, believing that, taking the various elements which help to form our conclusion into view, we shall not err greatly in such a deduction. Besides the particular notices which have been given of the wheat crop under the different States, we find the following general estimates respecting the wheat crop of the whole country, which it may be well to quote, as showing the views of those who have paid considerable attention to the subject. The Cultivator thus sums up the product of wheat for the year 1844, in a late number, (DecemberThis great staple product has yielded variously in different sections of the country; but in a territory embracing so many degrees of latitude, and possessing so varied a climate, it can hardly be expected that the same crop will succeed equally well in all parts the same season. I n rhine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, the spring wheat is generally cultivated, as it is considered better adapted to the climate than the winter Heat. The worm in the head, (cecidomyia tr it ici) improperly called weevil, has prevailed there to such an extent for several years, that this crop has been considered quite uncertain. The insect has, however, been less destructive during the two last years, and, from all the accounts we have seen, the yield of wheat in that section has been generally good the past season. In the eastern part of this Statenew Work) the insect above mentioned injured the winter wheat to some extent; but in the Genesee valley, and the great wheat districts of the State, the crop was good. In northern I n diana, northern  illinois :michigan, and Wisconsin, the fly (cecidomyia destruction) did much injury to the crop, in many instances occasioning almost a total failure; and we are informed that this enemy has already made: its appearance in great force in the early falls own wheat. In the southerly part of Ohio, I n diana, and I illinois, wheat, in many cases, did not fill well; the growth of straw was very great, but the prevalence of warm wet weather t occasioned much of it to fall down or rust. This was quite generally the case on rich land. In the uplands, of not so rich a quality, the crop was better, and the grain plumper and heavier. Taking the Western States together, however, we think the wheat crop did not give an average yield per acre, though, from the large quantity of ground sown, the aggregate product was not probably less- than in any previous year. To of the country at large, there was probably as much wheat produced the past season as in any former oneSThe aggregate of the wheat crop, as appears by the tabular estimate, for the whole country, during the year 1844, was 95,607,000 bushels. The ravages of the Hessian fly are becoming every year more alarming, and there is great danger, if more pains is not taken in time to counteract the evil, that the wheat .crop in our country will be seriously lessened, if not destroyed, by the same. In the hope of aiding the wheat growers 75 80 against this destructive enemy, an able paper has been procured from Edward C. Berwick, Esq, librarian of Pale College, who has devoted much time to microscopic observation and collecting information respecting this insect and its habits, and whose well known ability and accuracy of investigation entitles his valuable remarks to great weight. This interesting document, which Mr. Berwick has in the midst of his other a vocations kindly finished us, will be found in appendix No. 1. He thinks, as will be seen by a reference to his views, that the only possible method of extirpation is in burning the stubble, and sloughing it. I tis hoped that the farmers will endeavor to practise on the recommendation, so that there may hereafter be less injury sustained from the ravages of this insect. Dr. Harris, in his treatise on insects, speaks of the wheat fly, which is very destructive of the wheat crop, and which is sometimes confounded with the Hessian fly. Some extracts from his volume may be found in appendix No. 2. As a means of destroying slums or worms which sometimes do great damage in England, salt is very highly recommended in the English Farmers' Magazine, in the volume of which for 1843 may be found an account of the experiments of air. Us ke, which were extended over some hundreds of acres He says: "I n every situation, at every time, the effect appeared equally beneficial; the quantity used per acre was four or five bushels, sown out of a common seed scuttle in the evening. In the morning, each throw maybe distinguished by the quantity of slime and number of dead slums on the ground. In some fields, it has certainly been the means of preventing the destruction of the whole crops n an essay, by the late Willis May lord, on insects injurious to the farmer, published in the New York State Agricultural Transactions, he says : 'Kilndrying the wheat effectually destroys the weevil ;" and from some late experiments, recorded in the Tennessee Agriculturists, it appears, that if a hogs head, with one head taken out, is inverted over a fire, till thoroughly heated, and then is immediately filled with wheat, and headed up, all the we evils in the wheat will be killed, and the grain may be kept in safety until wanted for use. Keeping a granary well ventilated and cool, frequently stirring the grain, will do much towards preserving it from insects. A gentleman in Ohio gives the following account of a successful experiment against the weevil, in a letter to this office. He says: " I was, some twenty years ago, induced to make the experiments by the ravages of the weevil. They completely destroyed two crops of wheat. The third I was determined they should not entirely deprive me of. I let the grain stand in the field until completely dry, and then threshed and had it immediately ground, or before a sweat could take place. It made more and better flour than I had ever got before. I expected it would soon sour, but it continued perfectly sweet till the next harvest. I then laid a barrel by till the next harvest, and then opened it, and found it to be as sweet as when first ground. I have continued to act in the same manner for a number of years, and have never known it fail ri the last agricultural report, some suggestions were made with reference to the disease called smut, in wheat and other grain. The importance of the subject justified further remarks in this connexion. We notice that, in a recent lecture, Professor Johnston gives the following account of this 41 [75 ]disease, which is a species of fungus, the s po rules of which are so exceedingly minute that' they are taken up and ascend through the pores and sap vessels of the plants. Professor Johnston observed, it is said, "that the smut had received the name of are do see gum ; that these puff balls or s po rules were so minute that it would take 2,800 of them to cover an inch. There was no doubt that they ascended through the plant. By examination, it could be seen where they had come up. The tubes of the stalk were filled with black matter that had come through the vessels, affecting first the straw, and then getting into the ear, where it spreads itself all over. After passing through the stalk, the smut fixed itself under the root of the flower, which it rendered barren; and as the grain approached perfection, the puff balls became tight, and burst, showing black dust of very minute particles, so minute that it took about 1,100,000 of them to lie across a single inphHe then went on to speak of the manner in which smut was propagated. It was in the first place sown along with seed. Very often it was so minute that thousands of the particles might attach to a. single grain, and yet not be visible to the naked eye. Oats are more subject to smut than other grain. Eye is never attacked by it, and wheat seldom. Masses are sometimes attacked by it, and much injured Certain substances have been employed for the prevention of smut. The substances used are, sulphate of copper, or blue vitriol, wine, common salt, wood ashes, lime water, and sometimes arsenic. The application of these substances to the seed grain destroys the black dust, or the spores of the fungus; and, in addition to this, they make the grain grow better. Professorjohnston mentions an instance where a large field of oats was divided into several parts, and the seed doctored in different ways some not being doctored at all, other portions being dressed with gun no, and others steepedinthe following composition: phosphates of soda, sulphate of magnetic, nitrate of potash, common salt, sal ammonia c, or sulphate of ammonia. One pound of each, in ten gallons of water, to steep 300 pounds of seed, the moist seed to be dried with gypsy m or quicklimeOn looking at that field, it was found that the grain to which nothing had been done was smut ted; that which was dressed with gun no was also smut ted, as was likewise a portion where Campbells steep had been used but there were only two or three s talks affected with smut in the grain stepped in the composition above mentioned The smut which is sometimes found in wheat, called dust brand, or pepper brand, is supposed by some to be a different species of are do from that above spoken of. It is sometimes called sure do foetid a. But the same remedies against its attacks are used with equal effect n an agricultural paper, we find also the following statement as to an approved method of remedying this evil: " A gentleman near Baltimore has for several years been in the habit of washing his seed wheat in a strong solution ofglauber salts, (sulph late of soda) with the view of preventing smut, with complete success. He says he makes the solution strong enough to bear an egg, fills a tub half full of it, and then pours in half a bushel of wheat at a time, stirs it round well with the hand, skins off all the floating grains and other foul matters, dips out the wheat with a col ander, lets it drain, spreads it out on the barn floor till not quite dry, then rolls it in air soaked lime, and sows it. One man can wash and prepare in this way as much as a dozen men can put in the ground. Very descrip750] 42 t ion of foul seed, garlic, and filth, (except cockle is effectually taken out of the wheat by this process. He has no smut in the wheat since he adopted this plan. Flaubert salts can be purchased by the barrel at about one cent and a half a pound. The wheat swells while undergoing the process about 25 per cent; that is, four bushels will become five. I f, after washing, it be left upon the barn floor all night, aid thus become dry, it will lose a large portion of its increased bulk: It is better, however, to put it in the ground while somewhat moist, as germination will take place sooner; and the quicker any seed terminates after being put in the ground, the better. Besides the great object in view, the getting rid of smut and other impure ties, there can be no doubt that a most valuable nutrition and stimulating principle is added to the seed grain, in the soda that is absorbed. Farmers will do well to try the experiment. They may be assured it will do no harm, and it is not very costly. Probably a dollars worth of the salts would be sufficient for fifty or a hundred bushels of seed distinguished agriculturists recommends the following recipe, on the information of one who said he knew it to be infallible, after many experiments: " Dissolve a pound of blue stone in as much water as will cover five bushels of wheat, and let it remain about eighteen hours before it is sown, and you will never have smut in your wheat he find, also, in one of the numbers of the Southern Cultivator, the recipe for the prevention of smut in wheat, which we give as we find it or. Edi  Tor: I discover that you have several correspondents, giving various means to prevent the smut in wheat; and, as this is and important matter, I will give you one. My neighbor, Alexander R. Well, of this county, has long been considered a great wheat grower, and a great many persons are in the habit of sending some distance to purchase his wheat, on account of its superior quality. About the time he was cleaning his crop, I happened in, and he took me to his barn, to show me his great yield. I was astonished to find that there was no smut in his wheat, and remarked it to him. He said, no; I never have smut in my wheat. I inquired the means of preventing it, and he gave me the following: Now your wheat the first of October, and when you harvest let what you intend to make seed of remain five or six days longer in the field before it is cut, and by this means all the grains will be perfectly ripe and good. This is all he does to prevent the smut, and he never has it in his wheat. I stated that I had been out to see his yield, which I found to be fine. He sowed one bushel and a peck of wheat, and it yielded him forty bushels and a fraction over; it was as nice and as fine wheat as I ever saw, and made good flour. Hours, respectfully, Of Columbi A County, Georgi A. An editor of an agricultural journal recently established in Cincinnati, Ohio, a good judge in these matters, says, that the failure of the wheat crop in Ohio is often falsely ascribed to rust, as he states that many fields said to be destroyed from rust, on examination, " were in reality very little affected by rust at all. The straw merely turned brown because it had not the materials to give it a better color; and the merry did not fill, simply because the part could not obtain the proper elements for it to fill with. To obviate the evil which arises from the mixture of cheat with wheat, the following is said, in an agricultural paper from which it is taken, to be a good method 43 instead of having a riddle, as ordinarily used, in the fan, place a board in the riddles place; it may be an inch or two narrower than the riddle in width. By this means, the cheat is carried nearly off the screen board and, with the aid of a strong wind, is driven pretty effectually out at the second run of the grain The present year I undertook to clean some Mediterranean wheat, which had a pretty large share of cheat in it. By the aid of the above plan, at the second run, it was pronounced by an old and experienced farmer to be clean enough. I believe I might have run it five or six times the ordinary way without having it as clean. Thus I saved much labor, as well as some time, though it must be let through slowly and regularly, to prevent the falling sheet of wheat from obstructing the passage of the cheat while blowing out and falling through the fan si eve. This I accomplished by resting the half bushel on my shoulder, and letting the grain fall gradually into the fan hop per, which was aided by the jar of the fan in motion. This last precaution may not be necessary where hoppers are new, and properly constructed; but ours was old, and worn loose at the connecting points n the report for 1843, some notice was taken of a few varieties of wheat, and their adapted ness to our country. We find in the last volume of the New York State Agricultural Society a valuable essay on this subject, by General Arm on, of that State, who has done much to improve the culture of this valuable grain; and though it has been more or less published in the various agricultural journals in our country, yet it is believed that some extracts from it (in appendix No. 3) will not prove an unacceptable addition to this report. Different varieties are of course adapted to different soils and climates. The following is a notice taken from a public journal respecting a kind called the China or hardware wheat, said to have been originally found in a crate of China ware, imported from the north of China, and by the way of Canada introduced into this country. It is said to average from 150 to 180 grains to the head, and that it will yield from 45 to 50 bushels to the acre, and ri pens 8 or 10 days sooner than any species of wheat. , The crop is said to have been ripe at an early date. Mention is made in some of the papers of a species of wheat, in the vicinity of Cincinnati, called Alabama wheat, from the fact that half a pint was brought from that State in 1839. It is said that 2,000 bushels of this variety has been raised in 1844, in the White water valley, and that it takes the preference over all the wheat brought into the market at Cincinnati, weighing from 64 to 68 pounds to the bushel, and the yield averaging 30 bushels to the acre. Some of this variety may perhaps be received for distribution this winter at the Patent Office. The Black Tea wheat, a spring wheat, has been l already alluded to as a favorite variety in Vermont. It is said to be very hardy, free from rust, and produces a better yield than any other of the varieties there cultivated, especially on unfavorable soils. It is stated, by one conversant with it, that he believes it will yield better there than rye, even where rye has heretofore been considered the safest crop. The flint wheat is highly commended in Michigan, and it is stated, that where it is used it is quite free of the fly. One person says, that in Unadilla were two fields immediately adjoining each other, of like soil, and both prepared and sown alike, and about then same time, one with[ 75 ]a] 44 white flint and the other with the bald red chafed variety. "the flint stands fair, while the red chaff is not worth harvesting and threshing. The flint also is considered less liable to rust The Mediterranean wheat seems still to meet with favor, although some doubt whether, on its improvement by cultivation, it will be found to, resist the attacks of the fly and the rust. One of the most decisive trials of its value is found in the account given in some of the agricultural journals of the experiment of Major re. Apron, of Laurel Factory, Princegeorges county, Maryland, who, it is stated, made from this variety of wheat, in twenty acres of land, at the rate of forty-three bushels to the acre, when five years ago the soil would not have yielded seven bushels of oats to the acre. The blue stem wheat distributed the past year is also considered as a valuable kind for cultivation. The agricultural journals and reports of societies have a bounded with accounts of individual crops, which show a large increase on the usual average yield. The following are a few of the interesting facts relating to the production of this grain. "or. J. Underwood, of the town of middlesex, in the State of New Work, cut fifty-two bushels and fifty-six pounds of wheat on one acre, selected from about thirty, which he thought would yield the same amount." Some of this seed has been set t for, to distribute from the Patent Office this winter. Again: a specimen of white flint wheat, raised by Byron A. Adams, of Last Gloom field, New Work, is mentioned, one hundred and seventy-four pounds of which produced one hundred and forty-four and a half pounds of flour, and thirty-two pounds of br an and middlings, averaging forty-eight pounds of flour to the bushel. The following is taken from the Baltimore American : " Great yield he are informed that Mr. John Caught, of Middletownvalley, in this State, has now growing on his farm, from a single kernelof wheat, seventy-seven perfect heads, well filled. The same gentleman has also one hundred acres of splendid wheat now fit for the sickle. In the English papers, allusion is made to a new kind, called Barattawheat" which is said to be very prolific. A single stool or root consisted of seven ears, each containing eighty corns; thus giving the product of five hundred and sixty from a single grain. Mention is likewise made, in a recent English paper, of a crop of wheat, the produce of two acres and on brood of ground, which, when threshed out, yielded one hundred and fifty-three bushels of the finest quality* As showing the possible extent to which the culture of wheat may be carried, the following, extracted from an agricultural journal, deserves mention: "by planting the kerseys just six inches apart each way, and feeding the plant on food containing in a so ruble state all the elements necessary to build up its entire system, including the materials to form the straw v a swell as the merry, a gentleman in England has grown at the rate of three hundred and twenty bushels per acre The editor of the American agriculturists, from whom this statement is published, says: " It has been asserted by some, and sneered at by others in this country, that 100 bushels of wheat could be easily grown upon a single acre." It will be seen that the following little experiment in England produced at the rate of 320 bushels: " The imperial bushel contains 2,218.192 cubic inches; the Winchester our common bushel) 2,150.42; the imperial bushel, therefore, is to the 45 [a[ 75 I Winchester as 1 to 0.969447. The English quarter of wheat is 8 imperial bushels of 70 pounds each, equal to 9- American bushels of 60 poundseachAt the end of August, 1843, I planted in my garden 32 grains of wheat, at six inches distance, an inch and a half deep the seed was of the first rate quality. This seed produced this year 32 plants, having from 10 to 28 stems and ears each; the average number of ears was 16; the average weight of each plant 14 ounce. An acre of land would contain, at six inches distance, 174,240 plants; the produce, 304,940 ounces, or nearly 1900 pounds 320 bushels, or 40 quarters, per acre. The expense of doubling would be more than saved by the diminished quantity of seed required. I do not mean to state that such a result would be obtained upon a large scale, but I think it is worthy of trial. When we know that the average produce is only 2- quarters per acre, and that it is possible to grow 40, it will be allowed that there is ample scope for improvement. Cry a breadth in your fields an inch and a half deep; put one grain (and one only) in each hole, plant it at six or eight inches distant. He sure to plant good seed. Met as much produce as you can, but go for 40 quarters per acre More attention should be paid to the culture of the wheat crop, as, owing to the land being robbed of its appropriate chemical elements by the abstraction of the straw and the grain, the soil becomes un fitted for this grain. It is stated in the report of the Farmers' Club of New Work, that the quantity there has been diminished from 30 to 10 or 15 bushels per acre. The same process seems to be going on in Ohio and other Westernstates, and should be checked in time. Certain chemical substances are necessary for the formation of the straw and the grain, and these should be supplied if both are carried off from the land. Some experiments have been given in the agricultural journals, also showing the importance of the drill husbandry for wheat over the broadcast method of sowing. One of the most interesting of these is that of Charles Noble; for which, see appendix No. 4. It will be seen that, while at least 3 pecks of seed per acre was soon, the crop also was increased 71 bushels; so that the grain was 8 bushels and 1 peck to the acre. The amount of straw also increased 12 per cent, and the amount of grain 27 per cent. per acre. According to Sprengels Analysis, it is stated that 1,000 pounds of wheat leave 11.77 pounds, and the same quantity of wheat straw leaves 35.18 pounds of ash. Of the straw ash, 270 are s iliac, without which substance it is impossible to grow either wheat or rye. Thus, it is plain that the agriculturists, though he may sell the grain, must not rob his field of the straw; and that a gain in straw as made by Mr. Noble) is a real gain for perpetuating the fertility of his fields. Dr. Nobles system of top dressing, in which he has been so successful and which may be found in the Boston Cultivator, deserves to be read with attention, as it decisively proves that care only is necessary to make our crops far more valuable. To apply manure directly to the wheat crop, it is said, is injurious, as it produces weeds, and forces the growth of the wheat, and renders it thus more liable to blight and rust. The nutritions quality of flour has been ascertained, it is said, by a French[ 75 ]a] 46 chemist; and, from several samples analyzed, he has obtained the followingresultsNuremburg bread equals -10000 Dresden do -11531Berlin do -11604Canada flour do -11723Glasgow un fermented bread equals -12315Lothian flour equals -a" -13406United States flour equals -14503United States flour, by chemical analysis -15000The more glum ten flour contains, the more good bread a given number of pounds will furnish. A barrel of flour rich in glum ten will give 10 per cent more bread than one nearly all starch. The quantity of the meal forming principle depends, it is stated, in a good degree, on the quantity of nitrogen in the soil on which the wheat is grown. The following facts are interesting, in connexion with this crop in acre of land, with the same labor and proportion of manure, Jacobscorn Saw Tracts) says, will yield 300 bushels of <a name="potatoes2"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, or 24 bushels of wheat. The food of <a name="potatoes3"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, at 38 pounds per bushel, equals 11.4 pounds the latter, at 60 pounds, 1.4 pounds: thus, the wheat is one-eighth of <a name="potatoes4"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Air H. Navy says wheat contains three times as much mucin age, ok starch, as glum ten, albumen, sac charing, &c. Probably the nutriciouspower of wheat to <a name="potatoes5"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is as 7 to 2, or 2 pounds to 7 pounds. One individual, a year, consumes 480 pounds of wheat, or 1,680 <a name="potatoes6"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. One acre of wheat will feed 3 persons, and of <a name="potatoes7"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> nearly 7 persons. The nutriciousness and palatableness of bread depend much on the method in which it is made; and for this purpose good yeas t is indispensable. The following recipe for yeas t has been furnished by a baker, who has proved it abundantly. It is easily followed, as it requires no materials but such as may be obtained by every housekeeper. Were flour only well fermented when used for bread, there would be not only an actual saving of many millions of dollars, but the health and happiness of the community would be greatly advanced. For four or five gallons of yeas t, take one quarter pound of hops; boil them until all the strength is drawn out; strain the water ; add 5 pounds of common wheat flour; stir it in while it boils; also, stir in while it is boiling or hot one half pint of malt, ground fine. If made at night, it will be ready in the morning; and if in cool weather, or put in a cool place, they east will keep five or six days. The application of wheat straw to the making of paper has been known for some years; and we find it stated in a late English paper, that the finest and the coarsest kinds can alike be made, and that the experiment was soon to be tried on a large scale, as mills had been taken to Half ord for that purpose. Should this manufacture be successful, it will only be a new proof of the indebtedness of agriculture to the mechanics arts for the varied application of its products. Barley. Of the crop of barley, the information which has been received is in general very slender arid indefinite. Though it has been dis used as a material 47 [75 ]for distillation, yet, in some parts of the country, it is becoming somewhat more cultivated, in place of rye, for the use of animals, &c. The crop in Paine is thus characterized by one whose means of information are better than ordinary: "the crops of barley, when cultivated, were good; but not so much was sown this year as heretofore. The reason probably was, that barley has been cultivated pretty extensively as a substitute for wheat, as it did not suffer by the weevil. Farmers, finding that this insect was not so frequent as formerly, have returned to wheat. Barley has, however, never been raised extensively in Paine before the weevil came, and little or none is shipped Another person, speaking of the central part of the State, north, estimates the increase to be 10 per cent. more than in 1840; while, in the southwest section, it is thought to have "decreased yearly, for five years past, from 5 to 10 per cent in the whole, we believe that there was not so much raised, by 5 percent, in Paine. In New Hampshire, on account of the drought in the lower part of the State, east, the barley crop is thought to have fallen two thirds from the previous year. Further towards the Connecticut, in the southwest part of the State, it is thought to have been a slight gain, perhaps 15 to 20 per cent. In the central part of the State, west, on the Connecticut river, like all the grain crops, barley is thought to have been above an average. Perhaps the increase of the crop over that of 1843 would be safely fixed at from 5 to 10 per cent. There is not much raised in Vermont, and hence but little account is taken of it. As the season, however, was propitious for the grain crop, it is thought that there may have been a slight increase in the aggregate, of perhaps 5 per cent. or more. In Massachusetts, in the central section of the State, there seems to have been an: increase of about 10 per cent. over the crop of 1843. In the northeast part, bordering on the Atlantic, for the last five years there has been but little barley raised, on account of a worm in the straw. In Rhode I s land and Connecticut, there is very little attention paid to this crop, and scarcely any estimate can be formed, as it occupied so small a place in the view of the farmers. Seldom is there seen there a field of even a few acres devoted to barley. The bulk of the barley crop of the whole United States is raised in Newyork. Met, even here, there are large sections of the State where little or none is cultivated. It seldom, however, is the subject of distinct notice in the agricultural papers, so that it is not easy to trace the progress of the barley crop through the season of its growth. We find a few hints, which we give. Thus we notice it in the middle and also at the end of the month of July, in western New Work, as "good" "proving better than for many years" and in an agricultural paper for August, at New Work, it is stated barley has come in finely, and the crop is an unusually good one. His city is the principal market, consuming annually about 20,000 bushels The accounts since the harvest, also, from other sources, speak of it in the northern part of the State " as a fair average" and, with the exception of the following, in different sections, as " an average" "about as in 1843,"Sfully an average crop" " full crop" &c. In the county of Onondaga, it is estimated atone-fourth less than the year 75] 48 previous; while in the county of Jefferson, and its vicinity, it is thought that it exceeded the crop of 1843 by 15 per cent. A good judge says, from the information he has been able to gather, that it is larger than in 1843. More of this grain is cultivated this year than for some time past, and the crop is a very good one. The season has been very favorable for most of the spring crops; and it is quite probable, therefore, that the crop may be one quarter (perhaps one third) larger than that of last year. With this agrees the information from the western section of the State, that" the ain is of a better quality, and the crops larger n Rates, Genesee, and By coming counties, the barley crop is estimated, by good judges, to be 50 per cent. better for 1844 than was that of 1843. In Niagara county, our informant says: The growing of this crop has very much diminished within the last few years, on account of the progress of the temperance reformation. The crop of this year was about an average yield, though less land was sown. Very little, comparatively, is now raised, except for horse feed and making pork, though brewers both at home and abroad get a portion From the various information we are thus able to gather, we think there was an increase of this crop in the State of New York of from 15 to 20 percent. Were it not for the falling off in some of the counties, we might perhaps be justified in rating its advance over the crop of 1843 at 25 per cent; but, all things considered, we prefer the lower estimate. In New Jersey and Pennsylvania little is raised, but it seems to have been an 'ordinary crop" " as good as in 1843." Still, the quantity is so small as to attract comparatively little notice, so that no very reliable estimate can be formed. Compared with the crop of 1843, it might have been perhaps 5 percent. increase. Others possibly would rather fix it at as much the other way. In but one district, the northwest section of the State of Pennsylvania, do we find any decided increase noticed. There it is said to have been 25 per cent. over the crop of 1843. Though Virginia stands pretty high on the comparative list of the States raising this crop, yet we have been unable to obtain any data to enable us to speak with any assured ness as to the advance or decrease of the barley product. It seems probable that there may have been a slight increase, but so small that it will not vary much from the crop of 1843. The State of Ohio furnishes a barley crop larger than any. of the Western States but Michigan. The information for the most part from this State of this crop, for 1844, is, that it was a " usual crop" average n the central part of the State, north, comprising Delaware, Marion, and Rich land counties, we are told that the crop was about ten per cent over that of 1843. In the vicinity of Dayton, a good judge thus writes: " Owing to an increased demand for barley, it is probable that twice as much was reaped this year as last, but there was not more than half a yield The cause of the failure is stated to have been "the wet weather, For the whole State, we think there may have been an increase on the crop of 1843 of from 5 to 10 per cent. In I n diana and I illinois, although there was not much raised, yet it is thought to have been an average crop ; and, in the western part of the latter, by some was estimated at 10 per cent. increase over the crop of 1843.49 [a' 75 ]michigan ranks high among the barley producing States; and compared with the crop of 1843, which was a poor one, there has been a gain. In the eastern and northern section, it is estimated at an average crop, while at the west it is said to have been "unusually good" and "more than an average crop." Still, there have not been causes to produce an unusual demand, and therefore attention has not been more than ordinarily turned to it, so that the advance is to be attributed to other causes than the unusual occupation of a great quantity of field; and therefore the whole average for the State cannot be ranked higher than 10 per cent. over the crop of 1843. The whole barley crop for 1844 is supposed to have been 362 7000 bushels. Mention has been made in some of the papers of a kind of barley termed the Your or wheat barley. The person said to possess it has been written to for a sample, and some further information respecting it. The account, so far as given, is, "that it has been raised in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania. The straw of the grain is similar to that of the common barley, with the same formed ear externally; but it is not attached to the grain, that being formed like wheat, of course without husks and this is the cause of its great weight, which is about 60 pounds to the bushel. I to g oath is precisely similar to spring barley, requires to be sown at the same time, and used for the same purposes; and, thus far, has succeeded quite as well as the common barley." The original quantity, it is stated, was about a table spoonfuls, and has been cultivated for three years. It is hoped that some of the seed will ere long be received at the Patent Office for distribution, as it has been requested from the person said to have it. Oats. In referring to the tabular estimate of the crops, it will be seen that the year 1844 has been a very favorable one for this crop, and that the increase or gain on the previous year is large. The year 1843, it will be recollected, fell off in the aggregate, from the year before it, which was more than an average one. The weather the past season seems to have been propitious to this great crop, which appears to be viewed with favor in nearly all the States. The New England crop was evidently superior to that of the former year; though it will be seen there may have been sections which are exceptions. In Paine, it is estimated at " 10 per cent. advance" and our informant, well able to judge, writes: "in excellent yield of oats has been harvested in Paine. This grain is extensively cultivated. Large quantities are used in the logging swamps, on stage routes, in stables, and a great amount is shipped. The spring was favorable for getting them in, and the cool summer congenial to them, and the merry filled well." The advance we are inclined, from all we can ascertain, to set as high as 20 or 25 percent. for the whole State. In New Hampshire, the appearance of the crop seems to have been very similar. One person thinks it was " about the same as last year" another estimates it above the common average ;" another, " an average crop ;another, perhaps better fitted than most to form a correct opinion, says that " oats sown before the 10th of May have been an excellent crop those sown after run the risk of blight." The o at crop, for the whole, could not have been less than a gain on that of 1843 of 15 or 20 per cent perhaps larger. In Vermont, likewise, the o at crop has increased. It is said to have been" very good ; better than the year previous" which somewhat fell off from that of 1842. In Franklin county, like the wheat, it is said to have been very fair. From all we can learn, we feel justified in fixing it as high as 15 to 20 per cent. better. In the north eastern section of Massachusetts, though it was a good crop, yet it is thought to have been, perhaps, 10 per cent. less than in 1843. I n the central and other parts of the State, the product was better. In Berkshire county, in July, the crop, though less popular of late than barley, is said to look well. Probably, to estimate the whole crop of the State at an advance of 10 to 15 per cent, would not be very wide of the mark. Rhode I s land is supposed not to have shared in this gain, but either to have been about the same, or it may be a little less. In the southwestern section of the State of Connecticut, the crop of oats has been a fine one, and well harvested; in the central section it has, in many fields, proved deficient, owing to the drought in the early part of the season. In the great State of New Work, which stands foremost among the States which produce large crops of oats, from all our numerous notices, we have not a single one unfavorable. In every section it is spoken of as an abundant crop, or, at least, superior to that of 1843. It will be recollected that the crop of 1843 was decidedly less than that of the previous year. In the month of July, in the vicinity of New Work, it is stated, respecting the crop of oats: " The fields look beautiful; the heads are now filling, and the color is turning to that bright yellow that denotes that the crop is nearly ready to be cut. There is every appearance of a good yield to in Queens county, oats are said to be most promising. Again: in western New Work, from Buffalo, within the same month, we hear that 6 oats are generally good." Again: early in August, from the same section, the report is: "oats have given a full crop; and if we have only a moderately dry month, they will be secured in good order." And yet, againaOats are all received, and the crop proved to be a very good one n the central part of the State, in Onondaga county, in July: Oats are much better than usual, and the farmers count on an abundant crop to in the vicinity of Tic a, about the same period, the crop of oats is said to promise well. An agricultural paper, also published in that vicinity, early in August, says, of this crop, that it " promises to be uncommonly heavy; straw not so large, but the heads are large and well filled. The season has been quite favorable to this grain n the neighborhood of New Work, July 21, oats are described as being heavy" and a similar remark is made, that the straw is not so large, but it is said to be well headed, as the season was a good one. 'the notices received since the harvest was gathered in correspond with these earlier promises of the abundant crop. In Long I s land and in the vicinity of New Work, it is described as being " a good crop; more than theusuia yield." In West chester county the increase over the year preceding is said, by an informant, to be 100 per cent. In But chess and Putnam, as "good as in 1843." The report with respect to Range county, as given by one whose means of judging are better than ordinary, is highly favor a 50[ 75 ]51 [a[ 75 ]be. He says: "his is one of the staple products of our county of Range, and the favorable season and an improved system of culture have united to make the crop this year one of the largest which we have ever grown. The grain is of superior quality, and the total yield is probably nearly double that of last year. The best crop offered for premium to our society yielded the enormous, and, with us, unprecedented amount of one hundred and eight bushels to the acre; the second best yielded seventy-four bushels and twenty-four quarts to the acres n Ulster and Delaware, at least one third more." In Columbia and Greene, "somewhat better." In Rensselaer county, the crop was "an excellent one." In the Mohawk valley, "as good as the year before." In the northern section of the State, the o at crop was also a good one, And in Jefferson county, the increase is estimated to have been 40 per cent. above the crop of 1840. Long the region of Schoharie, in quantity, says one, it did not greatly vary "from the previous year, but in quality it was superior." Another writes thus: " Oats are produced in large quantities; the average yield, however, is not higher than twenty bushels per acre, and should be forty. I raised this year from three acres one hundred and thirty-two bushels of very large and heavy oats this was on sod ground, ploughed up in the fall, ploughed again in the spring, dragged over carefully three times, and seed to the amount of three bushels per acre used? In the counties of Oswego, Madison, Onondaga, Kaluga, and Sort land, this crop is considered "full an average one" " about the same in quantity as i 1843, but better in quality Still further west and south, we meet with similar statements. In Genesee and Wyoming counties, it is estimated, by one well qualified to judge, at one third more than in 1843. And of Niagara county it is said: "the crop of oats was good, though the quantity sown was less than in some preceding years, yet the average was 10 to 15 per cent. above that of 1843."I n Cattaraugus county the report is not equally favorable, for, though the usual quantity was sown, it is said " there was hardly a medium crop in agricultural paper, speaking of this crop in the State generally, remarks thus: "his as a grain crop may be considered as entitled to rank next to that of corn in importance. As food for horses, especially those which are employed in quick work, oats are preferable to any other grain, and constitute the most convenient food which can be given. The yield this year is generally good in most sections From the information we have been able to gather, we think we are authorized in estimating the o at crop for the whole State of New Work, for 1844, at least 25 per cent. better than in the year preceding. In New Jersey, likewise, the accounts are uniformly favorable. It is pronounced to have been a good crop, and by some is estimated at 50 percent. advance on the crop of 1843. As the crop of the last year in this State was so much less than in 1842, we are inclined to believe that and advance of 30 per cent. may be allowed, With scarcely an exception, the crop of oats in Pennsylvania which stands only second to New Work is pronounced to have: be et "a full crop more than an average n Lancaster county, our informant says: "there has been; thinner, something less than an average, owing to the want of' sfiieie rihicid127) h" Theahguage of others in various sections of the State isn ibtidtbtha i an aWer75 ]a] 2 age crop" "uncommonly good" "abundant crop, exceeding that of last year" &c. In the central counties, on the upper branches of the Susquehanna, it is said to have been " 30 per cent. better than in 1843, the season being more favorable." And still further north, and towards the northwest section of the State, the estimate of increase is placed as high as one third more than in the previous year. The crop of oats in Pennsylvania for 1844, compared with that of 1843,which was a falling off from the preceding year, seems, therefore, to have been at least 25 per cent. better. Some complaint is found of the drought gas affecting the o at crop in Maryland; and in the central part of the State, bordering on the Chesapeake, it is even thought to have been "not more than half a crop" owing to the dry May. By others, the injury from the drought is estimated to be about 20 per cent. Probably it did not vary much from 15 to 20 per cent. Virginia is a large producer of oats; and, so far as we have been able to ascertain, the reports respecting this crop during the last season are highly favorable. The general estimate seems to be, that the crop is a "full average one" " very good, both in quantity and quality" owing to a favorable season. In the central southern section, bordering on North Carolina, the estimate reaches even to " 100 per cent. advance on the crop of 1843,"which is accounted for from the timely seeing in good order, and a moist May and June. In Bedford county, also, it is said to have been an uncommonly plentiful one. In the western part of the State, also on the Kanawha river and vicinity, it is thought to have been 10 per cent. better than the year previous, which fell off 10 per cent. from that of 1842. In the whole, we feel warranted, taking into view all the causes which might influence the increase, to place it at about 15 per cent. In some parts of North Carolina, the drought affected the o at crop un favorably, so that it probably fell off one third from the crop of 1843. Such is the estimate with regard to the southern central section, bordering on South Carolina. In the southwest, too, a similar complaint is heard, and the product is thought to have been less. In the northwestern section, however, the reports are more encouraging, and the crop is spoken of as being a "good one." Similar, too, is the judgment of our informants respecting some of the northwestern counties; and it is believed to have been "an average crop." It is probable that there was an average advance of from 5 to 10 per cent, throughout the whole State. The same cause (the drought) affected the progress of this crop still more in South Carolina, and probably lessened it at least 20, if not 25 per cent. I need, by some it is estimated to have fallen off one third, in consequence of the very dry spring which was experienced. Thus a public journal in Green ville says: " The o at crop on upland is almost entirely destroyed by the drought." Again: " Oats were seriously injured by dry weather; but we should suppose that fully two thirds of the usual quantity has been harvested in this district Similar unfavorable reports reach us from Georgia. Great complaint is made of injury to this crop by the drought. By some the crop is considered as about an average one. Such is the estimate for the central western section. In the northwestern however, the language is: "short, on account of drought in the spring ;53 [a[ 75 the grain crops have fallen short of what they were last year" "decreased 50 per cent, on account of their being no price ;" "the season was against oats; consequently, we raised a less quantity ;" "1 25 per cent, short of the crop of last year, owing to the cold and wet in January and February, and drought in March, April, July, and August; I speak now per acre The falling off, as it is seen, was thus very considerable, and probably amounted to 20 or 25 per cent, compared with the crop of 1843. Of the o at crops of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas we know but little, there being but a small yield, compared with the more prominent and staple products of these States. To far as we can form an estimate, it is favorable; and we place the crop at a slight advance, perhaps 10 per cent. above that of 1843. In Tennessee, we are informed, that there was a decrease in some cases it is estimated at 10, and in others at 25 per cent. less than the crop of 1843. It may be set down at about 15 per cent, on the whole. An agricultural paper, published in this State, mentions that in the. Tennessee valley oats are " nearly a failure The o at crop of Kentucky, so far as we can judge from partial notices, was a better one than usual. Our informant, speaking of the northern central section, says that it was "very heavy and well saved, like the crop of 1843, and equal to it." Another: "the crop was very large, and the product uncommonly abundant." In the southern central counties, the estimate is given of an advance on the crop of 1843 of one sixth. The average increase for the whole State may therefore be fairly estimated- at 20 per With a single exception, our information respecting the crop of oats in Ohio, which ranks the third in its production of this grain of all the States, is most favorable. In some of the south eastern counties it is said to have been injured by rust. Of the eastern central counties it is said: The o at crop is unusually good, and at least 255 per cent. greater than it was last year, or than it has usually been." In the central section the increase is estimated at " 10 percent n the northeast, the crop is good. Last year it was very small. To doubt it is doubled this year, if not more. Last year, the weather was very unfavorable; this year, very favorable, and perhaps it is even more than doubled' In the northwest, and bordering on the lake, it is likewise thought to have been an advance of "50 per cent which is attributed mainly to the early rains in April, which were congenial to its growth. In the southwestern section, towards the centre, along the Diam i valley, the report is, that "this crop will not vary materially from that of last year. The season was favorable, and the yield was very good." Still further in the same direction towards the southwest, the o at crop is viewed as about a " usual one Reviewing the different information, and comparing it with that of the year 1843, we are confident that we shall not over rate the average increase of the o at crop for the whole State of Ohio, at 25 per cent. Perhaps it should even be placed as high as 30 per cent, as nearer the truth. We must allow as large if not a larger advance for the o at crop of I n diana, which appears to have been unusually good. Beginning in the southeast counties, on the Ohio river, towards the south, we are told that it was "an average crop ;" lower down, and bordering on Kentucky and Ohio, in the 75 ]a] 54 southeast, it is considered to have been "an abundant crop." Proceeding in a direction which will include the counties of Union, Gazette, and hayne, &c, the o at crop was about there as in the previous year." In the central section, in the vicinity of I indianapolis, the crop was only "a medium one, find injured by wet weather in the spring." In the north section of the State, it seems likewise to have declined, so that it is said to have been three-fourths of the crop of 1843. From all that we can gather, therefore, we believe that we may safely allow 25 per cent. for the average increase of the o at crop in 1844, over that of 1843. A very large crop of oats was gathered in I illinois. The statements which we have received are, without exception, of an important advance. In the southwest, there are said to have been "fine crops." In the same direction, bordering on the Mississippi, the o at crop is estimated to have been a gain of one third or more; north of this it is estimated at 25 percent. better than in 1843."I n the central and northern counties, it was a very good crop. The same is the view taken of the crop on the Wabash river and back. In an agricultural paper published at Chicago, we perceive it stated that there was a good crop; and it is even said that it was three times as good as the year previous, in middle I illinois. In the whole, we judge that the advance over the crop of 1843 deserves to be ranked as high as 25 or 30 per cent. The oats of Missouri are said to have been a first rate crop; and in Michigan, where it is a favorite crop, it is stated to have been a " good croponethirdper cent. at least better than that of 1843 ;" unusually good this year, and yielded more than an average crop." The o at crop of Michigan may there tore be set down. as an advance of 25 to 30 per cent. In I own and Wisconsin, it is regarded as likewise a fair advance, so that an increased crop has been raised ; probably it was 15 or 20 per cent. better. With such statements, drawn from a variety of sources, we feel authorized to put the crop considerably higher than that of the previous year. The aggregate crop of oats for the United States, therefore, amounts to172247000 bushels. Rye. This crop, although raised in all the States, yet ranks in its amount least of all the grains, except buckwheat. There is considerable variation in the estimates made respecting it for the year 1844. In Paine, in some of the upper counties, the estimate is that it was 10 per cent. more than in 1840. Another well informed correspondent writes, from the central section of the State: " But little of this grain has been cultivated during the past year. The crop proved good, but there is not much in market, on account of the small amount cultivated." As the crop for 1843 fell off, it is believed that 10 per cent. advance on that crop would be a fair average estimate, through the whole State, for the crop of 1844. In New Hampshire, in the lower section of the State, it is thought by our informant that it was diminished one half, in consequence of the drought. In the upper counties of this State, the season has been remarkably fruitful, and the crop is pronounced to have been above a common average. I n the southwestern section, the crop was about the same as in 1843. In the Farmers' Monthly Sister we find the following general statement respecting the rye of New Hampshire : The crop of rye on all our light lands 55 where not injured by the frosts of last winter, has been very good; and even tolerable on fields early in the season supposed to be nearly ruined by winter killing. Eye sown as early as the 1st of September, double the crop sown on the 1st of October, and four times as great as that sown in the middle of October." The crop of the previous year having fallen off, and the one for 1844 having been a decided gain on that, it is believed that 10 per cent. advance will not be too great for the crop thus noticed above. But little information has reached us respecting this crop in Vermont but, so far as we can form a judgment, there seems to have been a slight gain, perhaps 5 to 10 per cent. It is described as there having been no material variation, and the crop equal to an average. In Massachusetts, in the central counties south, it was "about the same as in 1843." In the northern ones, towards the east, it is thought to have been "25 per cent. better than in 1843;" while still further to the northeast, and bordering on the ocean, we are told, " rye has been hardly an average crop ; the straw was heavy, but the berne l was not so well filled. The multi come rye did not head at all; probably it is a winter grain. If sown in the fall, success might follow." The crop is said to have been 50 per cent. less" than in former years. Take the whole together, and with reference to the effect of the weather, there was a gain of about 10 per cent. for the whole State. There is no material difference between this and the other New Englandstates. If anything, there was a better crop in Connecticut, as it is described as being a good crop; and in the central part of the State, it is said, "rye an abundant yield, and the quality very superior." As the crop of 1843 fell off from the previous year, that of 1844 may be set at 15 to 20 per cent. advance, since more of this grain is raised in Connecticut than in any other of the New England States. The information respecting this crop in the State of New York is favorable more so than for the previous year. In some parts of the State, having been raised principally for distillation, it has been lessened within a few years. Thus, in one of the central counties, our informant says: " Eye, none raised; cold water times drown it out." Such is the general report from the central section of the State; there is a small crop, and no material variation from the previous year. In the vicinity of Tic a, an agricultural paper says, in August: " The rye harvest has been progressing for several days; it commenced somewhat earlier than usual; the crop will be full an average one n the northern part of the State it is said to have been "a good crops n Schoharie county, and towards the south, " the crop of rye was large the yield, individually, however, is very small, and is always so; the average is seldom over fifteen bushels to the acre, and this of agra in which should produce twenty-five bushels." In Rensselaer county it was an excellent crop" along the river counties an "average" one ; and a correspondent in Range county says: "eye is grown by our farmers pretty extensively, as the soil of some parts of our county is peculiarly adapted to it. The crop this year is poor, a considerable part of the grain having been blasted, it is supposed, in consequence of the storms of the early part of the season, when the rye was in its blossom; and the crop is probably one third less than the average one." As there are no inducements to produce any increase of growth, it seems to follow, from the above information, that the crop through the whole State could not have varied much from that of the previous year, the falling off in some sections having been somewhat over balanced by the gain of others; and an allowance of 10 percent. advance will be about a fair average estimate for the crop of 1844. A similar estimate may be allowed to New Jersey. Pennsylvania produces the most rye of any State in the Union, and the general report is favorable. It is variously estimated, as being "a good crop" " average" " pretty good" " very good" though in some parts the crop is said to be a "light one, having been injured by the frost in June and in others it is said there was much less sown than formerly. This crop being so much less cultivated than wheat, it attracts comparatively little attention; and hence the information contained in the papers, or in the replies of correspondents, is not as ample. Small patches are here and there cultivated, but these are scarcely observed by the passed by, and cannot come into a general estimate so well as when large tracts are laid down to any kind of crop. There was, on the whole, probably an advance of 10 per cent. over the crop of 1843. There is, comparatively, very little rye raised in the Middle or Southernstates. In Virginia, in the section where it is cultivated, it appears to have been a common one, and probably the increase may be rated, in comparison with the crop of 1843, at 10 per cent. Kentucky raises considerable rye, compared with most of the Westernstates; and though the production of it is said to be diminished in some parts 5 per cent. per acre, yet the crop was a fair one in quality, and unusual in quantity. The increase may have been 5 to 10 per cent. In Tennessee, there is said to have been less seemed, and the crop was probably some 5 or 10 per cent. less than in 1843. The crop in Ohio is but little noticed, but, so far as heard from, it seems to have been at least an "average" one, and in some cases it is even estimated in the central counties as high as " 20 per cent. increase." An informant, speaking of the vicinity of the Diam i river, in the southwest section of the State, says : "in account of the low price which rye brought in 1843,but little was sown for this year. The field was excellent; but the comparative quantity produced this year, I have no means of ascertaining Taking into consideration the fact just mentioned, that less was sown, in connexion with another, that in 1843 the yield fell off some 10 per cent it may be perhaps no unfair estimate to allow a small increase, from the excellence of the crop, of from 5 to 10 per cent, for the average one for the whole State, over the crop of 1843. In I n diana, I illinois, Missouri, Michigan, and the other remaining States, rye forms a very unimportant crop. In the whole, the crop appears to have done well in the first of these States, and was about an average one, and we may allow it 5 per cent. increase' over that of 1843. The reports from I illinois and Michigan are yet more favorable, and the crop is " good n the western part of I illinois, it is even estimated in one section as high as " 25 per cent. more than last year ;" and, likewise, in the western section of Michigan, it is stated to have been "unusually good" and that it " will yield more than an average crop." We put the increase in both these States at 10 per cent. over the crop of 1843. With regard to the remaining States and Territories, there is scarcely any information; and the only means of estimating the .crop is from the crop of 1843, together with the information respecting the season, and the 57 [75 appearance of the other crops most nearly resembling it in character. The whole estimated amount of the rye crop for 1844 in the United States is26450000 bushels. Buckwheat. The buckwheat crop is the least of all the grain crops, and, except in two or three States, the amount raised in any, will reach only some hundred thousands of bushels, at most. It is unnecessary to enter with much minuteness into the description. The editor of an agricultural paper in Paine writes us to this effect: that this grain is "not much cultivated, but the crop was very good when sown. I raised a very fair crop, which was harvested in just two months to a day from the time it was sown. It filled well; my horses are very fond of it before threshed, and will eat the straw now as quick and as heartily as they will c lover hay. It was cut when about one third of the seed had changed to a black color, suffered to wilt, then raked into a window, where it laid ten days, when it was got in. I propose to sow more next year, to harvest it as above, and keep it un threshed for winter feed for horses." The crop probably, so far as it was raised, was a slight advance (say 5 percent) over that of 1843. In New Hampshire and the other New England States, the ratio of increase is about the same; as we are informed the crop was good, "an average one" "very fair" "full average and good" "good, and gathered in fine order" &c. New Work, which ranks as one of the highest in the list of the States producing this grain, seems to have gained very considerably on the crop of the preceding year, which, it will be recollected, fell off from that of 1842 at least 20 per cent. In Long I s land, in consequence of the drought, the crop suffered, and is less than usual. In the river counties, and those in the vicinity of the city, the crop of buckwheat is considered by some as "the same as last year" "about an average." A very good judge of the matter, speaking of the vicinity of Range county, says of this crop, that it " is raised by our farmers for exportation, and is considered by many among our most profitable crops. The season has been very favorable for this grain, and the crop is at least one-sixth larger than common; the quality of the grain is also uncommonly fine." Still higher up, it is pronounced to have be eh "very good" "excellent." In Schoharie county, our informant says: " Buckwheat is raised in large quantities, and is more profitable this year than either rye or oats. The dry weather in the month of September has injured the crop with us; the average yield is about twenty bushels to the acre." In the county of Its ego the crop is thought to have been "much more than usual." Long the Mohawk valley, about as last year. In Jefferson county the increase was probably 20 per cent as it is estimated at 46,000 bushels, which is an increase on the census returns of about 25 per cent. In the more northern section, it is said to have been "a good crop." In the vicinity of the lake, and the central counties bordering, it is considered as " 50 per cent. above that of 1843,""good, and about the usual quantity" and also yet lower, towards the southern border, " more than an average" "a full average crop Further west, the report is quite as favorable: thus, in Steuben and Allegany counties, it is thought, on account of the season having been better[ 75 ]a] 58 that the crop was '25 per cent. better" than the year previous. In Genesee and Wyoming counties our informant says that the yield was 100 per cent better than in 1843, as much was then lost, owing to the bad weather. Of Niagara county and vicinity, the report given us is to this effect: 6 The cultivation of this grain is increasing. The crop in the season past is probably larger and of better quality than ever before; a larger amount sown, and the season has been favorable for ripe king and perfecting the grain; increase over 1843, at least 25 per cent. In Cattaraugus county, the crop is said to be " good, better than last year in reviewing this various information, and comparing it with the estimates of 1843, we feel authorized in placing the buckwheat crop for the whole State at an average advance of at least 25 per cent. The estimates from New Jersey, on this crop, are :equally favorable; it is called " a good crop ;" and in some of the central counties it is rated even as high as 40 per cent. We have put the whole, as in New Work, at 25 per cent. over the crop of 1843, which fell off some 30 per cent. from the previous year. It will be recollected that the decrease in the crop of buckwheat, in Pennsylvania, in the last report, was large. The crop of 1844,though much better, was not equal in comparative increase to that of Newyork. In the vicinity of Philadelphia, it is said not to have been a good crop. In some of the central counties, on the upper branches of the Susquehanna, the crop fell off from the average one, in consequence of the drought; and it is even estimated that perhaps there was "not more than one half the usual quantity." In other sections, the general report is, " an average crop" very good" ' more than an average." Of this crop, in the southwest section of the State, it is said, "buckwheat, a heavy yield, but not so much sown last summer as in some other years." In the northwest counties, and on toward the northern central, it is believed to have exceeded the crop of 1843 by "one third." In Arm strong county, likewise, the yield was very good for the crop put in. Taking the State through, with reference to the weather, amount sown, &c, it is believed that 20 per cent. advance on the crop of 1843 is a fair allowance as the average increase for the whole State. In Virginia and Maryland, so far as any reports can be gathered respecting this crop, it was an "average one" good as usual." We omit the last in the table. To little is raised in the District of Columbia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas, that it is also thought proper to omit altogether any estimate, for these States &c, in the column of buckwheat. The reports from Kentucky, I n diana, and I illinois, are favorable; and, although the quantity is small, there is an advance probably of 10 per cent. In Ohio and Michigan alone, of the Western States, is the amount deserving of much notice. The crop was probably 20 per cent. better than that of 1843. For these two States the estimates are, " good crop" " good crop, never better" " average" or "usual crop" &c. We may therefore consider the whole buckwheat crop, as we have given it in the tabular estimate, at 9,071,000 bushels. Mai Of Of I Ndi  Of Corn. This great crop is in high favor, but the amount raised this year is less than in 1843.59 [a[ 75 ]the crop in Paine promised, in the early part of the summer, to be a first rate one. In some parts of the State, it is considered so uncertain a crop, from the season, that the farmers rely less on it than they formerly did. From one in the central part of the State, who is well qualified to judge correctly, we have the following report: "the crop of I indian corn, contrary to the expectation of every one, turned out well very well. The season of summer was cool. The worms made great havoc with the seed planted. We had hardly a 'real corn night during the whole summer. It was from ten days to a fortnight later than common, and it was expected that an early frost would sweep the whole by the board. In September, however, we had a fortnight of real sultry weather. It brought the corn to maturity in grand style, and we have seldom had better bins of excellent corn than can be shown among us at thistimeAnother, also speaking of the crop of corn in Paine, says, of the southwestern section of the State, that "there was more planted than usual, "and a "fair crop" was gathered" 10 per cent. more" than the previous year. The average increase, we think, must have been from 20 to 25 percent. over the crop of 1843. Respecting the crop of I indian corn in New Hampshire, the early notices are favorable. In July, it is said to " look well ; and again, in the middle of September, an agricultural journal of high authority, says: "early the whole I indian corn crop, early and late kinds, in this part of the Merrimac river valley, is at this time so ripe as to be beyond the fear of injury from the frost. This crop will be excellent the present year; the well tilled fields are extremely prolific of ears, and the ears themselves tapped with corn even to the very points." The subsequent accounts correspond with the above. In the central western section of the State, bordering on the Connecticut river, the crop is said to have been "much above common South of this, the crop was " excellent" at least a quarter more was raised than in 1843. The season is stated to have been "kindlier for this crop than for many years past." In the lower part of the State, further east, it is said to have been full "an average" "a good one, equal to that of last year ;" and by one who is well fitted to form an accurate opinion, the remark is made, "increase of quantity, but no better crop, oneeighthFrom the whole we gather, as the general result, that there was probably an increase of 20 to 25 per cent. over the crop of 1843, to which the millionth unit should be added. The corn crop in Vermont is differently estimated at an average of 15 to 20 per cent. over the crop of 1843. It may have been about 10 per cent gain through the whole State. The earlier notices of this crop in Massachusetts are promising. Thus, it is said, for 60 miles from Boston, the prospect for corn is good. In Berkshire county, also, the crop is said to look well. In the northeast section of the State, we are told, since the crop was gathered, I indian corn better than an average crop; the ears are heavy, and well ripened." West of this, it is stated to have been " 10 per cent. better than the crop of 1843, and fully ripened n the more central counties, it is thought to have been " 15 per cent better than in 1843 ;" and from what we can learn respecting the whole crop, as compared with that of the previous year for this State, we believe it may be safely considered as an advance on that year of from 15 to 20 per cent. 75; ]a] 60 n Rhode I s land, also, there was an increase probably of about 10 percent, though the crop in the western section of the State does not seem to have been equally good with that of the eastern. The warm autumn was favorable to the growth of this product, and the amount gathered better than ordinary. The report with regard to the crop, from Connecticut, is highly favorable. It is said to have "come in much better than usual, and the season for its ripe king having proved" favorable" the crop is said to be "abundant." The average increase of the corn crop in Connecticut over that of 1843 was equal probably to from 20 to 25 per cent. The notices, Which we find during the summer, of the appearance of the corn crop in different parts of New York are quite promising. In the western part of the State, we learn that as early as the fire part of May they had already begun to plant corn. In July, the corn crop in the vicinity of Albany is said to look well. The same is the report under the same date for western New Work, Schoharie county, and also for Tic a; and near the lake region, it is described as "unusually promising." Thus, in the vicinity of Data via, it is stated, "corn never was better, and more than usual in quantity." In Onondaga county, somewhat early, the corn is mentioned as being "somewhat backward" the cool weather having affected it, though the warmer weather and rain then experienced promised to aid it. Nearbuffalo, it is said to look "remarkably well." In an agricultural paper, under date of July 21, for central New Work, we find the following remark as to the corn crop: "generally looks well, the early plant being tassel led. Some of our gardens, occupying warm soils, have had green corn in market already. The field crop bids fair to make a good average n the vicinity of New York city, we have here the following statement as to the appearance of this crop, also in July: "his is our great crop in this part of the country. The weather, since the ground was first turned up, and the crop put in, has been uncommonly fair or able. The plant had a good start before the hot weather came on, and its appearance is all that could be wished. The stalk is large, the leaf broad, and the color that dark rank green that denotes health and vigor. The ear is now beginning to set, and the silk and tassel are out. There is therefore every prospect that the crop will be a good one. I need, the season is so much advanced, that it cannot well be otherwise month later, we gather the following notices: In the vicinity of Newyork, " the season has been favorable, with sufficient warm weather to bring the plant forward. The ears have filled, and there is every prospect of an abundant harvest." Again: Worn looking well, generally; the s talks have a good growth, and the ears are abundant and well filledUtica: " Worn promises to be fine' Some complaint is made at Syracuseof the drought, as affecting the corn, in August' Under date of Buffalo, September 2, we find it said: Worn is generally doing well, and if the frost holds off for twenty days, we shall have a better crop than usual." To, again, from Rochester, early in September, speaking of the crop of western New Work, one writes: "' I indian corn crop never better." Somewhat later September 20) "the warm weather has hastened the ripe king of corn, which is now out of reach of frost. " And in October, from Buffalo: Worn in capital order." In the central part of the State, an agricultural journal remarks, about the middle of September: " We have not yet experienced any frost, and the corn is pretty much out of danger on that score; and 61 from present appearances, a fair crop will be harvested." Again " In the early part of the season, the temperature was rather low, and the months of May and June were of a rather moist character, but the warm temperature and seasonable showers in July produced a vigorous start, and the present prospect bids fair for a good crop." Again, in a public journal in Albany, it is stated: " The corn crop is ripe king most finely. This, which in the early part of the season was so backward, has lately come forward so rapidly, that the promise is most abundant. Another week of favorable weather would place it beyond the reach of frost The information otherwise gained since the gathering of the crop is also highly favorable. In Long I s land it is said to have been "a great yield probably one third more." In West chester and Lock land counties it is said that it was "25 per cent. better than last year." In But chess and Putnam, and some of the other river counties, a little better than in 1843." In Ulster and Delaware counties, "at least one third more than in 1843." In Range and Sullivan counties, the statement by one well fitted to judge is: " His is the most favorite grain product of our county, (range) and has been very generally cultivated by our ,farmers for many years. A few years since, forty bushels to the acre was considered a crop to be hoped for rather than expected, whilst now such a yield is considered almost a failure. The great improvements in the mode of cultivating this crop have not only more than doubled the product per acre within the last two years, but have individually increased the sum total raised in nearly as great a proportion the increased profits of raising the crop encouraging our farmers to cultivate this grain in preference to almost all other spring grains. The past season has been with us very favorable to this grain, and the crop is on every account a very large one probably at least one fifth larger than last year. The best crop offered to our agricultural society yielded one hundred and fifteen bushels and twenty quarts of grain to the acre. The second best yielded one hundred and six bushels and twenty-four quarts to the acres n Schoharie and Its ego counties, we are told that the corn crop " is a good one" " rather better than last year" and, again, that it has done " extremely well, the average crop per acre probably reaching as high as forty bushels. The season here has been favorable to corn neither too dry nor too wet; and a long spell of warm weather in the fall has brought in the crop in excellent order." In Rensselaer county, it is pronounced ' a fair crop." In the Mohawk valley, it is said to be equal to that of last year" good." In the northern part of the State, around the head of Take Ontario and vicinity, there was an increase of 50 per cent." on the census returns in 1840. I n Madison and Oswego counties, an increase of 30 per cent. In Onondaga county the crop is considered to have been a good one; but, owing to there having been less than usual planted, as also dryness in June, " less than an average one" -perhaps " 10 per cent." less than in 1843. In Kaluga and Sort land counties, "more than an average crop." In some of the counties further west, as Tompkins, Chemung, and Rates, there was "more than an average crop" and from one in the latter of these counties, who is well fitted to for man estimate, we are told "there was an increase of 40 per cent. this year over the last; severe drought last year injured the crop. I have raised this year, on one acre and three-fourths of land, one hundred bushels of shelled corn; it is called the large white corn." In Steuben and Allegany counties, also, it is described as having been "25 per cent. better than last year" as the season was also better. In the counties of Genesee and Wyoming[ 75 62 too, the crop is supposed to have largely increased, and the advance over that of 1843 is placed, by a good judge in these matters, as high as ' 50 percent." This region, even when in possession of the I indian tribes, was famous for its fine corn; as we find, in an account of General Sullivan S expedition into the country of the Seneca S, large quantities of corn were destroyed; and some of the ears, if we recollect right, are mentioned as being not less than twenty-one or twenty-two inches long. Met further to the north, in Niagara county and the vicinity, a correspondent informs us that "agriculturists are, to a considerable extent, applying their barn yard manure to this crop in preference to barley, and the season past it has been uncommonly large. Sixty or eighty bushels per acre are common, and one hundred have been produced in several cases. The causes of this increase, which is at least 30 per cent. above 1843, are : 1st. A larger amount planted. 2d. More and a greater variety of manures have been applied. 3d. More care in tillage, keeping down weeds, and stirring the ground during the growing of the crops n Cattaraugas county, which is not a corn county, the crop is said to have been a medium one. In an estimate, therefore, for the increase in the whole State over the crop of 1843, since the crop has been so fine in many of the most fruitful sections, we feel fully justified in fixing it at least as high as 25 per cent and we somewhat doubt if it ought not to be placed as high as 30 per cent. An agricultural paper in this State, published since the whole crop was harvested, holds the following language: "although this crop did not appear promising in the fore part of the season, owing to the coldness and backwardness of the spring, yet the mild and favorable weather of the latter part of the summer so well matured the plant, that the yield has generally been an uncommonly good one. In the Northern and Eastern States, as well as in Canada, we feel justified in stating that so good a crop has not been generally got for several years. This is a crop of very great consequence to all sections of the country, and, for home consumption, is undoubtedly of more value, every thing considered, than any other kind of grain. Well has it been said, by a distinguished agricultural writer, that it is meat, meadow, and manure." The grain affords a most wholesome and nutritivefood for man and beast; the stalk and leaf afford, when properly cured, a most excellent fodder for cattle; in fact, from no grain crop can so great an amount of sustenance be raised per acre, and from none can so good a return be given to the land in the shape of manure The corn crop of New Jersey, also, was better than ordinary" a " good crop" " 20 per cent. more" so that a considerable increase, as much as 20 per cent, may be fairly supposed. We have but few early notices of the corn crop of Pennsylvania; so far as we can ascertain, it was promising. In Berks county, in June, it is stated, "cor p looks advanced and healthy ;" and from Philadelphia, with regard to the State generally, that the " corn promises to be plentiful." Again, with respect to Chester county, we are told "the farmers are felicitatingthemselves upon the flattering prospect of heavy crops of corn" " vegetation is very forward Later intelligence respecting this crop is, in most respects, very favorable. In the counties of Columbia, Luzerne, and Wyoming, it is described as being an uncommonly large crop. In the central section, including those counties bordering on Centre county, it is likewise said to have been " a 63 [a[ 75 very full crop more than ever raised there in one year." Somewhat further east, it was "a good crop; " while, in the south eastern part of the State, we are told that it was 'cid127onequarter less" than the crop of 1843,owing to the " drought ;" and, again, " there was not more than two thirds of the usual yield from the same quantity of ground planted, owing to the' drought." In the central counties, bordering on the upper waters of the Susquehanna, the increased crop is estimated at 50 per cent. over that of 1843. I indian corn " could not be more sound in the grain and large in the ear than that harvested this fall; it is far superior to the crop of last year " I n the northwest section, also, it varied from " average" to "one third more than the crop of the previous year. Taking all the various information into view, we think it may not be far from the truth to estimate the corn crop of Pennsylvania at an advance of from 15 to of per cent. over the crop of 1843. The accounts from Maryland are not so favorable; early in the season, it is said, under date of Hagerstown, and with reference to Washington county, "corn, which is necessarily short, stands well, and presents a healthy and vigorous appearance." In a public journal we find the following notice : "he have seen a good deal of the growing corn, and have conversed with a number of experienced farmers, and believe that the corn crop on the Eastern Shore will be a very small one. The stalk is unusually small, and tasseled lower than we have ever known it. In poor soils, it will not repay the expense of cultivation." Again: on the 25th of July, a person writing from Centre ville, speaks thus of that vicinity : It raised on Tuesday last, for the first time for five or six weeks. The corn fields present a sickly appearance, from the drought, and look, in many places, as yellow as they usually do in September." Since the crop was gathered, the account from the central part of the State, west of the bay, is " 25 per cent. less, owing to the severe drought in May, July, and August ;" and in the northeast counties, "one third short, owing to a worm in the spring, and drought at the time of hearing 5" Again: an agricultural journal states that the " corn crop on the Eastern Shore of Maryland is a short one, "as " complaints are heard from every quarter." The crop probably fell off at least 25 per cent. from that of the year 1843. The corn crop of Virginia seems to have suffered much from the drought, The papers of that State furnish accounts like the following :the corn crops are cut short by the drought at least one half on this side of the Blue Ridge." Again: "he hear of sad failures, however, along the valley of the upper Roanoke." Again, in the last of July, in the vicinity of Norfolk : "he have had several refreshing showers within the last four days, which have had a most salutary effect on vegetation, and have been of incalculable benefit to the corn." Notwithstanding this unfavorable opinion, it is also added: " As far as our information extends through the eastern counties of Virginia, we have heard "no complaints of a deficiency of the corn crop; on the contrary, the general impression is that it will be more than al- average Other notices obtained are to the following effect: In the central, southern counties, bordering on North Carolina, there was "a diminution of one third, caused by a very dry July and August." Further north there was a short crop, and not of a very good quality." In a south easterly direction from the central part of the State, there was "a falling off of 20 o percent, owing to the drought of the summer." Last of the central counties[ 75 ]a] 64 and bordering on the Potomac, the crop, likewise, was "much affected in some neighborhoods" by the same cause. In the western part of the State, there was an increase of perhaps 20 per cent. above the crop of 1843. From the best estimate we can form for the whole, we believe that there was a lessening of the crop at least 15 per cent, compared with that of 1843. The same cause (the drought) affected the crop extensively in Northcarolina, though there were exceptions where the crop was quite good yet the notices respecting the northwest, towards the central south, and also on the south, inform us that the crop was " one third less." Probably, there was at least a decrease of 20 per cent, as the average for the State. We are furnished with considerable information, gathered from the public journals, respecting this crop, in South Carolina, These we sub join, without any reference to particular order of arrangementSOur coin crops are very fair, having been made principally by the last rains of a month ago Charleston (S. C.) Mercury. The Columbia Temperance Advocate says : " For several days past we have been blessed with copious and refreshing showers in and around Columbia, which have cooled the scorching heat of the atmosphere, and given new life to both the vegetable and animal worldHigginss Merry, July 26, 1844.-The corn crop is very sorry, owing to the great drought in the spring, which, in this section, lasted eight weeks. Heat generally proved fine. Cotton looks well; it is more forward than i ever knew it before, having commenced blooming on the 6th of June" Spring Drove, Aureus, July 27.-Some of the corn is entirely dead. It has been five weeks since we have had a rain to wet the ground. I may safely say, there is a drought in every thing around us" Colemans Cross Roads, Edge field, July 24.-My corn is tolerably fine in prospect, although, if we do not have rain shortly, I shall not make more than half a crop; neither will any one else about here. And over inNewberry, at least next to the river, the people are literally scorched up he understand" says the Camden (south Carolina) Journal of the 7th instant, " that the crops of corn in many parts of this and the adjoining districts, as well as the neighboring counties in North Carolina, are suffering much from drought. In some sections, not more than half crops areexpectedHigginss Merry, July 29.-We have had a very dry spring and summer thus far in this section, and, as a consequence, crops look very sorry, especially corn. The weather too, for the most part, has been very warm. In Sunday, the 7th instant, the thermometer stood at 99 degrees at 2 o clock, P. M., in the shade, and would no doubt have risen about 100 degrees, if a breeze had not sprung up about that time. This was the warmest day we have had in at least three summers past The Anderson (south Carolina) Gazette says : " Some sections of our district are literally parched up from the want of rain. The corn crop will be shorter than for many years past; while we are writing, however, the prospect for rain is good The Edge field (south Carolina) Advertise r of the 2 1st instant says' This part of the district has, for the last mouth, suffered much for rain. The corn crop has fallen off greatly, and the gardens are literally burnt up. In Monday evening we had a fine shower; and when this was written there was every appearance of more the first of any account for six weeks 2 '6, [75 Again, at a later date, it says: Within the last week we have had the warmest weather we recollect having experienced, which has nearly completed the destruction of the corn crop and gardens in the vicinity of the village. We had a fine rain on Saturday evening, but we fear part of the corn was too far gone to be saved. Some of our farmers have commenced pulling fodder, fearful, no doubt, that they will lose it" Pendleton, august 2.-We have had a more general rain than our district has been favored with since early in March. In some sections, we learn that the corn crop will be remarkably short, whilst in others it is verypromisingGreenville (south Carolina) .august 2.-The prospect for the crops was never more flattering in the upper districts than at this time. In some neighborhoods, however, they have suffered severely from drought, and, immediately under the mountains, from too much rain The Fairfield (south Carolina) News of the 3d says : " After an almost continued] drought for two months past, we have the gratifying intelligence to record of a most beneficial and refreshing rain on Wednesday and Thursday. The corn in the immediate vicinity of the borough, and other vegetable matter, have suffered considerably in that time Other accounts correspond with the above. In Spartanburg, Union, and vicinity, the crop was a "short one not more than two thirds. In the districts of Dickens, Aureus, Green ville, &c, it was one-fourth less, from drought ;" and, if we estimate the whole falling off, it was probably from 25 to 30 per cent, for the State, from the crop of 1843. In Georgia, also, we have before seen, there was a great drought in some sections, and the corn crop suffered by the same. As early as May 24, atCassville, we are told the "corn crop will be cut short, for want of rain n the western and northwestern section of the State, especially, though there were large crops, yet they were " not so great as usual, on account of drought." Again " 25 per cent. short of the crop of last year, in consequence of the cold and wet in January and February, and drought in March, April, July, and August." The want of a market also operated unfavorable and, we are told that it "decreased 50 per cent, on account of there being no price' There is, however, one exception, in a part of the Cherokee country, in which we are told of an increase of about so per cent, owing to the fact' that this has been a good crop year, or a favorable season for corn, In the whole, we presume there was a falling off equivalent to the average of 25 per cent. less than the crop of 1843. In Florida, the appearance of the crops, as we learn from the public journals, varied. in different sections. Thus, it is said: " The weather still continues hot and oppressive The corn crops in the vicinity of Jackson ville are almost worse than nothing. What the first drought in the spring failed to 'destroy has been fully accomplished by the present second one. Unless we have rain in a few days, the most serious results are to be feared gentleman recently from the interior informs us that the crops in the neighborhood of Sort King, and from that towards It. Johns, are very forward and promising, and be token rich harvests to the planters andfarmersLetters from the Suwannee say that the continued drought about that river has injured the crops materially, and that they will not turn out asfaygorable a~ anticipated 575 ]a] 66 The It. Augustine News learns that " very good crops of corn will be gathered in Last Florida, notwithstanding the extensive drought whichprevailedThe Tallahassee Floridian of the 3 1st multi mo says: "our corn crop has been unusually good this season; our planters have abundant supplies for consumption and sale From all that can be gathered respecting the corn crop of Alabama, it is believed to have been a good crop, and better than an average one ;probably 10 or 15 per cent. better than in 1843.. In the upper part of Louisiana, in the vicinity of Washita, it is said: "the corn crop is particularly fine throughout this whole section of country. In Arkansas, also, in the counties bordering on the Washita and its branches, we are informed by a gentleman just from there, that the corn looks exceedingly well." Though in portions of these States it suffered from the overflow, yet it is believed to have increased from 10 to 15 percent. The same was the case in Mississippi, where the corn crop appears to have been better in some parts, while in others it " suffered much for want of rain, and is not so large as in the preceding year." Taking the State through, by the estimate of good judges, it seems to have fallen off 10 percent. Under date of August, it is said of this crop, in Marion county and vicinity, that it was a fair crop; and, though there had been all sorts of weather first cold, then dry, then wet still it was uninjured. From the States of Tennessee and Kentucky, which raise such quantities of corn, we believe, from what we can learn, that there was a decrease on this crop. In some parts, though the corn was sounder and of better quality, the quantity fell off. The Southwestern, Farmer, in November, states that, in Tennessee, the crop was such that but little could be expected from thence for Mississippi. In several southern counties in Tennessee, the crop of corn is stated to have been " one-sixth less, as not so much was planted, in consequence of the low price and the increased cotton crops n the section of Kentucky embracing, among others, the counties of Path, Clarke, Lawrence, Montgomery, and Organ, the crop is said to have been " never better ;" but for the whole State through, we think there was a decrease of not less than 10 per cent. Our means of judgment, however, are not so ample as for some other States. Ohio stands high for its production of corn and, though not attracting equal notice for record in the public journals with the wheat crop, yet the accounts early given, so far as they have been gathered, seem favorable. Thus, a Cincinnati paper says: "between this city and Harrison, a distance of 20 miles, the corn on the Diam i bottom is heavy." Again: in the same vicinity, with reference to the appearance along the Ohio river, in July, it is stated: "the rains, unless too excessive, will do no material injury to the growing crops of I indian corn, which at present are very promising n the vicinity of the lake, towards the west, in September, it is said: " The corn crop, owing to the wet weather, looks small, but it is out of the reach of the frost." Other information is to the following effect: " In the vicinity of the lake, and on the northeast, it is said to have been good. It filled and ripened without frost. In June there was a frost, which injured some fields, and destroyed some early planted. After that, the weather was good till it was safe. Last year there was a deficiency of 15 per cent. This year the crop, it will be safe to say, is increased from 15 to 20 per cent." In the 67 [a[ 75 Northwest, towards the central counties, the report is less favorable; and, owing to the "wet weather about the time of planting" it is thought that there is a decrease of 10 per cent. And, again, by another, it is said: "Very poor, scarcely two thirds of a crop, in consequence of the .a." Still further towards the central part of the State, in the vicinity of Marion andRichland counties, "a wet spring" also caused a " decrease of 10 pe( cent from the crop of 1843. In the southwest corner of Ohio, also, the crop is estimated as "one third less than usual." Again, it is stated of the Miamivalley: "his crop will fall short of that of last year about 25 per cent." I ncid127some counties the yield was excellent; in others very poor. The decrease is attributed to long continued rains, which prevented proper cultivation. In the valley of the Muskingum, the southeast section of the State, on the other hand, it was unusually good, and has been rated even as high as 100 per cent. advance on the crop of the preceding year. North of this, in the eastern counties bordering on the Ohio river, the report is: "the crop is good this year, and may be estimated at 25 per cent. more than an average one; and in the southern portion of this district it is 100 per cent. greater than it was last years t is stated in an agricultural paper, under date of 4th of July, at Goshendohio, that "corn is greatly injured by the wire worm, which has been making sad work for several years, and appears to be increasingly mischievous. It is a yellow hard worm, about an inch long, and the size of a knitting needle. It works itself into the heart of corn before it is up, and afterwards collects around the roots, and seems to take away the juices, so that the corn makes but little progress in growing. Unless means are found to stop the work of this insect, some of the farmers talk of abandoning the crop of corn altogether When we recollect that, in 1843, the corn crop was but a poor one in Ohio, we feel warranted, from such accounts as we can now gather, to fix the advance of the crop for 1844 on that year at about 25 per cent. The early prospect of the corn crop in the south part of I n diana appears to have been good, as we find notices like this in the first week in June : "I neffer son and Jennings counties, the corn crop is doing well, though the ground has been considerably beaten and hardened by long continued and heavy rains." In general, however, the crop was much injured by the wet season; especially was this the case in the western part of the State. In the southwestern counties, lying on the Wabash, and in the northwest section, it is estimated that "one quarter was drowned out on the bottom lands, and the balance was light" so that there was not, as another expresses it, " more than three-fourths of last years crop raised." The loss is considered even greater in the central western counties, between the two sections just in mentioned, and it is said to have been "very poor, on account of the weather say 50 per cent. less than last years n the central part of the State, also, it is considered to have been at least but "a medium crop" having likewise there been injured by wet weather during the spring, and the overflowing of the bottom land." At the southeast, in the counties bordering on the Ohio, it was full an average crop, and by some it is estimated as being " 10 per cent. better" than the crop of 1843. The decrease on the corn crop for the whole State, we think, can hardly be less than 30 per cent. The wet weather operated also un favorably on the corn of I illinois, especially in sections bordering on the Mississippi[ 75 ]a] 68 where many hundreds of acres have overflowed. From the notices in the agricultural journals, we gather the following account. In Warren county, under date of June 3d, it is stated: "any have not planted their corn some have not even been able to plough, on account of the excessive rains since the 1st of April; many who have planted will be under the necessity of sloughing over, their first having rotted in the ground, and the weeds having gained the mastery n July, " the corn on dry ground is doing tolerably well, but the prospect on the whole is poor; much of it was planted two or three times over." The squirrels were destructive, and the loss fro ri the rains was great. Again: "the corn crop in much of this country will be light' Also, from Quincy: " The prospect for corn is very poor; there will probably be a failure." The other accounts received are no more favorable. In the south eastern section of the State, and along on the Wabash, it is considered to have been " not more than half a crop owing to the unusual rains." I n the southwestern counties, lying on the Mississippi and its branches, the estimate is, that " two thirds of the crop on the American bottom was cut off by the flood, and on the uplands injured early in the season by the wet and baked by the dry weather." North of this, also, on the Mississippi, it is thought to have been " 50 per cent. less" than the crop of 1843. From the central counties, the information furnished us is: "the corn crop yielded about two thirds of an average crop. Subsequent to the rains in the spring time, succeeded a considerable drought. The joint effect was to destroy the crop on low or flat lands, and injure it on all lands." South of these central counties, it seems to have been somewhat better. The average decrease of the corn crop in I illinois, it would seem, wa from 30 to 50 per cent; and we fix it at 40 per cent. for the whole State. Very little information has been gained respecting the corn crop of Missouri. From a notice in a public journal, we learn that in the lower counties, on the Mississippi, the corn crop was light; but in the upper counties of south eastern Missouri it promised well. Taking into consideration the state of the season, and the operation on the other crops, so far as known, we are inclined to think this crop should be rated at about the same comparative decrease as I illinois. By some, it is even put as high as one half. We allow, however, somewhat less, on account of the additional increase by settlement. From every part of Michigan, the account is of a good crop for 1844. Last year it fell off, but for this there has been a great increase. In the south eastern section of the State, it was probably not equal to that of some others. Thus it is said: The corn crop was generally fine, but the aggregate amount was about the same with last year, because less was planted, owing to the season for planting being exceedingly wet." In the north eastern and western sections, embracing the remaining cultivated portions, we are told that it was "unusually good, and will yield more than an average crop." And, again: " A good crop; 30 per cent. better than that of last year he shall not probably be far from the truth, if, in consideration of the advancing settlements, and the increased amount of land cultivated, together with the season, we allow an increase of 25 to 30 per cent, over the crop of 1843. The corn crops of I own and Wisconsin also suffered from rain in the 69 [a[ 75 early season, and were not average crops. Thus, in July, it is said, after allowing for the wet season, lasting for three months: "the corn, at best, cannot be more than half a crop." Again, at Salem, in I own, June 30th: "the corn is very small. Some farmers here have ploughed it up when it had been re planted two or three times, and been as often drowned out by the great rains." This loss will in some measure be balanced by the increased land brought under cultivation. It will thus be seen that there has been considerable diversity in the corn crop of the United States for the year 1844. The general estimate is thus summed up in a paper in the State of New Work, which perhaps in the main is too favorable : "the corn crop in this State, as well as in the middle States, and also throughout New England, is promising, and it looks well at the West; but the continued rains before alluded to are said in many sections to have done this crop an irreparable injury. The thousands, or rather millions, of acres planted with corn, on the fertile bottoms of the Wabash, the I illinois, the Missouri, the Arkansas, the Red, and the Mississippi rivers, were overflowed in June for such a length of time that this great Western crop must thereby be diminished. But the Eastern, Southern, and Middle States will repair this deficiency, so as to make a full averagecropThe whole amount, according to the tabular estimate, was 421,953,000bushels. The importance of the corn crop, as well as the fact that it is so universally cultivated, and so great a favorite, has induced us to sub join some suggestions, gathered from different agricultural papers respecting the method of planting, tillage, &c, which may be found in appendix No. 5. In the same appendix, also, will be found the report of the Middlesex Countyagricultural Society, in Connecticut, in a crop raised by Mr. W. Lads worth, of Durham, in that county and State, on a crop which yielded at the rate of one hundred and fifty-one bushels and eighteen quarts of shelled corn to the acre. Samples of this corn will be soon distributed from the Patentoffice. It shows what may be done by selecting seed, and properly cultivating it. In a letter of Her dine Ellsworth, of the same State, we have an interesting account of a crop of one thousand bushels of fine corn on 8 acres, or 125 bushels to the acre specimens of which have been received. The mode of tillage is also described in detail. (see appendix 5,as before) Another of these papers is from the report made to the Agricultural Society of South Carolina, which may be applicable to the culture of this crop in the South. We derive from this paper the following facts relating to the consumption of corn in that State. In the years 1838 and 1839, about five hundred thousand bushels of corn were imported. From October, 1841, to October, 1842, three hundred and sixty thousand and from October, 1842, to October, 1843, two hundred and sixty thousand bushels." This is said to show an increase of the crop of one hundred thousand bushels. But this mode of estimate is calculated to give the impression that such was the only increase; which would mislead, for the data are not sufficient on which to rest the conclusion. The increase, as we have attempted to show in the report for 1843, was larger. In the late geological survey of New Hampshire, by Dr. Jackson, we find some interesting remarks respecting the elements of the different kinds of corn, and their comparative nutriciousness, accompanied with illustrativeplates. These, with the useful deductions from the same, which he suggests, may be found extracted from his volume in appendix No. 6.70Much has been said and written respecting the use of corn s talks as fodder for cattle, &c. Some remarks and extracts from agricultural journals, on this subject, may likewise be found in the appendix. (see No. 7.)As the corn crop has suffered so much by the drought during the last season, in various parts of the country, it may be useful to remark here, that it appears, by an experiment mentioned in some of the agricultural journals, that " corn planted last spring, in very dry, sandy soils, and when suffering from drought, on being served with a pint of ashes to a hill, revived and did well The subject of corns talk sugar, and the relation it bears to the corn crop, may be appropriately considered under the head of sugar. Some remarks were made in a former report on the subject of broom corn. It is now stated that this seed is excellent to fatten sheep, and that they are fond of it, and will fatten better on it than on I indian corn. Room corn is thought, by one who has thus used it, to be more valuable for sheep than oats, or any grain, pound for pound. It is said that " large quantities of the brush of broom corn, raised in the valley of the Ohio and elsewhere, have been shipped to England within three months past, together with broom handles, for the purpose of manufacturing brooms. By managing in this way, we understand that rooms can be afforded cheaper in Great Britain than if made here andexportedSaltpetre is often used as a preparation for the seed. Some caution is necessary in its application, as appears by a trial mentioned in an agricultural paper, in which it is stated, that where too much saltpeter was used, the kerseys were reddish and delayed. The proper proportion may be ascertained by experiments, though something must depend on the nature of the soil and the circumstances of the season. <a name="potatoes8"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. When, the last year, (1843) the <a name="potato1"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was found in many parts of the country to have suffered from a new disease, it was hoped that it might prove temporary, and that during another year it would be seen that the loss was owing to some peculiarity of the season, which would not operate again; but, from the reports for the year 1844, it is to be feared the worst is not yet experienced. The crop, in other respects promising, seems to be much cut off by the evil before mentioned; and, what is still more disastrous, it appears to be extending into districts which have before been free from it. This will be seen by referring to the notices which we have been able to gather respecting it. Though an important crop for the comfort of the inhabitants of our country, yet, for some reason or other, it does not seem to engage the notice of the agricultural journals while in the earlier progress of its growth. The soil and climate of Paine appear to be peculiarly well adapted to the cultivation of <a name="potatoes9"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and it has here, happily, in a great degree escaped the destruction which has caused such injury in the other Newengland States. In some of the earlier notices which we find of the <a name="potato2"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, we are informed that it "appears well" and "promises to be an abundant crop Such was the result. In the southeast section of the State, it is said that" more was planted than in any previous year" and there was " a good crop, and but few have rotted; the quality is good" and in quantity it 71 [a[ 75 was at least " 10 per cent. above the previous year." In the central section, and running up to the north, also, there was " an increase of 10 percent." In some places they rotted in the ground, and this was then attributed to the " hot and dry weather." Again, from one who is well fitted to form a fair estimate, we have the following information: " Large quantities were planted, and the cool weather was very favorable for their growth ; and the quantity and quality of the crop are extra. Some complaint has been made on the seaboard, and some parts of the interior, of the wet; and some farmers have lost nearly the whole of their crop; and yet the average throughout the whole territory is more than in former years, owing to the increased attention paid to the crop." It would seem probable that from 15 to 20 per cent. advance on the crop of 1843 may be allowed. As early as May, the prospect for the <a name="potato3"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in New Hampshire is said, in some of the agricultural journals, "not to be flattering" and we accordingly find that the disease prevailed here, greatly to the diminution of the amount gathered. One of our informants in the lower part of the State says "he think <a name="potatoes10"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> fall short about 30 per cent." Another, more to the east, says that, "though there was a full crop, yet there was a loss of 10 per cent. by the rot or disease ;" and yet another good judge in these matters says, "suffering more rot-one-fourth less." In the central western part of the State, on the Connecticut river, "the <a name="potatoes11"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were early struck with rust, and nearly one third of the crop has rotted." Power, down, towards the southern boundary, also, the report is : "greatly injured by the rot; all of one third of the crop was destroyed. They suffered most on manured lands; on lands not manured, they escaped the disease entirely n the central section, towards the eastern border, it is said: "his crop, had it not been for the rot, would have been 25 per cent. better than in 1843; but I should think about 10 per cent. will be lost by the rot, as several farmers have informed me that they have continued to rot ever since harvested. In the whole State, the average decrease was, we think, full 25 per cent, from the crop of 1843, which was itself less than an average one. Vermont likewise possesses a fine soil and climate for <a name="potatoes12"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and the crops there are usually rich and abundant. But the crop of 1844 suffered from the general evil. The decrease is differently estimated from 10 to 30 per cent, or still higher. One person says the loss was one third of the crop. We may fix it at 25 per cent. In an agricultural journal, we find, the following remarks: "to readily may <a name="potatoes13"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> be produced by the mellow rich soil of the northern counties of Vermont, that the price of l 12 and 18 cents a bushel, delivered at the starch mill, makes that one of the most profitable crops. In many towns, starch mills have been in operation, and it has become quite common for an ordinary farmer to raise his one, two, and three thousand bushels of <a name="potatoes14"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a season. In the entire Green Mountain region, from Berkshire on the south, to the Canada line on the north, there has been such a failure in the crop of <a name="potatoes15"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that it is said there will be none left the present year for the manufacture of starch The <a name="potato4"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in Massachusetts, in the northern section of the State, running towards the east, is described as being "full an average crop, not affected by rotten ness or any new disease." Nearer to the ocean, however[ 752 in the same direction, it is said to have been "15 per cent. short of the usual crop, as they were diseased n the central sections, it is thought to have been " 25 .per cent. less than in 1843." And in a public journal we find the following : " We passed through western Massachusetts (hampden, Hampshire, and Franklin counties) a few days since, and found the <a name="potatoes16"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> almost everywhere suffering from a modification of the same disease. The tops died prematurely, before they had gained their maturity. We did not learn that the <a name="potatoes17"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> any where had commenced rotating. Some that we saw dug in Hampshire county were sound and good. The latest planted suffered the most." Again, under date from West field, near the Connecticut river, it is said, (november 21 :a) "the <a name="potato5"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop throughout this region has suffered severely from some cause not yet fully ascertained." Similar remarks occur in the region of Green field, Barre, and Pittsfield. The whole crop must, without doubt, have fallen off at least from 25 to 30 per cent. In Rhode I s land, there were parts of the State where the crop was very good, and little loss was experienced from the rot. This is stated to have been the case in the western section of the State. But in the eastern section the crop is estimated at "20 per cent. less than in 1843 ;" and the cause assigned is the early drought. Taking the whole State through, it seems fair to allow a decrease of about 10 per cent. The <a name="potato6"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of Connecticut fell off from 25 to 30 per cent. I need, some estimates in particular sections of the State place the loss still higher. Thus, of the central part, bordering on the Connecticut river, it is said, "<a name="potatoes18"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> suffered much from drought and hot weather, and the rot injured them very materially; not more than half a crop" In the southwestern section, also, it is stated that " <a name="potatoes19"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> come short; a blight on them will decrease the crop one half; but still there will not be a scarcity The early notices of this crop in the State of New York are somewhat diverse. In July, in western New Work, we are informed that "the <a name="potatoes20"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on dry land look well; on wet, will not produce much." Again : " In wet land, will not produce as much as usual, but there will be an average crop." In the central part of the State, also, in July, it is said, "<a name="potatoes21"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> promise well." Again, July' 11: "<a name="potatoes22"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> look well, but farmers say they need rain very much." July 2 1st, an agricultural paper in this section of the State says: "the season has been favorable to this valuable crop; and, so far as we can learn, there will be an abundant yield. Young <a name="potatoes23"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> appeared in our market some ten days since, of good size and fair quality. In the vicinity of New Work, early in September, it is stated : "The early plantings have turned out well; but the late crops are in danger of being injured by the worm; some of the vines are prematurely dead From Buffalo, under date of September, we have the following intelligence : "<a name="potatoes24"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> yield well, but the rot has attacked them throughout the country. There is hardly a town in this section from which I have not heard; and, in all, this dreaded disease has made its appearance. Now much it wilt lessen its product, is yet to be seen. In one instance, a farmer told me one half of each hill was affected so much as to be a total loss to, in the middle of September, the south towns of Erie county are said to have suffered great loss in this crop; and in Genesee and Wyoming counties not inconsiderable. In the vicinity of Tic a, under date of August 31, the black rot is said to have injured the <a name="potatoes25"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 73[ 75 Other informants furnish the same account of the injury sustained in this State. With scarcely an exception, the evil pervaded the whole State. Thus, in the northeast, on Take Ham plain, we are told " the <a name="potato7"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was much injured by rotating in the ground; and from this cause, as well as the stopping of the growth, the crop diminished one half." At the north, it is said, "a fair crop in quantity, but injured by the rot." In the vicinity of Oswego and Madison counties, "50 per cent. decrease on the crop of 1843." In Onondaga county, "the crop is almost a failure, and will not exceed a quarter of a crop ; they commenced rotating in the hill before the full grown tops delayed." In Tompkins and Chemung counties, "quite short injured by disease." In Rates county, it is said that "there were more raised this year than last, but large quantities have rotted." I n Seneca and Hayne, "the <a name="potato8"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was small; it was injured by the drought in August and September. <a name="potatoes26"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> that were planted early in the season were not as much affected with the rot as those that were planted late From Steuben and Allegany, the report which reaches us is, " half of a crop, compared with 1843, owing to disease." In some other sections as in Genesee and Wyoming) it is said the crop was "much injured by disease, but the quantity saved was as large as in 1843."I n Niagara county, "<a name="potatoes27"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been only a medium yield or quality, although the disease or decay by rotating has not exceeded from 2 to 6 percent. The crop in 1843 was light, on account of the very dry season which came on the last of May. The increase this year is probably from 5 to 10 per cent n Cattaraugus, where it is a favorite crop, it is stated that it was "a good crop ; here and there some injury from the rot, but not extensive n the counties of Kaluga and Sort land, it is said, " injured by rot crop hardly middling." An agricultural journal, in October, says : " In our last we observed that the <a name="potato9"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop bade fair to be a heavy one. Since then, we have heard great complaints of their failure; and the present impression is, that not more than half a crop can be relied on n One ida county, it is stated, "the <a name="potato10"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is nearly destroyed by rust." In the vicinity of the Mohawk valley, the crop is stated to have suffered from " 50 to 75 per cent. decrease, because of the rot." In Its ego county, " a bad and small crop, much affected with rot." And inSchoharie county, an informant says: " The <a name="potato11"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is small ; some of my neighbors have lost their entire crop; and I should think one half of the <a name="potatoes28"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the county are diseased. The largest <a name="potatoes29"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are generally rotten. All the <a name="potatoes30"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> dug while the vines were green below the ground were sound; where the vines were dry and wilted, the <a name="potatoes31"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were found more or less diseased." In Rensselaer county, it was " a very short crop, being injured by the disease." In Columbia county and vicinity, about "three-fourths of a crop." In Ulster and Delaware, "not more than half a crop, owing to the rot." In But chess and Putnam, "not a crop." In West chester and Lock land, "an entire failure." "I n some farms, the crop has so rotted in the ground, that scarcely any portion of them will be worth digging; and in nearly all the fields the injury has taken place to more or less extent." Similar information is given respecting the crop on parts of Long I s land, near New Work, where there is said to have been a "general failure." In Range county, under date of September 2 1st, notwithstanding the intensity of the drought, "the po[ 75 ]a] 74 ta toes in this section are rotating to such an extent as to destroy nearly the whole crop' Again, one who is well qualified to form a correct opinion, writes: "his year, in many parts of the county, the crop is a totalfailureAn agricultural journal published in this State, speaking of the general crop, remarks : " This crop has suffered much in many districts, from the epidemic which seems to be over spreading this country as well as the old world." "considerable attention is justly excited, from the prevalence of this disease." "there it has not been affected by disease, the crop of the past season has generally been a good one." To show how greatly this disease has affected this crop, it may be mentioned, that it has been stated in the papers that the Makers of New Lebanon, who were under contract to deliver 15,000 bushels, have been obliged to publish that they could furnish none. In view of all these facts, we are fully warranted in placing the decrease on this crop as high as one third; and probably, were we to reckon those lost since they were gathered, we might put it as high as 50 per cent. The rot prevailed in New Jersey to some extent, but not so much in some sections as it did last year; probably the deficiency may not have exceeded 15 per cent. In the central section of the State, and bordering on the Delaware river, it is said to have been " 10 per cent. less, owing to the drought : " and in yet another portion" 20 per cent. less The crop in Pennsylvania, though it does not seem to have been so greatly affected throughout the whole State by the rot, yet suffered severely from this disease, and also from the drought. In the vicinity of Philadelphia, it is stated to have been uncommonly good. In Chester county, it suffered much from drought, so that it is thought to be " not more than half a crop." In the rich county of Lancaster, also, it is said " there was a failure of one half of the usual quantity, owing to the drought which prevailed." In Columbia and Luzerne counties, there was "a partial failure, on account of the rot." In the central counties, on the upper waters of the Susquehanna, the account is more favorable ; and we are told that the increase was "20 per cent. over the last crop ; there was but little rot, while last year there was a great deal." Somewhat lower down, embracing Dauphin and Schuylkill counties, the crop is stated to have been one third short ;" the cause having been principally the prevalence of the rot. Towards the southwest, also, from the centre, the <a name="potato12"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was " below an average The crop, too, in Beaver and Washington counties suffered from the rot, so that it is pronounced to have been "less than an average n the counties of Arm strong and Clear field, the crop of <a name="potatoes32"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as appears from assessment returns, amounted to about 280,670 bushels, for the first, which is thought to have been a suitable crop. In the latter, nearly the whole crop was destroyed; and yet further to the north, and towards the northwest, the crop is said to have "increased onethirdFrom the best information, therefore, we can obtain respecting this crop in Pennsylvania, it fell off from 20 to 25 per cent. from that of 1843. In Maryland, the drought seems to have exercised a great influence in lessening the crop, so that by some it is pronounced to have been a total failure, and by others " a very indifferent crop; two thirds short" of that of 1843. We have estimated it at from 25 to 30 per cent. decrease. The greater part of the <a name="potatoes33"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised, however, are the sweet potatoes 75 [a[ 75 ]great complaint is heard from Virginia likewise, respecting the effect of the hot weather on the <a name="potato13"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop there. In the central counties, east, in the vicinity of the Potomac, it is said " the crop in some neighborhoods was much affected by drought, but in others there was an average crops n the southern counties, bordering cent rally on North Carolina, it is said that ' both the I wish and the sweet potato were diminished 50 per cent because of the dry summer. Further back, likewise, towards the interior, the crop is thought to have been "not more than half a crop" on account of "the drought. "I n some other sections it was an average crop, as, in the northwestern part of the State, on the Kanawha, it is said not to have been as good as in 1843. The whole average decrease was probably from 20 to 25 per cent. The <a name="potatoes34"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised in North Carolina, and others of the Southernstates, are mostly of the sweet kind, and hence the crop suffered less from the drought which prevailed there. The accounts given are, "average good" "very good." In the southern section, however, bordering on Georgia, it is said to have fallen off one half. In South Carolina, in the region of Spartansburg, Work, &c, the crop was very considerably lessened, and is pronounced by some to have been not more than two thirds of the crop of 1843," while in Dickens andGreenville, &c, it was "about the same" as in the former year. Thegeorgetown (S. C.) Advocate, in September, says: "matter <a name="potatoes35"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this region will be a complete failure." It would seem probable that there may have been an average decrease in this crop of about from 10 to 15 per cent. In the central western section of Georgia, <a name="potatoes36"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were a good crop. Still further north, it is said to have been 20 per cent. short of the crop of the former year, in consequence of the cold and wet in January and February, and the drought in March, April, July, and August. Similar statements, also, are made with respect to other sections of this State. The <a name="potato14"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, is said to have been very good, a full average, which will probably vary but little from 10 per cent. on the former year, except in Mississippi, which last year fell off very considerably; in view of which, the better crop of this year 1844) would seem to require a larger addition of from 15 to 20 per cent. In the eastern section of Tennessee, towards the central, in a number of counties, the report as to the <a name="potato15"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is said to have been "20 percent. less" than in the year before. In the western section, also, near the central counties, it is stated that the decrease was equal to "one quarter of the crop, in consequence of dry weather. The crop, on the whole, therefore, seems to have done better. In the northern central portion of the State, it is said that they were "ripe and sound, and rather more in quantity than last year" and, again, "there is a usual crop, and the yield abundant" while in the southern central portion, in both kinds, I wish and sweet potatoes, there was also a small "increase." It is believed, therefore, that the average increase for the whole State was about 10 per cent. In Ohio, some sections of the State exhibit a falling off of the <a name="potato16"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, which is attributed to various causes. Some variance appears respecting the fact whether the disease which has so lessened the amount produced or saved in other States prevailed in Ohio. Two intelligent informants hold diverse opinions on this point. We are inclined, however, to believe that it has partially made its appearance there, in the upper part of[ 75 76 the State. The southern part of the State was entirely free from it. From the information received, we learn that in theMiami valley, in the southwestern section of the State, there was "not more than half a crop of <a name="potatoes37"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and these were of a poor quality." Somewhat further to the east, also, on the Ohio river, it is said, too, there was but " half a crop." In the southeast, embracing Merry and some of the adjoining counties, we are told that there was "a fair crop 2' Somewhat above this, towards the central part of the State, and including Stark and Hayne counties, the crop was a good one." In the central counties of the State, (delaware, Marion, andRichland) the crop for 1844 " diminished" from that of 1843 " 10 percent." Last of these, also, reaching to Tuscarawas county, the crop is described as having fallen "short of an average, perhaps 25 per cent." In the northwest counties, bordering on I n diana, we are told "<a name="potatoes38"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been extremely light, say half a crop, and most of them rotted since the gathering." Further towards the east, and central along the lake, there was perhaps "an average crop." Ordering on the lake, and .in the vicinity of Lydia, a correspondent writes of the <a name="potato17"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop: "not much more than half a crop, owing to the continued rains the last two weeks in August; they appear to have been drowned, so as to stop their grow the adds: "there is, however, no appearance of the <a name="potato18"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease which is doing such mischief in New Work; what we have are good. Some early fields were nearly out of the way of the rains, and have full yields but the crop is probably not much more than half a one." Another very intelligent correspondent, writing from the south eastern part of the reserve, as late as December 7, 1844, says: "our <a name="potatoes39"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this quarter are not diseased. Kinsman, in this county, is about thirty-five miles from the lake, and is the farthest south of any place known to me where the <a name="potato19"><mark>potato</mark></a> is defective in this quarter. The disease was not observed there until the crop was gathered and housed. It has since appeared to a limited extent. It was very common at Twinsburg, in the north part of the town, sixteen miles from the lake." In a review of the whole, we are inclined to the belief that there was a decrease of at least from 25 to 30 per cent. in the <a name="potato20"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of Ohio for 1844. The <a name="potato21"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of I n diana appears to have been better than it was in 1843. In the southeast, bordering on the Ohio river, it is said to have been an average crop." In the central counties of the State, a "tolerable" one while in a southwestern direction from this, towards the Wabash, they were "scarce" the cause not mentioned. In the western central counties, bordering on the Wabash, the crop is stated to have been a "good one, "more than an "average crop" 25 per cent. "over 1843."The same was the state of the <a name="potato22"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in the northwest part of the State, as compared with the crop of the previous year. Taking, therefore, into consideration the deficiency of the crop of 1843, it appears probable that there was a gain of 25 per cent. over the crop of that year. The accounts of this crop from different parts of I illinois are quite diverse. In the south eastern section, on the Wabash, and back towards the interior, we are informed, that it was" a good crop." The same is the case with the western central counties lying along the Mississippi, where the crop is thought to have been " 10 per cent. more" than in 1843. In the other hand, in the southwestern section of the State, it is said there was " not more than three-fourths of a crop, it having been injured by the same cause as the corn." In the northern central counties, also, as Putnam, Marshall 77[ 75 and others in their vicinity, it is stated that "<a name="potatoes40"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were injured by the bad season, and about half or one third only of a crop was raised in the State." . Of the region of Chicago, a correspondent, who is a good judge in these matters, says there was "a small crop, though the quality was good." We are inclined to believe, in view of the destructive rains, which have been noticed in reference to other crops, which flooded the bottom land in this State, that the <a name="potato23"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was materially injured; and that, as compared with the crop of 1843, there must have been a falling off of from 15 to 20 per cent. We have but very little information respecting the <a name="potato24"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in Missouri. In some places it is stated to have been an average crop. Long the Mississippi, Missouri, and their branches, it must doubtless have been affected by the rise of the rivers; and by the same comparison with the effect of the season on other crops, we feel warranted in concluding that there was an equal deficiency with that of I illinois. We should be glad, had we better data to base our estimate on. The deficiency will probably over go rather than fall short of our calculation. The information which we have obtained respecting the <a name="potato25"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of Michigan, in every section, represents it as better than in 1843. In the south eastern part of the State it is said to be "far superior to that of last year perhaps 25 per cent." North of this' the report is, "a good crop on dry land; on wet land, poor ; on the whole, about 30 per cent. better than last year, when, in consequence of the dry season, they were very poor n the western part of the State, our informant says that the crop was unusually good this year, and will yield more than an average crop Probably, the average increase on the crop of 1844, over that of 1843, was fully equal to from 20 to 25 per cent. The crop of <a name="potatoes41"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, also, in I own and Wisconsin, was good, and a considerable increase over that of the previous year. I or the review of the whole country, it will be seen there has been an evident falling off; and although the disease, or rot, is not mentioned it a number of States, yet the crop itself seems to have greatly suffered. The whole crop, as given in the tabular estimate for 1844, is 99,493,000bushels, which is probably too large rather than too small. The sweet potato crop is evidently, on the whole, better than that of the wish <a name="potato26"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Several agricultural papers, and other public journals, express the opinion, decidedly, that there is not more than one third or one half a crop in the whole country. We believe this to be too large a deduction, and yet we may have fallen short in our estimate of the full increase. Behave endeavored to avail ourselves of the light within our reach. The experiment seems making, as to the raising of the sweet potato further north than before; and we see it stated that a successful trial has been made as far north as One ida county, New Work. This must have probably been owing to some peculiarity of the season ; nor could the <a name="potatoes42"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been of equal richness to those raised in more southern latitudes. Considerable discussion has taken place in the agricultural journals, on the comparative advantages and disadvantages of hilling <a name="potatoes43"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Both have their advocates; but the result of experiments is apparently in favor of not hilling. Thus it is said that two untilled rows gave five peckswhiletwoi which were killed gave ont aly: four pecks. With this: also, is somewhat connected the question, whether or not maturing of the <a name="potato27"><mark>potato</mark></a> should the- i the hill. A writer in an agricultural[ 75 ]a] 78 paper of high repute holds the following positions on this subject: 1st. "I that been proved, by trial, that the first crop is invariably smaller when land is manured in the hill; and if the fruit is poorer, I suppose there is not the least doubt that the succeeding ones will be." He refers to a trial both with corn and <a name="potatoes44"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, in each of which the position he maintains was borne out ; for he says there was not more than two thirds as great a crop on the part manured in the hill as in the others. 2d. " <a name="potatoes45"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> manured in the hill, in nine cases out of ten, are eaten badly by the worms." 3d. " When manure is put in the hill, the <a name="potatoes46"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grow too rank in the earlier part of the season ; too much of the essential part of the manure is expended in promoting the growth of the tops." 4th. " Worn and <a name="potatoes47"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as well as every thing else, when the manure is spread on, will endure the drought much better than if manured the other way" " the seed being planted on thicid127) manure, the roots grow too near the top of the ground and by hoping the hill being increased, the rain runs off as from a s tack of hay, watering between the hills, and leaving the hills dry." The use ofgypsum as manure for <a name="potatoes48"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is said to have been well tested in Yorkshire, England, where the gypsy med rows produced a much finer crop than as many others not so prepared. The sets were dipped in powdered gypsy m and planted in trenches, a little more gypsy m sprinkled on them, then filled up, and a small quantity more sprinkled on. We find in an agricultural paper some interesting remarks on the selection of seed for the <a name="potato28"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, taken from a foreign journal, which we have transcribed into our appendix, (see No. 8,) as useful at the present time, though not immediately occasioned by the disease. In the same appendix, we have also added an extract from some editorial remarks in the New England Farmer on the same subject; and likewise some selections from the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture. From the Farmers' Monthlyvisiter we have also borrowed an article, from the London Gardenerschronicle, with the remarks of the editor of the Sister upon it, which may likewise be found in appendix No. 8. The value of the <a name="potato29"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in our country seems likely to be enhanced by the recent application of this plant to the making of sugar, by the conversion of its starch first into sir up, and then into sugar. Under the appropriate head of sugar, further on, will be found a more extended notice of this subject. The comparative value of the <a name="potato30"><mark>potato</mark></a> is thus given: 100 pounds of <a name="potatoes49"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are equal, for nutriment, to seat, without bone -25 pounds. Means -28 do. Oh eaten bread -35 do. Warships and carrots -190 do. Turnips- -300 do. Cabbage -400 do. The experiments of Merry & Her ring establish the fact that 3 pounds of <a name="potatoes50"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are equal, for nourishment, to 12 ounces of bread and 5 ounces of meat. It will be remembered, in the last years report mention was made of anew disease prevalent in sections of our country, by which the <a name="potato31"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was greatly injured. It will also be seen by the notices of the crop for 1844, already given, that the <a name="potato32"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot or disease (as it is called) has ex 79 [a[ 75 ]tended and prevailed far more than in the year previous. To great has been the evil, that it excites serious apprehensions, unless something maybe found to prove an effectual remedy. It is to be hoped that such will be the case, as some very able men, of those who are both scientific and practical farmers, are engaged in the discussion and investigation of the cause and remedy. Premiums, too, are offered, which will, no doubt, prove a salutary impulse to efforts for success. The country could well afford to pay a handsome sum to any one who could devise the way to insure the agriculturists of our land from the destructive progress of this threatening calamity. The first thing in the present stage of the evil is the collection of facts relating to it. Without particular reference to any one of the numerous theories which have been propounded, we have taken the pains to gather and col late all the facts which are within our reach, that we might present, if possible, a condensed view of the whole case, in the hope and belief that thus we should be able to aid others in their investigations. It is probable another year, perhaps several years, must elapse before all the conditions necessary for the forming an accurate conclusion will have been observed, in the recording of the facts in reference to its commencement, progress, and the development of the cause. We shall here put down merely results of the comparison we have instituted, throwing the col later papers together into an appendix, that they may be at hand for any one who may wish to avail himself of them. For these, we are indebted largely, as will be seen, to the agricultural papers and public journals; and if there should be some repetition, yet it is believed it is no more than was necessary for allowing each writer to express his own views on the important subject under consideration. The whole collection, placed with scarcely any designed order of arrangement, may be found on consulting appendix No. 9. Our remarks on this subject, for the sake of clearness, we shall endeavor to embody in a number of distinct heads. We may not always be able to avoid their running into each other, as, though they are indeed distinct, they are likewise, in some instances, very closely allied 1. Extent of country embraced in the evil t seems well, at the outset, to try to fix some limits to the range which has thus far been gained by this disease, or plague, as it is termed. We are not fully satisfied on this point, as it is possible that the rotating of <a name="potatoes51"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from other causes may, in some cases, have been attributed to this particular one. But, so far as we are able to trace out its boundary, it has not, in any instance in this country, extended more than a little beyond the 45th degree of northern latitude, nor farther south than the 37th, if indeed it has gone so far. Behave not observed any notices of it higher up than Piscataquis county, in paine; along on through the central regions of New Hampshire, the line of the lakes in New York and Ohio, as far west as Cleveland. It does not seem, then, to have gone lower than a line drawn diagonally across to the northeast corner of Trumbull county, in Ohio, and so passing through apart of Pennsylvania, and reaching, in some parts, down to this District of Columbia, and perhaps portions of Virginia. We have not seen it mentioned as being discovered in I n diana, I illinois, or Michigan, though Or, Jackson, in one of his communications, which will be found with others, seems to imply that some complaints may have been made in these States, and even west as far as Wisconsin. There seems to be none of it in And[ 5 8 soda. I to direction, so far as we can judge, has rather been from east to west following, in this respect, the progress of insects, as has already been mentioned in another part of this report 2. is to the time of its first appearance 'in this county, we find not less difficulty. The evil may have been partially known, but not have attracted much notice. The first distinct recognition in the public journals, so as to excite attention, was during the year 1843. It is said now, by one and another individual, as will be seen by reference to the papers in the appendix, to have been noticed here and there years ago. Very possibly, however, they may have mistaken something resembling it in its appearance as well as general results. It is likewise stated, in a public journal, that the farmers of Nova Scotia have known it for years. We cannot decide on the truth of this assertion, nor whether or not it in all respects corresponds to certain evils affecting the <a name="potato33"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in Great Britain and on the continent, which it has been supposed entirely to resemble. As far as regards our own country, it seems to be comparatively, certainly it is so considered, as an alarming evil. The point of its original appearance is of some importance in enabling us to ascertain how far it may have been affected by meteorological phenomena, and therefore may be considered peculiar to the season; and thus merely temporary, or of a more permanent character. Further inquiry hereafter may elicit more ample information on this subject 3. The particular period of the season in which the evil is first observed to operate, is also another which it might be useful to determine. We have attended with some care to the comparison of the various accounts in reference to this point, and we cannot find any notice which extends forward further than to the month of August. In looking at the papers of July, as will be seen of our notices of the crops, we often find the crop of <a name="potatoes52"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> mentioned as promising; but in the course of a few weeks, first in the month of August, we notice the remark that the plant begins to exhibit signs of injury. We have noticed scarcely any of these intimations earlier than the latter half of August. They seem to be more frequent, however, in the month of September. It is quite probable that there has been considerable diversity in this respect, according to the climate and soil more or less adapted to forward the growth of the plant. As far as regards the evil to< the <a name="potato34"><mark>potato</mark></a> while in the ground, the whole time of the development of the evil is limited, throughout the entire extent where it has prevailed, to three or four weeks, and probably still less. This fact is useful, as it may lead to means of prevention. It is true, the cause may be hidden much further back ; and this must be determined when the nature of the evil itself is fully understood, if it ever shall be. 4. In the subject of the kinds of soils and methods of cultivation, in which the disease is more or less prevalent, we have apparent facts which seem at direct variance with each other. Some point to the clay by soil as that which is least exposed, while they say the sandy and dry soils are more so. Thus, Mr. Wilson, of New Hampshire, says: "I t is a fact, that on dry, warm, and highly manured land, the <a name="potato35"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the past season, has rotted more than on more cold airy places, with less dressing. The lakeWinnipiseogee, in about latitude 42 degrees north, is a body of water of about 20 miles in length. To the north of said lake is a fine farming district, or belt of land, of about 15 miles in width; and to the north of which rise mountains piled on mountains, among which are the White Hills. In 81 [75 ]this tract the rot has been more severe than in any other section of the State. This tract is situated in" what is te red the eye of the sun the ai in August and September :being heated, and the mountains at the north preventing the usual circulation, probably arms the soil more than in airy locations, where the circulation is not impeded bys the mountains. Such, also is the opinion of Or Merely, who tried both wet and dry ; and both were affected, but dry the most. A writer in Aiherst, Massachusettssupposedto be Profess t I Pitch cock) on the other hand, speaking of this subject as it fell under his own observation, says that the <a name="potatoes53"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> it the wet test lands rotted worst. It has likewise been said that it prevailed in Ohio, both ont the stiff clay lands, and also on sandy lands. The crops on new lands are said to be less injured, and that new uplands give sound <a name="potatoes54"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Another says : "I planted between one and two acres on new laid, with very little manure. The i rot, so much complained of has affected some, but not very badly Again, <a name="potatoes55"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which were planted on s ward land in Worcester, Massachusetts, are said not to be affected; but it should likewise be added, the plaster was used. <a name="potatoes56"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> manured in the hill are supposed to have suffered more than others. Barn yard mature is also said to be more favorable to the attacks than much soil used as a manure. Early planting is stated by some to be beneficial in respect to its appearance; by 'others, it is denied that there is in this any advantage. O it the whole, i it would seem that no kinds of soil are absolutely free, and that the rot has prevailed in a great variety of circumstances 5. The same may be said as to the kinds of <a name="potatoes57"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It was suppose, for a time, that the long reds, and some of the harder varieties, were not touched; but it now appears that they, likewise, have somewhat suffered. In the New England Farmer of November 27th, it is stated that on the far nm of the On. Daniel Webster, his long reds were badly affected, and he had lost them all. The evil, however, is stated to be more severe with respect to the Chenangos, Mergers, and Garters, and those which have been mostly highly cultivated and- improved. It has been thought that needlings would be proof against the attack of the 'disease ; but, by the experience of Mr. Bird wood, referred' to in one of the papers in our appendix, it would seem that this opinion is not correct.  One person says Garters seem to fare better than Mererrs. Another says that they likewise suffered. Lie says of the pink eye variety, the tops are all dead, &c. Another finds the blue o ses and the orange variety are also liable to the disease. Whether <a name="potatoes58"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should, be planted whole, or in cuts, has also bee: a question as to the effect. In respect to this, there seem i to be examples of the injury in both cases. To, too, as to the change of seed. I ni some cases, persons who have purchased l <a name="potatoes59"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from a distance have had -old crops. The, one person remarked at the Army ers' Club in New Not k: In Brooecounty, last week, much complaint was made of the condition of their <a name="potatoes60"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. They had Duel, Verser, and pink eye <a name="potatoes61"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, for a boat that came from about sixty miles north, was stopped of a bar, arid had to sell out- arid from these being planted, their crops are good; and from their own <a name="potatoes62"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, their crops are bad" Others say that f "changing the. see id does not prevent the rot this year' One person, in He Work, re ra is: " I had mine from Paine and "elise w here but they suffer 6. The appearance of the diseased fruit, as w e edge from the variousaceouiitsis similar in different: parts of the country. Hire te t her a" ^a^ "a" ' \a\ :a* .a' '75] 82 are affected, it is usually found that the rot begins with a small speck on the outside, and proceeds to the interior. Some, however, speak of the inside being rotten first, while the outside remains fair. Such is stated in the New England Farmer of November, already quoted, to have been the case with Mr. Websters. Mr. Mcallister, of Salem, New Work, says: " About the first of September, I opened a few hills of pink eye <a name="potatoes63"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having delayed tops, when hundreds of small white insects were seen on the <a name="potatoes64"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; some of the <a name="potatoes65"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were entirely rotten. I resolved, however, to give the subject a more thorough investigation. Having washed a few of them perfectly clean, I examined and readily discovered that there were first minute punctures through the skin, into the substance of the <a name="potato36"><mark>potato</mark></a>; the healthy appearance of the skin, for a short distance around the perforations, was changed to a brown color; second, a vesication or blister third, a vegetable abscess of limited extent, filled with purulent matter evidently showing that the <a name="potatoes66"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were much infested by the insects, and were going to decay in consequence of the ravages of these borders fourth, the appearance of moist gangrene, of a livid or purple color, which is only a variety of decomposition resulting from the injury inflicted by those insects Another person says: " I have examined diseased <a name="potatoes67"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In examining an apparently sound <a name="potato37"><mark>potato</mark></a>, small elevations are to be seen near the eye, Generally, the skin opens, and a black fungus makes its appearance. The number of black hung i having the power of bursting the skin is very great; they are termed cryptogamous. Their appearance is like a black wart, which then begins to spread itself, making an ulcerated surface. The black character soon leaves, and the spore did succeed; these latter are of a white ash color. The <a name="potatoes68"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> become spongy, often soft and purifying. This different termination I consider as the same disease." It is also said, in one communication, that " where the least speck of rot has begun on the outside, the stem and heart are also affected in the same ratio very general agreement exists as to the effect on the vines; they appear as if struck by rust, and to wither and dry away. In some instances it would seem that this appearance is noted to a day or night; so that vines which one day were appearing healthy and green, the next were sickly, and smitten as with the disease. In some cases, the vines are stated to have been hollow, as if worm eaten ; the rot does not seem to reach the <a name="potato38"><mark>potato</mark></a> a or tube r, till the vine begins to be affected below the ground. In some cases, however, it is stated, that though the vines have rushed badly, the <a name="potatoes69"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have yielded tolerably well." As to some further accidents, (as they may, perhaps, be termed) in some instances it is stated that there were no flowers and no balls on the diseased plants; that there was honey dew that <a name="potatoes70"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> nearest the stalk were most liable; the little fibrous roots of the tube r began to decay before the tube r itself rotted ; and sometimes one half of a hill would be delayed, while the other would be sound: One person speaks of a phosphorus cent light on some of his, which were stored away; but this, probably, was nothing peculiar, as such lights may be observed often in decaying substances. A peculiar effluvium is also mentioned on walking over the ground, by which it is said the presence of the rot may be partly detected. There is diversity of opinion as to whether <a name="potatoes71"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> dug early or late are most affected some inclining to one side, and others to the contrary. The fact is stated, however, that in many cases, when dug apparently sound, and thrown into heaps, or stored away i a cellars, they are often found to suffer very badly 8. The question is asked, whether the <a name="potatoes72"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> themselves communicate contagion, and the disease is of the nature of an epidemic n some instances, <a name="potatoes73"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> placed contiguous to each other have seemed to be affected. The experiments of Mr. Teschmacher, mentioned in one of his papers found in the appendix, were contrary to this supposition; a she states that, where he buried a sound <a name="potato39"><mark>potato</mark></a> with a diseased one, at a distance of about 2 i inches, and also placed them otherwise near enough to communicate their epidemic character, had it existed, no effect followed a trial of five days. He says, however, it is possible that the trial was not long enough. Again, it is of some importance to know whether or not they are poisonous; and, on this point, there is considerable conflict of opinion. If not poisonous, in some places, as used, they seem to have proved unhealthy. In the New Haven Herald, a communication signed " Tedious' says: " The extraordinarily offensive smell of the <a name="potatoes74"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> affected in this manner was brought strongly to our perception yesterday. A bushel of a choice kind of a small size had been dug from a dry piece of ground in the upper part of the city. They had been placed in .a shed room overnight, when they were noticed by the cook, (an I wish woman) who had heard nothing said, and had noticed no decaying ones among them. The observed that those <a name="potatoes75"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had better be removed, as they rendered the place very offensive, The basket was emptied under the shade of a tree, and four or five small ones only were found delayed some on one side or at one end; from each of which an offensive effluvium of great intensity emanated; and one person used to farming, &c, did not get over the effect of their influence for several minutesAgaini: it is stated in the Claremont (N. H.) Eagle, that where the damaged crop has been put into the cellar, so offensive has been the smell arising from them, that they had forthwith to be removed and buried up in the ground." Mention has been made in the public journals as to animals who have died from eating them; but it is difficult to judge how far credit istobeattached to such rumors. From the report of .late meeting of farmers and scientific men in Boston, it seems that no one present knew of any such case of injury. It would not, however, be at all surprising if they had proved deleterious. The impression seems to be quite general, from some cause or other, that it is not advisable to use them as feed for animals. Very probably, the results might be different in the different stages of the disease. The tops are said to have been cut off and eaten by cattle with impunity 9. Various theories have been propounded to account for the cause. The views which have been advanced may be reduced to four or fiveinsat1 origin, fungus, at atmospheric influence, excess of growth from manure, and deter i oration, &c. These are also capable of being considerably diversified, and sometimes two or more are supposed to be combined. Thus, under the latter mode, are found the stimulating power of manure, and the deteriorateing of seed from long continued planting; both of which are specified as particular causes. Each advocate of a theory has brought forward and seized oil facts which he supposed to favor his own views. Gilt the difficulty i, that these facts are so numerous, of so opposite a character in many instances and in various sections of the country, that it appears next to impossible to make them harmonize with any one theory; aid, from all we can see, the ullimnatecause must be pronounced as un discovered, at least with any degree of :certainty, The circumstances under which the evil has appeared, as we have already seen, are so diversified, that all the views seem more or less at fault. Stiithere can be no doubt that some of the views adopted have moreplausibility than others. What we still lack is careful' observation, from the beginning to the end of the season, in a great number of places, systematically, referring to soils, season, accidents, varieties, &e, as we have mentioned above; and minute and accurate detail as to every particular which may legitimately be supposed to bear on the subjects in all other cases at the outset, for a time it has seemed as if some were on the right track, and facts appeared to concur (as has been stated) to support it; and then something would be published, on equal k authority, so adverse that we are left almost as much to conjecture as before. Such is the present state of the case; and were we now to attempt to breach a formal opinion, or undertake its defence either a new one, or some one ofthosealdeady advanced we should but add one more to the already numerousTansuccessfil hypothesis. We shall therefore, con dense the theories with some of the arguments, and refer for fuller acquaintance with the same to face appendix a )a) The insect theory has been advocated with considerable earnestnesslTere are two divisions of this view. By some, the injury is attributed to a little maggot, or worm, which is said to be found in the vine, or in the hill for both statements are given) and which eats out the succulent part of the vine, on which they immediately wither. Mr. Part well says: " In connexion with all its stages, except in its most advanced decay, but especially in its incident attacks, are found maggots or large, and other creatures, which I shall call insects. The l aroma, or worms, about a line in length, a e slender, with dark heads, semi transparent bodies, and are sluggish in their movements." "the insects are sometimes invisible to the naked eye others, a mere visible white point; and others, still, nearly a line in length, wit li numerous short legs, long an tenn ar of a white color, and extremely active land shy." Mr. Perkifs also speaks of a green worm found in the eaten out vine. Others speak of an insect which makes the <a name="potato40"><mark>potato</mark></a> a nidus for theperpetuation of its species, in the same' manner as do the onion fly, the apple insect, &c. This writer says: " From some of the infected <a name="potatoes76"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> maybe seen the insect in its papa state escaping. In others, you may, on boiling, find the rudiments of the insect in embryo ; while in others nothing will be found, the insect having escaped." Others speak of numerous little black insects, which, on the leaves and vines being disturbed, fly off. I Some of the papers we find an enlarged representation of an insect, which is supposed by some to have caused the evil, "of a dark brown color, having a body shaped like the soldier ant, with the legs of the hairy garden spider on the fore body were two projecting sockets, plainly indicating that the in sees had, at some period, belonged to the winged tribe." One of our correspondents, who favors the insect theory, says that his vines " were sprinkled with small white, almost imperceptible, insects." He says, also, " during the summer, I examined fields in But chess, Ulster, Albany, and Schenectadyemi  n ties, and invariably found insects with numerous legs; and in some instances a small worm, not unlike the apple worm in form, but red, and very minute, ensconced within the withering vine. The conclusion I came to was, that these insects fed on the albumen requisite to form the perfect tube r; and, consequently, when dry, it was either wholly delayed, fro in anexcessttving been abstracted, or, if apparently sound, so much had been taken as857D3toeproduce decay by degrees' &c. By some, who oppose the insect theory fit I has been observed that these insects are only results of the injuryhavivgbeen done, not the cause; as insects and worms are more or less found in all decaying vines by) . The fungus theory has been advanced, and very plausible sustained, among others, by Mr. Teschmacher, of Boston, whose views will be found in his two papers in the appendix, taken from the New England Farmer. He states that, from the peculiar smell, and the reputed poisonous qualities of the diseased <a name="potato41"><mark>potato</mark></a>, he was nearly certain it was a species of fungus, In examination, as he says, he found the appearances to correspond with this view :as he easily recognised, among the dark slim y mass taken from the <a name="potato42"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the spores, or reproducing bodies of the, fungus a kind of darkglobule, which floated about in the drop of water employed in the experiment. These spores are said to be analogous to the <a name="seeds8"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of other vegetables; and; they are ;generated in such enormous quantities, that manyfungi spread with inconceivable rapidity. Mr. Teschmacher also givesanaccounti' oft her experiments, which tended to confirm him in the idea he had advanced c) .1mohspheric influence is strongly insisted on, by some, as the peculiar cause of the evil. To one can deny that the atmosphere has great influence in regard to vegetation; but whether the diseases be mainly attribute able to s this source, is not yet decided. The views of those who maintain- this theory are opposite; some ascribing the injury to the wet weather, others to the dry. Last year (1843) the disease was most commonly attributed to the \eat her being so very wet. This year, however, there has been, in many parts of the country where it has prevailed, great drought; nor has there been 'uniformity in the various sections where it has been equally destructive. A writer in the Amherst (pass) Express (understood to be Professorhitchqock) inclines to the opinion, it is said, that the season has been to rivet for the crop ; it hough the quantity is stated to be less, by the register, than in two previous years. In opposition to this view, it is stated that itnpart1 of the country where the weather has. suffered for want of rain, the disease still has been found. Thus a writer in the Massachusetts Ploughmnan says: 'the conclusion  have come to is this that as we had no rain in this town t and vicinity from the 4th of August to the 26th of September which wetted the ground to an inch, during this interval of time, the sun has most of the time shone bright, and very hot for this season of the year; the ground being very war nm, and no rains to cool it those <a name="potatoes77"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which had arrived at such an age in their growth became sun baked, or burnt; the vines died immediately, and they began to rot Another *modification of the atmospheric theory is that which a scribes it to a blight, or rust, similar to what takes place in wheat and other grain. Such is Mr. E. Abbots view, as given in the New England Farmer, who suggests that a flow or pressure of sap was produced in the vines, which they could not sustain and elaborate ; and that this fluid, descending to the tube, corrupted the <a name="potatoes78"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Such, too, is the view of Mr. It well and or. Blakesley, n mentioned in the Farmers' Club, New Work. Mr. Bacon, of Richmond, Pass, has some interesting remarks on this subject in his communication to the Boston Cultivator, which we have extracted in the appendix 75 ]a] 86 Under atmospheric influence may, perhaps, be classed the view adopted by some, which seems to attribute the disease to a honey dew exudation. Dr. Jackson, Mr. Old, and some others, favor this idea. The ho new dew is said to have first appeared on the stems, and was followed by the rust, with death of stems and the extension of the disease to the tubes. The fact which Mr. Old relates respecting a portion of a field covered with a carpet, which escaped, is thought also to be strongly in favor of this theory He supposes the glutiaous substance stops the pores, and causes death of the vines, &cd) By some, the disease is attributed to the excess of growth promoted by the use of different kinds of manure especially barn yard manure, and maturing in the hill. The <a name="potato43"><mark>potato</mark></a> is thus supposed to have been brought prematurely forward, and so exposed to the operation of the too great moisture, or too great heat, and other influences of the season. Factsaire mentioned which seem to afford plausible support to this view; and whether or not mainly a can e, a predisposition may doubtless be produced by the premature ripe king of the plant, by which it is rendered more liar be to injury. But it is also asserted by others, that this theory will not cover all the cases of facts .which are reported, since the evil has reached both manured and un manured lands <a name="potatoes79"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> early planted and late planted affected by different varieties of the season. Thus, one of ourCeorrespondents says: "the cause of this uncommon failure of the <a name="potato44"><mark>potato</mark></a> trop was, I think, owing to the rapid growth in moist warm weather for some time, and then followed uncommonly hot weather; and, what is strange, the tops all died within a few days, without any frost, on the high ground, as well as in the ground that was lo we) Another cause supposed for the disease, which has been strongly insisted on, either by itself or in combination with others, is the deterioralion of the plant itself. This is alluded to in a number of communications, and seems to be extensively believed in. It is well known, that as in the case, of certain kinds of pears and other fruit there is 'a tendency to run, out by long continued propagation, so the <a name="potato45"><mark>potato</mark></a>, it is thought, especially by being continually planted on the same ground, gradually deter to rates, and needs from time to time to be renewed. This is the reason assigned why certain varieties, which have been favorites with the public, have i been more subject to attack than others. The vitality of the 'ruin is believed to be greatly lessened, and thus a predisposition to be affected by the, evil is produced. Allowing it to be a real disease, whether owing to the electric state of the atmosphere, or whatever cause which may operate to furnish a wide spreading evil, certain kind might thus become more easily liable to the symptoms exhibited than others. Against this view have been urged facts which seemed greatly at variance with it; though the idea is admitted, that the seed may deteriorate, and thus become less fitted for planting f) The opinion has been advanced, that the disease is an imported one. It has therefore become a question of considerable interest, whether it has prevailed abroad. It is said that a similar kind has been noticed in Germany, also in England and I re land. We have endeavored to obtain some information on this subject from different European periodicals, but find little satisfactory. There are evidently two kinds of rot the wet, and the dry ; and the <a name="potato46"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, both in Germany and in England and I re land, has at times been subject to diseases which have greatly injured the 87 [a[ 75 crop. A German newspaper quotes from a foreign journal a description of a sort of epidemic which prevailed, and which was attributed to a want of vitality in the seed, and the remedy to which was proposed by obtaining seed from abroad: But the difficulty is in determining whether it is the same thing. There are resemblances, and there are also discrepancyes, so far as we are able to form a comparison in the matter. In the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture for March, 1844, we find a paper taken from the Livlundische Jahrbuicher, an agricultural periodical published at For pat and Moscow, which, as the work is not common in our country, we have thrown y into the appendix with our other papers. I t seems, by this article, that there has been a diversity of sentiment as to the, cause. " Some" says the author, " affirm it to be a species of a fly; others attribute it to small hung i, or parasitic al plants, which occasion the scab or corruption of the <a name="potato47"><mark>potato</mark></a>." The disease there mentioned, however, seems to be a dry rot, as is likewise the one (perhaps a still different species alluded to in another paper, and called the dry gangrene, which was communicated by M. de Martins to the anna les des Sciences Naturellesofseptember, 1842, which is found in the appendix, among our other extracts there. Some of the suggestions in both of these articles may be profit ably read 10. Preventiveswhatever may be the cause, and whether ever ascertained or not, the great thing, if possible, is to supply the remedies. The sein most instances, are based on the supposed origin; but, so far as limited observation allows, we believe that it will be found there are a number of suggestions to which it will be useful to pay some attention. In the American agriculturists, it is said: This disease seems to be as destructive in Great Britain, I re land, France, Germany, Holland, and Russia, as in our own country, and is attributed to many causes. The remedies suggested are to keep such as are intended for seed deep buried in the ground all winter; thoroughly draining and sub soiling the land where planted; to put them in small quantities; to select seed for planting, not quite ripe, and such as have not the slightest appearance of being watery living the land; obtaining new seed, either from planting <a name="potato48"><mark>potato</mark></a> balls or from distant countries, where they grow in a healthy state; after digging, spread the <a name="potatoes80"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the sun till they become dry and unfit for food ; then s tow them away till required for planting top dressing the plant with nitrate of soda and sulphate o( soda and magnetic, selecting such tubes for seed as grow near the top of the ground, and are quite green ; to plant the seed whole he find also, in the Farmers' Cabinet of the 15th of August, the following extract from the Journal of Agriculture, by Mr. James Caird, Waldo on, Fig ton, who agrees with the suggestion to plant seed not fully ripe. He says: "by seed <a name="potatoes81"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> last year (1842) were raised before they were perfectly ripe, and I have had no failure. Nearly all the seed I planted this year, however, was the small, un sale able tubes planted whole, rejecting the very smallest. The crop was very healthy and productive. I need, I have never seen a failure where small <a name="potatoes82"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, uncut, are used for seed ; and I believe this uniform success to arise from the small <a name="potato49"><mark>potato</mark></a> being unripe when taken from the ground. This opinion rests on the assumption that all the small <a name="potatoes83"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of a crop have not reached maturity when the rest of the crop is ripe, as being the last formed. If this be so, it strengthens the common opinion, that the less ripened <a name="potato50"><mark>potato</mark></a> of[ 75 1 the upland districts makes the best seed. But, at the: ame time, we see how good seed may be had without the trouble or expense p of, a change from a late district, if we either plant the small <a name="potatoes84"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> f our .own crops, or raise a portion for seed before they have reached maturity." :I n a subsequent number of the same paper it is stated, by a correspondent, that, on conversing with an old countryman, a. native of I re land, on their mode of raising the <a name="potato51"><mark>potato</mark></a>, he said that "they planted their <a name="potatoes85"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for seed late in the season, (too late for maturity) in ground well prepared, Within extra quantity .of manure, an tended them carefully; the produce was not fit to eat, but was superior for seed, producing a very abundant and sure crop in. In :a discussion among agriculturists in Scotland, with reference to the failure of the <a name="potato52"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop the age of the varieties, nature of the soil, state of the weather, cutting and not cutting seed, were ,mentioned as causes. Professor Johnston remarked i hat, as to the remedy, all are d that a sound, healthy seed, wellpulverized i d well drained soil, were the best' preventives of the disease, and best guarantee .of a good. Salt, i me, and plaster, have been respectively recommended by their advocates, and, i' some instances, with diverse success: An instance of the following kind has come to our notice in, this vicinity, which has recently .been personally examined by the Commissioner of Patents. Mr. James Arm mack, a well known t horticulturist here, planted with potatoculttigs three separate pieces of land, (two of which were san and gravely Jlpti, all on the 20th of June last. Those ;n the first, piece were vol d i plaster of Paris, or gypsy m, and sprinkled n the drill with theisamecid127) .be ,being covered; another piece was prepared with, compose and stable ma are; and a this, d covered with horse dung. In this experiment, the first ai love escaped the disease, and gave an excellent crop the second was >t quite so bad as the last, but both were comparatively useieS. The oil for the first two pieces was alike in one field. These facts, all at tested, see to favor the idea that heat is the great cause; and licence, that the decay of i the vine may be attributed to the disease of the the r. To maggots or insects were discovered, except such as are found in route, <a name="potatoes86"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> generally. This would seem to show that, the plaster acts as a counter action to the too great absorption of the moisture while the barn yard manure produces, on the other hand, too great heat, which might prove injurious. The use of poudrette, and other artificial marries, has been recommended, on plausible grounds, at some of the discussions which have taken place. To prevent the bad effects of barn yard manure one writer earnestly recommends its preparation by eremacausis, or the process of slow combustion, as it is thought that the ferment at ion of the manure i causes the evil. The ire lime is used, it should not be used in a caustic state, and applied directly to the seed. What is termed the hydrate of lime (i. e. lime with water) 4 is said combines with so ruble vegetable and animal substances, which, "n drying, or being acted upon by atmospheric influence, become insoluble in water. Gradually these compounds separate, the lime becomes a carbonate, and the organic matter becomes mould. An instance is related where, on planting, a table spoonfuls of lime was placed in each hill; and, after i they were up, was applied about a will of mixture of lime 2 bushels, plaster 3, and ashes 8. In this case there was not one e rotten <a name="potato53"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the fall, while in the fields of his neighbors they were much diseased 89 [7b3The whole result, therefore, of the facts collected seems to show ,that a inst ad spread I i praying :evil has attacked the <a name="potato54"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, w which bears many mark l s of being of the nature of an epidemic, and which, unless carefully guarded against by the best means' in our power, may prove destructive in years to cocid127e. It may be, that, like the cholera and other diseases withlreferenice to persons, there are certain states of the fruit, and also circumstances, which render them far more predisposed to it than otherwise; nd that though we may not be able utterly to d ward off the disease in every case, we may furnish such preventives as will be effectual in checking its extensive progress. We believe that, as in Germany and England with regard to the diseases of this crop the ere prevalent i we shalt his be enabled to check much of the evil. If it should lead to greater are in the choice of seed and cultivation, the present evil may eventually prove a real benefit to the agricultural community and the people at largeiHAY. The crop of hay we believe to have done well ,during the past year. There is, however, difficulty in gaining r much accurate information respecting its amount, either comparatively or otherwise, except in some few States, because it is. not considered an object of any particular interestandiin certain Stateswhat little is raised is confined to some particular. o n I n, .a: .a_ .a .a. , ' .a. .a. .a. .sections. Ll h ropTake New G d through, the hay crop as been a good one. The season was favorable for its growth and gathering; and it was generally secured in ficid127ne order. From' Paine, under I date of July 19, we hear to this erect: it Belgrde, Later ville, Fairfield, and the whole vicinity, the hay crop appears well. " In the south eastern part of the State it is said to have been a t fair crop probably about .in ,per cent, above last years (18 .a) In the northern central section, it is described as being very large never larger in the district u t t is added, that a portion of it was not gathered, but rotted on the ground. By the editor of an agricultural paper, one thus well fitted to gain correct information, we are told that " ,great crop of hay has been gathered in Paine this year. I tis rot common i to have two such abundant yields as this ad that of last year" It is probably by no means too large an estimate to. put the increase at 25 per cent. over the crop of 1843. The notices from i New Hampshire differ in the different sections of the State. While in the i western part, bordering on the Connecticut river, the account is that it was "above an average" "a Very good crop" "more than an average, but not so much as last year, When the quantity was extraordinary ;" " the quality this year is in such better than the last in the south eastern part of the State, it is thought ,that there is not more than two thirds of a crop." Another, a good judge of crops, says of hay, compared with he crop of 1843, "better crop increase onefourthTaking the. State through, there is probably an increase of about 20 percent. In the lower part of Vermont, the crop was "a good one, but not so good as in the year previous probably " about 10 per cent. less." I n the north eastern, there was about the same increase. In Crittenden county it was "abundant the t crop above mediocrity." In round numbers for that county the crop is put at "65 000 tons." In the county of Grand I s le, hay is thought to have given' about 12,000 tons. In the whole of that 75 ]a] 90 section there has been a considerable increase, which, probably, is equal to 15 or 20 per ce it. It would appear, therefore, that the whole crop, compared with that of: 1843, was about 15 per cent. better. As regards, this crop in Massachusetts, the report is not favorable. Theboston Cultivator, of July 6,says that "the ha' crop in this section is two thirds of the usual one." To the New England Farmer, of July 21, says h hay is said to be light near Boston." And again: the New Englandfarmer, of August 31, says "the hay crop, from 40 to 60 miles around Boston, is cut off one third." At an earlier date, also, in Berkshire county, we are informed "the hay has fallen off." Corresponding to this is the subsequent information. An informant, speaking of the north eastern section of the State, says: "in the sea coast, two thirds of the usual crop; in the interior, a full average' In the northeast, towards the country, it probably fell short about 15 per cent, but it was secured in the best season. Another statement, from the central part of the State, is to this effect" 10 per cent. less than in 1843." We believe that, taking the whole State through, it fell off about 15 per men t. In Rhode I s land, the report from the western half of the State is, that it as "as good as usual on good lands, but on inferior land less than usual in the eastern part, it is stated that there were about 7,000 tons, or 46 percent. less than in 1843. For the whole crop, therefore, we allow 20 percent. decrease, as compared with the crop of 1843. The information which we have been able to obtain from Connecticut, with regard to the hay crop, is much of the same cast. In the central part of this State, "it has been short" but there is said to be "sufficient to keep the stock." In the south eastern section, it is stated to have proved "a large crop." We think, on the whole, the crop has fallen off, though the rate of decrease from the crop of 1843 will not exceed 5 per cent. There has been an average increase in the State of New Work. Theiotices ate, however, somewhat diverse in the various sections of the State. In a public journal at Albany, in July, it is said: "the hay harvest in this vicinity is over, and the crop has been secured in good condition, but it is lighter than an average From a New York paper of the same month, we learn respecting that vicinity: "grass upon old meadows is quite light, and in some instances the farmers will not make hay enough to winter their stock, when usually they have had a surplus. In our meadows the yield is very large met later in August, the following notice is found in one of the public journals of that city: "the spring was highly favorable for grass, and both the high and low meadows presented a most luxuriant growth; so much so, that hay making commenced a week earlier than usual. The weather during the whole month has been in the finest possible order. Some of our farmers have got all their hay under cover, without getting Ve t by even a single shower, We have never seen our barns and hay barracks better filled. July is always one of our severe st and most trying months, and pastures are more apt to be parched than during any month in the year. This month has been an exception, and the grass has looked fresher than common. The cattle have been able to get a good nip, and look uncommonly fat and sleek n western New Work, the same crop is thus described in July: " Daylight; on old meadows not half a crop; on new meadows large burdens 91 [a[ 75 Again, at Buffalo, still later: "the month of August has been very wet and unpleasant; so much so, that hay making has been carried on at great loss and expense: :there is quite a quantity of grass not yet mown, and i some places farmers have had their hay in cocks for the last three weeks. The quantity of hay raised this year will not be any thing like such as last Somewhat earlier, in Steuben county, " the crop of hay is as good as the farmer can ask, and the weather favorable for the harvest' In Genesee county, it is said to have been a "fair crop." At Tic a, the grass crop was light" In Onondaga county and vicinity, "good 1 In Range county, July 5th, ' abundant." In Queens county, on Long I s land, "good to far as we can judge from further notices of correspondents, they givesinlilar accounts. At the north, bordering on the It. Lawrence, there was a full crop' In Jefferson, the increase is rated as high as from "50 to 60 per cent. Long the lake, from the central part of the State to the western boundary, the account is favorable such as Madison and Oswego, "an average crop, Kaluga and Scotland, " good" Rates, average ;Genesee and Wyoming" 10 per cent. over that of 1843;" in Seneca and hayne, "about a medium crop with the exception of Tompkins aidChemung, where it was an average crop, on account of drought; and Onondaga county, where we are told " the hay crop was about 15 per cent lighter than last year, (1843) owing, it is thought, to cold and wet weather in May, and hard frost about the 22d of May." Another ipforinant likewise adds the drought as a reason. The crop of Cattaraugus county is also said to have been "uncommonly fine n Niagara county, we are informed" this crop has been above an average, except on old meadows, or lands which have, been in grass several years. In such cases, it has been light; but most of our farmers now only two seasons, then plough up for corn or wheat. There a regular rotation Of crops is pursued, the hay crop was good. Average, it is estimated, about 10 per cent, above 1843."From the central counties, the crop along the Mohawk valley is judged to have been about the same as last year. I nuts ego and Schoharie, " alight crop; not as good as last year." In Rensselaer, "a full crop' The information respecting the river counties is, that it was "good j" 'about the same as in 1843 ;" average crop." In the county of Range, we have it from high authority: " Our crop this year is about an average one. The increased fertility of our lands gives a larger yield per acre than we formerly obtained. Is, however, the area accessible to navigable waters is very limited, we find this an unprofitable crop toward exportation. I to great bulk, even when pressed, renders it impracticable to transport it by horse power to any considerable distance. About the s are quantity of hay, barely sufficient for our home consumption, is generally raised from year to year' In review of the whole, while we allow a considerable falling off in some sections, we think it more than over balanced by the gain in others and we estimate the increase at 10 to 15 per cent. above the crop of 1843. In New Jersey the reports are in the different sections "about the same as last year" "good" and about" 5 per cent. less." In the whole, there was, it is believed, a slight increase. We have very little information respecting the progress of the growth of this crop in Pennsylvania, and considerable diversity exists respecting the amount gathered in the various sections. In some parts it suffered from the drought. Such was the case in Chester county, where it is thought to 15 ]a] 92 have he en :one quarter less" from this cause ; a so i a Lancaster ,county, where it is tated that there was: a "deficient of nearly onethirdcid127wing loathe; ant -of refreshing rain at the proper time. Further towards the centre, in Berks county, it is said -to have been "more than an average, yield, both in quantity and quality y" In nDauphin. Lebanon, and Schuylkill counties, and vicinity, it is described as having ,been "a a good, crop' In th central counties a, on the upper waters of the Susquehanna, the crop was "abundant Further towards he .west and south, embracing Hunting don, Juniata, aindsomoe adjoining counties, the hay crop was below the average." I nBeaverand Washington, 'about an average." In Somerset county -a lid the adjoining sections, 'as good as in 1843." Arm strong and Clearfieldin the former, by the assessment, it was about 18,000 tons, to s sa poor crop, onaccouilt, of the frost of the, 1st of June ; and, in the latter, "an average crop The crop in the northwestern section, also including Erie and sole counties, father to :the east, along the lake and the State of -new Work, compared with that of 1,84, is estimated at 20 per cent. increase; that in Columrbiaand Luzerne, "a very good growth ;" while in the vicinity ofPhiiadepthia; it was but 'about middling." The whole crop was probably a. greater one the :that of 1843, by about 10 .t 15 per cent. S ay in Maryland fell off, owing to the dry weather in the spring andearlypiart of the season, probably full 25 per cent. It is, however, a larger drop in .some sections than in 1840. In the eastern part of Virginia, on the whole, there was about an average crop, though in some places it was diminished by the drought; west of the mountains it was better, and the increase was probably about 10 per cent. As compared with the crop of 1843, there was, perhaps a small advance probably 5 per q en t. Very little is raised in many portions of the State. Of     north Carolina so far as any attention is paid to it in the. northwest, it was -an ' average crop ;" in the southwest, "very fine ;" and in the central part of the State, " one third less, on account of the drought Probably -he whole 1 average crop is a slight increase, but the quantity raised, is small. This is the case in all the Southern States scarcely any hay is raised and this year, in parts of Georgia, the crops of grain were so good, that hay was not: .put up for the feed of the stock. In Tennessee, also, the hay crop did not vary much from that of the previous year. In Kentucky, in some sections, it is mentioned as being a good crop equal to that of last year; in others, equal to "one third' more. Probably there was an increase of about 20 per cent, as attention seems to be somewhat more turned to it. The crop of lay also gained in Ohio. In the Diam i valley, it is said by a good judge" the hay prop was unusually fine but a large part of it was lost in curing, owing to wet weather at the time of cutting." In the central i counties, we are informed that there was "t 25 per cent. increase, owing to a .feet spring." In the northwestern section, bordering on I n diana and the lake, "hay has been large a very heavy crop." Still further from this, to. the east, along the lake, there was an increase of 25 per cent. I n the :northeast central section, also bordering on the lake, the report is: " seldom better; the weather for cutting it was fine. 1 any farmers received their :whole crop without a drop of rain. There is a very decided increase over the last years crop."

I illinois, it was probably about (2 i percent i over the last year" From the: above account, it is evident that thee ire was a 1 very considerable increase ein the crop of hay in n diana over that off 1843, and :it probably be fairy estimated at from 20 to (did 127) per cent. Similar accounts are finished with regard to I illinois. In the south eastern i sector o, on .the Wabash, towards the central part of the State, the crop was "good' In the southwest, on the Mississippi, and embracing- the counties of Randolph and Monroe, and others in their vicinity, We are told that the hay crop was very abundant about 20 per cent over last years" the best we have had for some years while, still further north, it- was probably ' 10 per cent. better" than in the previous year. By one, in the northern section of the State, who is a good judge on such subjoetsi we are informed that this crop is "more cultivated each year, as th:e wild grassafails6 and that the increase is equal to 30 per cent. He remarksifirther: "I May is becoming a crop with us. Sheep and dairy both demand it With' these data, among Others, we feel warranted in fixing th:e estimate for the average increase of the hay crop for I illinois at from 20 o 25 'percent. over that of 1843. ,I n Missouri, so far as we have gained any information respecting this crop, it was also good. The amount raised is not great, but there seems to have been. a gradual increase. Probably, it was eqliakto from 15 to :20 o pe cent. Michigan raises a tolerably large crop of hay, and the notices from that State fro t he last crop are quite favorable. His, in the eastern section, it is described as Having been "' far superior to the last years drop or and perhaps i the increase was " equal to to per cent." In the western counties it is thought to have been "10 peri cent. better." In the -eastern i and norther, "english hay was never better; marsh hay poor, as the season was too wet- : The whole increase was probably about i 20 per cent. The crops, likewise, of I own and Wisconsin were good; at least, it is believed (cid1270 per cent. increase or the crop of 1843. The whole amount of the ,hay crop for the United States, for the year 1844, therefore, is estimated at 17,715,000 tons. May is beginning to be s pie what exported; aid could a means be devised of compressing it into still less bulk, and yet without injury to' the hay i itself, it is possible that larger quantities might be taken to foreign marketvg70] 94 he find the following extract in a public journal published in New Yorkwsone hundred bales of North river hay have been purchased in New Work for shipment to Great Britain. This (says the shipping list) is, we believe the first shipment of hay ever made to Great Britain from this country. To France parcels have been sent occasionally, for a year or two past Some new varieties of gras are gradually becoming introduced into our agriculture, of which a portion are peculiarly adapted to the southern and warm climates. These may yet be of advantage in the vicinity which is thus furnished for the different seasons, and the weather which may occur. Among these may be mentioned the Bermuda grass, specimens of which as we see by a late number of an agricultural paper) have been sent to this country, from the West I n dies, for comparison and decision whether it is indeed the same which bears that name in some of our Southern States, and which is deemed valuable for some purposes of feeding, as it loses not more than 50 per cent. in curing, and, being thick, large crops are cut from it two or three times in a season. As it is important that the hay be cured in the best manner, we have sub joined here an extract taken from a description in an agricultural paper it i New Work, of the mode of making hay in Range county, in that State: " As to the time of cutting hay, I find a diversity of opinions among farmers. Some prefer mowing when the grass is fairly in blossom; others between the blossoming stage and the hardening of the seed; and still others when quite ripe. I am inclined to the belief that grass contains more of the nutrition properties in the middle stage than the others, and, when practicable, ought to be cut at that time But that which I deem of the most importance in the hay making process is the amount of moisture it should contain when placed in the now or s tack. In this subject there is but one opinion with our most efficient and successful braziers. I think it may be laid down as a general rule, that the more moisture the hay contains, without danger of combustion, the better. But the moisture must be the arterial juice of the grass, not of dew or water, nor absorbed from the wet soil. I am constrained to believe that water alone, in some form or other, causes dusty or mould y hay, and that the juice of the grass never does. I had two stacks of hay put up during my absence, in so green a state that they were perfectly charred at the centre for two or three feet around, without dust or mould in any part of them, and the remainder of the stacks as profitable and good hay as I ever fed out' In the early stages of having, greater care is necessary than the latter, as the grass then contains more juice; but in the latter part of July and August, we cut our grass in the morning, and now it away in the afternoon, and often put it in cock early in the day, to prevent it from becoming dry and brittle.  At this season of having, little more is necessary than for the grass to be wilt edge use about four quarts of salt to a load of half a ton of hay, sprinkling it on twice while unloading; and my plan is (although not generally done) to increase the quantity of salt when the hay is too dry, and diminish it when too green, as the salt increases the moisture t is not uncommon for our stacks of hay to smoke three or four weeks after put up, and the top of the rows to be thoroughly saturated with the steam. That hay which we think best preserved, has, on being opened, alight mahogany or foxy appearance; lies very compact in the s tack or now 95 [75 so much so, that it requires a vigorous arm to thrust an ordinary pitchfork one inch into it The advantages of making hay on the plan I have named are great. I think we save at least one-fourth of the weight, and as rpuchof the nutrition property of the grass; all which is obvious to those who have had an opportunity of seeing cattle fed upon hay made upon the two different plans. I will offer as a proof of this, that a farmer, on visiting me some winters since, supposed that our cows were well fed upon grain. He also remarked, that he found it difficult to bring his stock of cattle through the winter in as good condition as they were when the winter commenced. Our graziersbuy their cattle from the West and North in the fall, calculating that they will gradually improve throughout the winter on hay; and this, too, without the advantages of stabling, which is so generally practised Permit me to note another advantage that occurs to me. May is made on our plan more speedily, and with less risk of weather, and a greater quantity secured in the same space. I have heard but one objection made to hay of this description it is, that cattle do not eat a sufficient quantity of it. Such persons judge from the bulk, and not from the weight, and make no account of the nutrition properties of the grass retained by a short, instead of a long exposure to the sun and air. I apprehend that the reason that cattle eat less of the one kind than they do of the other, is much the same that a man eats less in bulk of pork or animal food than he does of vegetableHEMP, Flax, &c. To much difficulty has been experienced in arranging and harmonizingthe estimates of hemp and flax in one column, that we have in this report concluded to abandon the estimates of flax altogether. The original difficulty lay, as mentioned in an earlier report, in comprising the two together in the census returns. At the same time, after having finished our remarks on hemp, we shall also give such accounts of the flax crop, and such other particulars relating to the article, as may be useful. Hemp is mainly confined to two or three States, of which Kentucky has for years stood foremost. Notwithstanding the early promise respecting this crop, it is believed the whole expectation has not been realized. Thus the Louisville Journal, of the 22d of August, says that the hemp crop will be "fully an average one." Again, the same journal states that there is some complaint among those who sowed early in the season, that their seed vegetated badly, or the crop b loomed before attaining its proper height. In the whole, the crop is good. In the early sowing district, it is now harvest, and under favorable circumstances for a good staple. Pains have been frequent, but have ceased" &c. Compared with the crop of 1843,that for 1844 has largely increased; but as compared with that of 1842,it is less. Such is the estimate in the different sections where this crop is said to be "at least double the crop of 1843, but less than that of 1842 ;and elsewhere, "quantity greater than any former crop" . product uncommonly large" and, again, " increase of three-fourths." We are enabled to give what we believe to be an accurate estimate of the hemp crop of Kentucky, furnished us by the On. Dam Seat ty, a gentleman to whom the agricultural cone m unity are greatly indebted for many valuable observations on various agricultural subjects, (and among others hemp embodied in a published volume, and who has taken pains to acquaint him p 75] 96 self with the progress of this crops in his own State for two or three years past. The sub joined extract from his letter gives such a state right of particulars as will doubtless contribute te to an accurate appreciation both of the, am ont ft arid the importance of this crop : "have obtained complete and accurate returns of all the Hemp received by 'manufacturers and he imp dealers in the city of Days ville during thepreserit year, up to the 27th instant; and the amour tt is as fdlbowsSTos cut. mrs. is: "new rotted -669 16 3 2SWaiter rotted -81 12 3 16 Total -275 1 9 2 18" Of which quantity there was manufactured at Days ville, or to be manufactured; 85 6 tons 15 cut. 2 mrs. 10 lbs; and the residue was fo shipment to -manufacturing establish rents at other points, and for the Eastern market' In consequence of the low price which hemp has borne during the present year, a considerable quantity of hemp still remains in the hands of farmers. If this had been' brought in, the quantity received at Maysvillefdr the year would have been fully three thousand fond. By own opinion concurs with that of a very intelligent commission merchant at Plays ville, that about one-fourth of the entire hemp crop of Kentucky is delivered at, Days ville. I incline to think, from all the information that I have on the subject, that the above is rather an under than an over estimate. According to this estimate, the whole quantity of Kentucky hemp would be twelve thousand tons. S I tis proper to remark, that the year 1843 was an extreme l unfavorable year for the hemp crop, whilst that of 1842 was the most favorable year for that crop which we have ever experienced. With a view of ascertaining the relative product of the two years, I procured, during the last summer, accurate returns from 144 hemp growers of Mason county, of the quantity of hemp produced by them in each of those years: The aggregate result was as follows loans. ewtProduct of 144 crops in 1842 -1 656 15 Product, from same: farms in 1843 -9 19 14 The product of 1843, it wilt be seen, was more than half that of the preceding year. But this was owing to an increased quantity of ground having been sown, as will be apparent from the following statement: "I obtained from 80 hemp growers a particular statement of the number of acres sowed by them each year, together with the product, separately, for each year. These 80 hemp growers, in the aggregate, soWcid127d, in 1842, 2,832acres; which yielded 1,081 tons 8 cut making an average of 7 cut. 2 mrs. 15 lbs. (equal to 85 5 is) per acre. These same 80 hemp gowers in the year 1843 sowed 2,927 acres; which yielded 518 tons 10 cut making ar average per acre of 3: cut. 2 mrs. 5 lbs, (equal to 397 lbs" From this statement, it will be seen that the yield per acre in 1843 was less than half of that of the preceding year. The average 'of these two years-one very favorable, and the other very unfavorablebfromrthe' above data, would be 6 26 lbs. per acre, (equal to 5 cut. 2 mrs. 10 is) This would be about a fair average of the product of the entire hemp crop of Kentucky for ten years in succession." It is proper to remark, that the quantity of h up received at Maysvie97 [a[ 7 ]during the present year was not diminished in a corresponding degree with the falling off of the crop of 1843, compared with that of 1842. In consequence of the uncommon yield of the crop of 1842, and the deficiency of the market, much of it remained on hand. Such a portion of the old crop, which remained over, has been brought into market during the present year, as would probably make the entire delivery equal to an average crop Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the product of the entire hemp growing region of Kentucky, for the last two years, upon an average, would be about twelve thousand tons per annum The season has not been so favorable for the hemp crop of Missouri. Thus, we find scattered notices to this effectPettis county, Missouri, July 9, 1844.-" The wet weather, which has set in, has not only prevented any shipping, but has ruined the growing crop. I have heard but one opinion expressed that the hemp crop of Missouri is a total failure Again: the It. Louis Gazette says: "his important staple [hemp] of this section of the country, in consequence of the wet weather in the fore part of the season, will yield only about half a crop; the same cause produced a similar result last year, when the quantity was about 12,000tons. This season there will be probably about 15,000 tons, which will be doubled next year if the season proves favorable The estimate above given, of 15,000 tons, is unquestionably an error: we suspect it is meant for 5,000 tons. A correspondent from this State says of the hemp crop, " that in some parts it was not one-fourth of a crop, owing to the wet weather ;" and again, not " more than one-fourth ; including flax, it is probable there may have been 10,000 or 12,000 tons." The returns of the hemp and flax being mingled, and the amount of flax raised in I illinois being very considerable, it is difficult to form any suitable estimate as to the hemp crop of this State. In the northern central counties we are told, " the hemp crop was very indifferent" not more than one third of a crop, owing to the bad season. There was a very great increase in the number of acres sown in hemp in I illinois during the past season. The attention of farmers is much turned to this branch of production, and there is a great prospect of a large increase in the article of hemp in I illinois hereafter From a correspondent in Kentucky we have the following statement respecting the hemp crop generally. It will be seen that it sets the hemp crop of that State higher than Judge Seat ty has done, and we believe probably puts the crop of I illinois too low. His means of information, however, entitle his opinion to consideration. He says : "there are probably not 100 tons of hemp produced in Virginia. It is grown to a limited extent in the counties of Virginia bordering on the Ohio river. The product in Kentucky is about 15,000 tons; of Missouri, 6,000to 8,000 tons; I n diana and I illinois, 500 tons; Ohio, 500 to 1,000 tons. Little or none in any other State. A great deal of flax in Kentucky, I n diana, and Ohio, chiefly for seed and home made linen By the following extract from a public journal, we see that attention is turning to this crop somewhat in Mississippi: "the Vicksburg Whig notices the fact that General John H. Cobb had produced at the rate of 1,200 pounds of hemp per acre at Shirt tail bend, on the Mississippi; and also the fact that Messrs. Garfield had raised and manufactured in Mississippi, in one year, enough hemp to bale one hundred and fifty bales of cotton 7[ 75] 98 correspondent in Range county, New Work, says: ' A portion of our county is admirably adapted to this crop, and it was formerly extensively cultivated; but, for some years past, its growth has been discontinued, for want of regenerating prices." In connexion with this crop, we have gathered some particulars which may deserve mention here. The following statement of hemp received at New Orleans may help to show the rapid increase of the cultivation of this important article: "I n 184 142, the entire receipts at New Orleans were only 1,211 bales; in 184 243, they rose to 15,000 bales; and in 184 344, they reached 38,000bales, or about 5,000 tons the increase being almost exclusively from I illinois and Missouriagain: " We notice 7 tons of water rotted hemp, bought by, Messrs. Jamesanderson & To, of John Steel e, Esq, of Gazette county, Kentucky, near Lexington, at               $130 per ton. We have closely examined whole warehouses of Fig a hemp in Boston, and we think we can say, with truth, that we never saw hemp superior to this lot in any respect. It is very heavy, of beautiful color, free from tow, and perfectly clean. It is fully equal to hemp for which our paternal: Government pays Russia        $235 a ton Louisville Journal. It is also stated, in one of the public journals, that 800 bales of dew rotted sold in New York (designed for the English market) at                  $100 per ton. The better qualities are stated to have advanced                 $10 per ton, and the inferior 5. The Farmers' Sister for July also says that "nearly 5,000bales (or 123,500 pounds) of American hemp were received at Boston from New Orleans, during the six months ending on the I st instant' A writer in the Collar Farmer, published at Louisville, Kentucky, speaking of the encourage men t respecting this crop, says: " From our own personal observation, and from the oft tried experiment of a few pioneers in waterrottinghemp, we can safely say that the farmer will be able to realize, at the present low rate of hemp, from     $6.50 to  $7 per hundred weight, for fair, well cleaned water hemp, without hacking from the hand better; and for a very superior article, he may expect    $8 or more. Hair dew rotted rates something below these prices The great difficulty still experienced is a process of water rotating and a brake such as would enable the farmer properly to prepare for the market much of the hemp which is now converted into bagging, or wasted. Several notices have been published in the Western journals, announcing from time to time that the latter desideratum has been attained; but we have not seen any account of complete success having been reached. A writer on this subject says' The custom of de trotting hemp would, so soon as these experiments are brought to a successful issue, and this machine is put in operation, be abandoned; because a more valuable article could be prepared at a less expense. But, for south, some of our practical farmers may ask, what is to be done with so much hemp when it is raised ?a? Met us see. Kentucky has raised, for the past two or three years, an average crop of 15,000 tons annually; the great bulk of which has been dew rotted; and, with the exception of a few hundred tons for t wine, bed cords, &c, all of this, owing to the md ce of preparation, is fit only for bagging and rope." In the manufacture of these articles, there are about 10,000 tons annually couscid127t me i, lea king an over production of 5,000 tons a year, which Will have to lie in the farmers' hemp houses until the bagging manufacttirersare ready to buy it. There is, however, a greater increase in the produc9975 ]ti on of hemp than there is in the manufacture of it; because bagging and rope are articles of limited demand, and their consumption depends exclusively upon the extent of the cotton crop. These circumstances combine directly to reduce the price of dew rotted hemp; and, owing to the facts that the annual production of our State and Missouri is not only 50 percent. more than the consumption, but also that an estimated surplus of from 5000 to 8,000 tons of the crops of 1842 43 is supposed to be at this time in the farmers' hands un sold, many persons are even now looking forward to the price of hemp ruling lower next year than it has ever done before. Supposing, on the other hand, instead of de trotting, the entire crop of Kentucky was walerrotled; what would be the condition of things then ?why, instead of keeping his crop until the bagging manufacturer was ready to buy it, the farmer, by drawing out some 25 per cent. of tow, could obtain for the clean hemp from                $160 to            $200 per ton, and /or the low he could get as much from the bagging manufacturer as he now gets for his best dew rolled hemp. He then never need fear the markets being gutted; for the consumption of water rotted hemp in the world amounts to several hundred thousand tons annually. Russia alone raises 120,000 tons and, as I have before said, Kentucky could be made to produce 100,000tons, if our farmers only knew how to prepare it properly, and a machine was in successful operation to compete with the serf labor of Russiaat a meeting of the American I institute, a communication was made by or. Night, of Kentucky, respecting a new mode of rotating hemp, by water heated to 160 degrees of Fahrenheit, by which it forms an entirely new staple; it becomes silk y, more delicate and beautiful than the first flax. The same gentleman made the following statement to the institute: " Governor Chambers communicated to me a very curious important fact in relation to hemp. He stated that some years since a few tons of hemp were brought to his factory in Kentucky, which his foreman pronounced worthless, in consequence of its being over rotted the fibre not having sufficient strength to bear twisting. It was, however, put away irs one corner of the hemp house as tow, where it remained a year or more; when, being out of hemp, and wishing, to keep the force employed, he directed the foreman to try the lot, and see if it could not be spun for bed cords; when it was found to be quite a good article, it having acquired tenacity by age. I twas accordingly worked up, and he paid the farmer the usual price. Experiments were afterwards made on lots of similar character, and the results were equally favorable The above important facts show the benefit that may yet be derived to this country by the hemp crop. The amount of hemp imported in nine months in 1843 reached in value        $228,882. By the following extract of a circular of a house in New Orleans, dated September 12 1844, we see what may be done: "memphis important article to the growers of the Western country is beginning to attract much attention, not. only in this country, bu it i England. The consumption of it has greatly increased since the last year, which has been supplied by shipments from the West, a portion of which was placed upon the market at much less than its value, r and i in qutiaftiessufficient to supply the immediate -demand, at   $75 and     $85 pp or tin for American dew rotted. Ll, or nearly all, thus held, has been .taken; ,and p ices have advanced to  $92.50 ba 95.

The imports of Russia hemp this year are very small only about 400 tons against 4,000 last year. This will cause an increased demand for your water rotted hemp, which, if well cleaned, and of bright color, will be taken at full prices say from                $160 to              $170 per ton, "machinery of the most perfect kind is said to be in use in Europe, by which the finest linens (the superiority of which is seen by their being labelled "all hemp) are fabric a ted. Similar applications might be made in our own country. We have thrown into our appendix No. 10 some extracts from the report of M. Butowsky, the agent of the Russian Government, who was sent overall Europe to inquire and report "as to the best means of improving the management, cultivation, and fabrication of hemp." A translation of this document was lately published by order of Congress; but the extracts in the appendix contain, in a short compass, some of the most important particulars, prepared by a correspondent of the Louisville Courier. We have also thrown into the same appendix a circular published by some dealers in the article, which we take from the Prairie Farmer. From the Southern Planter, of August, we have also taken some extracts from a letter from William M. Key ton, of Virginia. Another from the Dollarfarmer, on the culture of hemp c. Should time allow, it is, too, our intention to add some extracts, in translation, from a German work, on the vegetables employed in spinning, &c. The estimated hemp crop for 1844 is 22,800 tons. Flax is raised in some parts of our country for seed, and the amount raised for this purpose is increasing. We have rich lands, and can raise this crop to great advantage. There is little danger of over stocking the market with seed, as the demand for the oil thus made is great. The oil crop, in most cases, will pay for the expressing of it. The quantity of oil is said to be about two gallons to the bushel; the yield per acre of seed is from 8 to 15 bushels. Sometimes in Europe it is sown and mowed when the seed is ripe, and the stalk thrown away. But since the new discoveries which have been made for enabling the manufacturer to spin it, and fabric ate fine linen from it, by machinery, it must reduce the price of linen fabrics, and enter into competition with cotton goods. Flax is admirably adapted to the first dropping of prairie land the sod being turned over flat, no weeds appear the first season. In this way, flax for seed maybe obtained and American seed for sowing commands a high price in England, where flax is often pulled before it is ripe, and where the climate is not so favorable for ripe king the seed. The amount of flax seed, as well as of linen goods, &c, imported, is of considerable value, though we cannot give any definite returns in respect to them. The paper in appendix No. 11, on the subject of flax, has been furnished by an experienced manufacturer of flax in i Paterson, N. J., and contains much valuable information, gathered from his personal observation abroad. By the following extract from a public journal, it appears that the business of raising the seed is one of no little importance at the West: "FlaxseedThe Cincinnati It las states that the cultivation of flax for the seed alone has become an important item among the farmers of Hamilton county-one farmer having 20, and another 30 acres under culture. The establishment of oil mills in our Western cities makes a home market, at a price that pays well for the cultivation even of the seed alone 101 [a[ 75 ]the Genesee Farmer, of September, 1844, speaking of this subject, remarks, that seed will bring in that vicinity             $1.50 a bushel, in any quantity, both for home consumption and export. It is also stated that the price of flax is about                $150 per ton. In a Western journal, foreign flax is said to be held in Great Britain at 42 to 100 per ton. I wish flax at 1 15s. to 1 18s. per cut; and mille d flax at 2 12s. to 2 15s. per cut. Tobacco. The tobacco crop is confined, in a great degree, to particular States; and so much difficulty is experienced in forming any estimate with respect to those States where a few thousand pounds or less are raised, as exhibited on the basis of the census returns, that we have thought it best to strike this crop from the column, as regards those States. In Connecticut and Massachusetts only, of New England, have we retained any estimate, where we believe there has been some increase. In the latter of these States, the attention devoted to the culture of tobacco is principally confined to a few miles around Connecticut river and its vicinity, in the northern part of the State, where, on account of the profit derived, more land has been devoted to it, with successful returns, from year to year. It is stated that in 1843,in the single town of Last Windsor, "more than 500 tons were produced, which sold for over   $50 per ton; thus bringing in more than         $25,000. I n five or six .adjoining towns, there is also a great deal of tobacco raised. Within the circumference of 25 miles, there is probably not less than 2,500tons sold annually; and the tobacco is good better for cigar trappers than that of the South." This would seem to indicate that our former estimates for this State have been probably about right. We believe this is the fact; and we have therefore fixed it at an increase of 10 per cent for the year 1844. Respecting this crop in Pennsylvania, we have been unable to ascertain it satisfactorily. From the little incidental knowledge we can get, as it is said to have done well, and more to be planted, we have concluded to fix it at a slight increase, though we should not be greatly disappointed if it turned out otherwise. Maryland is a large tobacco growing State. There is considerable conflicting in the accounts of this crop gathered from the public journals. Thus, for instance, it is stated: " Maryland tobaccoLyfords Journal of Saturday says, in reference to the coming crop of Maryland tobacco, that all accounts agree in pronouncing it, from present appearances, the largest, and of as good quality in general, as the State has ever produced. Some portion of it is already housed" The tobacco crops tobacco planter of Anne Run del county, Maryland, states that the article which we copied from By fords Journal on Monday last, relative to the extent and quality of this years Maryland tobacco crop, is incorrect. In Anne Run del, Prince George, and Salver t, the principal tobacco growing counties in the State, he says the planters will be satisfied in having two thirds of an average crop. This may be so, but Mr. Eyford is usually correct in his statements to, took injury to the tobacco crop The Marlborough Gazette of Thursday last says: Such injury was sustained in the lower part of Prince George by the storm on yesterday week. We learn that several planters had their tobacco crops so much cut by the hail as to render there valueless102Anp again: " We would remark, in reference to the present tobacco crop in Maryland, that, from all the information we can get, (and we have taken a good deal of pains to obtain it) the crop of Maryland is about one third short of an average one. At the same time, we understand that the quality is much superior to what it was last year, being rather thicker in the leaf, and generally very bright in color. The planters will therefore, in all probability, realize as much in funds for their crop this year as last as the improvement in quality will make up for the deficiency in quantity: In July, we find the following notice from Lock ville, Montgomery county: " The tobacco planters here made great preparations for the cultivation of a larger crop than has been grown for a number of years; and the season, so far, has been favorable." In the southeast section of the State, bordering on the Potomac river, the report respecting the crop is " 50 per cent short, on account of a dry May and a very dry summer." We believe that the crop is full 25 per cent. short, on an average, of the usual fair crop of the State. The Virginia crop, to judge from the notices which are found in the journals of that State, has greatly suffered during the past year. The following are specimensTheNorfolk Deacon says: " In the great tobacco region of the Roanoke, in Prince Edward, Charlotte, Halifax, Pittsylvania, and in the upper James, a drought, more severe than has been felt for many years, has materially impaired the prospects of the tobacco planter. In the above named region and country, the injury to the corn crop is estimated at one half i to two thirds. The condition of the tobacco crop is exceedingly critical. The portion of the crop first planted has grown swindling, for want of moisture while that planted later has put forth very closely, or perished in the hill. As late as the 2d, no rain had fallen in the country above named for months, and the injury sustained by tobacco must be material." The degree cannot be fully ascertained, but the crop must be short. I need, we fear another disastrous year for our great staple is about to revolver result which cannot be deprecated too earnestly by all interested in the prosperity of Virginia. The two last crops of tobacco have not only not added a dollar to the prosperity of the State, but left every planter involved in debt. The loss sustained by the planting interest has been almost overwhelming. Hundreds of slaves have been sold out of the State; not far from seventy-five to one hundred have been removed beyond our limits within the last twelve months, and a very heavy balance is yet marked down against the planter. It is difficult to estimate the bad results of a failure of the present tobacco crop; but, as circumstances now are, it is well to prepare ourselves for the worst, and make the best of it Again: " Tobacco crops friend from Charlotte county, in this State, informs us that an unusually severe drought has prevailed in Charlotte, Halifax, Prince Edward, Cumberland, and in the counties adjoining these and great fears are entertained for the corn and tobacco crops. To rain has fallen for several months, and up to Saturday last the drought still continued. The corn crop must be curtailed a half, if not more; and the fate of the tobacco crop is very doubtful. In large districts of country the plants failed, or were destroyed by the fly, and the beds were new sown. Thisprodured a late planting of the crop, and the want of rain has increased the difficulty. Any plants have died in the hill, and few planters have a full crop standing. The drought has also injured the tobacco that was planted 103[ 75 ]early, causing it to grow light. The tobacco crops of the three past years have wrought such disaster to the planters and to the Commonwealth, thatwewvill not permit ourselves to believe that another is to be added to thedisheartening results of the past Norfolk Herald, a august 9, 1844. Elsewhere we are told, in September: " The prospect for a good crop of tobacco is very gloomy. The tobacco crop is very un promising, the drought is so severe Similar to these are notices which have been furnished since the first crop was gathered. Thus, in the south eastern central section of the State, in the vicinity of Media county, it is stated that there was a falling off of 30 per cent. from the previous crop, though that which was raised is of superior quality." This was the "result there of drought." In the southern central counties, bordering on North Carolina, it is said: " The last was a small and bad crop ; and this is somewhat less caused by a scarcity of plants, and a dry July, August, and September; but that portion of this years crop which was planted early (say one fourth) is of a very superior quality." North of this, "the quality was good, but the quantity was hardly an average." In the western part of the State, also, the crop was about an average one. Considering that the last years crop (1843) was so poor, though this of 1844 has been lessened, yet, on the whole, we think it has not decreased more than about 20 per cent. In North Carolina, the same cause has operated to reduce the crop. I n some sections the crop is rated at about one half, as but little was planted. Elsewhere it is said that "in quantity it was about equal to last year, but the quality was superior' In the whole, the average decrease from the crop of 1843 was doubtless equal to 15 per cent. Respecting the crop in South Carolina, we have so little information that we find it difficult to form an estimate. Ordering as it does on Northcarolina and Georgia, the season was similar; but, as the crop occupies a minor place in the production of this State, we allow but little increase perhaps 5 per cent. In Georgia, the tobacco crops in the western section, or what is called the Cherokee country, are said "riot only to be much better, from the favorable ness of the season, but there has been an increased culture e I none part of this region, the increase is estimated at 150 per cent, on account of the very low price of cotton. Take the State through, we believe that there was probably from 25 to 30 per cent. advance on the crop of 1843. The same, we believe, was the case with Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida ; although, from the little attention given to it, notices are un frequent in the all absorbing question of the prosperity of the cotton crop. The crop of tobacco in 1 Tennessee is quite large; and in West Tennessee, we see it stated that it was very promising." The whole crop of this State appears to have been an increased one perhaps 10 to 15 per cent. The same was probably the case with the crop in Kentucky, where there was an increase of from 5 to 10 per cent. It is said that, from all accounts, the presumption is, that the crop in Ohio is nearly or quite an average one, and the quality about as in the previous year. In the Diam i valley, one informant says : " In 1843 there were 12,000 pounds raised ; in 1844,8,000. The crop of this year was superior to the last' in every respect, and the decrease of quantity is the result of a less number of acres being cultivated. In yet another section of the State, the quantity is fully double. Probably there was an advance of from 10 to 15 per cent possibly more[ 75 ]a] 104 The early notices of the crop in Missouri which meet us are like the following : " The tobacco crop in Missouri gentleman familiar with the subject has recently been travelling up the Missouri river. He informs us that he saw and conversed with a number of planters, and had means of gaining correct intelligence of the prospect of the coming crop in the counties of Boone, Toward, Chariton, Randolph, Bacon, Galloway, Montgomery, Warren, and It. Charles. In these counties our informant states that the crop will nearly equal in quantity, and greatly expel in quality, that of any former year. Our informant states, that since his return he has had opportunities of conversing with planters, and received accounts from most of the other tobacco growing counties, all of which concur in the above statement. It is now pretty certain that the quantity in the State will about equal, (probably from the increase of growers) if not exceed, that of any former year, and be of fair complexion, and better adapted to manufacturing than any previous crop it. Louis Republican. The information obtained since the crop was gathered hardly corresponds with the above. For instance, in sections of the State we are told that" the crop was but about one half a crop, on account of the overflow ;" and, again, " two thirds of a crop." We believe, from all we can ascertain, that there was a falling off of from 20 to 25 per cent" but that, allowing for the increased culture, on account of new lands, &c, we may estimate it at about 15 per cent. The following is the statement in the It. Louis Gazette, which, at 5,000hogsheads for one third of the crop, is near our estimate: "4bbaccoThe crop sent to this market falls short of last year, when there were about 7,000 hogs heads. This year the number will not much exceed 5,000 hogs heads, and the quality is not generally so good. It has been cut too green, and is specifically lighter than that of a more mature growth. Prices vary from             $1 to              $11 per hundred. The crop throughout the State for 1844 will probably amount to 20,000 hogs heads. Only about one third of the entire crop comes to this market. About two thirds is shipped direct to New Orleans, from the different harbors along the river, "tobacco is raised in some of the other States; but the quantity is comparatively small, and attracts so little attention, that no very definite calculations can be given respecting the crop in them. We have fixed the estimates in the table, according to the best judgment, from a comparison of former productive seasons, continuity, &c. The whole tobacco crop of the United States for 1844 we suppose maybe fixed at 166,705,000 pounds. In a Richmond paper we find the following statement respecting the crops of Virginia and North Carolina, under date of October 3 : "the total inspection embraced in the statement to the 30th of September, is 10,861hogsheads less than at a corresponding period in 1843; but still the returns do not accurately exhibit the real deficiency between the productions of 1842 and 1843, in consequence of a larger quantity of tobacco being replied and inspected a second time; the present year, perhaps 1,500 hogs heads were, at least, thus counted twice in the inspections. At this time the stock of old tobacco held by' the planters is very small. Relative, therefore, to the crop for inspection in 1845, it must be mainly confined to the production of 1844, which, in the aggregate, will not exceed 40,000 to 4 5000 hogs heads. The home demand for tobacco is regularly increasing 105 [a[ 75 Statistics of inspection and stock, to 30th September, 1844. I inspected. stock. Richmond -1914 7 hads. 8,446 hads.

During this period, one or two short crops in Virginia would affect prices. The Western States, during this period, had never exported, on an average, more than 35,000 hogs heads. In 1840, the West exported 40 000; in 1841, 54,600 hogs heads; in 1842, 68,000 hogs heads; in 1843,89,800 hogs heads; and in 1844, 81,200 hogs heads. We refer you to the New Orleans price current of the 7th of September, for the exports of tobacco from 1835 to 1844, inclusive; by which you will see that Neworleans alone has exported, in the last two years, as much tobacco, on an average, as the average products of the United States previous to 1835. This, we think, is sufficient to account for the low prices of 1843 and 1844;and we may say, the very inferior quality of the Virginia tobacco for two years past has contributed not a little to lessen its value, and to bring the Western tobacco into more general use. The fact is, that the West produces now nearly as much as the consumption of Europe demands. The failure of a crop in Virginia has very little, if any, effect on prices in Europe. It does, however, affect prices at home in our own market, since our manufacturers require annually from 18,000 to 20,000 hogs heads of Virginia tobacco for the consumption of the country, which is about half of what is supposed to be the crop of Virginia grown this year; and the consumption being on the increase, it is fair to suppose that at least one half of the tobacco raised in Virginia hereafter will be manufactured for home use. It should be remembered that the growth of tobacco is not 75 ]a] 106 confined to the United States. It is supposed that at least as much as 7 5000 hogs heads are raised in other countries. It is true the consumption is on the increase; but it seems that the production is far ahead of the consumption, as will appear from the statement of exports and products n letters which have been received from Algiers, (as we learn from the foreign journals) it is stated that the French have been successful in their plantations of tobacco formed there; so that it is not improbable that, in the course of some years, they may derive a portion of their supply for the market from that colony. The opinion is expressed that China may open to us a considerable sale, as the milder kinds, cut fine, and sent in packages of 5, 10, or 20 pounds, would be quite profitable there. They are said to use an immense quantity of their own raising, but it is far inferior in quality to the American. That which is taken out from this country by the captains and mates of ships is said to find a ready sale. As ships from every, quarter 'of the globe visit that part, and not much is exposed for sale, the opinion seems probable that there would be a very considerable traffic, were it attempted, as might now be through the ports opened to us. Several valuable papers on the culture of tobacco have been published by Dr. Partner, who enters very fully into the question as to the conditions of the soil, the preparation necessary, &c. He states that " in rich loams, where the solution of the minerals of the soil is rapid, and where 10 to 20 percent. of vegetable matter is incorporated in the earth, tobacco may be obtained for many years; but it is always an exhausting crop." He adds: " It has been stated that 170 pounds of mineral matter are removed in less than three months, by a crop of tobacco, from one acre of land." "his is very much more than wheat or other grains carry off in eight or nine months. -thus, wheat planted in October, and cut in June, takes from the soil, of the same mineral substances, 22 pounds in a crop of 20 bushels, with straw. In these estimates, the sand or s iliac is omitted, inasmuch a sits supply is too great in all soils to cause any fear from exhaustion" The important mineral substances presented in Havana tobacco, examined by Her twig, (Liebigs Anna len for April, 1843,) are Salts of potash, 34.15, Salts of lime, 51.38,Magnesia, 4.09, Phosphates 9.04,in one .hundred; parts ashes. These substances were, for the most part, insoluble in earth, and must have been dissolved during the growth of the crop." We have now arrived at a clear view of the cause of sterile ty in lands as respects tobacco saline substances and ammonia are not rendered fit for -food with sufficient rapidity. We also see why a large amount of dead leaves, or other vegetable rubbish, will yield a crop, by giving up to the roots, a sufficient quantity of these bodies, The great question is whether there are economical means by which land, which has lost the power of sustaining tobacco, can be rendered fertile, and be maintained in that condition He recommends the attaining a suitable soil by providing means to promote, its pomposity, and then to hasten the sol ability of its saline matters. This (he says) may be done by living; by burning part of the surface soil with lime in the kill ; by incorporating vegetable matter in the soil by burning of clay, and pulverizing; also, to secure the ammonia of the soil. In these subjects, he makes many remarks. The whole essays deserve the careful perusal of the tobacco planter, as they contain numerous 107 [a[ 75 ]valuable suggestions. They have been published by most of the agricultural journals in the tobacco growing regions. In a late number of the Southern Planter, a new remedy is described to prevent the destruction of tobacco plants by the fly. The writer says     had a bushel or two of dry ashes put into a large tub, and added train oil enough (say one gallon of oil to the bushel of ashes) to dam pen and flavor the ashes completely; this was well stirred, and mixed with the hand, and sowed broadcast over certain patches, Los. 2 and 3." The trial was successful, as it likewise was another year; while on No. 1, another left without the remedy, the plants were destroyed. In consequence of the expectation that a duty amounting to a prohibition would be imposed in England on tobacco strips, it is mentioned in a public journal that thestemmeries of this country had been closed, and no tobacco v would go forward in the shape of strips. England was the only foreign market, before, in which strips were taken. Cotton. There can be no doubt that, with regard to this great crop, which exercises so mighty an influence on the trade of this country, the crop of 1844 is much larger than that of 1843. I need, had it not been for the floods of the Mississippi, it would have been probably as large, if not, larger, than any before raised in this country. The return of the crop of the previous year, as it appears, was about 2,000,000 of bales, which, at 375 pounds to the bale, is only about 3,000,000 of pounds from the tabular estimate of 1843. It is possible that, in the proportional distribution of the crop, there was less accuracy. We see it strongly insisted upon by some of our correspondents, that Mississippi is now the foremost State in the production of cotton; and we are inclined to think that this may be true, as the progress of the culture is gradually more and more westward, though we felt justified in reducing the crop of that year, and raising that of Georgia in 1843,by the accounts which we could gather from the various States. In Virginia, there was probably a falling off of cotton, from the drought the decrease is, in some sections, even as high as 30 per cent; but it was of superior quality. The cotton crop of North Carolina is thus noticed at an early date in one of the public journals: ' The prospect of a good cotton crop in the northern part of the State is somewhat doubtful, owing to the drought. Somefieldsare much injured." In the north eastern section of the State, however, subsequent intelligent information is given: " The cotton is better than I have known it for many years; but, in consequence of the low prices at which it had been selling, planters did not try to raise it extensively this year, but curtailed their crops. In the northwest counties, the crop was an average one, yet little was planted." In the southwest, it was "good, clean, and dry, and opened well." In the southern central section, bordering Southcarolina, it is thought to have been "one fourth less, on account of the drought." In the whole, the crop for the State may have been a slight increase of from 5 to 10 per cent. over the crop of 1843, which fell off considerably from the previous year.  The following are some of the notices which have been gathered, from time to time, from the public journals, to mark the progress of the cotton crop in South Carolina 75 ]a] 108 From the Charleston Courier, of June 20, in regard to the crops, we quote the following extract of a letter, dated Jeffries Greek, June 10: "I have melancholy news to write in relation to the cotton crops in this neighborhood, and, I may say, so far as I have heard, in this region of country. About a fortnight or three weeks since, our prospects were never more flattering; but, in this short time, the a his gosp ii, or cotton louse, has attacked our cotton in such numbers, that, without some speedy arrest of their ravages should take place, there is a strong probability, from present appearances, that many crops in this neighborhood will be entirely destroyed; and none that I have heard from will escape extensive injury. I _have ploughed up one-fourth of my own crop, and planted it in corn ; and in the balance of my farm, there can scarcely be found a stalk of cotton but what is stocked with the insects. I have heard from most parts of this district, and from a portion of Darlington, and complaints from this insect are almost universally heard of" The weather and the crops his present month of July will be noted for intense heat and protracted drought. The surrounding country has suffered incalculable for want of rain. The corn crop is materially affected; and even cotton, which, up to within a few days, promised a most abundant yield, has commenced shedding its balls to a most incalculable extentCheraw (S. C.) Gazette of July 30. A letter in the Charleston Mercury gives a melancholy picture of the cotton crop, which account is confirmed from other sources of information. The Mercury says : "a. This disastrous result of a season that promised, in the other part, more richly than any for some years past, is not confined to that State, but is true, with more or less of litigation, of the entire cotton growing region. The peculiarity of the growth is, that the plant attained a precious maturity, and that all growth, and consequently all possible increase of the product, is now at an end. The crop is now nearly all gathered, or ready for gathering. Frost may come early or late ; it is all the same. There will be nothing for it to kill. Favorable localities may, to a limited extent, have escaped this injury; but, beyond a doubt, the disaster has been general. The Tea I s land crop is believed to be much better in the upland, as one might expect The Anderson (S. C.) Gazette says: " We have no rain yet. The cotton crop has been cut off nearly onehalfEdisto I s land, e August 5.-Though for some weeks past our dry and parched fields have been entreating in their behalf the prayers of the faithful, never, till ten days ago, had I seen a better promise of cotton to our painstaking planters." The effects of the long continued drought, however, have at last become alarmingly apparent, and our fields now present an aspect of premature age. The s talks are red an indication of maturity ; and the leaves on some plantations, withering and dying, cover the earth as after a frost. I n the low lands, where, from some remains of moisture, the plant has been enabled to endure the fiery trial, a red bug, unknown except to our oldest men, has appeared in great abundance, and is now sucking up its vital energies, and doing even more damage (some say) than the cater pillar of known destructivenessThe view taken by other informants, respecting the crop in this State, corresponds mainly with the above. It seems to have been better, however, in the northwestern section of the State, as the crop was about the 109 [a[ 75 same as last year. In forming an estimate, however, it should be remembered that the crop of 1843 suffered a great decrease from that of 1842. Further towards the east, along the northern line, it was stated that it was short say about three-fourths: the late fall was favorable, or it would not have been more than half a crop. Probably there was a decrease from the crop of 1843 of about 15 per cent, as that was by no means an average crop. Georgia ranks among the foremost of the cotton growing States. There is some diversity among the earlier notices of the crop, as probably the state of the market might have some influence upon the tone of the journals. In June, we find the following: "HailstormsThe Columbus (georgia) Times, of the 5th instant, I taste following: A heavy storm of rain and hail passed over the Chattahoochie river, some three miles below this city, on Thursday last. We hear that the corn and cotton were terribly cut up on those plantations within the track of the storm. A river planter showed us half a dozen corns talks taken from a field of 150 acres, and which he said was a fair specimen of the damage throughout the field. They were stripped of every leaf, and rudely topped. These storms have been general. We encountered no less than three on different days of last week, on a journey from the Ocmulgeeriver to Columbus, through the counties of Houston, Bacon, and Marion, We did not learn that the damage was very great Other accounts are in July. The Albany (georgia) Courier, of the 31stultimo, says: "for the last few days we have been apparently in the midst of autumn. The nights and mornings have been so very cool as to render fire necessary for comfort. The weather has been dry for more than a week past, and altogether favorable to cotton" New cotton The Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel, of Wednesday, announces a bale of new cotton in that city from the plantation of Jamesgardner, jr, Esq, of Columbia county. It is of good staple and fine quality. The first bale of new cotton received last summer was on the 24th day ofAugust25 days later Extract of a letter dated Columbus, Georgia, September 3, 1844: "The weather now is, and has been for some time past, particularly favorable to the growing and maturing cotton, and the picking is now in full blast. Such weather will insure a large crop" New Tea I s land cot on bale of Tea I s land of the new crop was received yesterday from the plantation of Mr. Ing us Martin, of Liberty county, consigned to Noble A. Garden. This is early for this description of cotton much earlier than former season Savannah Georgian, August 31." Tea I s land col lone have received a specimen of Tea I s land cotton from the plantation of Colonel W. W. Hazard, of It. Simon S. It is from the big cream seed, of very fine quality, and extra long staple. Colonel Writes us, that in July he picked at the rate of 8 pounds to the hand per day, which has not been done before, he thinks, for many years The Tea I s land crop still promises very fairly, and our planters on the coast will, we hope, reap a rich harvest for their toil." Another specimen, of similar quality, has been kindly furnished us by or. Hazard, also of It. Simon S, and to which all we have said of the above is strictly applicable The cotton crop in Houston county, where I reside, was very likely[ 751] 110 until the last of August. Heavy rains, and some remarkably cold day said nights, with a heavy wind, have altered the appearance very materially ; and I venture the assertion, that the present crop will fall short, in this county, of the crop of last year, from one third to one-fourth. D. B." Houston County, Georgii A, October, 1844.""New cotton Eighty bales of new cotton were received by the railroad last evening, consigned to various persons. The weather has been very fine for picking during the past two weeks. The accounts, though generally favorable, are sont what contradictory as to the prospect of a large yield many planters complaining of too much rain, and others of the ravages of the caterpillarSavannah Republican, Wednesday. The cotton crop The Washington (georgia) News and Planters' Gazette, of the 5th instant, says: ' The prospects for a large crop, which were very fair some weeks since, are destroyed by the long continued drought. There has been no rain of consequence for the last six weeks; and the consequence is, that the growth and production of the plant has entirely stopped. Some planters tell us that their crops will not be more than half what they had reason to expect a short time ago. What there is, however, is said to be of excellent color and quality n the western and northwestern part of the State, the crop is said to have been much better, and there was also an increased cultivation of the product. In some cases, it is estimated as "three times as large, on account of the low price of pork and corn, or the no price of every other agricultural productcid127) Again, it is stated that it " turned out perhaps 800 or 1000 pounds to the acre." The season in that section also seems to have been favorable. Ink the whole, we think that, take the State through, there was an increase of 10 to 15 per cent. on the crop of 1843. Alabama is likewise a large producer of cotton, and the following is the aspect of the progress of the crop in this State, so far as we have been able to gather it from the public journals. Thus: " The crop The Mobile Merchants and Planters' Prices Current, of the 20 th instant, says: 'from all parts of the cotton region we continue to receive accounts of the most favorable character in regard to the growing crop. Throughout Middle and South Alabama, the prospects for an abundant yield were never more promising' and from the fact that the present season is at least three weeks in advance of the last, we have thus some data deemed reliable by many who have paid attention to the subject, upon which to found an estimate of a large crop for Mobile, as well as for the country." We were informed last evening, by a gentleman from Washingtoncouinty, that the day previous he rode over several of the largest plantations in that county; and, from his observation, he is decidedly of the opinion that the crop does not look as well as last season. He says it is very true that much of the cotton is full three weeks more forward than last year but so much has been injured by the rain, that it does not average as well as it' did last y year' The crops in Down des county n We have seen a letter from one of ourvpeichants, now in the interior, to his correspondent in this city, datedLowndes County, August 14th, in which the writer says: ' The form is destroying the cotton crop of this county' "mobile -dvertiserDiing the week we' ave had' accounts from most of the cotton re 111 [a[ region in South Alabama arid part of Mississippi. The prospects of the planter for an abundant crop are still highly flattering. It was apprehended that too much rain had fallen in some sections, but as yet we have heard of no serious injury from that cause. From Clark county, we learn that the cater pillar has made its appearance on some plantations, and fears are expressed that it may prove destructive" The crops in North Alabamathe Southern Advocate, of the 6th instant, printed at Hunts ville, Alabama, says: 'the weather, for sometime past, has been alternately very hot and cool, and remarkably dry and dusty. Very thing is nearly parched up with drought. Our farming friends complain much of the injury done to the cotton crop by worms and the dry weather. The complaint is a general one; and it appears to be the opinion that the crop is cut off at least as much as one-fourth, if not one third. The season for picking is quite fine, and the article must be very good' "a" Alabama cotton crop The Mobile Herald states, that from the interior of the State, the news is, that the cotton crop was never as it is now. It was vigorous and abundant beyond example, and growing strong enough to defy all its enemies, the worms correspondent of the Mobile Advertise r, under date. of July 25, says" The prospect of a large cotton crop in this part of the State has been b lighted by the appearance of the cater pillar the most destructive insect to the cotton plant known to the planter. Their appearance this season is much earlier than ever known any previous year" To sport, Alabama, August 28, 1844.-The cater pillar is compnittinggreat destruction on our cotton crops on the Alabama river, in this section. I think our crops will be cut short considerable. The late excessive rains have rotted our cotton badly. Our crops are very fineSNew cotton The Marengo (alabama) Patriot, of the 3 1st August, says: Nearly 400 bales of cotton, of the new crop, have been received, "the understand (says the Utah Whig) that good pickets, on some plantations in this community, were gathering, each, 300 pounds per day Under date of August 25, Colonel Alexander Mcdonald thus writes to the Cultivator: "I set out, on the 24th of June, from Eufalla, Harbour county, Alabama, in latitude 31 , being what may be termed the cotton growing region. I have travelled over ten counties in Alabama, and saw many fine crops of cotton. It was, however, too early to determine as to the extent of the cotton crop. Dr. Loud, of Bacon county, in a letter of September 30, to the editor of the Cultivator, says that the cotton crop is good, notwithstanding the drought in the early summer. The worm and rust have produced considerable damage on the prairie lands, which has not been the case, except to a limited extent, on the sandy lands. 'the following notice is taken from the Southern Cultivator, an agricultural journal in Georgia : " Drop of cotton in South alabama or. Editor : The past season has been favorable for our cotton and provision crops. Our prospects of an abundant production were never more flattering than they were during the last summer, until the appearance of the cater pillar in August. I nm any fields, on the Alabama river, below Claiborne, they were very destructive having appeared before any part of the crop had matured ; and although their progress for a time was very slow, they eventually passed through entire fields, leaving scarcely any trace of vegetation. Fortunately, this was not the case generally. There were instances of continue[ 75 ]a] 112 out plantations, on some of which their ravages were thus marked, and on others very little injury was inflicted by them. Until within a few days past, the weather had been particularly favorable for picking. For the last five days it has raised without intermission ; and there is, of course, an entire suspension of field work. The loss which must result from this change of the weather, it is apprehended, will be great on the river plantations, as there is yet a considerable portion of the crop not yet gathered. An foundation of the fields, which we have every reason to anticipate, will destroy all that has not already been secured; and the hopes of the planters, whose crops were not early matt red, or who have delayed their picking from other causes, may be thus frustrated. From the combination of various causes, the production of the crop will not exceed an average of the last four years; and, with the present prices, how small will be the profit of the years labor !CLAI Borne, November 25, 1844."I n the north eastern portion of the State, the crop is said to have been a good one full al average crop. An informant, speaking of Gwinnettcounty, says that the culture of it was entered into pretty largely in the spring, on account of the rise of price. He estimates the amount in Gwinnett county at 860,000 pounds, or 2,000 bales. As the crop of last year fell off comparing it with that crop, we believe the crop of 1844 was at cast from 20 to 25 per cent. better, especially as there was, no doubt, much more under cultivation. The early notices respecting the cotton crops of Louisiana are quite conflicting. We shall give some which we have gathered at different periods.  The great flood of the Mississippi unquestionably lessened the crop very considerably; and we doubt not that the estimates given below on this subject will, in the main, be found correct; though it may be that some supposed to be lost, on account of the favorable weather which succeeded was not entirely so. We sub join the extracts without further comment From the Concordia (louisiana) I intelligence r, July 13." The extent of country overflowed the present season, though far less than was covered in 1.823, contains within its limits property to an amount exceeding 2,000 per cent. what was then exposed and subjected to injury and we hazard nothing in asserting that the amount of loss by the present flood will even far exceed that wide proportion." To far as we have been able to learn, up to the present moment, nearly the entire surface of the two Arkansas counties have been flooded; all the back and interior lands of War roll parish say over one half the entire surface; near one half of Madison; near one half of Tens as ; one third the eastern front of Catahoula and Franklin, taken collectively mostly in Franklin. Of the interior crop of Concordia, we cannot as yet offer a probable estimate; several places making three or four hundred bales are half flooded, and the water gaining on them rapidly, as it must continue to do, until a positive (and not reported) fall takes place as low down on the Mississippi as Watched.

We have made arrangements for collecting the details from the mouth of Arkansas to the mouth of Red river Estimates of the loss of cotton by the floods on Red river, Arkansas, and the Mississippi, we heard made in New Orleans last week, as varying from one to four hundred thousand bales. The result, we anticipate, will be in the vicinity of the latter, but the facts shall be supplied as early aspracticableShreveport, (red river) June 22.-The crops in this parish and Desoto never looked more promising than they do at present. Copious and invigorating showers have fallen at desirable intervals for several weekspastThe crops above the raft are, by the combined ravages of the high water and the worm, seriously injured, and, in some instances, entirely destroyed. The latter has attacked the crops in the uplands as well as thebottomsThe last intelligence from the raft indicates rapid progress in the removal of that obstruction Since my former letter in relation to the loss sustained by the cotton crop on account of the floods, I have seen some planters who have come direct from the Red river. They say they estimate the loss on that river and tributaries alone, at about 130,000 bales. This may appear too large an amount. He this as it may, I still adhere to my former opinion, at which     arrived after much personal observation and careful inquiry that, under no circumstances, will the loss fall short of 200,000 bales. It is possible it may exceed this amount. Some say it will reach 250,000. That portion of the crop destroyed embraces the finest qualities of short staple cotton made in America; such as that grown on the bottoms of the Red and Mississippi rivers, and on lands bordering lakes and ba you in Louisiana and Mississippi. The effect of this loss may not be very material upon the average market value of the aggregate crop; but I have no question of its future influence upon the higher qualities of the article, which will be more scarce. This circumstance will also, very likely, give greater firmness to the lower classifications, or to the inferior grades From the Had do Gazette. Drops in western Louisianaextract of a letter dated He Soto parish, Louisiana, July 26, 1844: Never were crops more promising in this and the adjoining parishes. Worn is so very abundant that, like last season, it may be bought at 124 to 15 cents per bushel; and should occasional showers continue, and no casualty happen to the cotton crop, it will yield a bale to the acre in our parish. The 200,000 bales represented to be lost by floods on the bottom land will be amply replaced, I judge, by augmented crops in the uplands 875 ]a] 114 The loss by the overflow in the cotton crop has been variously estimated some as high as 400,000 bales which I think must be exaggerated; and of course the very nature of the case prevents any thing like a correct estimate; but all agree that the growth is most luxuriant and promising where the flood has not reached, and that plantations where one half of the crop has been destroyed will still gather as much as they did last season. But for the injury that has been sustained, the crop would no, doubt have been the largest ever grown in the United States, and, as it is, will probably equal any preceding one New Orleans, July 29.-The steamboat Brilliant brought down yesterday the first bale of new cotton, from the plantation of A. Poverty, Esqwest Feliciana, consigned to J. B. Borne & To. The crop is about a month earlier than last year, when the first bale was received on the 17th day of August." Since writing the above, three more bales have been received by the Bunker Will, from Vicksburg-one from Governor Mcnutts plantation, one from the plantation of Dr. Bird, and one from that of Mr. Davisnew Orleans See of July 24. The editor of the New Orleans Bulletin is of the opinion that "the recent floods will reduce the cotton crop about 250,000 bales The It. An dry (louisiana) Whig says: "he are truly sorry to announce that the cotton crop in this parish is lament ably cut up. The cater pillar is making sad havoc. We learn that many of the planters on A you Boeuf contemplate abandoning cotton altogether, and intend planting the sugar cane. The cotton crop this year, inmost of that section, will not yield half the usual quantity; and all around us, a third at least will be lost. We are no alarm its, but. speak the words of sober ness and truth' and people at a distance may rely on this statement The caterpillarThe Red River Republican says: " In our last we mentioned the appearance of the dreaded cater pillar on our cotton fields. We have since received information from the country that puts to rest all doubts. The real insect, so destructive in other years, can be seen on almost every plantation in the parish.

They approach the tender plants in myriads, and the work of destruction is completed in a shorttimeThe cotton crop in Louisianathe New Orleans Picayune says: " From what we have recently seen of the cotton crop in the eastern part of the State, and from what we have heard of it in the other upland sections, we anticipate an abundant crop. It is true that great destruction has been done to it by creases and overflows on the margin of the great, and some of the lesser rivers. The aggregate yield, notwithstanding, will be greater than that of last year by several thousand bales" The Had do (louisiana) Gazette says: 'he regret much to hear, from almost every quarter, of the great damage which is done to the crops by the extraordinary drought. In many plantations, as we understand, where it had been usual to make as much as could be gathered, there will not be made the present year more than 400 pounds of cotton to the acre.

The crop in Louisiana letter from He Soto parish to the New Orleans Bulletin, dated ,august 30, says: "to my knowledge, crops in this vicinity are reduced from 1,200 to 550 and even 500 pounds per acre, owing to the plant shedding the balls; and it is too late in the season now for new growth to mature and yield. The product of cotton in the three parishes of He Soto, Natchitoches, and Had do, taken collectively, are cut short nearly one half, "the Baton Gouge Advertise r, of September 11, says: "the cater pillar is doing immense destruction on the cotton plantations in this parish. Wherever the crop is late, the balls being tender, and new 'forms' constantly emerging, the yield will be more than one half less than the anticipated crop. This is the opinion of a highly respectable planter, with whom we have had conversation on the subject" The army worm his destructive insect to the hopes of the planter has made its appearance in terrible quantities throughout the State. A gentleman, just from the ' Opelousas counties' informs us that the cater pillar has made its appearance in that region three weeks since. Within the past six days, it has passed over the broad fields of Concordia, leaving them as if a whitening frost had blasted them. One third of the crop, at least, in this region has been destroyed; how much more, time will determine. With the overflow, and now the army worm, the planter has but a slender prospect of being regenerated for his laborConcordia I ntelligencerWe learn from a gentleman, just from Millikens End, A, that the cater pillar, or army worm, is making great havoc with the cotton crop in that section.

The crops and the season he continue (says the New Orleans Bulletin) to receive the most discouraging accounts from the Red river district, particularly the large parishes of Natchitoches and Rapides. The cater pillar, we are assured, has committed un exampled devastation in many parts of those parishes and in Avoyelles. It prevails also on Black river and the Washita, though to what extent we have not heard. From other parts of the State, we have the following intelligence, through the papers of the interior The Concordia I intelligence r says, that " the cater pillar, or army worm, is more than usually destructive in the parishes of Rapides, Catahoula, andConcordiaThe New Orleans Bulletin says: "he spoke yesterday of the ravages committed by the cater pillar in the Red river parishes.

Had news, but true Such is the substance of the intelligence which, from time to time, appeared, respecting the cotton crop of Louisiana. The crop of Arkansas, notwithstanding the unusual floods, will, it is believed, be "equal to that of the former year perhaps a little above. The uplands yielded abundantly, and there was an increased quantity of land cultivated." In the earlier part of the season we find the following statement: " Drops in Arkansasthe An Buren I intelligence r of the 3 1st ultsaysThe corn crops in Washington, Crawford, and Franklin counties, (Ark will be very short.

It is dated Watched, May 4th, 1844" Unquestionably, and beyond the shadow of a doubt, the prospect of the crop now planted has not been as un promising for the last 25 years. We have had the longest and severe st drought ever known at this season, causing a complete check in vegetation. There is nothing in the fields for the insects to feed upon ; and, consequently, the cotton is cut down by worms, cater pillars, and grasshoppers, as soon as it makes its appearance through the surface. Thousands and tens of thousands of acres are now being ploughed up, and planted over; and the demand for cotton seed is so great, that             $1 per bushel has been paid for large quantities: We plant about 2 bushels to the acres. 0.

I have had to re plant cottontwiceWVicksburg, June 28, 1844..-From a re examination of the overflow thus far up the river, and from all Can hear, I now believe my former estimate of loss to the growing cotton crop, by reason of this extraordiaryinundation, was too low. It would appear, from the best information I e an obtain .that the damage will not be less than two hundred thousand bales. The crop on the high lands looks well, but is backward, and stands rather that on the soil. Should any casualty attend the crop on high ground, the aggregate :r op of the year will be a very short one. The' plant ;on :the high land is subjected to the ravages of an insect called the army worm a species of cater pillar, which produces a butterfly late in the summer. They u usually attack cotton plants 4 in July and August, when they begin to produce young balls, which they ring and cut off, as also all the tender shoots and leaves. They have been known to destroy who leo fields of cotton in a single night. To remedy or protection against this destroying blight has as yet been discovered. Their ravages are principally confined to the crops on the high lands. There is another species of s mail later pillar, that often attacks the plant while very young, cutting off the tender still close to the ground. This insect works early in the spring. Later in the summer, it is changed into a pretty moth such as often lights about dwellings. The ravages of this insect are less than. those produced by' the army worm. At present, the cotton crop is beyond their reach. The weather continues excessively hot Cotton crop The Watched Free Trader says: ' We learn from planters, cultivating the hill land of some portions of this country, that the warm has become very destructive, eating up and destroying whole fields of the growing or ripe king crop" From a correspondent who resides in the interior of the State, we also learn: ' The present year has not been favorable for culture in this regiomSome had no rain; others, enough; others, again, too much From a letter dated June 18, in Razor county, we are. informed: , Our crop in this valley is unusually fine for the season, and fully three weeks more forward than the last. Picking will commence about the first week in August. To rain from the last of March to the last of May. Too dry[ 75 118 to get a rise of cotton, which of course affected stands. This, with a very heavy rain, then a long dry spell, has caused really a shorter crop than usual, though our very excellent fall and early opening has allowed us to save all we have made. As a specimen, one field that I have finished this year has yielded me this year 911 pounds against 1,136 last year. Nothing but an extra late frost gave me over 600 or 700 pounds. The improvement in culture has aided somewhat, but the fall has done all, which no man could have anticipated after one frost in September, which was very remarkable. I make my estimates from my own personal measurements and weight, and can assure you that, up to October 1, I never had a worse per acre prospect n another section, we learn that " the cotton crop is about the same in quantity, and much better in quality, than in 1843."And, again, in another part of the State: " Cotton far better in quality, and about the same in quantity n still another, we are told that the cotton crop was " more than an average one, exceeding any crop for the last five years from 100,000 to 200 000 bales is the deficiency of the crop for 1843 may perhaps have been estimated too high, we are inclined to believe that the crop of 1844 may have yielded from 15 to 20 per cent. more than that of the previous year. One of our correspondents estimates the crop at 450,000 bales, which is not far from the one we have given. The crop in Tennessee, if we were to judge from the following extract, promised well. The American Eagle, published at Memphis, Tennessee, says: "The prospects of the cotton planter being munificently rewarded for his labor by an abundant crop were never more encouraging in this region. The plant is very forward, and the balls are already beginning to open. It is the general expressed opinion, that we are to have the heaviest crop ever gathered, provided the present prospects are not lighted of which, to any considerable extent, there is but little danger But, as it would appear, in the Tennessee valley the expectation was not fully met. Thus it is stated : " The average, through the valley, will be from 550 to 600 pounds seed cotton to the acre 200 pounds less than the average for this valley. It began to open 20th of July, and we began to pick 10th of August. It will be gathered early, and will be a beautiful article, worth two cents per pound more than the last crop to the manufacturer; for it will be dry, sound, and clean, and will make more and better thread' In the whole, we think there was an increase of from 15 to 20 per cent. Of the crop of Florida, (to judge from the extracts which follow) there must have been an increase of at least 20 to 25 per cent. over the crop of 1843." The cotton crop, cater pillars, ache Tallahassee Floridian, of the 3 1st ulm, says: The cotton crop promised well until the appearance of the cater pillar, the first of the month. At all events, we are informed that the cotton crop will be a third more than last year; hut, at the present low prices, the planter would much rather double it Cotton in Florida" The Tallahassee Sentinel, of the 10th instant, says that an abundant yield of cotton is expected throughout that district 119 [75 and that, in the absence of any un toward blight, planters will make as much or more than they g an gather t will thus be seen that. the crop of 1844 is much larger than that of 1843. The low price of other articles, and the rise of cotton in the9earlyspring, prompted to greater cultivation; and we believe that, taking into view the amount of stock on hand, the crop this year has been an over production. The whole crop for the United States is estimated at 872,107,000 pounds. The cause of rust in cotton is ascribed mainly (by Mr. Puff in, in his agricultural survey) to the depredations of myriads of very minute insects to which the green cotton plant furnishes their best, if not their peculiar food. He adds, that though other causes may aid these insects as weather, &c yet "it may be presumed that they would not be present, or be very few in number, if the preceding crop had not been cotton, but some other crop, on which these insects could not live General Hamilton, in an address before an agricultural society, remarks, on the culture of cotton : That the rows ought invariably to run north and south; that not only the least amount of shade should be cast upon the plant, but that, as our winds prevail in the summer months, the highest amount of atmospheric al nourishment may be given to the plant." He adds: "I believe, moreover, after the full moon in July, the perpendicular stem of all cotton over 41 feet high should be topped; and two or three of the long lateral branches on the full moon in August. I am satisfied that in rank and wet seasons we should make at least one third more to the acre by adopting this process He refers in support of this view to the principles laid down by Lie big, and also approves highly of Dr. Clouds theory, as resting on the true philosophy of the plant. In a communication from Dr. Loud on the subject of his method, he says to us: "by experiments in improving the culture of the cotton plant are rapidly gaining ground among planters; and I think I have reduced it to a positive demonstration, that cotton may be grown on the improved plan of manure and checks, and be sold in the market by the planter at 3 cents per pound, at least more profit ably than it can" be grown and sold on the ordinary plan of the country at 6 to 8 cents per pound The subject of preparing cotton for the market is one which at the present time deserves the serious attention of the planter. While the over production is so great, and the price so low, his success must depend much upon the superiority of his cotton; and, of course, that which, other things being equal, is best prepared, will find the read i est sale and command the best price. In this subject we sub join the following suggestions from an experienced person, which we take from the Southern Cultivator, published in Georgia. He says: "I take all the care I possibly can in picking it out of the field, endeavoring to keep up with the opening as near as possible, taking all the pains I can to pick it clear of trash; I then dry it thoroughly on a scaffold, keeping one hand picking it over while the cotton is drying then pack it away cleanly in bulk, suffering it to remain until it becomes heated. My finest cotton last year remained in bulk about two months this year I think of letting it remain three months in bulk. After it has remained long enough for the oil to be drawn from the seed into the staple, to give it that beautiful cream color so much admired, I then commence ginning. I gin it very slowly on a fine saw gin, picking it over again as it is gin ned, so as to get out any remaining trash that may be in it. I have 75] 120 a blue that is fixed to the gin, through which the cotton passes after leaving the brush. The blue is eight feet long, and so constructed as to let all the dirt and trash drop in a box below, as the cotton passes over the fingers of the 4 blue; the cotton passes from the blue into the cotton room. I never suffer miUchto be packed in the room before putting it in bales. This is done With the greatest care. I press it down with a screw, instead of treading it with feet, as every pressure de faces the cotton to some extent. My bales weigh ab but 480 pounds. I sew up my packages very nicely, and put up i my cddttn- in the best of baggingNbw, I request the farmers, before they condemn my plan as too tedious, to ri take the trial, and they will find it a money making business. I would he were state, that I make three qualities of cotton. My first and second qualities plainly put my name on, and the place of my residence ; the third quality "I put the letter M on The increasing amount of the cotton crop from year to year, which finds no .market to keep pace with the production, begins justly to excite seriousapprehinsions as to the result. In the public journals and agricultural papers 6fthecottongrowing States, we find frequent communications pointnitg1, the necessity of curtailing /the cotton crop, cultivating a sufficiencyofprovisibnhs on their own lands, and manufacturing at home the articlesvwsiitte purchased 'from other States.

Add this to the larger crop of 1844, and the remaining stocked ve~ allowing considerable for increased consumption) will be advanced sothtevenltially the amount left of one year may almost supply the d ;and of the year abroad. The duty has been taken off from cotton in Austriabutthis :il not produce any great change, as the amount taken will not probably reach to 50,000 bales. A correspondent in Mississippi makes thef6hlliingTremarks on this subject: "migration must soon cease to this tt, ab i bringing negroes here expires by the limitation of our Constitutionrwe have an immense territory not yet settled; much of it is choicelahidfoco6tt0n, which will be a dead capital to our speculators, who invested t th6ircid127) borrowed bank paper; who: will, by eloquent appeals to my countrymen i, endeavor to prove that the Constitution should be amended, so astogittie' up our fertile lands; but this will not take( Of e may therefore hope that some check will be given to the production p o otis on, it having already reached to a fearful amount.

Will it then sell ?a' He adds, that the price of slaves there is higher :now than in the hard times; and that a trader in Vicksburg, having a a number of negroes, could not sell one in i twenty days, as sugarptlitersondly were buying or inquiring, As to the demand for cotton, a writer in Hunts Magazine for December last says: "the increase in our consumption has been pretty regular." Replaces it for the winter at 347,000 bales, which is an increase of 5.5 per ce at 121 [a[ 75 7 a year. " If this ratio be allowed" he says, this will give 370,000 bales as the consumption of the American man factories for 1845."The French consumption he estimates at 420,000 bales, and he allows the other demands on the continent to be 180,000 bales. He allows the English consumption to be 1,480,000 bales; and, with the data he has taken, he thinks there will be an excess of supply for a year of 300 000 bales i which, added to the stock on hand, will constitute a large amount. The stock on hand at Liverpool, September 13, 1844, was 921,000 bales. The receipts from other sources, besides the United States, are becoming larger, and leaving a proportionate increase every year in appendix No. 12 will be found some extracts from a late English paper, which present what is probably as fair a view as could be taken of the aspect of this crop in its relation to the European market at the close of 1844. The following account of sales, imports, &c, to November 29, 1844,istaken from the European Times, and furnishes suitable data fort estimating the yet further prospect of this most important crop122rl ~0 C o C~ o 10 o 00 i~ rrtf9lricocoe Micofacihehicofo4 0 -*S^ ll ^a^ ^O. 3 In B- -a^ r 10 ^a^ 4HCO Of' 44) c< Scococo ioCaiqN to* -qjclc ~rich t pelt _q j catch C Nxz I Q 0) I J, C <a?

The experiments in I india are not yet abandoned. The following, )relating to this subject, is taken from the Southern' Cultivator, a paper published in one of the largest cotton growing States, at Augusta, Georgia :a: " Growth of American cotton: in I n diam n regard to the culture of American cotton in Bengal, it must be admitted that, although tie experiments have been numerous, and, in some instances, on an extendediscalethe whole have hitherto been conducted by amateurs, many of whom, having satisfied a temporary wish: to try the culture, have abandoned it, whether successful or otherwise ; so that it is almost impossible to form a decided opinion as to how far the cultivation would answer in ai commercial point of view. Of late, however, there appears to be a desire, on the part of the Government of Vert gal to take up the culture, as, ended in the appointment last year of a gentleman the has had considerable' experience in America, for the express purpose of reporting, after a careful investigation, on the capabilities of the climate and soil of Sac ca, and the surrounding districts, for the introduction of the foreign t staple. We alluded to this circumstance on a former occasion; and we now learn, from the reports which the i deputy governor has considerately placed at the disposal of the agricultural society, and which were submitted at its last n meeting, that, during the last eight months, Or. Price has been engaged in travelling over various parts of Sac ca, Furreedpdre; Nipper a, and Hullo ah, situated on theDultussary, On ni, Began, Burrapootra, Lucia, and other rivers in that tract of country; and has seen many spots on which the foreign cotton could be cultivated to advantage, more particularly on the islands situatedonithe Not tea and Our deep, as also on other small islands situated on theH10ttea river, in consequence of their .continuity to the sea. Some of ihisexI erimentShavecid127eeen successful, while i others have failed; bucid127t in no instance does hi appear to have received k fresh seed in time to sow at theprEpr season; so, on this very essential point, he may be said to have (cid127abored under a great disadvantage, besides experiencing other minor difficulties incidental to nearly all first attempts at a new culture. Notwithstanding these natural obstacles, he seems to have seen enough to itiluce him to hold out sanguine hopes that, if advantage can i be taken of the proper season, :he will be able to cultivate the plant to advantage in the Sac a. district. In consequence of this favorable -opinion, we understand that Government have it in contemplation to commence: the work in earnest, by the appropriation of such tracts in the district as, from previous examination, may be .considered most fitting for the cultivation of American cotton, and combine therewith a matter of even still greater importance namely, the increased cultivation and improvement of the indigenous staple Calcutta Star 125 [a[ 75 ]and again: " Cotton in I ndiaThe following item of news, received by the late arrivals from England, will be interesting to some of our readers : "the report of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, contained, in the india newspapers, shows that the experiments in growing cotton have been, on the whole, successful specimen of Our ma cotton was pronounced to be a very fine, soft, long, strong, and clear colored staple, which would compete with the very best American short staple cotton, could it be produced in sufficient quantity The statement below is one which deserves most serious consideration: " Last I india cotton t appears by the latest advices from Liverpool, that, notwithstanding the large amount of cotton sent from I india to China, the importations into Great Britain during the past year, from that quarter, have been larger than ever before. It also appears that Last I india cotton has been so much improved in quality, that it now competes even with Mobile and New Orleans cotton; the best of the former selling as high ass 3d. per pound, while the lowest of Mobile brought 2 3d, and New Orleans 3d. Besides this, while the imports of Last I india cotton have increased, during the year, to the amount of 62,757 bales, those of American cotton have decreased to the amount of 272,983. Decrease of American cotton, twenty per cent. I increase of Last I india, forty-three per cent The -valuable qualities of cotton in their relative order" (says Mr. Tea brook, in his treatise on the subject) "are strength, firmness, length, even ness, and freedom from knots and entanglements." He says: " The recognised .distinctions on the continent of Europe are as follows 1. The North American 2. The West I indian 3. The South American 4. The Last I indian 5. The Levantine6. The African 7. The I italian 8. The Spanish." The relative value of the above cottons is as follow Sea I s land. Bourbon. Egyptian. Bahiand Pernambuco. Motril, from the kingdom ofGranada.

Murat. Bengal[ 75 ]126 The application of cotton for a variety of articles has been suggested as a mode of increasing the consumption of the article. Perhaps none of these is more important than that which is contained in the following, which we take from the American Farmer, which, as it will be seen, credits it to theCultivatorThe whole of the paper in the Southron will be found in appendix To 12." We find the following in the Albany Cultivator : Cotton beds are becoming very much in use on steamboats on the Western rivers, and a reconsidered superior to any kind but hair" Cotton beds he have received, from J. A. Guernsey, Esq, a copy of the ' Southron' published at Jackson, Mississippi, containing some remarks on the advantages of cotton for bedding. These advantages maybe summed up as follows: "I t is claimed that it is the cheapest, most comfortable, and most healthy material for bedding that is known in the civilized world. In addition to these, may be named superior cleanliness; ver min will not abide it; there is no grease in it, as in hair or wool; it does not get stale, and acquire an unpleasant odor, as feathers do; moths do not infect it, as they do wool it does not pack and become hard, as moss does; nor does it become dry, brittle, and dusty, as do straw and husks ; and in may cases it is medicinal. It is said not to cause that lassitude and inertia which is produced by sleeping on feathers. People not acquainted with it have supposed that they have been sleeping on the best feathers, when in fact their beds were made of cotton." The relative cost of cotton compared with feathers, hair, &c, may be seen from the following statement most of a hair mattress They are generally sold by the pound, and cost from 50 to 75 cents per pound. Thirty or forty pounds will cost                $15 or           $20. Woolthirty pounds of wool, at 30 cents per pound,  $9; twelve yards of ticking, at 124 cents per yard,             $1.50; labor, thread, &c,       $2.75. Total,              $13.25. Feathersforty pounds of feathers, at 30 cents per pound,                 $12; fifteen yards of ticking, at 121 cents per yard,             $1.87. ; labor, &c,       $2.75. Total,               $16.62". Cottonthirty pounds of cotton, at 8 cents per pound,     $3.40; twelve yards of ticking, at 12- cents per yard,             $1.50; labor, thread, &c,       $2.75. Total,  $7.65. It is recommended to run the cotton through a "picked" where one can conveniently be obtained, before using. This gives it additional cleanliness and buoyant y. The substitution of cotton for bedding, throughout the United States, would be an immense saving, besides opening a new avenue for that article to an extent, according to the estimation of this writer, equal "to more than two of the largest crops of cotton ever produced in the United Statesother suggestions are made, like another article, also from a Southern journal: "the following admirable hints we find addressed to the farmers of South Carolina by a correspondent in the Southern Agriculturists. We wish that they might reach and be heeded by all; for it is certain that the stock of cotton on hand in Europe is fearful y accumulation g, and that so long as this process is going on, it must continue to fall. There is no escaping this dilemma; and the sooner our Southern brethren look127S75 ]this matter in the face, and provide for it by a change of system, the better it will be for them. We hope they will take these observations kindly, for they are kindly meantCThere is a partial, if not complete, remedy for this evil, which I take the liberty of suggesting through your pages. Met every cotton planter make it a rule, and adhere strictly to it, to make no more cotton than he can make clear of his plantation expenses ; that is, let him pay all his plantation expenses by other crops, and make only so much cotton as will support his family, pay his debts, and add to his property. Any planters, I dare say, will answer, that they would be glad to make enough cotton to pay their debts and support their families. This may be true as to some but, in general, it would be more per t than true. Even those who are hardest run, purchase corn, salt, negro clothes, &c, with 'cotton' money. I doubt if there is any planter who could not produce enough for market, besides cotton, to pay for all these things and all plantation expenses. Some are so situated that they could sell corn alone sufficient for the purpose. Met them increase their corn crop, then, to that amount, and diminish cotton. Others, again, if the corn could not be sold, might feed it to stock, and sell that. It will bear transportation; and there is a great deal of foreign beef and bacon sold in the cotton region. Heat and flour, in the middle and upper country, could be made to pay these contingencies. Vice will grow at the foot of the mountains, and command a good price and so will tobacco. Any could pay these expenses by cutting timber and making singles, states, &c. In short, there are few planters in the whole cotton region who might not, by a little diversion of labor, manage to make what cotton they do clear of the expense of production, and do so profit ably. Met each planter look around him, and see what his resources are. I do not invite him to make his own shoes, hats, blankets, clothes, salt, and iron. In most cases, others, who are in these lines, can make these things and bring them to his door cheaper than he can make them himself. But he can follow the business he understands, or at least is best prepared to carry on, and make something else besides cotton to pay for them. I know the folly of recommending any measure to planters requiring their combined action. I recommend this to each planter, for his own individual advantage, as well as for the sake of the whole. While it will diminish the aggregate crop, if it curtails but a bale, it will teach each man to be independent, to a certain extent, of cotton speculators, open his eyes to his own resources, and gradually prepare the way for that change of culture which is inevitable and at hand for all those who cannot make a heavy bale to the acre. And I would add, that every planter should, as speedily as possible, reduce his culture to such land only as will make a heavy bale per acre. If he has none such, let him 'make it' Manure will soon do it. But down the cotton, increase the corn and pea crops, pen hogs, cattle, and every thing else, on straw, much, weeds, &c, and he will soon have as much land that will raise him a bale to the acre as he wants, if he makes no more cotton than he makes 'clear" I preach no more than I practise. I am a middle aged planter, and have nearly always made my cotton crop clear. I have suffered my share in' the hard times, and have met, I think, more than my average of losses :yet I kept aboveboard, without any stringent economy, mainly because I have paid plantation expenses by selling corn, peas, oats, &c. My expenses have been as heavy as any planters of the same force, and my land 75 ]a] 128 probably as poor; yet I have kept up chiefly, I think, because I did not have to pay them in a lump at the end of the year out of my cotton, which would have left me so small a surplus that probably I should not have thought it worth taking care of. The balance would have been mere odds and ends, which few know how to make tell. I have made corn, &c Supply my odds and ends of cash, and appropriated them, as they came to hand, to pay current expenses; and when my cotton came in, I could do something with my little lump of clear money. Met me say, also, that, after next year, I shall not plant an acre but will (or, at least, ought to yield me 400 pounds of clean cotton not one; and not many trust, next year. Met my land, in its best natural condition, will not average half that much. What I adopt for my own good, and experience has proved to me is for the good of every planter, both individually and collectively, I recommend others to try Suggestions like these deserve to be pondered. There are various products which may be substituted, some of which will be more particularly considered further on. Among these are m adder, indigo, raising of sheep, of the alpacca, making of silk, &c. It is stated, in an agricultural address delivered in Mississippi, that Judge Cry, of Louisiana, who has for fifteen years been engaged in raising silk, says that he could produce silk on his plantation to the value; of several thousand dollars, without planting one stalk of cotton less, or interfering perceptibly with the cotton crop. Whether or not this is so, there can be no doubt that the silk culture is admirably adapted to the South, and that it might supply a fine outlet for unprofitable labor in the over production of cotton. The alarm is now so great, that conventions have been called in Mississippi and some of the other States, to take suitable measures to reduce the amount of cotton raised, as long as demand is comparatively less in proportion to the supply. The following resolution was adopted in the House of Representatives in Alabama, and referred to a select committeelofnine members' Resolved, That the increased production and diminished price of. the principal staple of this State admonish us of the propriety of seeking new sources for the employment of labor and the investment of capital; ,and that, as preparatory thereto, it be referred to a special committee, toi report as to the experience of providing, by bill, for an accurate and full geological survey of this Statethis measure will no doubt prove very beneficial, as it will tend d to, develop the resources of the State, Another benefit would be, the establish merit and steady support of an agricultural journal, which may bring within reach of the agricultural population those features of cultivation and kinds of products which are best adapted to their circumstances. The introduction of improvements and comforts will always keep pace with the knowledge on the subject which is obtained. By the investigations intothe nature of the soil, and the proper means of culture, the most excellent crops may be produced, and an article that will always find a ready marketcid127) at an advanced price. The attempt to discourage the production by mutual promises not to cultivate will scarcely be found more successful than, former ones have been. Jealousies and individual interests will more or less be, seen to clash with such a project; but the working up and applying :are of the article in various, forms on their own plantations, ,o icid12775the vicinity, with the distribution of a portion of their laboring force towards other objects, forms ,the surest remedy on which to rely. Dear bought experience, however late, will at last unite all the- planters in this conviction, and then a brighter day may dawn on the great: ottdngrowingStates. Their lands are rich, and means still further to enrich and improve them lie fully within their own reach. The variety of products which may minister to their own comfort as, food or clothing may readily be obtained from their soil and domestic industry, when once inventive geniis shall put still further into operation the physical strength and local advantages which invite them to convert their crops yet more' directly among themselves to the supply of all their necessities. Of  Of. In tracing the progress and result of the rice crop, we are mostly confined to a single State; for although this product is raised in, some oft .the other States, yet the very large proportion of the crop which is grown in Southcarolina is so great; comparatively, that the indications of it are to be traced from its appearance in this State. From all that we can learn respecting the rice crop of 1844, it is an unusually fine crop probably from z 0 to 25 per cent. better than in 1843. The following are a few of the notices which have been gathered from the public journals in Souithl carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, respecting the growth of this crop. : ,a." The crops in this neighborhood" says the Tiny ah (S. C.) Observer i; f the 6th July, t' look quite as well as usual, and the rice crop is more forward than we have known it. In the 28th multi mo we saw an ear of rice taken from a field of Mr. Reuben Pringle, on Black river. The field was planted on the 18th of March, and by today must be shooting out general y. The rice will be certainly ready for harvest by the second week inrAugust, which is unjustly eiarlyCharleston Patriot. The rice crop he saw a few heads of rice on Saturday last from a plantation adjacent to this city, which looked exceedingly well for the season, though perhaps not quite as forward as last year.

The season and the rice crop The Wvinyalh (georgetown) Observer, of the 14th July, says' From the 7th to 11th of the month we have had a succession of northeast i winds and rain, which suspended the harvest for the time, and kept the planters in- suspense as to a gale. In Wednesday the weather cleared up, and the harvest was again resumed, and is going on finely. ,from the Savannah Republican of July 25."The new rice cop- We saw a few heads of rice on Saturday last from a plantation adjacent to this city, which looked exceedingly well for the season, though perhaps not quite as forward as last year.

The upland crops in the neighborhood, which were planted early, and well worked in the early drought in June, will yield an average harvest also; but, from the back parts of this district, and many of the adjacent ones, accounts as to the corn and <a name="potato55"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops are unfavorable; so much so, that in some neighborhoods not half a crop will be made vice crop One or two planters on the river commenced cutting their rice on Saturday, and others on Monday last; though we are informed that the harvesting will not be general for a week to come. The prospect for a fair crop is good; and if the weather should prove favorable, we may expect a full average yield Savannah Republican' Vice harvest new rice he were in error on Friday, in our market report, in stating that many planters already had their entire crops down. It is true that all are progressing rapidly with their harvesting, but still they are not so far ahead as we supposed.

It has not been beat out yet, as the seller and the purchaser cannot agree upon a price for it Savannah Republican." The rice planters on Gape Dear are now busily engaged in cutting and getting in their crops. We are informed that the yield this year is fully an average one. There has been no storm during this month to damage the crops to any extent- Wilmington (N. C.) Chronicle. The crops in South Carolinathe Tiny ah (georgetown) Observer says: The late crop of rice, just harvested, and now in the course of manufacture for market, is about an average one, and of good quality Elsewhere we see it stated that the rice crop was earlier than it had been for twenty years, and extra good n an extract, which we sub join from a New Orleans paper, we have an indication that the attention of the planters of Louisiana and Mississippi is turning more towards this crop. The writer says: " Louisiana rice few days ago we received a beautiful sample of rice, raised eight miles back of Waterproof, in the parish of Tens as, in this State, and which we are told by good judges is equal in quality to the best South Carolina rice. We are glad to see that the planters of this and the adjoining State of Mississippi are turning their attention to the raising of other products besides cotton and sugar. There are plenty of cotton lands in this State which we have no doubt are admirably calculated for the growth of rice; and we doubt not our planters could easily raise sufficient for home consumption- New Orleans Trophic, October 5. The rice crop of Louisiana is said to have been a "full crop ;" and we have felt authorized to allow an increase of from 5 to 10 per cent. in others of the States where rice is raised. The whole crop, therefore, will amount to 111,759,000 pounds. Upland rice is cultivated to some extent in I illinois and other States north of the rice region. It is said, in the Cincinnati Slough boy, to grow in the most arid soil; is sown some time in April, and is ripe in September. The 131 [usual method as stated is, to sow it in drills about 18 inches apart; b i icid127the land is well prepared and clean, it maybe sown broadcast, and it of te yields from 25 to 30 bushels per acre. It would probably grow well in some of the Northern Atlantic States. By a careful analysis of rice and rice straw b by Professor Heard, the following result is said in his report to have been obtained: "Considering a single rice plant in its dry mature state to weigh 100 grains, (a supposition which will often accord with the fact) we shall have of mineral matter, in the different parts of the plants, the following number of grains n the stubble and root -360 Straw and leaves -a. Dusk -142tCotyledon and epidermis -117 Clean rice -a- -14 100. was, however, in filling, nearly one-sixth of the cotyledons stilladhereato the grain, for all practical estimates it will be nearer the truth to state the mineral ingredients of clean rice at 2 per cent. those of the whole crop and to diminish, therefore, the residue m of the cotyledons and epidermis by 000 per cent; making the per cent age statement to stand thus Stubble and root -a- -3608Straw and leaves -368sHusk -14. Cotyledons and epidermis -11 Clean rice (commercial) -01000He adds in a note : It may be useful to present also a per century view of the incombustible constituents of the rough rice :dusk -510Cotyledon and epidermis -418 Clean rice -71 t scarcely need be stated that the cotyledons and epidermis are found min coarse rice flour inter mingled largely with the dusk, and with from 8 toss per cent. of clean and powdered rice. The cotyledons and epidermis are richer than the clean rice in sac charing matter and glum ten, which materially augment the value of rice flour as a feed for cattle and swine. Thesezprinciples are thus returned to the soil under the most favorable conditions for agriculture He draws, then, this conclusion: " If the foregoing views are correct, i becomes plain, at a glance, that the planter who sells his crop in the condition of rough rice robs his lands of 27.84 per cent. of the mineral ingredient, of this species of produce; while, on the other hand, he who sells it as clean rice abstracts from them but 2 per cent. of these ingredient shut the true value of these constituents cannot be rightly estimated bcid127their numerical proportions; since the mineral ingredients of the cotyledons And epidermis consist of above 50 per cent. of the most precious saline substances; while in those of the stubble, root, and dusk, the like constituent e[ 75 ]a] 132 scarcely rise to 10 per cent, from the extreme slowness with which the dusk suffers conversion into hum us, unless fermented with stable litter. His portion of the rice plant appears to be almost wholly neglected by the planter; but, as it contains above 30 per cent. of carbon, it must be capable, when i incorporated with the soil, of performing, to a considerable extent, .the functions of the hum us i. e, of gradually giving rise to carbonic acid, from combining with the oxygen of the air, and of raising the temperature of the soil by its erernacausis, or slow combustion. Besides, its minutely dividedsilica is in a more favorable condition for absorption by the roots of plants, than that which is offered them by the soil itself. We may add to these supposed useful properties of the dusk, the mechanical service which, in certain stiff com posts, it is capable of exerting, by laying the ground open to the access of air, and as an absorbent of moisture. As it is unlike to the stalk and leaf, in not containing all ali, it might, perhaps, be found advantageous to add wood ashes along with it, to the soils on which it is applied The whole of Mr. Shepards report of his analysis is interesting, as showing the elements of the rice, and its straw, &c; and to those who cultivate this plant offers valuable suggestions for improvement in their practice. Of    Lkthe subject of silliettluree was so fully considered in the last report, that we have but little to add. Our particular information, also, respecting this crop for the year 1844, is comparatively limited. From all we can learn, however, there can be no doubt that the subject is gradually becoming one of deeper interest. During the past season, in October last, a convention of silk cult wrists, similar to the one held the previous year, has been held at New Work, which was well attended. Such information, we understand, was communicated, and placed in the hands of the secretary, the Rev. J. R. Harbour, of Massachusetts, for publication. We had hoped to receive this document in time for this report, that we might embody some of the results which it presents to the people, for their consideration, and may possibly be able to do so before it leaves the hands of the printer, in one of our appendixes. As it is, we must rely principally on such scattered notices as we have been able to find in the public journals, and such other information as we have otherwise gathered. From a notice of the silk convention, published in the Americanagriculturist for November, it is said, that." within two years there has been a vast increase in the manufacture of silk in this country an increase amounting, it is supposed, to some three or four fold. In the growing of silk there has been also a large advance an advance more difficult to estimate, as the returns are incomplete. We know enough, however, to be assured that the business has essentially surmounted the struggles of its infancy and its miserable nursing, and is now on its feet, and commanding the respect and confidence of intelligent men throughout the country." "almost all who, are now r engaged in growing silk are preparing to enlarge their operations, and many new riulberry orchards will be planted in the following spring t appears that in some parts of the country the for us multicaulis suffered considerable loss from the winter of 84 344. Thus the, Prairiefarnier states that some patches that. stood the hard winter of 1842cid12743perished during to he uncommonly mild one of 1843- '44." ,A- cortes 133 [a[ 75 ]pungent of that paper thinks that the multicaillis is not the best for pair te lands; and states that; of 15,000 of his trees, not over 1,000 survived the last winter. Further experience is said to confirm the results of open fee dig, which were published in " The Silk Question Settled" from which we quoted in the report of 1843. The Sort hampton association is said to have made, in his way, 150 pounds of reeled silk. Oh in Of  Mummers, ofManladim, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, has made the same quantity, also in the same way. Others, also, are said to have thoroughly tested the question, and to have become wholly satisfied that worms must have the pure a hi of heaven, except in very early or very late feeding. Others, too, had had good success in the ordinary way. This is stated to be the case with Miss Camp, who exhibited, at the fair of the American I institute, ri bands made f the ill of worms hatched of this years (1844) eggs, and fed on: ttulberries which grew from seed which ripened in the same year. Other specimens 'of raw silk, &c, were exhibited; and, altogether, the reward beautiful assortment of the products of silk culture and manufactures, evincing the growing interest which is taken in the subject. At the same time, Mynheed An Schaick, Esq, of New Work, made a donation of             $1,000 to the A' eric an I institute, to be expended in premiums to promote the silk cause. This will unquestionably have a happy influence in stimulating enterprise' and at the same time, many who may not obtain the prizes will find themselves was all rewarded in the increased profit accruingfrom their devotion to the subject. As an eviadenceo6f the superiority of this country for silk culture, &c General Tallmadge, president of the silk convention, observed, during the sittings, that when he was in I talk he noticed the eggs of the silk worm were always hatched by artificial means, on account of the moist ness of the climate; and that no care was there required to prevent them from watching. `were, however, owing to the dryness of our climate, the eggs must be put in ice houses and other cool places, to prevent them from watching before the leaves of the mulberry are ready for them. In I talk, the books tell how to take the eggs hat ch; in the United States, how to prevent them. From this, he thought it a clear inference that our country is most favorable 'for its prod action. Mr. Harbour laid stress on the fact, that the eggs used should be from healthy worms, and they should be kept in a uniform and 'healthy state. He recommends to put eggs into a tin box cases with lead, and place it in ice until the watching season commences. To extreme transitions of temperature should be allowed. From the icehiouset let them be taken to the cellar, and then to a gradual heat, so that they will be 8 or 10 days in watching. He declares that worms are much more liable to be injured from heat than from rain and dew. His plan is to keep the worms less exposed till after the second or third mounting, and then placed in tents; or he thinks it best to use artificial means at first, and then resort to open exposure. Some interesting facts with- relation to this subject will be found in the two letters of Doctor Stebbins, of Massachusetts, in appendix No. 13. One of these letters is taken from the American Agriculturists; the other accompanied. some specimens of paper, much resembling what is called China paper, made of the bark of the mulberry tree. Some of the facts are mentioned in both; but it was thought best, however, to publish both of them entire. The paper shows what may yet further be done in this thing. I that the soft, silk y feel, the external appearance, and peculiar smell, of the134aper which has been brought from China. The excellence of American silk has been well tested; and it is a fact that American silk is now soldier the name of foreign silk. A manufacturer writes that "the article of American silk is being produced to a considerable extent, but not equal to he consumption, by a large amount; but we believe, in a few years, with the protection we now have, we should be able to keep back the I talianTo show how much the business has increased in France within a few years, we quote the following paragraph from a good authority :a* Silk in Francevery little more than fifteen years have passed since here were in France only six departments in which there were extensive plantations of mulberry trees, for the general rearing of silk worms. Boa these may be added sixteen others in which this cultivation was carried Saw, but on a limited scale and in a precarious manner. Now, however, forty-two new departments have taken up this profitable employment of i time and capital; so that we have sixty-four out of eighty-six department soothed with mulberry trees, and producing silk in greater or less quanti dies. The present silk crop of France is said, on good authority, to beNwarth 160,000,000 of francs t is evident that the silk business holds out great inducements to the American people; and many years may not elapse before we may find it source of great profit to our country. If we recollect from how small, ginnings the cotton culture has risen to its present state, this will not seem at all incredible or surprising. A curious application of silken rags is stated in the following extract rome an agricultural journal late number of a French paper (the Quotidienne) states that, through he researches of the learned and much respected Professor Debzenne, the most useless portions of silk can now be transformed, through that gentle at 's chemical palingenesia, into new silk again, to serve for different a titles. In the same way that caoutchouc is drawn out into filaments, and eleven into a dura be material, so are these remnants of silk reduced to, l that is no more than its primitive state, (viz: a g luminous paste) by means, f a dis solvent; and, like fused glass, re acquires, oncoming into the air, all its original strength and tenacity. Having found the best dis solvent of the, saoutchouc, (the distillation of this elastic resin) Professor Debzenne wa sot deceived when he thought that he could also di still silk, which he found t be the true medium for its dissolution. The crude silk, and that which a is not dyed, was easily managed. The inventor at present has found no difficulty but with the dyed portions of silk, and more especially the black yes( but he hopes, by continuing his close attention to the subject, to, Trvrcome this difficulty, and to relieve France from the duty of 70,000,000,fanes which she pays to the foreigner for the means of alimenting her. Numerous silk establishments. We may certainly look upon the invention as one of the most valuable of the present century The estimated crop of silk for 1844 is 396,790 pounds of cochons. Sugar. Compared with the previous year, the sugar crop of Louisiana has be enlarge advance on the crop of 1843. Though confined to but a single State, it is not always easy to ascertain in sufficient season the amount of thee drop, so as to avoid the error of wrongly estimating. The crop was put a that was supposed to be a fair conclusion, from the various accounts which 135 [a[ 75 ]reached us; but the season proved more propitious than was anticipated, and the amount received was larger than had been estimated, and even exceeded the most sanguine hopes. Our estimate was consequently quite too low. We have made a corrected estimate by the returns of that year as actually known, the basis of the present estimate in the table for 1844;so that it is consequently much larger than the mere per cent age itself of increase on the tabular estimate of 1843 would have required. Great injury is now stated to have been recently suffered by the frost, by which the crop will be lessened from 10,000 to 15,000 hogs heads. The various notices by which we may trace the progress of the crop, as we have been able to gather them from the public journals, are as follows. We regret that but one or two agricultural papers contain any mention of this crop, being most of them published at a remote distance from the sugar region." The coming sugar crop of Louisiana letter in the Courier, dated New Orleans, June 1st, says: 'the sugar crop is unusually small for the season; and if the Mississippi river dont stop rising very soon, it will doubtless reach and destroy many of the large sugar plantations. The crop just closed was 50,000 hogs heads short of the year previous. The Testis about 20,000 hogs heads short of the supply they took last year; they have been buying from hand to mouth, hoping to starve out the holders, but they have at last concluded to come in and take their supply' "the sugar crop in Louisianathe New Orleans Trophic, of a late date, says: 'he understand that the cane is in the most flourishing condition in all parts of the sugar districts. A friend of oh irs, who has lately returned from a tour in the adjacent parishes, informs us that he i as never seen the cane so abundant and so luxuriant. In the parish of Plaquemines, he has seen cane 16 feet high, and voluminous in the extreme. Mr. Peter Rapp, a well known planter there, has intimated his intention to commence rolling from the 3d to the 5th of the ensuing month' "again: The last Concordia I intelligence r says that it is admitted that the plantations on the Mississippi never looked more beautiful than at present. The sugar cane is, without precedent, good; and the crop expected this year is one third more than has ever been made in Louisiana. The cotton, also, looks well never saw sugar crops look finer than they do in Louisiana, on the Mississippi river. In many fields the cane is higher than a mans waist. If no casualty happens to it before maturity in the autumn, it will be the largest crop ever made in the Statewe find the following extract, also, in the Planters' Manner of August 3, 1844 : " The crops The cane, from all that we can learn, is unusually forward, in this parish quite too much so; for, owing to its size and the moisture of the land, the late heavy rains and high winds have prostrated it in many places. We would impress upon the minds of planters the importance of being prepared early for the rolling of the crop this season. Such better lose something by commencing early, than to risk the loss of half a crop by the frost n the same paper, of a later date, is a less flattering account." The sugar crop The last Planters' Manner, published in the town of Franklin, Louisiana, has some speculations on the present growing crop of sugar, from which we extract the following: "whatever the prospects may be in other sections of the State of an[ 75 1 136 abundant yield of sugar, they are not by any means flattering in this canegyowingregion. In this parish, the crop on the Lech, which is most important, is unusually poor, owing to the rains which prevailed throughout te, months of June and July, and interrupted cultivation 'the crop on the ,ay du Pale, Berwicks bay, and A you Cut, we understand; is good: (did 127) so ;is the crop in 'Lafourche.

Fortunately, they: began grinding this season very early, so that a larger i Portion than _s pull: of the crop has been secured; but still the loss is estimated at from 10,000to 15,000 hogs heads. Notwithstanding this, however, the crop will not be less than 150,00 hogs heads, and many estimate it at 180,000. : The price is very low; prim equality from 4 to 4- cents, and from that down to 3 cents, according to quality n the American Agriculturists for December, 1844, we have the following account of an improved method of making sugar by an hydraulic press, which is said to possess some important advantages improvements in sugar making ice; find in some of the late numbers of Simmonss Colonial Magazine, that a patent has been taken out for the application of hydraulic pressure in extracting the j ice, from the cane. Two passes, each capable o of bearing, a strain of. 1,400 tons, are worked altiernaitly by one set f pumps, which pumps may be workedSeithr by manual labor, by means of double ended le yer handles, or, where manual labor is scarce, by two mules, or a small steam engine of itwoShorse power. These presses are calculated to turn about 6,000 gallons of cane juice per day of ten hours, which is more that can be effected by a tyler mill, even i when driven by a steam engine of twelve or fourteen horse power." The. giant ages of this system of hydraulic pressure are stated to be 1. The juice in the cane (generally 18 per cent by weight of sac charing matter) can be wholly extracted; thereby saving about 8 parts now left in the meg ass. 2. The juice can be rapidly filtered when .cold, as discharged from the 'mill or hydraulic press, if by the latter it should be needful. 3. The tempering can be effected properly and uniformly. 4. The juice can be defect led promptly a sit runs from the mill, hydraulic press, or filter; thereby avoiding the detericid127ti effects produced by re mining in receivers. 5. The bean sing and .evaporating of the defeated liquor (rendered purer by previous operations) ca' l e effected in steam m pans, without discharging from one in it the other. 6. The elaborated sir up may be de colored and filtered through animal charcoal, which can be revivified on the estate. 7. The final concentration of h sir up can be more rapidly accomplished than by the present mode, in an open pan or trench, at the low temperature of 170 to 1800 Fahrianheit, r at about ,80 to of below the usual temperature of the strike when boiled the common method. 8. The concentrated mass can be r op early crystallized and effectually cured, and the pott if g 'avoided, by the use of vessels into which the strikes are discharged consecutively; and the sugar so cured will not drain during the voyage 9. The molasses can be converted into sugar nearly equal to that of the first production; and sugar can also be made of as good quality, in all respects, _a_ as muscovy do (and by this peculiar method only) from the molasses that drains from the sugar of the second quality. 10. The meg ass maybe used for manure, if the various operations are performed by the agency of steam. 11. The machinery, apparatus, &c, are simple in their construction and management, and much less costly than others it appendix No. 14 will also be found a letter from Mr. Rielleux, of New Orleans, respecting his method of manufacturing sugar, to which allusion was made in a previous report. Table sugar still continues to be manufactured in large quantities in many of the States; and the probability is, that it forms a considerable[ 75 ]138 portion of the supply in many towns in the States where it is usually made. It is said that not less than 10,000 tons are annually sold in the city of Newyork. The season, on the whole, was a more favorable one for the manufacture of this article in 1844 than in the year 1843 ; and, in some of the States, a large increase is noted. In Vermont, which stands foremost among the New England States with respect to the manufacture of sugar, there is some diversity of opinion. In the county of Crittenden, it is said that "the product of map le sugar will not exceed one half of the usual quantity, owing altogether to the unfavorable season for the manufacture of the article? It should be recollected, however, that there was a falling off, in the year 1843, of not less than 50 per cent; so that the crop of 1844 was, no doubt, in advance of that year. The whole quantity reported for that county is 88,500pounds; for Grand I s le, 3,600 pounds. In the other counties there was, it is thought, an increase of 50 per cent. over the crop of 1843, and 10 percent. over that of 1842. From some of the lower counties our information is, that it is about an average quantity, being four times what was made in 1843, and equal to 1842. From all that we can gather, considering the great falling off the last year, the sugar crop of 1844, in Vermont, was at least 75 per cent. more than that of the year 1843. New Hampshire also raises a large quantity of sugar, and this is said to be yearly increasing in quantity, and much improving in quality. The year 1843 was a very poor year; and it fell off so much that an equal advance now, as well as in Vermont, should be allowed. We have already stated, at an earlier place in this report, that the figure de noting millions in this crop in New Hampshire, was somehow dropped in 1841, and has been continued so till this time. Now the mistake occurred, we have no means of knowing now ; but it has been corrected in our table for 1844. We suppose the season has been equally favorable in the other New England States. In New York a similar increase must be made, as it is variously estimated, in the notices we have gathered, at from 30 to 100 per cent. increase. In Pennsylvania the crop is thought, for the most part, to have been a large advance on the crop of 1843, which suffered very greatly from the depth of snow, which prevented the manufacture. From the Western States, with the exception of Ohio, the report respecting the sugar crop for 1844 is quite favorable, and ranges from 25 to 30 per cent. increase. In Michigan it reaches as high as 75 to 100 per cent. One young man in Went county, it is stated, made not less than 700 pounds from 100 trees. Some interesting statements respecting the manufacture of map le sugar will be found in appendix No. 15.:Corn-stalk sugar he have received a number of communications relating to this subject. A successful experiment on the manufacture of this article was made by Mr. John Real, of New Harmony, I n diana, who obtained above 300 pounds from the quantity of stalk used which was about at the rate of 500 pounds to the acre. Some communications on this subject may be found in appendix No. 16. In the same appendix, also, are added some other papers relating to the subject. The letter of Dr. Jackson, and one addressed to him r are important, showing that crystallizationcan be effected. It is believed that the results already obtained warrant the conclusion that, as attention is more and mere devoted to it, the apparent difficulties 139 [a[ 75 ]will all be obviated, and the article will yet be manufactured in large quantities. It is now said, also, that sugar can be manufactured in great amount from <a name="potatoes87"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The statement in an English journal is, that three tons of the raw material will make one ton of <a name="potato56"><mark>potato</mark></a> sugar. An account of the process will be found extracted from Dr. Tres Dictionary, in appendix No. 17. By the following extract, it appears that water melons have been turned to good account in the production of sirupSSugar from watermelonsUriah Johnston, a citizen of Carolina, says he has extracted from water melons a sir up equal to molasses, which would produce sugar of good quality. The sir up is obtained by boiling the juice three hours in a common iron pot-eight gallons making one gallon of excellent sir up. He thinks one acre of common sand hill land would produce water melons enough to make 200 gallons of sir up equal to the best molasses. The refuse of the melons makes capital food for hogs; and so nothing is lost his might be quite valuable in some sections of our country where this fruit is raised in large quantities; still it does not promise to be of very extensive use. We give a statement here of the amount of be et sugar made in France for a year. It will be recollected that the manufacture of sugar from the be et is of comparatively recent date; and this shows what may be expected, should the facts on the subject of the corn stalk be fully sustained: "the manufacture of be et root sugar in France, for the year ending July 4, 1844, was 28 millions of kilograms, (325 man factories) aid the duties levied amounted to nearly five millions of francs The whole amount of sugar produced in the United States in 1844, both from the cane and map le, is 201,107,000 pounds. Other Products For Culti Vati Of. Line is so little made an object by the culture of the grape, that it is almost impossible to form any estimates respecting this crop; and therefore it has been omitted altogether in the columns of the tabular estimate. The culture of the grape for the table is increasing, and promises to be a source not merely of pleasant luxury, but, in many parts of our country, of very considerable profit. In a review of the crops for 1844, it appears, that notwithstanding there has been a lessening in some important ones, still there is a sufficiency for man and beast; and, our country may yet afford a surplus for foreign markets.  We shall next avert to certain productions of the soil, and connected with agriculture, which furnish inducements to some of our citizens to direct to their cultivation a portion of their enterprise. In the last report some mention was made of m adder, as offering inducements to some of th agriculturists, in sections of our country to embark in the enterprise of its cultivation. It is believed, that the more the attention is turned to it, the more feasible the project will be regarded. There is a very considerable demand for it abroad. The prices for m adder, according to a late price current in Liverpool, ranged from 3 to 4 perch t; and for m adder roots, from 4 8s. to 4 10s. There are some parts[ 75 ]140 of the country to which this product is well adapted. In a late number of the Southwestern Farmer, we find a communication, said to be from a gentleman of respectability, who speaks of having met; in New Orleans, a German who had come to this country with the express purpose of raising m adder, and urging some one to enter upon the experiment. The statement is therefore made, from this experienced individual, that in any part of Mississippi 3,000 pounds per acre of dried m adder, or m adder fully prepared for the market, could be produced. This, at 15 cents per pound the minimum rate in New York or Boston) would produce    $450, in three years, to the acre, arid   $4,500 for 10 acres. In appendix No. 18 we have a full account; of the mode of cultivation, the kind of soil adapted to it, and such other remarks as may be useful, taken from an agricultural journal. In Surgery Manual of Agriculture, we find it stated that, according to the experiments made by Messrs. On For o, at Victringen, in Carinthia, during the years 1835 and 1836, the common opinion, that one years roots will not color so lasting or dark colored a red, is not correct. In Avignon, the roots are suffered to remain in the ground two years; in Poland, England, and the Last, three. He also mentions that, in France, ladder is sometimes cultivated for 12 to 15 years, successively, in the same field. In the Transactions of the Agricultural Society of Carinthia for 1834, 1835, and 1836, Messrs. On For o have given an account of their mode of future of m adder, which, Larger says, deserves the attention of allcultivators of the article. We translate here a few sentences of Burgersdescription of the same: "they take up the roots every year, at the end of April or the beginning of May; because, in this experiment, though they obtained less -weight of root at a time than by two years, yet, in the two successive yearly gatherings1tthey secured more. In He its Husbandry, also, another German work, we find it stated that the cultivation of m adder is best conducted in a moist, warm climate, and those regions where flax and hemp are most successful; the soil should be moist, loose, and a strong loam. He recommends that, in the first year, while the plants are small, the wide spaces -between be used for the culture :of low: beans, and other vegetables which, do not grow to any great height, a nd so will not impede the growth of the m adder. The ,report of M. He Aspirin, to the French Academy of Sciences, on this .product, is, said to have effected quite a revolution in its successful culture. We sub join, also, in appendix No. 18, some extracts from this document, published in a circular of J. M. Thorburn & To, of New Work, who say they have a large quantity of choice seed. M. He Gasparinsobservations apply better to France, where labor is low, than to our own country. Still, it is useful. Some m adder seed will form part of the <a name="seeds9"><mark>seeds</mark></a> to be distributed this season from the Patent Office. Another product, which deserves more attention than has yet be r given to it, is mustard. The demand for mustard seed is large, and the price it command  is is sufficient to regenerate the expense and labor of raising it. He have endeavored to obtain some estimate of the quantity imported but there are no returns of the same in the reports of the Treasury Department: An informant, however, furnishes us with the following contusions. He says that the amount used is probably as much as there is of Yuma tra pepper, especially when the fact is taken into consideration, that mustard is used for the sick, also, in the form of sinapisms and baths 141 [75 He allows, however, that, for the table, there is only one pound of n^ ;hard -for two pounds of pepper; and then the amount is quite large. Mustard seed is now principally imported from England and Old anidRecently, some lots have come from the south Pacific, in whale ships; but, from the samples, it is said that this article is not good in its quality. Tiheenglish manufacturers have recently been supplied, to some extent with seed from Calcutta. A manufacturing house in this country, from who ire have principally derived our information, tell us that they have seen but two. lots of Calcutta mustard seed, both of which were injured by being shipped too green, and heated in the voyage. From a late price current, it appears that white& mustard seed is most in demand, and corn hands the best price abroad. This, it is stated, has not been the case for a numiberdofyears before. The market, it is believed, will bear a very considerable hi crease of production, and yet the raising of the article prove profitablroI t is also stated, that if the manufacturers could rely on a supply of the seed even if it were one cent per pound, or fifty cents per bushel over th.'cost of importation no orders for foreign seed would be sent out. Theamerican seed is thought to be so much superior to the English, that it is believed, were it once tried, it would be preferred even abroad; and the opinion is expressed, that the demand would rather exceed the production than the contrary. In appendix No. 19 may be found some further in for, nation respecting this product, mode of culture, &c, taken from the Farmers' Cyclopedia. We have likewise sub joined in the same appendix from the Farmerscabinet and Ohio Cultivator, accounts, of a crop of brown mustard raised by J. H. Parmelee, of Ohio; which shows that, if properly cultivated, it may prove profitable. A further letter of M messrs. Well & Brother, of Philadelphia may also be found in appendix No. 19. These gentlemen, from their, situation as manufacturers in a large city, are well qualified to judge correctly on this subject. A crop to which the attention of portions of the Southern country may yet be profit ably directed, (as it formerly was) from the overprodAutioitof cotton, is indigo. This article commands a good price in the market, and considerable quantities are imported every year, to supply the consumption of this country. Formerly, it was an article of export ;and but for the increased attention to cotton, it is probable the quantity now' raised might be large. In order, to aid in the object, should the attention of any, whose lands and climate are well adapted to it culture, be turned to its cultivation, we have sub joined f, in appendix No. 20, some extracts: respecting this product, from the Farmers' Cyclopedia. It is said that our common garden our slain will also furnish a good dy which; may answer the same purpose as indigo. As this plant about is in many sections of our country, it may be useful to add here the' reeipawhich we find for this purpose in some of our agricultural. papers, where it is said to have been furnished by Mr. L. Ellsworth, of Rapier ville, I illinois :take two bushels of persia in, (port lace a) known a- pursleyadd a, sufficient quantity of water to cover it when pressed down into the ketleiand boil until thoroughly cooked then strain off the liquor ; a lo: I o up pound of ground -log wood, boiled separately .dissolve oe q claret~ of a pound of alum- in a sufficient: quantity of water l to cover four -pp ou did of wool or cloth; then boil the wool or cloth in the alum n water two hours 75 ]a] 142 then add the our slain liquor and the log wood, and boil two hours more. When the article is first taken from the dye, it will have a purple hue; but will soon turn to a handsome blue on being exposed to the air. The quantity may be increased or diminished as required, observing the above proportionsSpurry is much thought of in many parts of Europe, and this product may deserve the attention of our agriculturists. We have already given an account of this article in the report of 1843; and will merely here repeat, from that description, the remark of On Her, the great Prussianagriculturist, that, in proportion to its bulk as hay, or cut green or in pasture, it is the most nourishing of all forage, and gives the best favored milk and butter. Some of the seed of this plant has been procured for distribution, and it is not improbable that this may be the means of introducing it into culture in this country. Lover is recommended in some of the agricultural papers as a product which, to a limited extent, will furnish a profitable crop when raised for seed. It is stated by one person, that, at four dollars a bushel, it will afford a better profit than any kind of grain. The mode of raising seed from the large kind suggested, is to pasture it till about the middle of June, then sow on some plaster, and now as soon as three-fourths of it is ripe. By thus mowing it early, more seed is said to be got from it than if it is left to, stand till it is fully ripe; because, in this latter case, a quarter of the seed is lost in gathering. For the small kind of c lover, it is recommended tom of it from the 20th to the ,24th of June, and then plaster immediately after the hay is off. The second growth will give good seed. 1 any farmers gather their c lover seed early, and sow the sod with wheat the same fall. This is considered in many cases a good fallow for wheat. In appendix No. 28, some account may be found of I italian rye grass, which might be useful in parts of our country. Billet would likewise do well in some soils. We insert here a short extract, from a good authority, relating to this product, as it may perhaps be useful to some: "june is a good time to sow mille t. It will do well sown any time in, the month. It makes, when well cured, excellent fodder. One of the general advantages of this crop is, that if the hay crop is likely to come in light, this may be grown as a substitute. Half a bushel of seed broadcast to the acre is a proper quantity, though only a peck is sometimes sown on rich ground. It may, if desired, be sown in drills; and if designed for seed, this is the best way. A common turn in drill will sow the seed well. It will yield bounty fully ; and the seed, when ground into meal, is excellent for fattening animals. Father light ground is best for it; it will, indeed, do well on land that is too light for grass. In 1841, Mr. G. Bones received a premium from the Tompkins County Agricultural Society, for having raised on two acres five and a half tons of mille t fodder, and sixty-three bushels of seed a It was new land, the wood and timber from which was taken off in the month of April, and twenty quarts of seed sown to the acre the 8th of June succeeding writer in one of our agricultural papers mentions coffee as a fruit that may deserve a trial in some of the Southern States. He speaks of a coffee estate which he saw just before entering the city of Caraccas. The coffee trees, he says, were planted in rows of ten feet from each other, under a 143 [a[ 75 tree with an umbrella like head, called the buccaris, which were about thirty feet apart. In the West I n dies, the banana, or plant ain, are usually planted on the sunny side of the coffee tree, to shade it from the fierce heat of the sign. The cultivation, he adds, is simple. It is said to flourish well on the Jamaica mountains, at a height above the sea where the climate is quite a scold as South Carolina, Georgia, or Louisiana; the labor is also very light. The tree, when once planted, will bear thirty, and sometimes fifty years. The preparation for market, too, is very simple, and may easily be performed by children. When ripe, it is picked ; then carried to a platform which covers sometimes an area of several acres, made of plaster, very hard and dry. There the ferries are spread out in the sun to dry; after which, they are placed in a mill resembling a cider mill, where a heavy wheel passes over them and takes off the dusk; it is then cleaned by a common fan, and placed in bags for market. It is an interesting question, whether it will bear the climate of the Southern States; for, (says the writer whom we are quoting) if so, there can be little doubt that, for productive ness and facility of culture, it will be preferable to any Southern crop. It is to be hoped the trial may yet be made, and thus the question practically decided. The addition of coffee to our home products would save to our citizens a large amount of money which is paid abroad for the same. According to the statement of foreign imports for Line months ending 30th of June, 1843, the quantity imported amounted to about 93,500,000 pounds, at a value of about     $6,500,000. It is not difficult to procure the seed; and, when once the fact is ascertained that it can be raised, we can have no doubt that it would become a favorite object, and divert much capital and labor from cotton raising; thus rendering that product more valuable. Any of the root crops admit also of more extensive cultivation. Large quantities are already raised for the feeding of stock; but their lull value is not yet sufficiently realized. We observe, in collecting various information from the agricultural papers, that splendid crops are noticed, showing what our farmers might do, with proper care. Some of these products maybe rendered valuable for other uses than for feeding of animals or the supply of the table. The sugar be et, it is well known, is employed in great quantities for the manufacture of sugar in France. It is said likewise to furnish an excellent vinegar, with very little trouble. A winter in the Detroit Farmer says " The last season I grated about a bushel of the sugar be et to a fine pulp, and pressed the juice therefrom, of which I obtained six gallons. I put the same in a vinegar barrel which was entirely empty, and in less than two weeks I had as good and as pleasant vinegar as I ever obtained from cider, and was equally as strong and clear The year 1844 has been one peculiarly distinguished for the product ofpumpkins, melons, and similar fruits. They have been raised not merely in large quantities, but also of rare excellence. Any reports have reached us, and have also met our notice in the agricultural journals, of admirable crops of this kind; and although they can never form a primary crop, or be substituted as a succedaneum for the more important field products, yet they may not be altogether unworthy of mention, as they form often a talma able aid to the farmer, when, by some unforeseen cause, he is compelled, in some measure, to resort to them. One gentleman from Schoharie county, New Work, writes us that, on 3 75 144 acres of corn ground, where he planted pump kin seed with the corn, besides the good yield of corn which he harvested, he also gathered over 4,000pumpkins, averaging 10 les. each making 40,00 lb is, or nearly 7 tons to the acre; which would prove valuable feed for stock, particularly mild cows, for which purpose he considered them superior to any thing else. I na; public journal in Massachusetts, it is stated that a gardener in Worcester raised from a single seed 15 pump king, weighing 384: is. The largest weighed 31 lbs, add the average of the whole was 25 is. each. The vine, including all its branches, measured 635 feet in length. A great desideratumwith respect to this and similar fr it, is, to obtain the best method of preserving it through the winter. I to value as fodder may thus be much enhanced, as it may save, in some degree, ,more costly food. The following is a method said to have been given at a meeting of theFairmers' Club, in New Took: A pump kin the growth of the year previous, was presented by a farmer from Red Bank, who remarked that he had found it an easy matter to keep the mi through the winter, and had nearly succeeded in keeping them two years. He directed, o select only the dead ripe ones to be preserved. These should be carefully I aid on the bottom of a cart, and carried to a shed having a southern ex p sur. In the bottom of the shed must be a layer of rails, and then a layer of pump king. Ghent his is completed, then it must be built up with another layer of rails, so placed as not to press on the pump king; and so on ill tale she d is fill. Met the pump king remain here till you are afraid of their freezing. As soon as this is the case, they must be taken to the kitchen, and put on shelves failed to the cross beams. In connexion with the subject of this species of fruit, we sub join the following mode of raising cucumbers, which is stated to have been full tested, and found preferable to any other, especially when the season is dry: " An excellent mode of raising cucumbers and me tons, is to dig out a space (say) 6 or S inches deep and 3 feet across; place an old keg (nail castor any thing of the kind) with both heads knocked bijou in the centre of the excavation. When fill the space around the tub with com i post made by mixing good loam with manure from the how pen hen root, or stable, (the former are preferable) cover it over with two or three inches of earth, a d plant the <a name="seeds10"><mark>seeds</mark></a> near the tub ; fill the tub or case with some light kind of manure or much that v will hold water like a sponge. The advantage of this is, that, in case of drought, water may be turned into these tubs by tie pail full, and the light manure will prevent it from going off too suddenly, but will give a gradual supply to the roots as they require. The cases should be open between states, or .else holes must be bored in them, to let the water soak through. If the ground is inclining -to be wet, no excavation should be made; but the case k should be placed on 'the top, and a little mound made round them m by' t the in re and each.

The vines will cover the surface, and the action of the sun on the sand will prove highly beneficial to the melon. Melons produced in this manner ripe n, and are as good as those raised in heavier soil he have several valuable communications relating to different vegetables; some of which we shall throw into our appendix, as they may prove useful to a portion of the agricultural community. One of them relates to the oka, the seed of which, it is said, will form an excellent substitute for coffee, when burnt and ground in the same manner practised in the preparation of that fruit for a beverage. Some account of this vegetable may be found, together with Mr. Gallant letter inviting attention to the same, in appendix to. 21. The <a name="seeds11"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are said to be abundant, and the plant easily raised. A valuable account of the mode of raising ce very, a favorite garden plant, has been furnished us by Genius Smith, Esq, of New Work, who has tested it by many years' trial; and who (as it will be seen in his letter in appendix No. 22) confidently recommends it, as deserving the attention of those who wish to obtain the choicest specimens of this garden vegetable. We have formerly mentioned artichokes as a vegetable which would be very profitable to many of the agriculturists of our country. This product has long been known and most highly prized in Germany ; and the writings of some of the first practical agriculturists there, (as Her, Schwertz, Larger, and others) abound in strong commendations of their excellence as a fodder for stock, and especially much cows. It would appear, from some notices which have met our view in the agricultural journals, that artichokes are beginning to be somewhat more cultivated by our farmers. The following statement we derive from one of these valuable periodicals, the Cultivator. The facts mentioned deserveconsiderationSeveral trials which we have known made with this root indicate that it is one of the most valuable for stock which can be cultivated. A few years ago, a gentleman of our acquaintance planted a small patch of rich ground with them. The produce was at the rate of 1,200 bushels per acre. They were principally harvested by hogs, which were turned in, and allowed to root them up as their appetite prompted. They gained well, with no other food, while the artichokes lasted. A great advantage of this root is, that it will lie in the ground without injury all winter' Mr. Thomas Noble, of Massillon, gave us a brief account of a trial withartichokes, made by him the past season. In April, 1843, he planted two acres with this vegetable. The ground was of medium quality. The artichokes were planted in rows 2' to 3 feet apart using a little more seed than is commonly used in planting <a name="potatoes88"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. As soon as the frost was out of the ground last spring, (1844) the digging of them was begun, and continued as the stock required. The produce of the two acres was 1,500bushels. They were fed principally to sheep, though some were given to cattle, horses, and hogs. All animals ate them well, seeming to prefer them to turn is. While the sheep were being fed with them, they were pastured on growing wheat and c lover. The shepherd thought the wheat and c lover were sufficient for them, as there was a full ' bite' and he accordingly discontinued the artichokes. The eyes (fell off' in their milk, and the lambs soon showed that they were not doing so well. The artichokeswere again given, and they soon did as well as ever." Mr. Noble also used the tops for fodder, He cut. them ti 1 October, just 10[ 75 ]a] 146 before frost came, dried and housed them. They were fed to the stock in winter, and were evidently preferred to corn fodder or. N. is so well pleased with artichokes, that he is raising them this year on a larger scale. They require but little cultivation it; being only necessary to keep the ground clear of weeds till the artichokes get a good start. For. T. M. Johnson, of Greensborough, Alabama, lately informed us that he is this year growing 30 acres of artichokes. He considers them the most profitable vegetable he can raise. In that climate, they can be dug any time in the winter There are several varieties of artichokes, but that called the Jerusalemartichoke (helianthus tube ross) is considered best. From the fibres of the tops or stems, a cordage is sometimes manufactured in some parts ofEuropeThe introduction of the turn in into Great Britain was gradual. Lordtownsend, who led the way in the enterprise of its culture, had the nickname of the vegetable applied to him, by the wits of the day at the Court, and went by the name thus of" Our nip Down send" but it is said that, by the culture of this root alone, not less than 160,000,000 has been added annually to the value of English agriculture. Acts like these should be borne in mind by those who essay experiments on new products, which promise, if successful, to be a source of great benefit to their country. He should not be surprised if, in the course of years, the value of the artichokeshould be fully realized, though few, at present, seem to turn even a passing thought to its admirable qualities. Large quantities of apples, and other fruits of the orchard, have been raised during the past season. It is found, however, that, owing to premature ripe ness, or some other cause, it has been more difficult than usual to preserve them from early decay. As apples promise yet to become an article of export, it may be useful to give here the following method, which is said to answer well, for preserving them. It is stated in one of the public journals, on good authority, to have been successfully tried in northern  n diana. It is, at least, a simple plan, and easily tested. The writer remarks, as from his informant, that, to keep apples from autumn to June, they should be placed in a shallow hole, dug as if for <a name="potatoes89"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; the bottom is first covered with corn s talks or straw, and then the straw with dirt, five or six inches more. To shelter is to be placed over them. When the severe weather commences, and the ground, and perhaps also the apples, are thoroughly frozen, place straw over the frozen heap, and cover the whole again with 4 coating of earth 10 or 12 inches thick. The object of this is to keep the first coating of earth frozen till spring, and then to cause it to thaw very slowly. It is stated that I wish <a name="potatoes90"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, bees, carrots, andturnips, may also be preserved in the same manner. Any of these roots may be thoroughly frozen without injury, provided they are well covered over, and then suffered to thaw by slow degrees. Sweet potatoes cannot be so treated with success, as they suffer injury from a small degree of cold. The common <a name="potato57"><mark>potato</mark></a>, or apple, that has been frozen, decays in consequence of sudden thawing; but if they are put in a frozen state into cold water until the frost is expelled, and then are used, they will be nearly, if not quite, as good as if they had not been frozen. A great variety of fine fruits are produced in this country, and the excellence of various kinds is continually improving by cultivation. Grapes of the native species, and others, are found in abundance in the markets of 147 many of our cities. A number ofkFrench emigrants, it has been stated, are about to fix themselves in North Carolina, to cultivate the native grape there, for the purpose of manufacturing wine; and they say, after examination, that they believe, by age, it will prove equal to the best kinds of wine which it resembles from Europe. One would hardly suppose that such vast quantities of strawberries were sold, as the result of examination in some places shows to be the fact. Thus the Cincinnati It las says: "I t is estimated that the market has been supplied with one hundred bushels of large delicious strawberries daily, for three or four weeks past. Theraspberry is now succeeding the strawberry in about the same quantities, and the black merry will succeed the ras perry in the like profusion. There are strawberry patches in the neighborhood containing about twenty acres, cultivated by a single individual; and gardens of the same size devoted to the ras perry. These ferries sell at the stalls in the market at five to ten cents per quart. They form a standing dish on most of the tables of the wealthy and middle classes; and none so poor but they are more or less supplied late committee from the Horticultural Society of that city, appointed to ascertain the statistics in relation to the growth and sale of strawberries in Cincinnati and its vicinity, has reported that, in pursuing their investigations, they had found in the market, during one day in the last week of May, 235 bushels of this fruit; and this was exclusive of the large quantities bought by the hotels, and also of those brought into the city after market hours, and hauled about the streets dark has heretofore been mentioned as an article which might become a profitable product in some sections of our country. Numerous attempts have been made to reduce the tenn in, or coloring principle which it contains, into such a compact state that it might be more readily transported, and bear the expense of freight; bark itself being so bulky that the freight from our country to European markets would prove too great to justify its exportation, and, in some degree, also prevent its being carried, for sale and home use, to various parts of the country. A mode has at length been adopted, to obtain a precipitate, and thus concentrate the good properties of bark in the form of a dry cake, resembling in appearance the yellow other, Experiments which have thus far been made on this subject justify sanguine expectations. Should no disappointment in relation to it arise, in the future efforts to be made in completing these experiments, the discovery will prove of great value, especially to the western section of our country, as the settlers there will be cheered to find a new motive given them for clearing their lands of the heavy timber. Dark, at Philadelphia and in the seaports, sells for    $8 per cord; while at the West it is worth only from l       $2.50 to     $3. In another year, further information can doubtless be given on this subject. We have a few remarks to add to the suggestions contained in the former report, with respect to the products of the dairy. In the preparation of butter, much must depend on the quality of the salt which is used. Even the purest salt of commerce, it is stated, contains small quantities of sulphate of magnetic and lime, nitrate of soda, andSmuriate of magnetic. This is the case with rock and bay salt, which is considered altogether the best to be obtained; and that which is commonly Used, not only contains a portion of these substances, but likewise other[ 75 1 148impurities, which greatly impair, if not destroy, its efficacy. The following direction is given on high authority, as a mode by which, at little trouble or expense, any farmers wife can render the salt she uses pure: But into a large kettle a peck of salt, with clear rain water enough to dissolve it; boil it, and skin off every particle of s cum that rises on the surface; then dissolve one ounce of the carbonate of soda in four ounces of water, put it intothe kettle, stir it well, then boil it again for ten minutes, swimming off the s cum that rises; then strain the bring through several folds of flannel. Considerable, quantity of earthy matter will thus be found in the bottom of the kettle, which is the cause of the impurity. After having thus strained it, add a small quantity (half an ounce or so) of m uratic acid to the bring, to neutralise the soda; then put the bring again into the kettle, and boil it till it crystallized, or in a shallow wooden vessel till the water is evaporatedthe first is the quickest. After the salt is well crystallized, it must be washed, by putting it into a clean basket, and throwing over it a bucket of perfectly pure water, and let it drain off rapidly; then let it be dried. Perfectly pure salt can thus be obtained, suitable not only for butter, but for preserving meat, &c; and the increased excellence thus secured will well repay all the trouble and expense of preparation. It can be rendered more pure than is usually bought, indeed, if the carbonate of soda should notvbeadded; but it is still better when it is also used. In some of the public journals the following method of sweet ening rancidbutter has been published, as taken from some foreign work. It is one which deserves more thorough trial, as the evil to be remedied is one of considerable magnitude. We give it as we find it in the American Agriculturists, under the head of" foreign agricultural news :in agriculturists in the neighborhood of Brussels having succeeded in removing the bad smell and disagreeable taste of some butter, by beating, or mixing it with chloride of lime, he was encouraged by this happy result to continue his experiments by .trying them upon butter so ran did as to be past use; and he has restored to butter, whose odor and taste were insupportable, all the sweetness of fresh. This operation is extremely simple, and practicable for all; it consists in beating the butter in a sufficient qucid127antity of water, in which put twenty-five or thirty drops of chloride of lime to two pounds of butter. After having mixed i till all its parts are in contact with the water, it may be left in for an hour or two, afterwards withdrawn, and washed anew in fresh water. The chloride of lime, havingnothiinginjurious in it, can with safety be augmented; but, after having verified the experiment, it was found that twenty-five or thirty drops to two and a half pounds of butter were sufficient t is stated, that the trouble of churning may be saved by the adoption of this plan : Lie up the cream in a linen cloth, and place over it a piece of calico or print; then bury the whole in damp place in the garden for twenty-four hours; then take it up, and turn the cream (which is by this time of the consistency and shape of a pudding) into a bowl, and stir it with a wooden spoon, and the butter will quickly separate from the buttermilk; and it is said, it will be sweeter than that which is made by the ordinary method. We have noticed, in the course of the year, the record of some file fairies. We give, a a specimen of what can be done in this branch of agriculttiralindustry, the product of Mr. Brainerds dairy, in the town of Western, State of New Work. From sixteen cows, in one season, he made one hundred a nd events i x j pounds per cow, besides the supply of a family of six 149 [a[ 75.di~ much of the time, seven or eight persons. This (remarks the editor of the agricultural journal from which we derive the facts) would probably raise the quantity to between one hundred and ninety and two hundred pounds. There was no extra feed, besides grass and hay, except one hundred and ;fifty pump king in the fall. In the making of cheese, it is said, that if the cure is not scalded, thearontatic oil, which rises to the top, and runs off in the they, is retained but also the cream might thus pass off. The cheeses should be kept in the press for some days, occasionally turning them, till the linen wrap per is no longer moist; when rubbed, it may be with hogs land instead of they butter. The experiments in the preparation of corn meal, 4 c, by kill drying, have been completely successful. Mr. Will, whose letters were given in the last report, informs us that he manufactured it both of flour and meal, and held it in the South for the summer and fall markets, and that every barrel remained as good and sweet as when made. The flour was sold at  $5 to    $6 per barrel; the corn meal at     $3. His agents at New Orleans wrote him, on returning the account of sales, congratulating him on his bright prospects for the next year; assuring him that in f both, but especially in the latter, he had established his reputation beyond any thing he could imagine; and they did not care how much he sent them, as they could sell it both for city consumption and shipping purposes. To injury was experienced, even in the i samples first sent the previous year; and the opinion is confidently expressed, that it would, continue so for years. A half barrel of the flour made in 1843 will probably be received at the Patent Office, to remain for exhibition some two or three years. Some of the meal, two years old, remains as good as when first put up, as may be seen by a sample at the Patentoffice. Preparati Of Of Soi L, Seed, &c. In a gutted market, and, consequently, a poor demand of any great staple, there is a necessity for a change of crops; and, lest a common selection, by many, of the same crop should not lessen the evil, it will be advisable to :diversity the crop, so as to raise, as far as practicable, all that is consumed on the farm. In this selection and diversity of crops, much, very much depends. Until lately, cotton planters have purchased all provisions and clothing, and raised nothing but cotton. This course has been partially changed, and will be more so without delay. At the present low prices of cotton, with no improvement in market, it is evident that an exchange crop of this article, especially if competition continues, must fail to remuneratethe planter. While, however, the selection of new crops is recommended, great care must be taken that no crops are attempted but such as are suited to the soil. If the soil will not admit of (a change to the desired crop, it must not be attempted. If possible, the soil should be examined; and this is easily done byanalyzingithe same, and finding the component parts. It would be useless to attempt raising wheat on sand, or I indian corn on clay. And that is cold or wet may produce grass, but will not produce grain without draining. I tis impossible to lay down any positive rules, while we judge only from the appearance of the soil; since some rich soils contain too much aridity, aid land that might not exhibit to the eye any lime might contain, in some chemical solution, enough for wheat. To of hum us: this may be estimated more accurately by the eye; still, an analysis is better. The eminent Her very justly lays down the proposition, that, in exact[ 75] 150 proportion to the amount of aridity, is the decrease in the value of the soil and this goes on from bad to worse, till the soil is no better than what we commonly call marshy land. Some extracts from his Principles of Agriculture (a work hardly known in this country, but which is a standard one in Europe) will be found in appendix No. 23. These embody some of his valuable remarks on soils, and means of correcting their defects, &c, and, we doubt not, will be found very useful to the agriculturists who may read them. The attention of the public has recently been directed to the question as to the quantity of seed which should be employed, and the best method of sowing it. An interesting paper on this subject, taken from a foreign journal, on the injury and waste of sowing corn or grain too thickly, maybe found in appendix No. 24. Mr. Fewest Davis has there furnished some valuable hints, which deserve consideration, as he plainly shows that much seed may be saved amounting, as he calculates, for Great Britain, to an annual saving of 1,328,507 quarters, or 10,628,056 bushels; or 73,774 quarters more than the annual average of foreign importation of grain for the last ll years. His essay on the subject is evidently the production of not only a practical man, but a sound judge of agricultural subjects. Some mention was made, in the report for 1843, of modes of raising crops by a new process of applying the means of fertility directly to the seed itself, in form of steeps. As this has become a matter of deeper interest, in consequence of the theory being apparently admitted by eminent scientific writers, we have sub joined at this time, in appendix No. 25, several interesting papers, which we have taken from various sources, and which throw much light on the history of the discovery, and methods adopted for the purpose. They will be read, we believe, with much interest, by those who have not before seen them. We have given, in appendix No. 26, a statement relative to the time of the vegetation of <a name="seeds12"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, which, allowing for the difference of location, and thus of. climate, may prove useful in conducting experiments and carrying on observations in relation to some of the fruits of the earth. Other steeps are also mentioned in the agricultural and public journals, which are more or less commended. Among these are Of   acute rives chemical, said to have been tried successfully. It is stated that he received the gold medal and the sum of 3,000 francs of the Society of Encouragement c, at Paris, for this preparation, after a report to the society made in the year 1843, by a committee composed of four chemists and four agriculturists, who tested the process for three consecutive years. It is said to be sold at Baltimore, by F. W. Wee ny, for     $3 per half barrel of sixteen or eighteen g allons, with full printed directions how to use it. Besides the preparation of <a name="seeds13"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, various expedients have been resorted to, to promote the fruit fulness of crops, either directly acting on the plant or on the soil. Some of the most curious results thus produced are those which are recorded as having taken place on the application of electricity or galvanism. Although, in the present stage of this means, it does not admit of any extensive use, yet it is not impossible that valuable conclusions may be drawn respecting the theory of vegetation, and hereafter something more practical may be realized. The account of these experiments (one by Dr. Foster, the other by William Loss, Esq) may be found in appendix No. 27. The choice of seed is a subject which deserves much attention. Drops may be rendered more sure and productive, and also often earlier, by a careful selection of seed at the proper time. A practical agriculturists, fo 151 [a[ 75 ]three successive years, planted seed corn taken from within an inch of the but tend of the ear; and the result is said to have been, that he obtained a good crop some two or three weeks earlier. It is well known, also, that beans and cucumbers, &c, taken from the lower part of the vines, are best for seed. The importance of sub soil or deep sloughing is not sufficiently realized. It is well known that beneath the upper soil lies yet another, composed of different chemical elements, and in various combinations. It may often be, therefore, that, by bringing up the sub soil, the very constituents which are deficient in the upper may thus be supplied, or the excess in that may be neutralised by this. The roots of. plants extend to great depth. Lover isa familiar instance. The fine roots of this plant may not un frequently be found in abundance two and three feet, or more, below, the surface; and hence the great advantage of this crop to the ground itself. In a late English agricultural paper, a writer says: " In forming a kitchen garden, I had occasion to trench a wheat field, and found that the soil was matted with fibres to the depth of about four feet six inches; but stronger roots extended below that depth, and were traced from five feet to five feet six inches his applies also with great force to those vegetables which have long tap roots. I instances are recorded of the carrot being raised eighteen, twenty, twenty-four, and even thirty inches long ; and were the finely tapering root traced down its whole extent, it would often, doubtless, be found to reach far deeper. I tis obvious, therefore, that if the ground be loosened deep, the roots have free play, and the plant will thrive much better. The secret seems to be, to turn up the sub soil; and the deeper the ground is ploughed, the more probable the success. Worn should be planted somewhat deep, and covered light, as, in this manner, the action of the atmosphere may be more easily secured, Numerous examples of experiments proving this i night be cited, were they needed. It is probable that the deep planting, a swell as deep covering of <a name="seeds14"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, has often impeded their growth. The following is a valuable statement respecting raising of grass, which is taken from an agricultural journal, where it is attributed to an old experienced practical farmer: "I will take an old piece of herds grass, that at present yields less than half a ton of hay per acre: and at the end of five years, without breaking up, fresh seeing, or maturing in any way whatever, I will raise the crop to two and a half tons per acre; and this I will do by merely permitting the crop to stand until the seed will just ve get ate before cutting. By mowing the crop sooner than that, the roots bleed and die out; and that is the reason why a second crop does not spring for a long time after. I once purchased a fifth part of the crop of timothy on one of the islands in the Delaware, with the intention of cutting my lot at the time the other four purchasers did theirs; but I was called from home, and it was not done until the <a name="seeds15"><mark>seeds</mark></a> would ve get ate. I thought my hay was spoiled, but it was preferred to that of all others for horse feed; and, behold, the next year, my lot of land yielded double the crop of the others; and, at the end of five years, it had increased to two and a half tons per acre, having overgrown all other glasses a uniform crop five feet in height, and preferred before all others at the market. Since that, I have never cut timothy until the <a name="seeds16"><mark>seeds</mark></a> will just ve get ate; and I would take a poor field that shows only a few spears of timothy growing in it, and, by these simple means, engage in five years to cut two and a half tons per acre of superior hay, provided the land be suitable to the growth of the crop[ 75 152MANURES. The subject of manures is more and more engaging the attention of the agriculturists of our own as well as other countries. Pua no has recently been imported, and a number of experiments have been made during the past year. These all tend to confirm the view which has heretofore been expressed of the extraordinary power it possesses on various crops. I n appendix No. 29 we have given some extracts from a letter of Dr. Jackson relating to this subject, as well as a number of other papers relating to manures of different kinds. To Dr. Jackson is due the recipe for an artificialguano, which was published as that of Mr. Valentine, the gentleman who presented it to the Farmers' Club in New Work, in the report of 1843. Any suggestions are made in relation to the best method of applying this manure to the soil. We have copied, for the appendix above mentioned, the most complete set of rules which have met our view in any agricultural paper. There is no doubt that the various specimens analyzed exhibit degrees of adaptation for particular soils. The Peruvian is the best. Theafrican is better than some other. It appears to be a necessary condition to its full strength, that the location from whence it is taken be where there are no rains, but continued dry weather; otherwise, certain elements essential to its greatest fe utilizing powers are lost or impaired. W. F. Karkeek, an eminent writer on these subjects, in a late essay on manures, says thatguano is drilled in with seed. Not less than a ton of earth or ashes should be mixed with each cut. of gun no. The introduction of gun no will lead to many useful experiments, and its analysis will induce the formation of, artificial gun no of various kinds, from materials which abound in our own country. If it were not for this, it might be of comparatively little advantage, since the cost on the seaboard and the transportation would perhaps consume, in a great degree, the profits of farmers of the Last, who have now to compete with the fertile soil of the West, where manure is not supposed needful. Some of the rich prairies there have been cropped fifteen to twenty years, without apparent deter i oration. While, therefore, the introduction of gun no may be hailed as a new era, its advantages will be very limited, and farmers will still have to depend upon rotation of crops, com post heaps, &c. These, with deep sloughing, will always, in a good season, secure a fair regeneration. The account given by Mr. Schattenman of the cheap and immediate conversion of fe cal matter into manure, which will be found in appendix to. 30, and which we have taken from an agricultural journal, deserves consideration. It is by such knowledge that the farmers of our country will gradually begin to understand what a vast mine of wealth they have in the means so easily afforded them of fe utilizing their lands, and that it is not so much by tilling a great area of soil, but devoting their information and practical skill to cultivate highly a smaller number of acres, that they are to look for their success. The nearest approach to gun no among us is, doubtless, pigeon dung. I tis said that from the use of this, the Persian melon .in some, degree derives its superiority. Men dung is, as it is said, also a most excellent manure for melons. Charcoal and salt have both been used with great effect. The following statement shows the great efficacy of these, in experiments made in England : "the Karl of Essex gives an account, in the Agricultural Gazette, of 153 75 an experiment made by him with charcoal, and charcoal combined with salt, applied to turn in seed at the time of sowing. In the first case, the seed was mixed with twelve times its bulk of charcoal dust. In the second case, the seed was mixed with five times its weight of salt, and nine bulks of charcoal and in the third case, the seed was put in alone. The ground was very dry and parched, but the seed, where the charcoal and the charcoal and salt were used, came up in five days. The plants where the clear charcoal was used, however, grew much the most rapidly; where nothing was used, the plants came up badly, and, after they were up, did not grow near so fast as the others. The earl also tried the same application of charcoal with the seed of the Belgian carrot, which vegetated several days sooner than carrot seed usually does, even under favorable circumstances. He also sowed one row of turn is with double the quantity of salt above mentioned, which totally destroyed the seed. Nothing but the substances named were used, and the earl thinks that the quick vegetation and rapid growth wereattributable to the malt is likewise said to be excellent for plum trees, as appears by the following extract from the Boston Cultivator: "or. Benjamin Jacobs, of For chester, had a small plum tree which never bore more than half a dozen plums which came to maturity. Seeing salt recommended as a remedy, in an article from the Cultivator, he applied two quarts the 1st of March, in a space about two feet wide around the tree, commencing about six inches from the tree ; it was dug into the ground a little: the consequence has been, a fine lot of fruit. We saw this tree a short time since, and it was as full as it could hold. It is evident that salt made the great contrast between this and previous years, as to the production of fruit n the American Agriculturists we have a condensed view of some experiments made by Mr. Kann am, a full account of which is found in theQuarterly Journal of Agriculttire, published in Scotland. To this gentleman, we believe, was awarded the premium of fifty sovereigns. The suggestions of the editor of the American Agriculturists are likewise deserving of attention Experiments with manures." Nitrate of soda. nitrate of potash, sulphate of soda, salt, and soothe con dense from the English Agricultural Journal a series of experiments with the above manures, made by Mr. Kann am, on several kinds of grain, the past season, and detailed at considerable length." Oats, per imperial acre, over the same kind of land where nothing was applied, gained, with 84 pounds of nitrate soda mixed with 168 pounds of common salt, 5.76 bushels grain, and 304 pounds straw; with 112 pounds of nitrate potash, 4.26 bushels grain, and 304 pounds straw; with 112 pounds of nitrate potash, 4.26 bushels grain, and 280 pounds straw; with 236 pounds of salt, 6.66 bushels grain, and 350 pounds straw." Barley gained, with 168 pounds of nitrate soda, 14.12 bushels grain, and 572 pounds straw; with 112 pounds nitrate soda mixed with the same quantity of sulphate soda, 11.55 bushels grain, and 432 pounds straw ; with 84 pounds of nitrate soda mixed with 168 pounds salt, 10.42 bushels grain, and 600 pounds straw ; with 114 pounds of nitrate potash, 11.16 bushels grain, and 71 4 pounds straw; with 336 pounds salt, 11.42 bushels grain, and 44 pounds straw." Heat gained, with 140 pounds of nitrate soda, 5.62 bushels grain, and[ 75 ]a] 154 424 pounds straw; with 112 pounds of nitrate potash, 4.25 bushels grain, and 316 pounds straw; with 32 bushels of soot, 2.25 bushels grain, and 68 pounds straw; with 336 pounds of salt, 1.4 bushel grain, and decreased the straw 96 pounds; with 140 pounds of sulphate soda, the grain decreased 0.83 of a bushel, and increased the straw 28 pounds." The good or ill success of such experiments as detailed above, must always depend more or less on the situation of the land, the elements contained in the soil, and something on the season. For example : if the land be within reach of sea breezes, which for centuries have been supplying it with soda, an application of nitrate of soda would not benefit it; nor would nitrate of potash a soil already containing a sufficiency of potash. It would be the same with lime, plaster, &c, &c; so that, in making experiments, all these things must be considered. Still, we would not advise the farmer a tall times to be at the expense of an analysis of his soil, to see what elements it contained, but would advise him to make a few cheap experiments on a small scale; and if these prove successful, then enlarge them. His would cost him less than a good analysis, and be more certain and satisfactory, as there will be attendant circumstances in all experiments over which the chemist can have no control, and for which he cannot always account n appendix No. 31 will be found the letter of Doses Pierce, respecting manure, which may be derived from the remains of le aches or refuse lye. This may be of very considerable importance to many parts of our country where manufactures are springing up, as it may afford the means of enriching the soil, even in the close vicinity of new markets. The use of lime and ground bones has been very beneficial in many parts of our country in restoring lands. The great difficulty in the application of this latter manure is in the want of suitable mills for grinding the bones. A gentleman, writing us last season in the District, expresses his surprise that no one has established such a mill here, instead of shipping them to Philadelphia. He says, that not being able to procure all he wanted, he has ordered 1,200 bushels from Philadelphia, at a cost of about    $40 per hundred. It is not improbable that many of these same bones were shipped from this District. Similar cases may doubtless be found in other parts of the country. In appendix No. 32 is given a communication from Peter Last wood, Esq, relating to these subjects. His experience is valuable. One manure is stated by others to be very useful for pasture of much cows. Time appears to have had a great effect on the land in many sections of the country. It is well known to be of great use for wheat crops. In a report of the Newcastle County (delaware) Agricultural Society, we have some interesting statements on this subject. It is there said : "the lands have increased in productive ness and intrinsic value at a rate unprecedented, in consequence of the application of this manure; for, notwithstanding the low price of grain, several farms in the vicinity of Red Lion and it. Georges Hundreds, within the last year or two, have brought 60 or 70 dollars per acre, where the same lands, 20 years ago, would not have brought more than 15 or 20 dollars, at the most karl has also been tried there with great success. In sections of our country are vast beds of mary, and it needs only a little enterprise for persons to avail themselves of its benefits. This is peculiarly the case in Virginia and North and South Carolina. Last beds of this substance afford the means of restoring lands that have been worn out by constant dropping, and the success which has already attended experiments of this kind en 155 [a[ 75 courage to the further trial. Mr. Puff in, to whom the South is so greatly indebted for his essay on the calcareous manures, in his late Survey of South Carolina, describes a most extensive bed of mary, extending through a large part of the eastern section of the State, which is easy of access and of a very excellent quality. The following statement is from the Southernagriculturist, and gives an account of the experiments of Mr. Hammond in marlingSUnmarled acre 361 lbs. seed cotton." 100 bushels do 451 do. I increase 90 lb s 249 per cent." 200 do do 384 do. do 23 6.3 "3 300 do do 173 do. Decrease 188 52 The land, being very old, is bare of vegetable matter for mary to act onto which, more than to the texture of the soil, inferior as it is, I attribute the failure of any great improvement from it. I make the statement, however, because it is valuable in many respects. It shows the danger of heavy darling on worn land, without previous rest or manure. The acre with three hundred bushels has been destroyed. There is one rich spot, the bottom of a small basin in the centre of it, which produced nearly all the cotton gathered. In the rest of it, the weed mostly died as soon as it came up. One hundred proves a better quantity than two hundred bushels, and perhaps a little less would have been still better on this soil at least to begin with. All the lightest land in the fields marked with two hundred bushels was evidently injured, and now requires help. I anticipated this effect from what I saw last year, and reduced the quantity to one hundred and fifty bushels on all the land then darling. I have reduced it now to one hundred bushels, and shall hereafter mary at that rate. I prefer to go over it again, after I have finished all, and give it what it may prove itself able to bear after resting once or twice The crop of this year has satisfied me perfectly that cotton will mature at least a fortnight earlier on marked than on unmarred land Another unexpected effect of mary it may be worth while to state. I commenced in the spring of 1842 to put it in my stable pretty freely, for the purpose of improving my manure. I did not think of its having any material effect on the health of the mules; but I have had but little sickness among them, and have not lost one since; while previously I lost on the average four annually, and never in any year less than two. I attribute this change, in a great measure, to the absorption of noxious gases by the mary." I am now darling as actively as heretofore; and I esteem it so beneficial, that I have this summer marked a field of over two hundred acres, the average haul of which is three miles from my landing; and being tolerably fresh land, that has rested this year, and was sowed in oats last year, which were not cut, but grazed down after ripe king, I have put on a hundred and fifty bushelsFOOD For Cattle. The economical feeding of cattle is a subject of no little interest to the agricultural portion of our citizens. The attention of scientific as well as practical men is more turned to it from year to year. We have thought it would be useful, therefore, to add to what was said on this topic in the last report, several suggestions, which will be found in appendix No. 33. By the tables there found, the farmer may be able to estimate the compare 75 ]a] 156 active value of the various kinds of fodder used, and how far one can be used as a substitute for the other. In the same appendix we have give ran account, taken from an agricultural paper, of some experiments respecting the steaming of food for cattle; also, a condensed view of some experiments made by Mr. Stevenson, as to the feeding of farm horses, which we have taken from his essay in the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture. He received from the High land Society the premium of ten sovereigns for his successful experiment reported. In reference also to the fattening of cattle, and the quantity of food consumed, &c, much depends on the temperature at which cattle are kept. I n appendix No. 33 will also be found an extract on this subject from Professor Johnstons lectures. The great excellence of oil cake, there stated, deserves notice; and to show the amount of oil, and proportion of oil cake c, in the <a name="seeds17"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of plants raised for this purpose, we have given, in appendix No. 34, some extracts from Dr. Are, and also a table of He it, a German author, in E. Good rich Smiths translation of Surgery Economy of Farming. These tables will be useful to those who wish to compare the relative value of the different oil plants. The variation in any case maybe attributed to the difference of country, climate, &c. The steaming up of cattle is carried on to a large extent in the West; and some interesting particulars relating to this subject, together with letters of gentlemen to whom application was made for information relating to this subject, as well as respecting the use of sheep in the same manner, will be found in appendix No. 35. It will be seen by these papers, that the raising of cattle and sheep may be made very profitable; and we can scarcely doubt that, before many years, more attention will be paid to this branch of business in the West and South than has been hitherto done. It is probable that not less than 50,000 or 60,000 sheep were purchased for the West during the last year. In many parts of our country we notice statements which show that the raising of sheep might also be rendered profitable for their wool. It appears, from the statistics of Lowell, that the amount of wool consumed in those factories alone (1, 000 000 pounds) would require, at the rate of 3 pounds i er sheep, at least 330,000 sheep. In a Rochester paper of July last, it is stated that more than 300,000 pounds of wool was purchased in that city during the month of June preceding, at prices 10 cents higher than the former year. The crop of wool in Washington county, Pennsylvania, for the season, is said to have been 800,000 pounds, which sold for      $300,000. A million of pounds of wool was advertised for by a firm in New Orleans, for the French market; and the opinion is expressed in a public journal, that the wool business will yet perhaps exceed in quantity, if not in value, the cotton business. It now amounts to about one quarter, The original Saxon clip in 1826, in But chess county, it is asserted on good authority, gave only 2 pounds to a clip; whereas the American product of last summer gave over 3 pounds said to be the result of our better climate. If such be the case as far north as the State of New Work, what might not be expected in the more mild climate of the South ?a? We perceive by the public journals that various experiments are making by individuals in Northcarolina, Georgia, &c, from which much may be expected. The introduction of the Cloaca, or Peruvian sheep, is a subject which deserves attention. It is said that more than 2,000,000 pounds of wool of this animal were imported into Great Britain in 1843 from South America. Some papers relating to this subject, selected from the agricultural journals 157 [a[ 75 c, may be found in appendix No. 36; and also on poultry, the annual product of which (see appendix No. 37) is           $20,000,000 per annum. The review we have taken of the crops and various products which are or may be raised among us leads most naturally to the inquiry, What are our prospects with respect to the disposal of the articles produced by the agricultural industry of our country? In former reports, we have considered this question, both with reference to our home and our foreign r market. We shall pursue the same course at the present time. Home Market. There are a great variety of articles which, as is well known, are absolutely needed for the support and comfort of our own citizens. These must, and will t, of course, find a market, to the extent of that necessity, near the spot where they are produced. Others find, too, a ready sale by our internal commerce of one State with another. The man who raises nothing must be fed by the fruits of the labor of him who gathers the crop; while he, on his part, gives that return which his own industry or capital enable shit to make. Very section of the country must, in some degree, be dependent on some other; and probably it is well that it is so; for, otherwise, the interchange of commodities would cease, and, in a degree, likewise, that intercourse which is essential to the best knowledge by fellow citizens of each other. The great outlets of the West, pre eminently the agricultural part of our country, are the Mississippi and the lakes. It is trifle that a portion of their products find their way through railroads and d canals to Baltimore and Philadelphia; but, if we would estimate the amount of the trade, we must turn to these two great channels of commerce. By these, the agricultural products also find their market in foreign countries. The enterprise of our citizens is pressing still further beyond the Mississippi; and the ancient fable seems almost realized, in the rapidity with which towns and villages spring up. The following, which we cut from a public journal, is hut a specimen of what is going on: "the growth of a village The village of Squaw ka, on the upper Mississippi, was laid out in 1836. At that time, provisions of every sort were obliged to be imported for the use of the settlers. Now, the tide has turned; and the insignificant village, within the present year, has made tout, Louis and other markets the following exports: 5,358 barrels of pork and land; 124 barrels of beef; 2,584 barrels of flour; 40,000 bushels of wheat; 64 bales of hemp; 30 sacks of wool; 200 hogs heads of tobacco, a large quantity of corn, oats, hemp seed, hides, fur, pelt rise, and: otherarticlesThe slaughter of pork and beef is increasing in many parts of the Western country. From a It. Louis paper, some months since, we gather the following information: That arrangements had been made there for slaughtering and packing down 60,000 hogs, and from 10,000 to 20,000 cattle. From 700,000 to 1,000,000 lbs. of beef also, it is stated, could be stniokedeach month during the season, at the establishments there. Of the cincinnati trade it is stated There was shipped from Cincinnati to New Orleans during the past year       $2,795,676 worth of the manufacture of hogs. Of the eight lead iting articles of Western produce, (pork, bacon and hams, land, beef, flour, whiskey, cheese, and butter) it would seem that Cincinnati alone ships more than one half of the entire receipts at New Orleans. The whole value of the seat New Orleans is said to have been   $4,472,869.[75 ]158 There has, however, been a falling off, the past year, of perhaps one third in the pork made in the whole Western country. The number of hogs packed in the Wabash valley, this season, is stated at 62,400-a falling off, compared with last season, of 82,600. The New Orleans Bulletin, of the 26th December, says that the quantity of pork received at that port the present season is less by more than one half the quantity received to the same time last year. This will increase the price, and in this respect will be favorable to the farmer. A single firm in Cincinnati, it is stated, sold in a single year 6,000 tons of cheese, in value   $70,000 to     $80,000. The cheese trade of that place for the year, it was supposed, would amount to upwards of 3,000,000 lbs, and reach in value              $18 o 000 to            $200,000. The number of hogs slaughtered there and at Moving ton is given at about 200,000 head. The value of the products of the how, exported from Cincinnati during the first six months of 1844, is stated to have exceeded             $1,500,000; to which other domestic products might be added, equal to at least     $3,000,000 more. The amount of home consumption of various articles may be judged from the following estimate for a year for the city of New Work. It is probable that it falls short of, rather than exceeds, the truth. The American I institute of New York has published a statement respecting the consumption of animal food yearly in that city. The weight ofbeeves killed yearly is 34,400,000 lbs; sheep and lambs, 6,300,000 lb s hogs, 3,750,000 lbs; calves, 990,000 lbs. Total, 45,449,000 I is. Therepublican says: "assuming the population of New York city to be 350,000, and that the consumption of animal food averages four ounces per day to each, the total consumption in a year amounts to 31,937,500 lbs; to which may be added the amount consumed by commerce in the coasting and foreign trade, and also by the population in the immediate vicinity of the city13472500lbsfair estimate; it makes up and confirms the total before stated, of45449000 lbs, which, at 3 cents per lb, amounts to             $1,363,470."Add to this the flour and other agricultural products, and take a similar ratio for other large cities, and it will be seen the amount of home consumption must be very great.       $2,000,000 worth of hogs, cattle, and sheep, are sold, annually, at Right on, near Boston. The amount of wheat passing through the Well and canal, up to 2 3d of July, is given as 1,958,000 bushels. This would probably be considerably increased during the remainder of the year; so that the whole amount would take off a good proportion of the surplus product of the States bordering on Take Erie. The operation of Air Robert Feels corn bill on the Canada trade is said to have been great. There was exported at Montreal from the opening of navigation to the 11th of September, 1844, 241,276bushels of wheat, against 15,417 the previous year; and 351,692 barrels of flour, against 57,497 of that year. I immense quantities of wheat have been sent into Canada, and there ground; in which state it is allowed to be shipped as British produce. The quantity of flour forwarded on the Erie canal from Buffalo the present season, notwithstanding the large quantities shipped from the lakes, by way of the Well and canal, was, to the 1st of August, 500,000 barrels and of wheat, 940,000 bushels. There were forwarded, in the same period 159 [a[ 75 50 000 barrels of beef and pork, 40,000 bushels of corn and oats, and a million and a half pounds of wool. The amount of canal tolls received at that place was        $292,000. There has been received in the same period, by the canal, 22,000 tons of merchandise, and 46,000 barrels of salt. The great wheat State of Ohio, it is evident, promises less respecting this chief staple than she has done. In appendix No. 38 we have thrown together some extracts from a recent report of commissioners appointed to take an agricultural survey of a part of this State, and which embraces some interesting facts deserving attentive consideration. In appendix No. 39, also, we have placed an extract from a Southern paper, relating to the home production of cotton bagging and other articles; which indicates that the attention of some of those States is most likely to be more fully turned to that subject. Forei Of Market. Our articles of produce are also gradually finding increasing favor in foreign markets. Some of them, scarcely known before, appear to be gradually introduced. Of this description are I indian corn, hay, apples, &c which seemed to be received with more or less favor. The quantity of indian corn shipped to England, from New Work, the first eight months of 1844, was 190,000 bushels; in 1843, only 35,000 bushels. In an English paper it is stated that American cheese has already driven the Dutch cheese out of the market. Our hams and beef are generally becoming more popular. One cause of the superiority of English beef is in the preparation of the animal for slaughter. In this country, our cattle are knocked down, bled a short time, left to cool, and then barrelled, The English, on the contrary, bleed for several days previous to killing. This custom is now practised in some of the Eastern cities, and occasions the whites t color of the meats in the best markets. A brazier of high respectability from the West, now a member of Congress, states that he lately sold a large lot of cattle in New Work; 15 or 20 were butchered daily; for several days previous to killing, the ox was tied in a stall, with no food, and only a little water; he was bled three successive days, until he fainted and fell; the issue was then tied up, and the ox recovered. After this, he was slaughtered. The butcher thus accomplished two objects: he lessened the weight of beef, and increased the beauty of its appearance on the stall. To many subterfuges are resorted to by the purchasers to effect a good trade for themselves, by increasing the off al when the quarters are weighed, that d rovers prefer to sell the ox at so much per pound live weight; and this is certainly fair for both, and a great check on fraud. In appendix No. 40 will be found a letter from Mr. Scott, of this city, lately from England. His experience in grazing has been great, and his letter, we think, will be read with interest. In appendix No. 41 will be found a method of packing provisions for the English market, illustrated by an appropriate cut, which will also aid in understanding the directions there given. In the same appendix we have also added prices current of two firms, which, though in some respects similar, yet also contain a variety of particulars in which they furnish additional information. These are the latest accounts we have as to the state of the English market in American produce. The late treaty with China must probably open to us eventually if not directly, yet indirectly a new channel, through which will be poured the[ 75 ]a] 160 products, in some shape or other, of our fields, and the industry of our citizens. It is stated that, within a year, there has been an increase of our exports to China of 1,500,000 yards of cotton shirting; and that, in the last four years, there have been sent to the Chinese market 100,000,000yards of plain cottons. It is true that by far the larger portion of this is from Great Britain; but we are gaining from year to year. The following are given as specimens of some of the exports to foreign countries. Others might be added : " Cargo of the packet ship Samuel Kicks, for Liverpool 562 bales cotton, 1,650 barrels turpentine, 2,053 barrels flour, 250 barrels land, 200 barrels flax seed cakes, 27 barrels bread and corn meal, 2 cases veneers, 460 bushels I indian corn, 285 bundles (45 tons) hay" Cargo of ship For onto, for London 25 bales American hemp, 500 barrels turpentine, 250 tons linseed cake, 65 packages manufactured tobacco, 250 tierces beef, 10,000 gallons s term oil, 8,000 pounds spermaceti, 20 tons tallow, 130 hogs heads tobacco strips, 15 packages furs and skins" Cargo of vegetables, c vessel cleared at Boston, last week, forDemarara, with the following cargo: 150 barrels apples, 16 kegs butter, 10 barrels carrots, 3,000 cabbages, 200 ce very roots, 15 boxes cheese, 6 half barrels cranberries, 50 barrels green corn, 10 half barrels eggs, 4,000 fresh fish, 75 live hogs, 200 lobsters, 50 barrels onions, 100 boxes mystery, 50 barrels <a name="potatoes91"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, 75 live sheep, 50 half barrels turn is, 10 boxes poultry, 15 boxes peaches and pears, and 150 tons of ice Exports to Europethe packet ship Mediator, from New Work, for London, takes out 358 tierces of beef, 288 of c lover, 200 cases of ashes, and 112 of cheese.

Prices may be comparatively low; but a starving people are not lifting up an imploring cry for the very necessaryes of life. Some of our products may be diminished; but still we have enough, the country through, and to spare, for those whose hands and hearts open to receive our interchange of commodities. The Last and the West are drawing into closer proximity ; vast chains of railroads and canals are, as it were, planting a depot or fixing a port of entry nearer to every mans door; while there are breaking out, like the pent up fires of the internal earth, and heaving into sight, alike with new elements to be wrought, the kindling forge, the smoke and din of factories, where industry, toil, and enterprise, of one kind and another, greet the farmer as he bears to them the fruits of his health full and useful occupation, to feed the multitudes which crowd into those cities of invention and machinery. Amid all the inequalities which must always more, or less abound in climate, soil, and kindred elements, there is still an onward impulse, and the restless spirit of enterprise cannot stop. Dear after year must add to the development of our resources; and if, perchance, there mayor must be a change in the direction of labor, yet labor cannot always be profit less. The evils of over charged production, a better judgment ,will rectify; and if we are true to ourselves, we need fear no fo reign l competition ; nor that markets will not gradually be found, which will echo back, in calls for aid, their response to our inquiry if they can receive to re. extending surplus of the products of our national industry 161 75 ]APPENDDI  X. No. l. Observations communicated at he request of he On. H L. Ellsawobri S by E. C. Herricki librarian of Pale College, Connthe Hessi    Of Fly. The insect commonly called the hessian by, which has for so man years ravaged the wheat fields of our country, appears to have been wholly unknown I ere before the American Revolution. It is usually stated that the insect was first noticed in the year 1776 or 1779, on States, I land and the we sternly end of Long I s land, and was generally supposed to have been introduced among straw brought hither by the Hessian trops intlheservice of Great Britain. :the ravages of the insect soon attracted general attention; and as ely as the year 1788, serious apprehensions were excited in" England that the destroyed might be conveyed thither n some cargo of wheat. The alarm i there was so great, that the Government to q k up the matter; " the Or ivy Council sat day after day, anxiously debatigwhat measures should be adopted to ward off the danger of a calamity, more to be dreaded, as they well knew, than the plague or pestilerneexpresses were sent off in all directions to the officers of the customs at the out ports, respecting the examination of cargoes; des patches written to the ambassadors in France, Austria, Russia, and America, to gain that information, of the want of which they were now so sensible; and so important was the business deemed, that the minutes of the i council, and the documents all ted fill a vo pages' (air by and pence, i, 50.) In the 25th of June of that year, an order in council was issued, prohibiting the entrance into Great Britain of wheat raised in any of the territories of the United States ; intending, by this measure to keep out the much dreaded enemy. Soon after the arrival of the news of this order, the supreme executive council of Pennsylvania addressed a letter of inquiry to the l fPhiiadiephia Society for Promoting Agriculture, who promptly replied that the plant of the wheat alone was injured, and that the insect was not propagated by sowing the grain which grew on fields infected with it. 'the pihibitio in doubless based o the erroneous representation of Air Joseph Ranks and Dr. Flag den, which they continued t enforce, even after they were better instructed by Dr. Our re. It is sufficiently remarkable, that, although the wheat was prohibited an i e ii try" it was allowed to be stored , so that the Hessian fly, i if conceal ed among the grain, would, after all, have had a good opportunity to escape into the 'country. In eight or ten months, i the Over nm en it bought n the imprisoned wheat at prime cost, kill dried it, and re sold it it re at less and almost immediately took 6ff the prohibition. (Memnoii of Currieii651) l l: 'of     n: the course of a few years after this, the Russia fly w s found :I ne very part of our country the r wheat was cultivated. Hero. the periodpfithne Revolution down to the present time, no insect in the aid has ~a~ e- 11[ 75 ]162ceived so much public attention, or has called out so many scores of pages of observation and speculation. These are to be found scattered through magazines, agricultural journals, and common newspapers. But, in defiance of them all, the Hessian fly continues its destructive work, and is probably as little under the actual control of man as it was half a century ago . Whether this insect was an original inhabitant of this country, or was imported by the Hessian soldiers, is a question not yet settled. At the time of the discussion which led to the prohibit or order, an extensive inquiry in Europe resulted in the conclusion that the insect was wholly unknown there. Met, in the year 1834, it was found existing in several places in southern Europe, and injuring the wheat in the same manner as in this country. This important discovery was made by my friend, Mrojames D. Ana, who had previously been engaged with me in the examination of the Hessian fly, and was well qualified to decide upon the case American Journal of Sciences, x li, 153.) Moreover, we have an account from the vicinity of Geneva, in Switzerland, reported by Duhamel, of an insect destroying the wheat there as long since as 1732, in the manner of the Hessian fly; and an account, in 1823, by Add i, of what is probably the same insect, in various places in I talk. To traces have been detected of any insect of the habits of the Hessian fly, in our country, earlier than the year 1776 ; and if this insect is a native of North America, what plant sustained it before wheat, rye, and barley, were imported ?a? In the other hand, we have no proof that the Hessian fly has ever been found in Germany; and it is certain that, if the' wheat were reaped in the ordinary manner, nearly all the available insects would be left in the stubble; and, further, the straw alleged to have been brought by the Hessians mast have been that which ripened in the summer of 1775, and from which most of the insects which it contained would have escaped before August, 1776. In a question of such uncertainty, no one need quarrel with anothers opinion. The first scientific description of the Hessian fly was published in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, for July, 1817, (to. 3, i, 45,) by the late distinguished entomologist, Thomas May. He there gives it the systematic name of the cecidomyid destruction; and to his description adds a. few remarks relative to its habits, and furnishes, also, an account of another insect, by which the fly is often destroyed. Without going into a minute and tedious technical description, the following account is offered, as probably sufficient to enable an observer to identify the insect in its various transformations The Hessian fly is a two winged insect, with head, eyes, and thorax, black; the head is small and depressed; the pale i (or mouth fellers) are three or four jointed the basal one being the smallest; the antennae are about half as long as the body, and consist each of from 14 to 17 oval joints, besides the basal joint, which appears double; the wings are large, hairy, rounded at the tip, and have each two or three longitudinal nerves i the abdomen is of a tawny red, and furnished, irregularly, with many black hairs; consists of seven rings or segments, besides the ovipositor, Which is of two sides, and of arose red color ; the ovipositor, when extended to the utmost, is about one third as long as the abdomen; length of body, from the front of the head to the end of the abdomen, about one-eighth of an inch; the legs are 163 [a[ 75 long arid slender, pale red d covered scarcely with dark hair. Tlhemale is equal in size to the female, but generally less black, with antennsasomnwhat longer, and about three-fourths the length of the body. The joints of the antennae are globular, and slightly separated from each other. Several other species of the genus cecidomyia, or one closely allied to it, are common in this region. But the Hessian fly is the largest and dark est of our species with which I am acquainted. The eggs are laid in the long creases or furrows of the upper surface of the leaves (i. e. the blade or strap shaped part) of the young wheat plant. While depositing her eggs, the insect stands with her head towards the point or extremity of the leaf, and at various distances between the point and where the leaf joins and surrounds the stalk. The number found on a single leaf varies from a single egg up to thirty, or even more o. The egg is about a fiftieth of an inch long, cylindrical, rounded at the ends glossy and' translucent, of a pale red color, becoming, in a few hours, irregularly spotted with deeper red. Between its exclusion and its watching, these red spots are continually changing in number, size, and position; and sometimes nearly all disappear. A little while before watching two lateral rows of opaque white spots, about ten in number, can be seen in each egg. In four days, more or less, according to the weather, the egg is hatched; the little wrinkled maggot, or lavra, creeps out of the delicate membranous egg skin, crawls down the leaf, enters the sheath, and proceeds along the stalk, usually as far as the next joint below. Were it fastens, length wise, and head downwards, to the tender stalk, and lives upon the sap. It does not gnaws the stalk, nor does it enter the central cavity thereof; but, as the lavra increases in size, it gradually becomes imbedded in the substance of the stalk. After taking its station, the lavra moves no more, gradually loses its reddish color and wrinkled appearance, becomes plump and to rapid, is at first semi translucent, and their more and more clouded with internal white spots; and, when near maturity, the middle of the intestinal parts is of a greenish color. I n. five or six weeks (varying with the season) the lavra begins to turn brown, and s pon becomes of a bright chestnut color. In this state, the insect bears some resemblance to a flax seed; and many observers speak of this as the flax seed state. The lavra has now become a chrysalis, or papa, and takes no more food. The papa within gradually c leaves off from n the outer skin, and, in the course of two or three weeks, is entirely detached from it, so that the skin of the lavra (now brown and hardened, and of a sort of leathery texture) has become a case or shell for the papa inside The papa shell is, of course, in size and form, like the lavra: it is oval, bulging out beneath, and of the same curve above as the outside of the stalk; divided by cross lines into twelve segments, and is about an eighth of an inch long. Within this shell the papa gradually advances towards the winged state; it contracts in length, but not in breadth; and its skin appears covered "with minute elevations. Must before evolution, we find the papa invested in a delicate membrane, or scarf, (which, not long previous, was its outer skin) through which many parts of the future fly may be distinctly see ri. Finally, this scarf splits along the thorax, or back, and the insect comes forth, both from this and the papa shell, a perfect two winged fly. This is, in brief, the history of an individual which has been so fortunate as to escape all the numerous enemies with which its race is surbf75164rounded from the moment the egg is deposited; but of these, more hereafter .,I n the Northern and Middle States, at least, winter wheat is sown in September or October. Soon after the plants have appeared above ground, the Hessian fly begins to lay her eggs upon them; and this operation is continued during several weeks, according to the season k The eggs laid on the green leaves are in a few days hatched, and the young larvwacrawl down the stalk, and take their stations; generally clustering around the stalk at the nearest joint below. Were, by sucking of the plant, they increase in size, become full and hard, and, pressing deeply into the stalk, they impair its growth; and if their number about one joint is large, the stalk is killed. Frequently the plant, although impoverished, advances far enough to head out; but when the grain begins to fill, its own weight, or perhaps the wind, causes the stalk to break down. The injury done to the wheat is occasioned by the exhaustion of the sap, and by the pressure on the yielding stalk .a. In five or six weeks the large stop feeding, the outer skin turns brown, and within this brown and leathery case the papa pass the winter generally a little below the surface of the earth. in April and May the fly is again found depositing her eggs on the same wheat, (viz: that from grains own the preceding autumn) and also on the spring wheat which has just come up. The sd eggs hat ch, and the larvae therefrom operate in the same manner as those of the autumn previous. These large become pus about the middle of June. The flies which lay their eggs in the spring are probably in part from the papa which became such late in the preceding autumn, and partly from papa e contained in stubble left the preceding summer. The period of the existence of the Hessian fly in the papa or flax seed state is exceedingly variable. After much observation, my own opinion is, that, in general, papa e which become such late in the autumn evolve the winged insect partly during the next spring, and partly in the summer and autumn following. Those papa e which become such about June evolve the winged insect partly during the next autumn and partly during the year succeeding. The Hessian fly is attacked by numerous foes, which, in various stages of its existence, destroy a large part of every generation. Whether it has, in its winged state, any enemies, except the ordinary destroyeds of flies, I know not. The eggs, while lying on the leaves of the young plant, are visited by a very minute four winged insect, (a species of platygasterwhich lays in them its own eggs. From later observation, it appears that, occasionally, as many as five or six eggs of this parasite are laid in a single eg go of the Hessian fly. The latter egg patches and becomes a papa, as usual; but from the papa case, instead of the Hessian fly, issues one or more of these minute parasites. The pump, while imbedded in the stalk, are attacked by at least three different minute parasites, (four winged bymenoptera) which, boring through the sheath of the stalk, deposit e their eggs in the body within and the latter is finally devoured by the parasite lavra. These are the principal means by which the multiplication of the Hessian fly is re trained within tolerable limits. Although the loss annually sustained by the wheat growers of this country, in consequence of the ravages of the Hessian fly, is severe, yet it is well nigh impossible to ascertain even its probable amount. As long 165 [a[ 75 Since as 1800, Dr. S. L. Site hill, of New Work, affirmed that the insect is more formidable to us than would be an army of twenty thousand Hessians' In 1804, President Wight, of Pale College, remarked that" this insect is feeble and helpless in the extreme, defenceless against the least enemy, and crushed by the most delicate touch; yet, for many years it has taxed this country, ann u ally, more, perhaps, than a million of dollars' At the present day, the amount of the injury inflicted probably far exceeds what it was forty years since ; and to discover some feasible mode of ex terminating the insect, or at least of arresting its ravages, is an object of great importance to this country. Various re medial measures have, from time to time, been proposed most of which I will here state 1st. Keeping the seed wheat in elder juice, solution of notre, boiling water, or other liquids; or rolling in lime, ashes, or some other substance, in order to kill the eggs. But as the eggs of the Hessian fly are not on the seed, they will never be hurt by such processes. To far as these means give vigor to the plant, they may be of some little service 2d. Owing seed obtained from places in which the insect has not made its appearance, (american Museum, iv, 47.) This recommendation also assumes the error, that the eggs are laid on the grain, and will be found, as it has often proved, useless as respects this insect 3d. Abstaining rigidly throughout the whole grain growing region of North America from planting wheat, rye, barley, or oats, for one two, or three years, and thus to starve out the insect! This plan might be effectual, but would obviously involve some inconvenience s 4th. Maturing the land very highly, so that the plants will grow vigorously, and be sooner out of the way of the insect, and also better able to resist it. This proposal has some merit, but does nothing towards destroying the insect 5th Owing some variety of bearded wheat, flint wheat, &c, supposed to have a harder and more solid stalk than common wheat, and better able to withstand the impression of the larvae. A suggestion of some value, but, equally with 4th, leaves the insect un harmed 6th. Fumigating the wheat field, and sprinkling the young wheat with infusion of elder and with other steeps. If successful, which is quite ,uncertain, it is plain that these measures are impracticable on a large scale 7th. Owing winter wheat very late in the autumn, so that the fly shalt have mostly disappeared before the plants are large enough to be attacked to doubt this plan is to some extent useful, but the wheat sown late is in great danger of perishing during the winter. The fly will of course attack it in the spring, yet one attack will do less damage than two 8th. Owing oats early in autumn on the intended wheat field; I tis supposed the fly will lay its eggs on the plant; then let them be ploughed in, and the wheat sown. The fly having nearly exhausted itself on the oats, the wheat will suffer less. This plan may possibly be of some partial utility 9th. Drawing a heavy roller over the young wheat, both in au turn and spring. This process must be useful, in crushing many eggs and larvae 10th. Permitting sheep tend other animals to graze the wheat fields while the insects are laying their eggs. By these means, large numbers of the eggs will be devoured with the leaves 11th. Turning the stubble immediately after harvest, and sloughing icid127S75 166 the remains. This is by far the most practicable and effectual mode of ex terminating, the insect, or, at least, of checking its increase. In the stubble are many pulse of the fly, at this time completely in our power if, in reaping, the stubble is left high, the fire would sweep rapidly over afield, and destroy nearly all these pipe ; the few which escaped the fire would, by the plough, be buried so deep as to perish in the earth; mere sloughing in of the stubble must be highly useful. If the two recommendations last named were thoroughly put in practice over the wholeountrynot only upon wheat, but also on rye and barley, and any other plants attacked by the Hessian fly the ravages of this insect would, in all probability, ere long, become scarcely worthy of notice. It may not be improper, in this place, to state that the foregoing account of the habits of the Hessian fly is derived from my own long continued observations, and that I have moreover endeavored to consult all the papers of any importance which have been published on the sub There are in the United States, besides the Hessian fly, several other insects which attack the wheat while in the field. Those persons who assert that the former lays its eggs on the grain in the spike or head, have undoubtedly mistaken for the Hessian fly some one of these other insects. The following brief notices of the more important of these enemies, I have abridged from the accounts comprised in D~. T. W. Harriss' Treatise on some of the I n sects of New England, which are I injurious to Vegetation" (lamb. 1842. 459 pages, 8 vo) a work of great interest and value. In it the inquirer will find a faithful digest of all the reliable information we have on the numerous insects which injure our plants, fruits, and trees; and, in addition, he will learn the means of defence, so far as any shave been discovered. The book ought to be in the hands of every intelligent farmer and orchard ist 1. A grain moth, (Angoumois mothalucita cereal elba, Ll iv) probably the same as described by Colonel Garter, in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, volume i, 1771; and by J. To rain, in ceases Archives of Useful Knowledge, volume ii, 1812. It is about three eighths of an inch long when its wings are shut. The upper wings are of a light brown satin color and lustre, covering the body horizontally above, but drooping a little at the sides. The lower wings and the rest of the body are ash colored. The moth lays her eggs usually on the young and tender grain in the field; each cater pillar from these eggs selects a single grain, burrows into it, and remains concealed, devouring the meal within. Subjecting the grain to a heat of 16 70 War, for twelve hours, in an oven, will kill the insect 2. The English wheat fly (tips la tr it ici, Air by) is a small orange colored two winged ignat, which lays its eggs in the head of wheat while blossoming. The maggots from these eggs are without feet, tapering towards the head, at first perfectly transparent and color less, but soon becoming, orange yellow; and when mature, are each about an eighth of an inch long. It is supposed they devour the pollen, and prevent the setting of the grain; the maggots fall from the spike to the earth, within which they undergo their final transformations. This insect (dr one very167EI 75 ]similar to it) has done much damage in the Northern States and in Canada for several years past; but no effectual mode of preventing the mischief, or of destroying the insect, appears to have been devised 3. The wheat caterpillarThis is a span worm of brownish color, with twelve feet-six near each end of the body. It feeds on the berne l in the milky state, and also devours the terminating end of the ripened grain t is said to be found in the chaff when the grain is threshed. We have little certain knowledge concerning the parent insect or its transformations. In addition to these three, there are probably other insects more or less injurious to our wheat crops. Such has been published in our journals relative to these de predator; yet their habits are imperfectly understood, and many of the accounts are confused and contradictory. It is greatly to be desired, that all who have the opportunity should endeavor to make careful observations, and communicate them to the public. These observations must be accompanied by accurate descriptions of the insect under examination, and in its various stages; otherwise, most of the labor will be spent in vain. No. 2. Extracts from Dr. Harriss work. Of I Nsects. The wheat crops in England and Scotland often suffer severely from the depredations of the maggots of a very small ignat, called the wheat fly, or the cecidomyia tr it ici of Mr. Air by. This insect seems to have been long known in England, as appears from the following extract from a letter, by or. Christopher Bullet, written in 1771, and published in the " Philosophical Transactions" for 1772: 'that the farmers call the yellows in wheat, and which they consider as a kind of mildew, is, in fact, occasioned by a small yellow fly, with blue wings, about the size of a ignat. His blows in the ear of the corn, and produces a worm, almost invisible to the naked eye; but, being seen through a pocket microscope, it appears a large yellow maggot, of the color and gloss of amber, and is so prolific that distinctly counted forty-one living yellow maggots in the dusk of one single grain of wheat a number sufficient to eat up and destroy the corn in a whole ear. One of those yellow flies laid at least eight or ten eggs, of an of long shape, on my thumb, only while carrying by the wing across three or four ridges. In 1795, the history of this insect was investigated by Mr. War sham ;a* and since that time Mr. Air by, i Mr. Morris, and Or Shirreff, t have also turned their attention to it. The investigations of these gentlemen have become very interesting to us, on account of the recent appearance in our own country, and the extensive ravages, of an insect apparently identical with the Etiropean wheat fly. The following account of the latter will serve to show how far the European and American wheat flies agree in their essential characters and Transactions of the Linnean Society" vol. iii, p. 142, and vol. iv, p. 224.4( Transactions of the Linnean Society" vol. iv, p. 230, and vol. v, p. 96,C "Coudons Magazine of Natural History" vol. ii, pp. 323 and 448.intheir, habits* The European wheat fly somewhat resembles a mosquito in form, but is very small, being only about one tenth of an inch long. I to body is orange colored. I to two wings are transparent, andehangeabe in color; they are narrow at the base, rounded at the tip, and are fringed with little hairs on the eds. I to long an ten nm, or horns, cons st, in the female, of twelve little bead like joints, each encircled with minute hairs; those of the male will probably be found to have a greater number of joints. Towards the end of June, or when the wheat is in blossom, these flies appear in swarms in the wheat fields during the evening, at which time they are very active. The females generally lay their eggs before nine o clock at night, thrusting them, by means of a longretraetile tube in the end of their bodies, within the, chaff y scales of theflPowrs, in clusters of from two to fifteen, or more. By day they remain at est on the stems and leaves of the plants, where they are shaded from the heat of the sun. They continue to appear and lay their eggs throughout a period of thirty-nine days. The eggs are of long, transparent, and of a pale buff color, and hat ch in eight or. ten days after they are laid. The young insects produced from them are little foot less maggots, tapering towards the head, and blunt at the hinder extremity, with the rings of the body somewhat wrinkled and bulging at the sides. They are at first perfectly transparent and color less, but sq on take a deep yellow or orange color. They do not travel from one for et to another, but move in a wriggling manner, and by sudden jerks of the body, when disturbed. As many as forty-seven have been counted in a single for et. It is supposed that- they live at first upon the pollen, and thereby prevent the fertilization of the grain. They are soon seen, however, to crowd around th lower part of the germ, and there appear to subsist in the, matter destined to have formed the grain. The latter, in consequence of their depredations, becomes shrivelled and abortive; and, in some seasons, a considerable part of the crop is thereby rendered worthless, The maggots, when fully grown, are nearly one-eighth of an inch long, Mr. War sham and Mr. Air by found some of them changed to pupaewithin the ears of the wheat; and from these they obtained the fly early in September. The papa, represented by them, is rather smaller than the full, grown maggot, of a brownish yellow color, and of an of long oval form, tapering at each end. The papa e found in the ears were very few in number scarcely one to fifty of the maggots. Hence Mr. Air by supposes that the latter are not ordinarily transformed to flies before the spring. Towards the end of September, he carefully took off the skin of one of them, and found that the insect within still retained the maggot form, and conjectures that the papa is not usually complete until the following spring. According to Mr. Morris, the maggots quit the ears oftheiweat by the 1st of August, descend to the ground, and go into it to the depth of half an inch. That they remain here, unchanged, through the winter, and finish their transformations, and come out of the ground in the winged form in the spring, when the wheat is about to blossom, is rendered probable from the great number of the flies found by Mr. Shirreff, in the month of June, in, all the fields where wheat had been raised* See also my article on wheat insects in the "new England Farmer for March 31, 1841 rah, p. 306.168f 75 l the year before. The increase of these flies is somewhat clip id by the attacks of three different parasites, which have been descried by Mr. Lie by. : .a. D -in insect, resembling the foregoing in. its destructive habits, and known in it maggot form, by the name of the " grain wormcid127" has been observed, for several years, in the Northern and Eastern parts of the .united States, and in Canada. It seems, by some, to have been, mistake f .the grain weevil, the Angoumois grain moth, and the Hessian fly; and its history has, been so, confounded with that of another insect, also called the grain worm in some parts of the country, that it is: difficult to ascertain the amount: of injury done l by either of them alone. The wheat fly is said to have been first seen in America about the year 1828,* in the northern part of Vermont, and on the borders of Power Canada, From these places ,its ravages have gradually extended, in various directions, from year to year. A considerable part of Upper Canada, of New Work, New Hampshire and of Massachusetts, have been visited by it; and, in 1834, it appeared in Paine, which it has traversed, in an easterly course, at the rate. of twenty or: thirty miles a year. The country over which it has spread has continued to suffer i more or less from its alarming depredations, the loss by which has been found to vary from about one tenth part to nearly the whole of the annual crop of wheat; nor has the insect entirely disappeared in any place till it has been starved out by a change of agriculture, or by the substitution of late sown spring wheat for the other varieties of grain6Many communications on this destructive insect have appeared in " Thegenesee Farmer' and in "the Cultivator" some of them written by the late Judge Duel, by whom, as well as by the, editors of " The Yankeefarmer' rewards were offered for the discovery of the means to prevent its ravages. Premiums have also been proposed, for the same end, by the" Kennebec County Agricultural Society" in Paine, which were followed by the publication, in "the Paine Farmer" of three ' essays on the grain worm: " presented to that, society. These essays were reprinted in. the seventeenth volume of the " New England Farmer" wherein, as well as in some other volumes of the same work, several other articles on, this insect may be found. From these sources, and more especially from son me interesting letters where with I have been favored by a lady lately resident in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, the foregoing and following statements are chiefly derived. A continued series of observations, conducted with care, and with a due regard to dates, is still wanted, to complete the history of the various insects which are injurious to grain in this country. Couldmr. Berwick (who is so well qualified for the task) be induced to devote the necessary time and attention to this subject, we have reason to think that the interests of science and of agriculture would be greatly promoted thereby. The american wheat insect, in its winged form, has not yet fallen under my- note. It is stated by Judge Duel, Mrs. Age, and :others, to agree exactly with the description of the European wheat fly, (cecidomyia tr it ici) being a very small orange colored ignat, with long slender legs, and two transparent wings, which reflect the tints of the rainbow, I immense* Judge Duels report in 'a" The Cultivator" vol. vi, page 26 ; and " New England Farmeryvol. ix, page 42. Mr. Fewest says that its first appearance in western Vermont occurred in 18204See ' New England Farmer" vol. xix, page 301.)[ 75 ]170 swarms of these orange colored gnaws infect fields of grain towards the last of June. While the sun shines, they conceal themselves among the leaves and weeds near the ground. They take" wing during the morning and evening twilight, and also in cloudy weather, when they lay their eggs in the opening flowers of the grain. New swarms continue to come forth, in succession till the end of July ; but Mr. Duel says that the principal deposit of egs is made in the first half of July, when late sown winter wheat and early sown spring wheat are in the blossom or milk. The flies are not confined to wheat alone, but deposit e in barley, rye, and oats, when these plants are in flower at the time of their appearance. The eggs hat ch in about eight days after they are laid, when the little yellow maggots or grain worms may be found within the chaff y scales of the grain. Being hatched at various times during a period of four or five weeks, the yep not all arrive at maturity together. Mrs. Age informs me that they appear to come to their growth in twelve or fourteen days. Specimens of these maggots, which she has sent to me, were found to agree, in every respect, with the descriptions and figures of those of the European wheat fly. They do not exceed one-eighth of an inch in length, and are not provided with feet. From two to fifteen or twenty have been found within the dusk of a single grain, and sometimes in every dusk in the ear. After A shower of rain, they have been seen in such countless numbers on the beards of the wheat, as to give a yellow color to the whole field* These insects prey on the grain in the milky state, and their ravages cease when the grain becomes hard. They do not burrow within the kerseys, but live on the pollen and on the soft matter of the grain, which they probably extract from the base of the germs. It appears, from various statements, that very early and very late wheat escape with comparatively little injury, the amount of which, in other cases, depends upon the condition of the grain at the time when the maggots are hatched. When the maggot s begin their depredations, soon after .the blossoming of the grain, they do the greatest injury ; for the kerseys never fill out at all. Pinched or partly filled kerseys are the consequence of their attacks when the grain is more advanced. The hulls of the impoverished kerseys will always be found split open on the convex side, so as to expose the embryo. This is caused by the drying and shrinking of the hull, after a portion of the contents thereof has been sucked out by the maggots. Towards the end of July, and in the beginning of August, the full grown maggots leave off eating, and become sluggish and to rapid, preparatory to mounting their skins. His process, which has been alluded to by Judge Duel, and some other writers, has been carefully observed by Mrs. Age, who has sent to me the maggot s before and after mounting, together with some of their cast skins. It takes place in the following manner: The body of the maggot gradually shrinks in length within its skin, and becomes more flattened and less pointed, as a nay easily be seen through the delicate transparent skin, which retains neatly its original form and dimensions, and extends a little beyond the included insect at each end. The to rapid state lasts only a few days; after which, the insect casts off its skin, leaving the latter entire, except a little rent in one end of it. This cast skin is exceedingly thin and color less, and, through a microscope, is seen to be marked with eleven transverse* " New England Farmer" vol. xii, page 60.171[ 75 ]lines. After shedding its skin, the maggot recovers its activity, and writes about as at first, but takes no food. It is shorter, somewhat flattened, and more out use than before, and is of a deeper yellow color, with an oblonggreenish spot in. the middle of the body. Within two or three days after mounting, the maggots either drop of their own accord, or are shaken out of the ears by the wind, and fall to the ground. They do not let themselves down by threads, for they are not able to spin. Nearly all of the mr disappear before the middle of August; and they are very rarely found in the grain at the time of harvest. Some persons have stated that they are transformed to flies in the ears of the grain; having, probably, mistaken the cast skins found therein for the shells of the chrysalis or papa. We have good reason for believing that the maggots burrow in the ground, and remain there unchanged, in a to rapid state, through the winter. Whether, on the approach of spring, they again, cast off their skins, in order to becomepupae, or whether the skin gardens and remains as a shell to protect the papa, has not been determined; but it is probable that the skin is not cast off till the insect comes forth in the winged form. The last change seems to occur in June and July, when great numbers of the flies have been seen, apparently coming from the ground, in fields where grain was raised the year before. Several cases of the efficacy of fumigation in preventing the depredations of these insects are recorded in our agricultural papers* For this purpose brims tone has been used, in the proportion of one pound to every bushel of seed sown. Strips of woollen cloth, dipped in melted brims tone, and fastened to sticks in different parts of the field, and .particularly on the wind ward side, are set on fire, for several evenings in succession, at the time when the grain is in blossom; the smoke and fumes thus penetrate the standing grain, and prove very offensive or destructive to the flies, which are laying their eggs. A thick smoke from heaps of burning weeds, sprinkled with brims tone, around the sides of the field, has also been recommended. Time or ashes strewn over the grain when in blossom, has, in some cases, appeared to protect the crop; and the Rev. Henry Vol man, the commissioner for the agricultural survey of Massachusetts, says that this preventive, if not infallible, may be re lie on with strong confidence t For every acre of grain, from one peck to a bushel of newly soaked lime, or, of good wood ashes, will be required; and this should be scattered over the plants when they are wet with dew or rain. Two or three applications of it have sometimes been found necessary. Whether it be possible to destroy the maggots after they have left the grain, and have be taken themselves to their winter quarters, just below the surface of the ground, remains to be proved. Some persons have advised burning the stubble, and sloughing up the ground soon after the grain is harvested, in order to kill the maggots, or to bury them so deeply that they could not make their escape after they Were transformed to flies. Perhaps thoroughly lining the soil before it is ploughed may contribute to the destruction of the insects. It is stated that our crops may be saved from injury by sowing early in the autumn or late in the spring. By the first, it is supposed that the grain will become hard before many of the flies make their appearance; and by the latter, the plants do not come Among others, see "the Cultivator" vol. v, p. 136.t("Third Report on the Agriculture of Massachusetts" p. 67.[ 75] ,172 into blossom until the flies have disappeared. In those parts of Nerengland. where these insects have done the greatest injury, the c cultivation i of falls own or winter grain has been given up; and this, for some years to come, will be found the safest course. The proper time for sowing in, the spring will vary with the latitude and elevation of the place and the forward ness of the season. From numerous observations made in this part of the country, it appears that grain sown after the 15th or 20 th of May generally escapes the ravages of these destructive insects. Late sowing has almost entirely banished the wheat flies from those parts of Vermont where they first appeared; and there is good reason to expect. that these de predator will be completely starved out and exterminated, when the means above recommended have been generally adopted and persevered in for several years in succession. Mrs, Age has discovered another pernicious insect in the ears ?of growing: wheat. It seems to agree with the .accounts of the thiipscerealium, which sometimes infects wheat in Europe to a great extent. This insect: belongs to the order hemipterd. In its lavra state, it is smaller than the wheat maggot, is orange colored, and .is provided with is ix legs, two :antennae, and a short beak, and is very nimble in. its motions. It is supposed to suck out the juices of the seed thus cause no the latter to: shrink, and become what the English. farmers call hung led. His little pest may probably be destroyed by giving the grain a thorough coating r of soaked. lime. Our agricultural papers contain some accounts of an insect or of insects much larger than the maggots of the wheat fly, growing to the length of three-eighths of an inch, or more, and devouring the grain in the ear and after it is harvested- The insects to which I allude have received the names of wheat r worms, gray worms, and brown weevils; and, although these different i names may possibly refer to two or more distinct species, I am inclined to think that all of them are intended for only one kind of insect. Sometimes this has also been called the grain worm; whereby it becomes somewhat difficult to separate the accounts of its history and depredations from those of the cecidomyia, or wheat insect, described in the foregoing pages. It may, however, very safely be asserted that the wheat worm of the west i n part of New York and of the northern part of Pennsylvania is entirely distinct from the maggots of our wheat fly; and, that it does not belong to the same order of insects. From the description of it, published in the sixth volume of "the Cultivator" page 43, by Mr. Willis May lord, this de predator appears to be a cater pillar, or span worm being provided with 12 feet, 6 of which are situated near each extremity of its body. Like other span worms, or geometry, it has the power of spinning and suspending itself by a thread. Mr. May lord says that it is of a yellowish brown or butter nut color; that it not only feeds on the kernelin the milky state, but also devours the terminating end of the ripened grain, without, however, burying itself within the hull; and that it is found in great numbers in the chaff, when the grain is threshed. He says, moreover, that it has been known for years in the western part of New Work; and that it is not so much the new appearance of this insect, as its increase, which has caused the present alarm respecting it. Thetransformations, and the appearance of this insect in its perfected state, have not yet been described. Mr. Nathaniel Will, of Warren, Pennsylva173 [a[ 5 ni a, has given a somewhat different description of it* In threshing ,his winter wheat, immediately after harvest, he found among thesecreeningsa vast army of this new enemy. He says that it was a caterpillariaboutthreeeighths of an inch in length when fully grown, and apparently of a straw color; but, when seen' through a magnified, was found to bestripedlengthwise with orange and c real color. I to head was dark brown. I twas provided i with legs, could suspend itself by a thread and resembled a cater pillar in all its motions. This insect ought not to be confounded with the smaller worms found by Or, Will in the upper joints of the stems of the wheat, and within the kerseys, until their identity has been proved by further observations. It appears highly probable that Mr. May lords and or. Will Is wheat cater pillars are the same, notwithstanding the difference in their color. I n sects of the same size as these cater pillars, and of a brownish color, have been found in various parts of Paine, where they have done much injury to the grain. Unlike the maggots of the wheat fly, with which they have been confounded, they remain deprecating upon the ears of the grain until after the time of harvest. I immense numbers of them have been seen upon barn floors, where the grain has been threshed; but they soon crawl away, and conceal themselves in are vices, where they probably undergo their transformations. Mr. Elijah Good, of Winthrop; Paine, says that the chrysalis has been observed in the chaff late in the fall t A gentleman from the southern part of Penobscbt countyrriiforms me that he win no wed out nearly a bushel of these insects from his wheat in the autumn of 1840; and he confirms the statements of others, that these worms devour the ,grain when in the milk, and also after it has become hard. In the autumn of 1838, the Rev. Henry Vol man observed the same insect in the town of Fremont, in Hers hire county, Massachusetts. It was separated from thwow heat, in great quantities, by threshing and win no wing the grain' These wheat worms, (or wheat eaterpiillarsas they ought to be called, if the foregoing accounts really refer to the same kind of insect) are supposed, by some persons, to be identical with the c lover worms, which have been found in c lover in various parts of the country, and have often been seen spinning down from lofty and rows where c lover has been st owed away. A striking similarity between n them has been noticed by a writer in the " Genesee Farmer j Stephensibley, Esq , informs me that he observed the c lover worms in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, many years ago, suspended in such numbers by their threads from a newly gathered c lover now, and from the timbers of the building, as to be very troublesome and offensive to persons passing through the barn. He also states that, if he recollects rightly, these i sects were of a brown color, and about half an inch long. I am sorry to leave the history of these wheat worms unfinished ; but hope that the foregoing statements, which have been carefully collected from various sources, will tend to remove some of the difficulties where with th subject has been heretofore involved. The contradictory statements arid unsatisfactory discussions that have appeared in some of our papers respecting theSThe Cultivator" vol lip. 21..- "new England Farmer" vol. xvii, p. 73. Second Report on the Agriculture ofMassaaueFtts" y: 99. New England Farmer" ,of. xvii, p. 73. S- we England Farmer" vol. xvii, p. 164.[75 174 ravages of these worms and the maggots of the wheat fly might have been avoided, if the writers on these insects had always been careful to give a correct 'and full description of the insects in question. Had this bee id done, a crawling worm or cater pillar, of a brownish color, three-eighths or half of an inch in length, probably provided with legs, and capable of suspending itself by a silken thread of its own spinning, would never have been mistaken for a writhing maggot, of a deep yellow color, only one tenth of an inch long, destitute of legs, and unable to spin a thread. When the transformations of the former are known, and the insect is obtained in its winged or perfected state, it will undoubtedly turn out to be a very different creature from the tiny orange colored wheat fly Until its transformations are ascertained, it will be of little use to speck late on the means to be used against its ravages. No. 3. Observations by General Arm on. Vari  Eti Of Of Wheat. The culture of wheat has called forth the attention of the agriculturists in the temperate zones more extensively than any other grain. The varieties have been extensively multiplied; each variety has its advocate. The varieties cultivated three thousand years ago appear to have been much inferior to some of the varieties of the present day. The quantity was probably greater than that obtained from some of the most valuable varieties of the present time; but the grain was coarse, containing much less of the essential qualities of good wheatgluten and starch. The varieties cultivated at the present day appear to have as great a difference in their quality as there was between that cultivated before the Christian era and the present time. Whi   Of Fli Ntthe origin of this valuable variety is not certainly known. It is claimed that it was introduced into New Jersey from Pain in 1814; and from thence spread through many of our wheat growing districts. It is likewise claimed to have been brought from the Black sea into New York about the same time. The supposition that it originated in the town of Some, One ida county, in this State, where it Was called" mud flint" from having been found growing on much soil, is not entitled to serious consideration. I to first appearance in western New York was about twenty-five years since. The strongest probability is, that it was first brought from the Black sea into this State. I to origin is of less importance than the proper appreciation of its value to the cultivate or. It is generally acknowledged to be one of the most valuable varieties that has been introduced to the wheat growers of the Northern States. Descriptionthe chaff is whiter than in most varieties. A few short and soft beards are found in the upper end of the heads, which are inclined to droop somewhat like the heads of barley. The straw may be said to be of medium length, and not as large as the straw of the common varieties. At the root it is more solid, and of a wiry appearance being more stiff, and not as subject to lodge as when it was first introduced. The heads are not long, but generally well filled with from thirty to forty kerseys in each head. The berne l is of a white flint y appearance, and very 175[ 75 ]solid, with a thin 1 ran; the merry is of good size; the straw is very white, and of a bright appearance having less leaf on the straw than any other variety I have had under cultivation. There is one peculiarity about this variety, not met with in any other with which I am acquainted that is, the tenacity with which the merry adheres to the chaff in its chamber. I t must be very ripe to waste by shelling when cut; and when threshed, but little of the chaff is separated from the straw. The only objection to this variety, when first introduced, was, that it was difficult to tread it out with horses, or beat it out with the flail; and then the white caps adhered so closely to the berne l, that it was frequently complained of by the millers. But, on the introduction of threshing machines, this objection was entirely removed; for, in passing through the machine, the chaff is completely torn from the merry. That which was formerly a strong objection is now considered a decided advantage, as it does not suffer by standing until it is fully ripe, and gives the wheat grower more time to secure his crop without loss. When it was first introduced, it was mostly sought for to sow after corn, or on land not well prepared, and on thin and light soils seldom being affected by the frost of winter, except on some bleak points where the snow is off most of the winter, or where the snow would blow on and remain in heavy drifts till late in the spring where, in fact, no variety that we have introduced could succeed. This variety has withstood the Hessian fly better than any other now cultivated. The solid ness of the straw at the root gives the fly less chance of destroying it, as it is not as easily eaten off when the merry is filling the time when wheat is most injured by the fly. Some of the s talks of this variety will be so eaten as to fall down, yet mature the merry; while, in other varieties, after it has fallen from the injury of the fly, the greater part of it fails to mature. The hard and flint y merry is not easily affected by the rains, and it is, consequently, less subject to "grow" from exposure in an unfavorable harvest than other varieties. I have never known it to grow while standing in the field, and seldom while standing in the shock; but when committed to the earth, it vegetables very readily. Some have supposed that, by threshing it in a machine, many kerseys are injured so that they will not ve get ate. I have frequently threshed a few bushels with a flail, and sown it side by side with that threshed with the machine, and have not yet become satisfied that the threshing with the machine has proved injurious to wheat intended for seed. The amount of seed, and time of sowing There is some difference in opinion as to the quantity required to be sown to the acre. 'first, we must take into consideration the soil, its quality, (for on that much depends) and the time. of sowing. In clay loam soils, the first week in September is the best time for this section of the State. It is important to have it take a good root before winter; and, if sown earlier, the fly is very apt to destroy some of it in the fall; and if it should be so large as to nearly cover the ground the last of October, it should be eaten off by cattle or sheep, as it is less liable to be injured by deep snows. Were one bushel of seed to the acre is as good as more on soils in good condition if sown ten days later, add one peck more seed per acre. In sandy, gravely loams, the second week in September is the time most favorable[ 5 176 for sowing; if earlier; the fly is very apt to affect it, so as to diinihthecrop. Heat, on such soils, appears to suffer more from the fly than one lay soils. In these soils, one bushel per acre; and, if the soil is not in good condition, one peck more should be sown. The white flint spreads, or tillers, more than the common varieties; and, when I have sown a bush el and a half the second week in September, it was too thick the straw fine, the heads short, and the berryniot as large and fine as it would have been if one peck less had been sown to the acre. There is one advantage in sowing thick on soils where it is subject to be affected by rust it will ripe n two or three days earlier. That is an important consideration on soils unfavorable to the early ripe king of wheat. The yield per acre While this kind of wheat has been generally received with great favor, as one of the most productive varieties, the shortness of its head has, by some been thought an objection. I believe the head is as large, in proportion to the size of the straw, as the other varieties. The amount per acre here, on common soils, is from twenty to twenty-five bushels; it frequently exceeds that on strong soils, and i, i some instances, has reached thirty, thirty- five, and forty bushels per acre. In of ne instance, in this town, twelve acres produced 648 bushels, being fifty-four bushels to the acre; and the greatest yield ever known in this county, 68 -bushels per acre, was from seed one half white flint, the other half of red chaff bald. I to quaclityThis variety is held in high estimation wherever it has been introduced. The millers give it the preference over all others. I to white flint y character and heavy merry make it tell in the half bushel; the pure wheat weighing from 63 to 67 pounds to the bushel. When I cut before fully ripe, it is from one to three pounds heavier per bushel than when fully ripe. The time of cutting To be the most valuable for the millers, wheat should be cut as soon as the merry has passed from its milky to its doughy state. Heat cut then contains more of the glum ten, and less starch; if suffered to stand till the merry becomes hard, the glum ten is diminished and the starch is increased, which reduces the quantity and quality of the flour; but for seed, it should never be cut till fully ripe :starch is more valuable in its early vegetation than the glum ten. One cause of the increase of smut, of late years, is the cutting of wheat intended for seed too green. Heat cut before it is fully ripe should not be sown. Of     f wheat growers would adhere strictly to the sowing of no seed that is cut before it is fully ripe, they would find smut disappearing, without the preparation of bring and lime. The farmer that neglects to bring and mine his seed wheat does not look to his best interest. Putty wheat ismaueinproved by not cutting until fully ripeQutity ai and amity of flour! The white flint wheat is the most valuable variety that has been introduced into -western New Work, for ti h quantity and quality of its flour. :I to soft mellow feel, and its richness, give it the preference over flour made from any other variety, T iROVED.

My seed wheat weighs 64 pounds to the bushel, and the yield of flour is superior to any other. There I have sold for seed, it has universally been held in the highest estimation. The last three years, I have sold extensively for seed. The past year, I have had orders for it from seven different States, the District of Columbia, and Canada; and where, it has been tried, it has given the greatest satisfaction. In August, 1842,I sold J. Took, of Byron, Genesee county, forty-seven bushels for seed. Whi   Of Provence, From Franceheads middling size and bald chaff of a bluish cast; merry very large and white; br an thin; yielding flour well, and of a good quality. This is one of the most beautiful samples that I have had under cultivation. From its first coming up, it comes forward faster than any other variety I have seen so much so, that it can be distinguished from all the others. The blades are larger and longer, spread more rapidly, producing more straws from a root; it stands the winter well, is not injured by the insect, and ri pens four or five days before the common varieties, yielding well. In one instance, one peck was sown in October, after corn, on less than one-fourth of an acre, and the product was eleven and a half bushels of most beautiful merry at the rate of forty-eight bushels to the acre. The only objection I have to this variety is, it falls down more than any other. The straw is small, long, and soft, with heads large in proportion to the size of the straw, and well filled. Old Red Chaffthis variety was introduced into western i New Work more than forty years ago from the lower part of Pennsylvania, and for more than twenty years it was the favorite variety, and has produced some of the heaviest yields known in this vicinity. Red chaff, bald; straw long, seldom lodging; merry of a good size, and weighing from 60 to 63 pounds to the bushel; white, and br an thin, producing flour well, and of a superior quality. In new oak lands, it is now one of the best varieties that is sown; on old lands, of late years, it appears to have lost some of its former qualities, being more subject to rust and mildew. The insect attacks it more freely than some others, and it has suffered by severe winters. At present, it is not sown as much as formerly. Kentucky Whi   Tebeardedbetter known in western New York as Hutchinson or bearded flint, or Canada flint was introduced into Cayngacounty by Mr. Hutchinson, and has been sown extensively for the last five years, and now is the favorite variety with many. The two years that I have tried it, it has not equalled the improved flint. 'in clay soils, or where wheat is late in ripe king, it may be valuable, as it is supposed to ripe n earlier than other varieties. With me, when sown on the same soils, and at the same time with my flint, it has not ripened any sooner. This is a white chaff bearded wheat; heads short and heavy, (it is called club wheat in some sections) and well filled with a short, white, round merry, weighing from 60 to 65 pounds to the bushel. The merry, being short, packs close in the half bushel; yields flour of good quality, but will not come up to the improved flint. The br an is thicker and more brittle, and will not admit of being ground so close; if it is, the flour is more speck y, exhibiting small particles of br an. If it is not cut before fully ripe, there is a loss in harvesting; for it shells very easily. Very touch of the long, stiff beard, shells it out. It stools or tillers out but little, requiring from one and a half to two bushels of seed per acre. The straw is stiff, and seldom lodges. In river flats and rich soils, where the common varieties would12ir 53 17 8 one, this will not get down. I n sects affect it more readily than they dose other varieties. The heaviest yield of wheat that I have heard of this year i as from this kind. It is somewhat liable to smut, owing to itscid127uuially being cut green. The straw being thick, it matures more after it cut than most kinds. I Ndi  Ana Wheat- His variety was introduced from the State that bears its name; white chaff, bald ; merry white and large; br an thin; the merry not as flint y as the white fling having more of the appearance of theintrdoved flint; some of the best quality weighing 64 I is. to the bushel, produiiniig flour of superior quality and quantity; the straw is larger and longer than the white flint; ri pens about three days sooner; shells easy, so, that there is considerable loss if it remains in the field till fully ripe. It is well adapted to strong soils. In the farm of J. Took, of Byron, it has averaged 0 bushels per acre for 10 years; but, with me, it has not proved as well as the flint. I to early ripe king makes it valuable on late soils. This grain the insects have attacked more than the flint, and it is more liable to be winter killed. Velvet Beard, Of Crate Wheatthis is an English variety, and was introduced into western New York about 16 years since. This is a reddish chaff, bearded, with a large red merry. The straw is large and long; heads long, and well filled; long and very stiff beards; producing well on strong soils. It requires to be sown one and a half bushel to the acre, as it does not spread as well as some other kinds. It is sown mostly an the strong soils of the Genesee flats; being very hardy, and straw stiff, it is not subject to be: thrown out by the frosts of spring. With its stiff straw, it seldom gets down. ' he merry is heavy, weighing from 60 to 64 is. to the bushel. It is 15 per cent. inferior to the white wheat in the quantity and quality of its flour. Flour made from this wheat is of a yellowish cast. It will admit of being sown the last of August being seldom injured by the insects or strong soils. Whieatland Redthis is a new variety, which I originated from the Virginia May. It is a red chaff, bald, heads of medium length, and well filled with a red merry, weighing 66 pounds to the bushel, and producing your of good quality. This is a very hardy variety; straw of good size, and very bright; it has the quality of the Virginia May in its early ripe nag. It has stood our severe winters as well as the most hardy variety that I have tested. I believe it is one of the most valuable kinds that can be introduced on soils where other varieties are subject to rust. The four years that I have tested it, it has had no appearance of rust. I to red merry is objectionable. I know of no red wheat that is equal to the white in quality or quantity of its flour; the br an being thicker, and will not admit of being ground as close. Goldren Dropan English variety; red chaff, bald, long straw, large and stiff; this is more hardy than most of the English varieties. The merry being red, br an thick, and not yielding flour equal to the common varieties, is a strong objection to its culture in this vicinity. I have given up is culture, believing it does not come up to many of the varieties I have had under cultivation. Medi  Terraneanthis variety was introduced into Maryland, from the Mediterranean sea, six years since. It is a light red chaff, bearded, merry red and long, very flint y, br an thick, and producing flour of an inferior quality 179 n a communication from a wheat grower on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake bay, dated September 6, 1842, speaking of the wheat crop, he says: " The variety that has succeeded best here, this season, is the Mediterranean. It is a bearded wheat, and remarkably heavy; but the grain is about as dark as rye, and not plump. I tr i pens about ten days earlier than any other variety, and has escaped every disaster for several years From another from where it was first introduced : " It is a coarse red bearded wheat, and makes inferior flour. I to only merit, in my estimation, is, that it ri pens earlier, and is less liable to rust than any other variety." .a. This variety may prove valuable at the South; being seldom affected with the fly, and its early ripe king is favorable on account of rust. I to long stiff beards, heads short, shelling very easy, (so much so that if it is not cut while in its doughy state, there will be a great loss) and the inferior quality of its flour, are strong objections to its culture, where wheat of a superior quality succeeds well. Blue Stem has been cultivated in Virginia for about 33 years; white chaff, bald, merry white, weighs 64 pounds to the bushel ; br an thin, and producing flour of superior quality. Formerly this was a red wheat now it is changed to a beautiful white. Straw fair size, producing well. It is now one of the most productive varieties cultivated in Virginia. I am giving it a trial. I Tali Of Spri  Of Wheat was introduced by Mr. Path away, of Some, One ida county, New Work, and for several years was much sought for. For the last few years it has not succeeded as well as formerly, and is much less cultivated. This is a bearded wheat: white chaff, heads long, and the chambers standing apart more than the common varieties; merry red, long, not very full; br an thick, and flour of fair quality, Spring wheats are most valuable on soils where the winter varieties are thrown out by the frosts of the spring. Tea Wheat, Of Of    Beri  Of Baldthis is a spring wheat-one of the most valuable of the spring varieties. It is extensively cultivated in Newengland, and in the northern part of this State, [new Work] Straw not long, very bright, the heads bald, with a beautiful white merry, and producing flour of a good quality. The straw is not so large as the I italian, ripe king earlier. The merry sits closer in its chamber, and is not subject to rust. I have cultivated it for several years. I have, however, rejected all spring varieties. Black Sea Wheat was first introduced into the State of Paine, and has been successfully cultivated there for several years, as well as in some of the other New England States. It has succeeded the best of any of the spring varieties in Vermont: being earlier in i maturing, it is less affected with the grain worm; seldom rusts or mildews. This is a white chaff, bearded; straw soft and very subject to get down, which does not injure it in filling; merry long and red, weighs well, br an thick, a ad producing flour of an inferior quality. I to early ripe king gives it the preference to others. I have received a description of several of the most val table varieties of wheat cultivated in Virginia and the South, and had specimen, of them forwarded to me; but they have miscarried. If I had succeeded i a getting them, I would have given a description of the .here. I hope to be more successful at some other time[ 75 ]a] 180 his list might have been much extended; but I have confined myself to such varieties as I have had under cultivation, or those that have come under my own observation. No. 4. From the Farmers' Cabinet. Broadcast And Dri  Lled Wheat. At the present period, when the price of agricultural produce of every description is so reduced, it becomes of great importance to the farmer to look around and see whether he cannot increase the produce of his soil without increasing his expenses. This is particularly needful in raising wheat. From some causes, perhaps not well understood, the wheat crop has become, in the Eastern and Atlantic States, exceedingly precarious. Our wheat, even when not attacked by enemies such as rust or fly has been gradually diminishing in the amount raised to the acre. The report of the Farmers' Club of New York states that the quantity has decreased there from 30 to 10 or 15 bushels per acre. This diminution is owing, probably, to the land being gradually robbed of the chemical constituents of the wheat, by sending the grain away, while we retain the straw to make food to supply succeeding crops; hence, if we put on enough of this kind of manure, we may raise large crops of straw, but not grain in proportion. And further, as if we thought we had yet too much grain, we have our manure yards so planned, that the saline parts (which are the most important in the formation of the grain, and which are so ruble in water) have every facility to enable them to be washed away by repeated shower. But is our present method of planting or sowing wheat the most likely to insure the largest yield ?a? This is what I now wish to speak of. In the work of Retro Full, (the father of thorough tillage) printed about one hundred years ago, he states that, while other farmers were sowing two or three bushels of wheat to the acre, and reaping only fifteen or twenty bushels, he drilled about half a bushel in three rows, about eight inches apart, in the middle of six feet wide lands, and usually obtained about 40 or 50 bushels per acre and this without the aid of much or any manure. His success he attributed to tilling the land while the wheat was growing. Returned the furrow with what he called his he plough, alternately from and to the rows of wheat, like many who use the plough are in the habit of tilling their corn. In the spaces of eight inches between the rows, the ground was loosened by hand hoping. This plan, though not adapted to American farming, for the reason that, generally, we wish grass to follow our wheat crop, v was yet deemed sufficiently plausible to determine us to give a fair trial to the drilling, in comparison with the broadcast plan. Accordingly, in the fall of 1843, our felt (the c lover being all ploughed under, and a light dressing of manure about ten one horse cart loads to the acre being spread on the surface 181 [a[ 75 was nicely harrowed. We commenced at one side, sowed broadcast about six acres, with two bushels of seed to the acre. In about a week afterwards, we were furnished with a drill by our enterprising neighbor, Johnjones, of Bohemia Manor, who owned the only wheat drill in the State of Delaware. Commencing on the 20th of the 9th month, we drilled about 27 acres, putting in about 10 acres a day, with one bushel and one peck of seed to the acre. The cost of the drill (including the services of one man and one horse) was 50 cents an acre, though two horses were required to work the drill. All the wheat, both drilled and broadcast, stood the winter well. To appearance, the broadcast looked best; it appeared thicker, both in the fall and in the spring. The drilled wheat by our neighbors generally was pronounced too thin, and was considered by them a failure. In the 4th month the weather was very dry and warm, which seemed unfavorable for wheat. It appeared to stop it from stooping sufficiently, causing it to shoot up prematurely, and too thinly; but when the heads were formed, there was a manifest difference between the length of the drilled and the broadcast those on the drilled wheat being decidedly longer. The whole crop was free from rust or fly, excepting along one head land, which had been eaten off by cattle when about one foot or 18 inches in height, where we found the fly in abundance showing, certainly, that insects are most likely to attack those plants whose powers have been impaired thus teaching farmers that the most likely way to avoid the fly, and even rust, is to keep their plants, by all known means, in as healthy a condition as they possibly can; for where one field of vigorous wheat will be destroyed by the fly or rust, ten will be which are either put in badly, or are too poor. Previous to harvest, we had five acres carefully measured with the chain and compass, by W. Bennington, the surveyor of the neighborhood, assisted by John Bones. The surveyor was present when the wheat was cradled, and saw that each acre had its due share. It was put away in separate rows, and threshed separately, and the grain all measured. Los. 1 and 2. Two acres of the broadcast surveyed together Two bushels of seed to the acreSeventyfive shocksFiftyfive bushels of wheat, or 27 b bushels to the acre. No. 3.

Were we see that, by the use of the drill alone, (the soil being in the[ 75 ]a] 182 same, or perhaps an inferior condition) the crop was increased 74 bushels per acre, and, adding the amount saved in the seed, (3 pecks) make 8 bushels and 1 peck to the acre; and further, that the amount of straw on the drilled acre, with a smaller quantity of seed sown, increased 12 percent; and the amount of grain on the same acre was increased more than 27 per men t. It in ay be proper here to state, that the whole field (between 30 and 40 acres) was manured and treated alike; although, from causes existing previously in the soil, some parts of the land, being naked and barren, was more denuded than others. The surface soil, being washed away, did not yield as well as other parts. I suppose that, without the c lover and main re, the field would not have averaged more than 3 bushels certainly not 5,busiiels to the Acre. The drill used was invented and made by M. Pennock & Sons, of Men net Square, Chester county, Penn, the inventors of the revolving horse rake. 'even rows, about 8 inches apart, are planted by it at one time, about 3 inches in depth; the planters stand perpendicular; their points, projecting forward, produce small furrows, similar in shape, but deeper than those made by the: teeth of the cultivate or. The wheat, thus growing in the bottom of the ifirr0ow, is protected from the bleak winds of winter, and the fine earth, pulverized by the frosts, fills up the furrows by spring, arid nourished the young plants. Our own convictions have been sufficiently strong upon the above experiment to cause us to purchase a drill, or, as it should be called, a wheat and corn planter -for it plants either equally well for our own use; with which we have put in, this fall, the entire field of wheat, containing about 40 acres. Respectfully, Charles Noble. Phi   Ladelphi   A, 10th month, 1844. P. S. The acre yielding 40 bushels of wheat, it will be seen, I have not compared with the broadcast in their per cent age yield, because of their distance apart; supposing that the difference of yield might have been owing to some difference in soil. No. 51 From the Southern Agriculturists. Report Of I Ndi  Of Corn. Your committee on I indian corn beg leave to report: We consider the corn crop as second to no other crop made in the United States; and in this State, the advantage of raising our own supplies would be of great importance, and would save to the State a large sum of money spent annually for corn. Under these circumstances, any improvements in planting or cultivating this valuable grain must be interesting. 13 y a judicious use of the plough, and other good management, the crop may be much in 183 [a[ (did 127) increased; and, in a few years, a full supply for the State might be expected. In the years 1838 and 1839 about 500,000 bushels of corn were imported; from October, 1841, to October, 1842, 360,000; and from October, 1842, to October, 1843, 260,000; showing an increase of the crop of tthState of 100,000 bushels in one year. The increase may be attributed to the efforts made by Mr. Puff in and others in recommending mary and other manures, and the proper use of ploughs. All plants derive their nourishment from air, water, and soil; and the corn plant must have a supply of air and moisture to effect a full development of its growth; and the soil, to do its part, must be well manured a nd cultivated. There the land has been long planted, there is frequently a hard sub soil crust, which n must be well broken up by the sub soil plough to enable the perpendicular roots to penetrate deep into the earth, to obtain moisture for the plants. In preparing land for a corn crop, we would recommend that, in the early part of the winter, a furrow of 6 or 8 inches deep should be made with the common plough; that the sub soil plough should be run i ri this furrow to the additional depth of 10 or 12 inches; and that corn s talks arid other manure should be put in this trench, and listed in, Whetthdooughly wet, with a small plough or he, as may be convenient; the land to remain in this state to the period of planting. We cannot too highly recommend the use" of the sub soil plough. By its use, the soil will be less wet after great rains, and more moist in great draughts. Mr. Cela plain informs us that, in 1823, he planted a field of 25 acres of corn ; that in a part of the field he used the sub soil plough, and in the other part the common tillage. A furrow was made, with the common bar share plough, 5 or 6 inches deep, and with the sub soil plough 7 inches deeper; that, in all other respects, the soil, planting, and tillage, were the same. In that part of the field where the sub soiler was used, the corn kept its color throughout the season, and produced 50 per centummore that the other; and where the common tillage was used, it suffered much from drought, and fired considerably. Mr. C. M. Cement also states that he sub soiled a part of a piece of ground which he planted to I indian corn. The piece of ground was on alight loam y or sandy knoll; that he sub soiled it in strips, leaving alternate strips not sub soiled ; all being manured alike. He ran the sub soiler from 8 to 10 inches deep. The season proved to be very dry. And where the sub soil plough was not used, the corn was so burnt up that it produced nothing; but where it was used, the corn remained green and flourishing through all the drought, and produced a good crop. The soil must be moist at the time. f planting, or a good stand cannot be expected. The seed corn ought to have been selected with much care in the field from those s talks bearing the greatest number of ears. And here we would recommend, in the highest terms, the use of the coal tar to preserve the seed from birds, &c. When the seed is well prepared by the use of coal tar and soot, and the soil well moistened by a good rain, to be planted at the distance of 3 feet; the rows being from 5 to 6 feet apart and either one or two s talks should be left, according to the fertility of the soil. There the soil is very rich, or highly manured, we think it best to plant at 2 feet apart, and to leave two s talks[ 75 184 is soon as the corn is up, the plough ought to be used in breaking up and pulverizing the earth between the rows; and, when 5 or 6 inches high, the best plough man ought to run a furrow as near as possible to the plant, (the bar side of the plough being next to it) and the other plough man may break up the intermediate space between the rows. At this period, the sloughing ought to be deep and close; breaking up and pulverizing well the soil. By pomposity of soil, the air is admitted, and a larger quantity of organic and in organic food for the plant is afforded. In dry weather, the oftener the plough is used the better, until the corn is about one third grown; after which, the plough ought to be laid aside, and the cultivate or, or he marrow, used in its place. In wet weather, the plough ought never to be used. Worn is benefited at all periods of its growth by the application of manure on the surface over the roots. If the drought is great, and the corn far advanced towards maturity, the surface crust must be broken, and the earth stirred lightly, to admit air and moisture to the roots ; but care must be had not to disturb or cut the lateral or surface roots. About the time corn is maturing, brace roots shoot out from the joints near the surface of the earth. These roots frequently strike deep into the earth, affording both nourishment and support to the plant. If a high hill has been made, these roots shoot out higher upon the stalk, where it is brittle, and likely to be snapped off the first high wind. If there be little or no hilling, the corn will bend and yield to the storm, and rise again, having sustained little or no injury. This would be particularly the case where the soil is very fertile and highly cultivated. Well grown corn has from 40 to 60 large roots extending from the joints under the ground, which, with the tap root, penetrate deep into the soil, if not obstructed by a hard sub soil. From these large roots innumerable small fibrous roots shoot out in all directions towards the surface, extending across the rows 5 or 6 feet, in search of nourishment for the plant. The large perpendicular roots afford moisture, and the small fibrous roots food to the plant. The deeper the perpendicular roots penetrate the soil, the less injury% the plant will sustain from drought. And the more the surface has been broken up and pulverized, the further the surface roots will extend in search of nourishment to mature fine and large ears. No. 52 For the American Agriculturists. Experi  Ments I N Planti Of Corn. During a short visit with which I was honored by your father (or. Pollen) in August last, I showed him a field of corn, with which he was so much pleased, that he requested I would give an account of its product which I promised to do through the American Agriculturists. The field lies northeast of my orchard, and adjoining thereto a locality with which you are familiar. When I purchased the plantation on which I now reside, in 1812, the field had been in cultivation, in one continued succession of corn crops, for 185 [a[ 75 ]some 20 or 25 years. To soon as I could prepare the ground for the purpose, I put it in timothy meadow. As it lay adjoining my sheep house, I permitted a small flock of my sheep, during the time they were fed, each winter, to run on it. I also applied to it the manure derived from my sheep fold. In this way, in the course of 12 or 15 years, which I supposed it to remain in meadow, it was restored to its native fertility, being naturally as rich as the best Kentucky land. I now raised several crops of tobacco on the ground, when it was again put in meadow, and treated as above. For the last three or four years preceding the present, it has been in hemp. Early in April of this year, it was all ploughed, and once harrowed, and laid off with great exactness 3- feet each way. It was planted on the i 3th of April, the ground being very light, and finely pulverized. The corn came up well, and in due time was thinned out to three s talks in a hill. It was carefully cultivated by sloughing alternately each way, with the common Kentucky shovel plough, and going over once with broad hoes. The season up to the 2d of July was tolerably favorable, though there was too much rain for a first rate crop. The corn was now generally getting into silk. At this period, when corn requires much rain, or at least frequent showers, to cause the corn to ear well, a drought came on, and no rain fell for two weeks. During this period, the atmosphere was very dry and windy. The consequence was, that there was scarcely an instance of two ears being produced on the same stalk, and even the single ears were much reduced in size. Although, after a drought of two weeks, we had again a succession of light showers, yet they came too late to be of any material benefit to corn crops as forward as mine. Under these disadvantages, the yield fell greatly below what it would have been, had not the severe drought of July intervened* Upon carefully measuring an acre of about an average quality of the field, the product was 77 bushels. I am convinced, that if a due proportion of rain had fallen during the first half of July, the yield would have been fifty per cent greater. The corn was of the white species a medium between the flint and the larger kinds which are more productive, but not so good for bread. Permit me now to give you the result of another experiment, made during the present year, to ascertain the advantages of planting corn more closely than usual, recommended by some of our farmers, who have succeeded in raising very large crops under favorable circumstances. My experimental crop was planted on the 12th of April, (one day before that described above) upon land which had been cleared in 1810, and preserved in its native state of fertility by a due proportion of grass crops. I to fertility was about equal to that described above, and was in a field lying on the same ridge, northwest of the rivulet you speak of running through my farm, in your November number, page 322 of your last volume. This field had been in c lover for the two years preceding, and was ploughed up last fall with the view of putting it in hemp, and was consequently in fine condition for hemp or corn. In one side of the field, I laid off, in an of long square, four acres, each acre lying equally well, and of equal fertility. This ground was again ploughed early in the spring, and level led with the harrow. It was now laid off the long way with great accuracy, 3 feet from centre to centre, and then checked off the other way in rows: the first acre 4 feet apart, the[ 75 ]a] 186 second acre 3 feet apart, the third acre 3 feet apart, and the fourth acre 2. feet apart. The whole was planted the same day; and, din di iting, "the three first acres were thinned out to three s talks in the hill, au rd thee both acre to two s talks in a hill. :the number of s talks in each acre, if none had been missing, would have been as follows to. 1, 3 by 4 feet -9335No. 2, 3- by 34 feet -10668No. 3, 3 i by 3 feet -12447No. 4, 3 by 2: feet, two in a hill -9956This crop, of course, suffered equally from the drought with that above described, and, having more outside rows, was more deprecated upon by the cry. Is, and did not stand quite as well, or with such perfect regularity, as the other in the hills. Taking the proper allowances for these causes, I did not calculate upon quite as large a product as from the other field. Peri gathering and accurately measuring each acre separately, I found the product as follows: No. 1, 68 bushels; No. 2, 69 bushels ;to. 3, 69 bushels; No. 4, 77. bushels. Thus the acre planted 3- by 4 feet produced nearly as well as that planted 3- feet each way; and the latter produced the same quantity as that planted 33 feet by 3 feet; and the acre planted 34 by 2. feet, and only two s talks in a hill, produced 84 bushels more than either of the others. From this experiment, it would seem that, in the best of ground, where three s talks are intended to be left in a hill, the distance each way should not be less than 3' feet; and that, where it is intended to plant more closely, not more than two s talks should be left in a hill; The acre planted 3 i by 2 i feet produced decidedly the best; but it was too close one way to be ploughed with convenience. Thus planted, there were 84 square feet for each hill. If planted 3 feet each way, there would ,be nip e square feet to each hill, and the distance would be more convenient for sloughing both ways. I incline to think that planting 3 feet each way, with two s talks in : hill, would be the most eligible for convenience and product. As a single experiment is not very satisfactory, I i rite nl, if I am spared, to repeat the experiment next year on the same ground, laying it off one way 3 feet, and the other 4, 3 i, and 3 feet thinning the last t& two s talks in a hill, and the other two acres to threes talks in a hill. In this last experiment, I planted the same kind of horn as in' the other." A. Of Atty. Prospect Of   Of, December 1, 1844. No. 5 she I indian corn entered by Mr. Lads worth for premium was one quarter of an acre, selected from near the middle of a field of four acres, This field was planted with the "improved Butt or corn" about the 1st of May, in hills, three feet apart each way. The land on which it was planted was "s ward ground' manured with common yard manure, at the rate of from. twenty to thirty cart loads to the acre, turned over flat 187 [a[ 75 and rolled, and the corn planted on the furrows. It was hold four times, without hilling or turning up the furrows between the rows. The seed with which it was planted appeared to be a mixture of the common Button corn and a very large kind of eight bowed corn, and the whole crop was comprised of a mixture of the two varieties, in about equal proportions; a bushel of each kind of which was laid before your committee for inspection. The ears of both kinds were very large and long many of them measuring nearly, or quite, 14 inches in length. The kerseys upon the eight bowed were very large, and the cob small; the kerseys on thetwelverowed were also much larger than the common Button corn. And your committee are of opinion, that if Mr. Lads worth will continue this cross mixture for a few years, he will have a kind of corn far superior to any now in use. In this field of corn, the suckeds were all allowed to remain until the customary time for cutting the s talks. The product of that portion of the field entered for premium was at the rate of 151 bushels and 18 quarts to the acre. Your committee are aware that it hardly seems possible that so large a quantity could be raised from an acre in this old hide bound State of Connecticut; yet, from the certificate of the town committee of Durham, and from the statement of Mr. Lads worth, under oath, such was proved to be the fact. Think of this, ye farmers of Middlesex county! One hundred and fifty-one bushels and eighteen quarts of shelled corn from one acre! This eclipses even the far famed corn regions of the great valley of the West. With facts like this before their eyes, our young farmers, we think, will hardly feel dis, posed to quit the i healthy home of their sires, to seek a fortune among the Wolvereens and Hoosiers of the Western prairies, but be content to settle down amid the hills and dales where dwell the lovely masses of our own dear Yankee, land.  In competition with the foregoing, was a quarter of an acre of eight bowed corn, entered by Joel M. Clark, Esq, of the society of West field, in Middle town. This corn was raised on green s ward land, ploughed plain, and rolled. Two coats of how pen manure were applied. One coat, being coarse, was put upon the land and ploughed in; the other was fine manure, placed upon the top after the field had been ploughed, and harrowed in. The whole amount of manure used was about 65 ' cart buck loads" to the acre. It was planted about the 20th of May, four kernelsin a hill, hills three and a half feet by two and a half apart. The soil isa gravely loam. The seed -was rolled in plaster of Paris before planting and, if your committee are not mistaken, the suckeds were all removed from the hills about the time of the last hoping. The product of that position of the crop which was entered, for premium was at the rate of 108 bushels and 4 quarts to an acre, which every one must admit to be a very extraordinary yield; and the committee regret exceedingly that the rules of the society will not admit of a premium being awarded: The quality of this corn was superior, in the opinion of your committee, to any exhibited. The kerseys were large, and the ears well filled, but too short to be very productive under ordinary circumstances. Respectfully submitted, by order of the committee. Henry D. Smi  Of, Chairman[ 75 ]a] 188 to. 54BRI  Dgepoi Of, January 18, 1845. Dear Of    R: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 16th instant, and hasten to make a short reply to your inquiries relative to the amount of corn raised per acre on my farm. First, the mode of culture invariably turn over with a heavy sub soil plough, in the early part of November, some 8 to 10 acres of old meadow land, and roll the furrows down with a heavy roller; leaving the frost during the winter to destroy all vegetation for weeds, &c, and the following spring cross plough it well, and harrow it twice. Secondthe manure I make consists of one third creek mud, or de composed vegetable matter, one third stable or barn yard manure, onethirdunslaked fine lime, taken from the bottom of the kill. Thirdly n planting, I never use more than five grains of the best selected corn for the hill; and as the plant shows itself through the ground, we invariably use unleashed ashes on the outside of the young plants thereby allowing the action of the moisture of the atmosphere, or rain, to run the reached substance to the root of the plants. In pursuing this course, I find, on the first cleansing, that but a few, if any, (so called) rubbing show themselves. Again, I have, from experience, found it unnecessary to he my corn three times. All that is necessary to make it prop agate well is to keep it clean from weeds, and let the braces or holders strike well intothe ground. I have in the hill tried hen dung; and unless very great care is taken to use but about a will to the hill, it will assuredly destroy all growth. Fourthly plant from three to four feet apart, and have never failed to raise from each hill from four to seven well grown ears. In the summers of 1842 and 1843 I planted nine acres of corn-one half Long I s land yellow, and one half Long I s land white. We had a contest at our agricultural society; and feeling, as I did, that my competitors, were behind me, I called in a sworn surveyor; he measured two acres, one of white and one of yellow; and with the aid of my men it was gathered, and under his supervision correctly measured. The result was the white gave per acre of well grown ears 236 bushels; the yellow, on the same ground, 224 bushels of ears to the acre; and this result took the first premium at our society. Again: the present year, I had on low cold ground about eight acres of corn, arranged and planted similar to my statement above. The result is, that it yielded 121 bushels of shelled corn per acre. I am certain that our old State of Connecticut contains thousands of acres of un improved lands, that, with proper culture, will yield as much or more than what is de nominated the fertile lands of the West. Again: I find that the land of this State is ill calculated for the culture of oats; and, in lieu thereof, I have substituted barley, which yields a fraction more in quantity to the acre than will the best of oats; and it will weigh per bushel about 47 to 54 pounds; and the straw is of greater value for all purposes than any other; and I may, with truth, remark, that it does not reduce the strength of the soil so much as oats, by at least some 20 per cent. You would really do our old stubborn farmers of Connecticut an essential service, by urging them to vary their culture, not only in their land, but every description of their stock. In the bottom lands of 189 [a[ 75 ]the State, lying on the sound, there is no necessity for complaint, for the yield will well compensate the husband man. The great difficulty arises from the almost entire impracticability of improving the ideas of our old farmers to any thing that promises the smallest advantage or improvement. Time, with the de composed vegetable matter taken from our creeks, forms a valuable manure, and is at the command of almost every farmer in this vicinity. The use of plaster is given up on our grounds here, owing to the atmosphere being too salt for its use. My timothy meadows yielded me last year an average of 34 tons per acre; and if the ensuing summer should be more moist, I hope to have 3- tons to the acre. As you requested, I have given you a hasty scrawl; but I beg you to be assured that there is no difficulty in producing in our vicinity rising 125 bushels of shelled corn to the acre, but care must be taken to produce it. With sentiments of regard, yours, &c. Verdi  Of Ellsworth. On. H. L. Ellsworti I . No. 6. Researches Of The Sali Of Matters Of Grai N. The researches made on several cereal grains, and on other <a name="seeds18"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, demonstrate the existence of certain saline matters, which are essential to the formation of those <a name="seeds19"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and on the presence of which their nutritiveproperties, in a measure, depend. I indian corn. When this grain is burnt to ashes in a platino capsule, it is found difficult to burn out the last traces of carbon; for the visible phosphates and free phosphorus acid envelope the particles, and prevent the admission of the oxygen of the air to the carbon. While engaged in the agricultural survey of Rhode I s land, one of my pupils accidentally converted the bottom of a platino capsule into a brittlephosphuret of that metal, by the action of the carbon of the grain on thephosphoric acid at a high temperature the reduced phosphorus combining with the platino. This accident led to the discovery of a volatile base in the grain, and to a series of interesting researches on the saline matters. In burning 100 grains of brown corn, one grain of ashes remained, and was found to consist of phosphates of lime and magnetic, with a littlesilica, potash, and phosphorus acid. Heard obtained, by combustion of I indian corn, 0.95 grain of ashes, but no free phosphorus acid. He states the composition of these ashes asfollowsSilica -3845Potassa, (with traces of soda) -1951Phosphate of lime -1717Phosphate of magnetic -138Phosphate of potash a -a- 2.24Carbonate of lime -25 Carbonate of magnetic -21lh75 ]a] 190 Sulphate of lime and sulphate of magnetic -0Silic, mechanically present -17Alumina traces, and loss -6510000The quantity of as lies operated upon is not stated, and the processes are not given, excepting those of incline ration, in which he failed to form aphosphuret of .plaiting m, which was owing to the free admission of atmospheric air, and ofuc6nmbustion at a low temperature. By burning off the carbon with nitric acid, free phosphorus acid may be be readily obtained, as in my experiments. The chit, or that part Of the grain containing the germ, being dissected out, and analyzed separately, was found to contain a still greater proportion of the phosphates 100 grains of the "chit" yielding 6.4 grains of very visible ashes, which consist ofPhosphate of lime -24Phosphate of magnetic -08Phosphoric acid, a little potash, s iliac, and oxide of iron -3 264 t is evident that the salts are most abundant in this portion of the grain. This was confirmed by an observation made by Mr. A. A. Hayes, who remarked that sulphate of copper colored green the chit and germ only, thereby beautifully defining the limits of the phosphates in the grain, by the formation of phosphates of copper, which thus pointed out the limits of the phosphorus acid. This ingenious method I have since applied to the examination of the <a name="seeds20"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of all, our usual plants, and to tubes, roots, and stems of recent vegetables. By soaking any seed, after it has been cut open, in a watery solution of sulphate of copper, or blue vitriol, this experiment may be repeated; and the result will give decisive proofs of the presence of phosphorus acid in all but the oily <a name="seeds21"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, which do not admit of this test. A grain of I indian corn, split open longitudinally, and thrown into a solution of pulp hydrate of ammonia, the "chit" is soon changed to a dark olive color, which arises from the change of the salts of iron into a sulphur et of that metal. A black colored matter, forming with the ammonia, turns the vegetable coloring matter yellow, and the two colors combined produce an olive. This experiment was made first ty Mr. Hayes, and has been applied by me to every common grain and seed. I then prepared specimens of grain, by means of tincture of iodine, so as to point out the limits of the starch and dextrinethe tincture of iodine striking an intense blue with starch, and a deep port wine red with dextrineso that, from this test, a rich violet indicated the presence of both starch anddextrine in grain. If the oil is extracted from the transparent horny part of corn by alcohol or ether, the tincture of iodine will indicate the presence of starch in that part of the grain associated with the glum ten. By these means, *we may easily cause any grain to point out the extent and precise 191 [a[ 75 ]limit of each of its ingredients, and, by the eye, we can form a pretty correct estimate of their relative proportions in different <a name="seeds22"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. This beautiful application of chemistry being new, and nothing having yet been published on the subject, (excepting what I have stated to the American Association of Geologists and Naturalists, or have given in the form of lectures before agricultural and other societies) I have had a colored lithographic drawing made from my specimens, and present it to the public in this report t is my intention to publish hereafter a more full account of the chemical method of testing plants, with some physiological researches on germination; but the excid127ieririeits require much time, and are not yet fully completed Among the curious results of these experiments, is the proof that the relative proportions of phosphates in grain depend on the appropriating power of each species or variety; for an ear of corn being selected which had on it two different kinds, (viz: the Tuscaroras and the sweet corn) and these <a name="seeds23"><mark>seeds</mark></a> being split in two, and immersed in the same solution, soon gave evidence of more than double the amount of phosphates in the sweet corn than in the other variety. Now, since the kerseys came from the same ear, and grew side by side, they obtained unequal quantities of phosphates from the same sap, derived from the same soil, A crop of sweet can will take twice as much of the phosphates as the other variety, and, consequently, will sooner exhaust the soil of them; and, also, if the soil is deficient, will require more phosphates (ex. gr. ground bones) to be added. (see fig. 6,Tuscarora, and fig. 10, sweet corn Some interesting facts will also be noticed in the variable proportions of phosphates in different varieties of the same species of grain, and the great preponderance of them in I indian 'corn, beyond what is contained in the smaller grains, like barley, oats, and wheat a fact that seems to explain their peculiar properties as food for animals; the more highly phosphaticgrains being more likely to sur charge the system of adult animals with bony matter, producing conceptions of phosphates of lime, like those resulting from gout. Perhaps that stiffness of the joints, and lameness of the feet, common in horses fed too freely with corn, may be accounted for by this preponderance of the phosphates. Young animals cannot fail to derive more osseous matter from corn than from other food. Agriculture may learn something from these researches; for they indicate the relative power which each kind of grain possesses in appropriating the phosphates contained in the soil, and consequently its waits. Buckwheat and oats contain the least proportion, and may be raised on soil which is not fully supplied with phosphates. Means and peas are highly charged with the phosphates of lime and magnetic, while they contain but very little starch. They also contain salts of iron, as indicated by the alteration of their white color to a dirty olive green. Both the cotyledons and the germ are charged with all 'these salts, but the epidermis or skin of the bean or pea is free from them. Relative proportion, of starch in grain. Tuscaroras corn contains the most. (fig. 5 represents the natural appearance of the grain when it is cut open; fig. 6 shows, by the iodine test 75 ]a] 192 changing it to a violet, that starch and doctrine form the entire mass of the grain, excepting the chit and germ) Vice corn and pop corn contain the least starch. The other figures sufficiently explain the relative proportions of all the ingredients of the grain they represent. Relative proportions of oil and glum ten. Vice corn contains the most oil; pop corn, Canada corn, and brown corn rank next. Burden corn is charged with a very fine white oil; Tuscaroracorn does not contain oil or glum ten. It will be remarked that there is a great difference in the mode of distribution of the oily and g luminous parts of corn the Southern variety always having it on the sides of the elongated seed, while the starch projects quite through the grain to its summit, and, by its contraction in drying, produces the peculiar pit or depression in this variety of grain. The Burden corn is still more remarkable for this arrangement. Hopping corn. The oil in the horny portions of the grain is contained in little six sided cells, in the form of minute drops, visible in a thin section under a good microscope. When a grain of corn is heated to a temperature sufficient to de compose the oil, a sudden explosion takes place, and every cell is ruptured by the expansion of gaseous matters arising from the decomposition of the oil, and the grain is ruptured at the weak est point in the arch, and is completely evolved and folded back. Now, on examining the cells again, they will be found lacerated and swollen much out of shape. If an attempt is made to pop Tuscaroras corn, it will be found never to succeed; hence, I was able to prove that this curious phenomenon, so familiar to every child, though never understood by its parents, is due entirely to the decomposition of oil, and the formation of carburetted hydrogen gas, such as is sometimes used in lighting large cities. This change in the corn is one of considerable importance, so far as regards facility of digestion; for it is much more digest able by man after this decomposition and extricate on of the oil, though not so fattening to animals that can digest oil. The use of oil in corn is obviously to prevent the rapid decomposition of the grain in the soil, and to retain a portion of food until needed by the young plant, and is always the last portion of the grain taken up. It serves to keep meal from pouring readily; and it will be observed that flint corn meal will keep sweet for years, even when put up in large quantities; but the Tuscaroras meal will sour in a short time. The latter is the most digest able grain for horses, and is soft; but is of little value for feeding swine. It is a good kind of grain for rapid cooking, for its meal is quickly boiled or baked. Oily corn makes a dry kind of bread, and is not adhesive enough to rise well without admixture of rye or flour. Vice corn is so dry that, alone, it will not make bread, but is dry like sand. Oily grains are excellent for fattening fowls; and the rice corn, both from its size and oily nature, is admirably adapted for them 193 [75 worn is sometimes raised for the manufacture of whiskey, and the oil is, saved during the ferment at ion, since it separates and rises to the surface. I have been informed that 100 bushels of corn yield from 15 to 16 gallows of oil. It is made on the borders of Take Ontario, and has been used in the, light houses on the lake. According to my analysis, the proportions of oil in I indian corn vary from 6 to 11 per cent the latter being the yield fro ni Canada corn while rice corn contains still more, but has not been fully examined. Southern corn has more starch and less oil than our Northern flint corn, and is much softer and better food for horses, though not so fatiteiinng for swine or poultry, and is, when ground, more apt to become sour. When I indian corn is pulled by means of potash lye, the oil next to the epidermis of the grain is converted into soap, and the epidermis is detached. The caustic all ali also liberates ammonia from the Tmucilagearound the germ. Sweet corn appears like an unripe grain. I to origin is unknown; but it appears to have been used by the ab original inhabitants of New England anterior to the settlement of the country by the pilgrims. It is a remarkable variety of corn; containing, as before observed, an iUnusuallylarge proportion of the phosphates, and a large quantity of the sugar and gum, with but little starch. I to excellence for food in its green state is well known and appreciated; and having s talks which are short and slender, they of course take up a less proportion of the saline matters of has oil. The colors of I indian corn depend on that of the epidermis, or hull, and of the oil; the latter, when yellow, showing its color through a transparent epidermis; while, if the hull is colored and opaque, the grain presents the same color. In the Rhode I s land white flint, (a favorite grain in that State) the oil is transparent arid color less; and the epidermis is likewise free from color, and is nearly transparent: hence the meal is white; and the ,quantity of oil being large, it is less liable to ferment and become sour than some other varieties, and is in very good repute. The yellow color of the golden Sioux, a twelve bowed kind of coicid127, is due to the color of the oil. Grown corn has a darker color, dependent on the combined colors of the oil and epidermis. Red and blue corn owe their lively hues to the colors of the epidermis, and not to the oil. In inspecting very thin slices of corn by the aid of the microscope, the epi dermal coat is found to be made up of hexagonal cells; sometimes but h elongated, and much larger than those of the g luminous and oily parts of the grain The starch g lobules are seen distinctly in the starch y part, and are smaller than those of the <a name="potato58"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and are much more rounded. A drop of diluted tincture of iodine brings out their forms and character tinostbeautifully. To crystals of saline matters are seen in the grain; but the phosphates are probably in the state of a fine powder, while the ammonia is in combination with the organic matters, forming a kind of ami de ; :ii the mracilage around the germ 1 375 194 indian corn, according to the analysis of Mr. May en, consists of the following ingredient s 100 parts by weight yielded Starch -2840Nitrogenized matter -480 at matter, (oil) -3560Coloring matter -Q20Cellular tissue -000Dexrine -00 Various salts -7209820The proportion of oil is evidently over rated in this analysis; and the error is due to the sol ability of the ze in, or glum ten. of I indian coin, in ether, which May en used to dissolve the oil. The glum ten, being taken up in this process, was mistaken for oil, and credited in the analysis as such, when it should be put under the head of nitrogen sized matters. It is not surprising that M. Sum as, in quoting this analysis, should observe that " individuals who eat corn for some time present symptoms of an accumulation of fat in their tissue, which will not appear astonishing when we consider that a bushel of corn would yield a quart (litre) of oil Our New England farmers, then, ought to be an excessively fat people, according to this theory, if they did not work it off into hard muscular fibre. -sum as says, that the popping of corn is due to the conversion of the water contained in the starch into steam; which I have shown to be an error, and proved this phenomenon to arise from the rupture of the cells of the g luminous part of the grain, by the conversion of the contained g lobules of oil into gas. I indian corn is not sufficiently well known in Europe, and is not properly valued' In England, the climate is not sufficiently warm in summer to allow it to ripe n; but green corn can be abundantly raised, and, if known, would be valued as a luxury. In the south of France, and in Venetian Lombard y and in Tuscans, abundant crops of I indian corn are raised ;but it is used only by the poorer classes, and for feeding cattle absurd prejudices having prevented its use among the higher classes of the people. All animals that are exclusively carnivora us will eat I indian corn, and generally prefer it to other grain." It certainly is, in the highest degreenutritiolus ,a. The cultivation of corn gives a peculiar character to New Englandhusbandryit being a hold grain crop, unknown in England. A grain of corn is a fruitful topic, and might profit ably occupy a large space on these pages ; but what has already been stated may serve to show the degree of interest attached to a single agricultural product, and convince agriculturists that they have abundant objects of study around them. It is obvious that the ingredients above described as components of corn are all essential to a highly nutritions grain. The glum ten and mucin age contain nitrogen an element essential to the formation of fibrous tissue, a muscles, nervous matter, and brain 195 [a[ 75 1 The oil is nearly formed fat, easily convertible into animal oils by a slight change of composition. Starch is convertible also into fat, and into the carbonaceous substances of the body, and, during its slow combustion in the circulation, gives out a portion of the heat of animal bodies; while, in its altered state, it goes to, form a part of the living frame Sugar acts in a similar manner, as a compound of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon. From the phosphates, the substance of bone, and the saline matters of brains, nerves, and other solid and fluid parts of the body, are in a great measure derived. The salts of iron go to the blood, and there constitute an essential portion of it, whereby it is enabled by successive alterations of its degree of oxidation during the circulation through the lungs, arteries, extreme vessels, and veins, to transport oxygen to every part of the body. These remarks apply also to the other cereal grains, and in part to leg luminous <a name="seeds24"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. It is evident, then, that grain contains all the elements required for the perfect development and support of the bodies of animals; and that even when we consume animal food, we obtain the same ingredients, some of which are presented in a more concentrated form; but they were all originally derived from vegetables, and are but little changed in nature in animals. From: the modern researches of French chemists, it is evident that "flesh is grass" in a more strict sense than was formerly supposed ; Dumashavingdemonstrated that vegetable fibre is of the same composition as animal fibre; vegetable albumen identical with animal albumen; case ice, or the basis of cheese, also of the same composition as leg men of beans, peas, and other plants; while, at the same time, a kind of cheese was made from beans. The identity of composition of vegetable and animal proximal e principles leads to some remarkable conclusions; and it is now laid down i by the French chemists, that plants are the exclusive producers of the proximateprinciples common to both them and animals; and that animals never produce any of them, but only appropriate those previously formed by~ war its." Plants" says Sum as, "are organs of reduction; animals are organs of combustion. Vegetables produce neutral nitrogen sized matters, fat matters, sugar, starch, and gum; de compose carbonic acid gas, absorb heat and electricity, and are an apparatus of reduction Animals consume neutral nitrogen sized matters, fat matters, sugar, starch, and gum; produce carbonic acid gas, give out heat and electricity, and are an apparatus of combustion 19 61.

Of     n a former report, the advantage of ~owing corn broadcast for fodder was mentioned. The experiment has been made in various parts of the country, and it is with pleasure that we find the following account from the Edge Agricultural Society of South Carolina.

The soil is alluvial, and of a chocolate color. Early in December, 1842, it was shrub bed, and deeply broken up with a narrow s cooper. In the 27th Of April following, it received a cross sloughing with a turn plough; and on the 1st of May the corn was sown at the rate of three bushels per acre, ploughed in lightly, and brushed. It grew off finely, receiving no other attention, than once or twice to cut down the weeds and bushes that sprang up on its margin; and, what to me was remarkable, it retained its dark green color during a drought of such length and severity as to cause vegetation i elsewhere to exhibit evident signs of suffering. In the 20th.

W. Leakno. 81 Mprovement Of The Quali Of Of <a name="potatoes92"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Any improvement that can be effected in the quality of <a name="potatoes93"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is important. Some observations on the subject, at this season of the year, may possibly, therefore, have a useful tendency. It is well known that, in some soils, and most seasons, the produce of <a name="potatoes94"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is abundant, and their quality excellentcid127) while in others, the quantity is not deficient, but the quality is inferior; and there are situations so unfavorable, that the crop is always bad in every respect. Occasionally, indeed, cold wet seasons deteriorate this important crop, even in the best soil, on which the most skilful cultivation has been. bestowed. Supposing, however, that all has been done that could possibly be effected in the way of good cultivation, yet, when the crop is fit for taking up, its proper after management is a most important consideration. People think that, if they guard their crop from frost, they have done all that can be needed; but this is a mistake of the worst kind. By improper management after up, <a name="potatoes95"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the finest quality are easily spoiled; and, on the contrary, by judicious treatment, even such as are watery may be much improved. It is of the first consequence that light, as well as frost, should be guarded against; for light renders the tubes un wholesome. The stems, and, in fact, all the parts of the <a name="potato59"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant above ground, are more or less poisonous. Numbers are occasionally formed. along the stem; but they are, as we all know, green and bad. This is entirely owing to their exposure to light. Having pointed out one of the sources of deter i oration, it may be as well to name a means of improvement. Always dry the tubes before cooking them. If a <a name="potato60"><mark>potato</mark></a> is weighed when fresh taken up, then laid in a dry, warm place for some time, and again weighed, it will be found to have become lighter, in consequence of the evaporation of a portion of its water and it will then, in cooking, be more flour y. In I re land, with this in view, <a name="potatoes96"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, when watery, are often taken out of the caves, and kept in a dry place for a few weeks, and a great improve e net is the consequence. Thefrench are away of this fact. A writer in the He vue Portico le says 199[ 75 ]'I n unfavorable seasons, <a name="potatoes97"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are often found to be watery and without flavor, although cooked with the greatest care. In this case, the mode of effecting an amelie ration is easy: it consists in placing them near a stove or oven for about a week previously to their being used. At the end of that time, they will be found meal y and of good flavor The editor of the Farmers' Monthly Sister has this season raised between twelve and thirteen hundred bushels of <a name="potatoes98"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on about six acres of s ward land. The ground was prepared in the following manner: After the corn planting had been finished, about the 25th of May, manure (on about one acre com post, and upon the other five acres clear manure from a stable, made during the preceding summer and winter) was laid out in piles, and spread over the grass, which had then already started green from the ground, in furrows of about 12 inches in width ; the whole fiat was completely turned over, these shutting into each other so close as to leave no vacuum between. With the sod thus inverted, and the manure all covered to the depth of about six inches, the <a name="potatoes99"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted between every third furrow, at the distance in the rows of about three feet from each other. A hole or are vice was made, from two to three inches below the surface, with a sharpened stick, and, at the distance of 18 inches, a single <a name="potato61"><mark>potato</mark></a>, of the common size, placed in it, and covered up with a kick of the heel, generally, when the soil would admit of it. Great care was taken that the seed <a name="potato62"><mark>potato</mark></a> should not enter so deep as to go below the up turned s ward. In this way the <a name="potatoes100"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grew above the soil, ,while the roots drew sufficient sustenance from the de composed manure and -delayed turf at the bottom. During the whole season, there was no difficulty from weeds; the witch grass in some parts of the field, where it, had taken root, did indeed, late in the summer, spring through the inverted turf. The whole process of hoping the six acres ty rice cost only 22 days' work of one man. The planting was done with great expedition. In twice hoping and going over with] thecultivator, and the subsequent digging of the <a name="potatoes101"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, neither the bottom turf, nor the manure overlaid by it, has as yet been disturbed. The crop of I indian corn intended for the same land next year (according to our present years experience of a field last year cultivated in the same way) will derive a greater advantage from the manure than the <a name="potato63"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of the present year. One advantage of raising <a name="potatoes102"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this manner we believe to have been, the entire freedom of the crop from the disease and rot which have been so generally complained of. The ground was the ordinary intervals of Merrimac k river, which had lain so long to grass as to give not much over half a ton of hay to the acre. It was good land, but was much in: want of stimulating manure. The crop of <a name="potatoes103"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was probably not quite so large as it might have been if the same manure had been mixed in the same depth of soil actually pulverized; neither was the labor of making the crop more than half as much; but the manure is left in the ground, to do much the most effective service hereafter. In a diligent inquiry of our <a name="potato64"><mark>potato</mark></a> daggers, we have not been able to learn that any of the new <a name="potatoes104"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were infected with the rot. The earliest kind were taken from the field before the warm weather of September; and those laid in the common cellar have as yet discovered none of those offensive qualities which have been so much a matter of complaint. One hundred and fifty barrels of the first dug were sent and sold in the Boston market, averaging, after paying the price of transport, 25 cents the[ 75 ]a] 200 bushel. Of the long reds, we have between five and six hundred bushels in the ground, under a hem lock cover, which, in the market next spring, may be worth 50 cents the bushel. At half that price, after paying all expenses of cultivation and manure, this crop will give us a clear gain of about           $20 to the acre. In .about one acre of the <a name="potato65"><mark>potato</mark></a> ground, manured with the stable dung, after the first hoping, was placed some eight hundred pounds of ground paster. There this was applied, the tops of the <a name="potato66"><mark>potato</mark></a> were more lukurintthe <a name="potatoes105"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> seemed to be fewer in number, but all of a larger size. The effect of the plaster was to make the crop at least one-fourth better. To 82CHOI Of Of <a name="potatoes106"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. For Seed." In ripened, a hid consequently watery, <a name="potatoes107"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> make the best seed roots, inasmuch as they always produce strong, healthy, vigorous plants; this watery matter being the terminating principle. <a name="potatoes108"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> which have been planted late in the season, or which have grown in boggy land, or in a mountain situation, are to be preferred; as, under such circumstances, the tubes a are not matured, and the marina has not been developed. In the other hand, if we use for seed roots those <a name="potatoes109"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have been raised on good. land, have fill y ripened there, and have attained all the perfection of which they are capable as to quality, abounding in farinaceous matter, but deficient in mucilaginous matter, curled, and unhealthy, a general want of vigor will be evident, and the produce will be very inferior to that from unripe tubes, as they only possess the pro creative power in perfection. San illustration, it is known to most persons engaged in rural affairs, that, in the long varieties of <a name="potato67"><mark>potato</mark></a>, one end (called the crown or rose end) will, when cut off, make better seed than any other part of the same <a name="potato68"><mark>potato</mark></a> better, because the plant which springs from it is much more healthy, succulent, and vigorous, than the others. Now is this accounted for? Simply because such rose end is the watery end. To prove this to be the case, boil such a <a name="potato69"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and the part referred to will be found soft and une a table, while the remaining part of the <a name="potato70"><mark>potato</mark></a> is firm, dry, and flouryThe circumstance of inferior <a name="potatoes110"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> be getting good ones is not peculiar to this vegetable alone, but it is in unison with all the operations of nature, and to a part of her great law which decrees that, when perfection in vegetable or animal productions has been attained, their reproductions degenerate, and vice versa Essay on the field culture of the <a name="potato71"><mark>potato</mark></a>, by Petercowan; second edition, 1834.)SWe think the experience of last year and this, in regard to the <a name="potato72"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, is strikingly corroborate ve of the theory of weakness in the <a name="potato73"><mark>potato</mark></a> as being the primary cause of the failure; for observe the results. Theunderripened seed, raised in the bad season of 1841, produced a crop without failure in 1842, and in the alleged unfavorable circumstances of heat and drought; while the over ripened seed, raised in the fine season of 1842, has caused extensive failures in 1843, in the alleged favorable circumstances of moisture and coolness. What should be the practice indicated, by these results, but that un ripened seed should be planted in all, cases 201 [75 and, to prevent its becoming over ripened in any season, let the <a name="potatoes111"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> intended for seed be raised before ripeQuarterly Journal of agriculture, july, 1843. The character of the season, it is true, has an important influence upon the character of the <a name="potato74"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop; but we think, as a general fact, much of the inferiority of <a name="potatoes112"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, common in our market, is attribute able to neglect in the selection and management of seed. It is more common than otherwise for <a name="potatoes113"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be stored promiscuously at harvest, and thus permitted to lie together till towards spring, when a sorting of the best that remain is made for seed. The selection should be made previous to storing, and a separate place provided for those intended for seed, free from light, from heat, and from danger of freezing. It is contended by many skilful farmers in England, that the latest formed tubes are far the best for seed, or, indeed, those which have not attained perfect maturity. The reason given for this superiority is, that those tubes which are latest formed will retain their reproductive properties more fully at the next season for planting. This theory seems plausible to us. We said theory; we are remindedcid127however, that it is not mere theory, for we recollect reading, not long since several statements of practical farmers in the London Agricultural Gazette, giving the results of a practical test of this theory in their own husbandry and those results were strongly in its support. In England, among the best farmers, it is a custom to store the seed <a name="potatoes114"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by themselves, in pits dug in the earth; and managed in this way, and being chosen from the last formed tubes, they retain their full vigor till planting time returns; and even if not perfectly ripe when pitted, they will become so in the pits' It is confidently asserted, by many observing agriculturists, that weakness of the seed is the chief cause of the defects or failures in the <a name="potato75"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, and that weakness comes from over ripe ness. "I think" says a writer in the Gardeners Chronicle, "that the loss and disappointment from failure in the <a name="potato76"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop may, in ninety-nine cases out of every hundred, be prevented by the exercise of a little care. I knew a market gardener, famed for his <a name="potatoes115"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, whose practice always was to dig up and put away sufficient for next years seed, before they had completed their growth. They were thus full of sap, and kept so. I have myself had <a name="potatoes116"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> so waxy as to be unfit for the table; but from this very fact they made very good seed. A friend of mine called on me one day to look at his <a name="potato77"><mark>potato</mark></a> field, which had been well prepared and dressed with farm yard manure. He observed that they came up very bad, and desired to know what was the matter. The fact was, that the seed had been stored away with a large mass all winter, and deprived of sprouts two or three inches long before planting. The vitality was quite exhausted before they were put into the ground this was the secret of the failure. Boils, manures, and seasons, no doubt, will affect a <a name="potato78"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in various ways; but, with a little care with the seed, any considerable failure may usually be prevented. Need <a name="potatoes117"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should not be' of a meal y quality, nor should they be stored where they will heat, nor be kept out of the ground more than twenty-four hours after being cut out for planting[ 75 202 to. 91 The following, from notes reported for the Cultivator, refers to a discussion in the early part of 1844, during the sitting of the Legislature of Newyorkpotato Crops. Dr. De, of the Assembly, remarked, as a fact connected with this subject, that severe losses were experienced in portions of Europe for several years; that the matter was exciting discussions among the agriculturists of Britain and Germany, and that some of the European writers indulged in suppositions that the defect was occasioned by the de genera cy of some of the varieties of <a name="potatoes118"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> commonly cultivated. He hoped to hear from those who had been engaged in cultivating <a name="potatoes119"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> last year, particularly, such facts as would exhibit the nature of the difficulty, that some remedy might be devised against the recurrence of such d losses as the <a name="potato79"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in this State had last year suffered. He saw around him many who devoted large sections of their lands to <a name="potatoes120"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for the New York and Albany markets, and he hoped they would freely communicate their experience on the subject, together with suggestions for remedying the evil complained of. The subject was evidently worthy of attention. The <a name="potato80"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, for its value to man and beast, is of primary importance more than thirty millions of bushels being annually raised in this State, which, at an average of 25 cents per bushel, made a pecuniary valuation of more than seven millions ofdollarsalniost equal to the valuation of our corn crop. As there is no article in greater use for food, so there is none which better repay s careful cultivation. Mr. Abbot, of the Assembly, from Onondaga, remarked, that a primary consideration with him was the quality of the seed. Some of his neighbors, like many farmers elsewhere, thought rather more of " small <a name="potatoes121"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for seed than he did. As well might you expect good wheat from shrivelled seed, as to look for satisfactory returns from the diminutive <a name="potatoes122"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which many people thought ' good enough for planting." His practice was to select the best <a name="potatoes123"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for seed; and his aim was to cultivate them so as to realize large and certain crops, of quality equaling, if not surpassing, the best he planted. As for this "disease" or "rotten ness" in <a name="potatoes124"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and certainly it proved a 'formidable difficulty to many farmers lastyearhewould merely mention the result of his own experience and observation lie had raised considerable crops of <a name="potatoes125"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for many years, and declared that the yield was never better in quality, and seldom greater in quantity, than on his farm during last season. He had planted the seed sufficiently early to allow the crop to ripe n early, in the fall; and out of the quantities thus timely planted, and properly cultivated, and housed in good season, he had not lost a bushel by decay or rotating. Some of his neighbors, however, had lost considerable; and what he had observed respecting their practice and his own satisfied him, that with the <a name="potato81"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop planted early, so as to be fully ripened and properly gathered before the frost sets in, there is little to fear from disease or failure. What other conclusion could he draw, when he found that his success was good, as was that of neighbors around him, who concur red with him in practice; while other farmers, who were less prompt in planting and gathering their <a name="potatoes126"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, lost much of their crop byrottingthe land being of similar quality in all the cases mentioned. I n 203 [a[ 75 j reply to an inquiry, Mr. A. stated that his mode of cultivation yielded him 300 bushels per acre. He added, as a fact of interest on this subject, that one field of <a name="potatoes127"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> (better land than the other fields) lost him nearly all the crop, owing to its having been planted later than the other parts of his <a name="potato82"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop last year. Dr. Week man, of Columbia county, mentioned the facts within his knowledge resulting from the experience of some of his neighbors, as well as from the culture of his own farm. He repudiated the idea of any disease: in <a name="potatoes128"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, other than results from negligence or ignorance in the cultivates. Whatever the theories of European writers may be concerning the difficulties with the <a name="potato83"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop for some years past, he disbelieved that the losses of last year in this country were occasioned by any exhaustion of the vital qualities of the seed. For this incredulity he had sufficient excuse in the results of his own experience. He planted last year, as generally every year, several varieties of the <a name="potato84"><mark>potato</mark></a> ; and the oldest varieties, so far from being exhausted through the length of the time that the kind had been cultivated, were the best among his whole crop. He would not be understood, however, as undervaluing an occasional resort to planting the <a name="seeds25"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the <a name="potato85"><mark>potato</mark></a> apple, as a means of obtaining new v varieties, or of sustaining (if not improving) the qualities of the old kinds. But this he would assert, as the result of experience on his own land, and of observation elsewhere that the disasters to the <a name="potato86"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in this region resulted from the negligence of farmers; for he had yet to learn that any <a name="potato87"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop planted in proper soil and season, and harvested and secured in due time, had suffered among the disasters of last year; while he had unfortunately abundant evidence that the late planted <a name="potatoes129"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, especially in moist soils, resulted to a great degree in rotten ness, occasioned by unfavorable weather in the fall. In no branch of farming is it more essential that what is done should be well done in season. Met those who lost their crop last year remember this in future, and he ventured the prediction that there would hereafter be little or no complaint of <a name="potatoes130"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotating when the farmer most needs them for nutriment in his family or in his barn yard. Dr. Added, that those who turned attention to this matter, who cultivated the best kinds of <a name="potatoes131"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the best way, now always find ready market for their crops especially in the valley of the I and son, or on other channels leading to New York and other large cities. Such <a name="potatoes132"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, he knew well, would always command a good price from 20 to 50 per cent. more than the <a name="potatoes133"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> carelessly cultivated. Great carelessness is manifested by farmers in reference to their <a name="potato88"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. The planting is often, too often, deferred till too late a period; and many people seemingly overlook the fact that <a name="potatoes134"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, to be of good quality, require to be fully ripened. If not matured, like other products of the earth, before the frost comes on, how can we expect successful results? Why should we be astonished at decay and rotten ness among the immature <a name="potatoes135"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, checked in their growth by the severity of early winter ?judge The ever said that his experience in the <a name="potato89"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, during the last year, had been very much like that of the president of the society, Dr. Week man. He had planted upon a sandy loam three varieties of <a name="potatoes136"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the Garter, the flesh color, and the pink eye; but he had seen nothing of disease amongst them. He had never had finer <a name="potatoes137"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for the table; but others about him, who had planted upon clay soils, and especially upon level lands, where the water from the heavy fall rains of the last season did not[ 75] '204 readily pass off, had suffered from the decay of their <a name="potatoes138"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. He did pot apprehend .any evil consequences from any thing like a general or seated disease in our <a name="potatoes139"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> nothing but t a a favorable season and proper cultivation would remove. He had had experience in growing <a name="potatoes140"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> upon the bottom lands of the Hudson, upon sandy loams, and upon sand and clay mixed. He had had the best success upon the last description ofso6i, with in quantity and quality of the crop. He had, from his extprienceaid Observation, come to the conclusion that land that would produce good wheat would also produce good <a name="potatoes141"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. He preferred planting early , i ad, if i a clay loam, upon an undulating surface; for in this kind of soil, if the, ground is level, unless thoroughly under drained, the crop is very likely to suffer from the early fall rains while it is coming to maturity. This risk is not encountered in sandy loams ; there you are pretty sure of an article of good quality, but generally much less in quantity. There is great ad vantage in ri asking the ground rich, and he preferred planting nigh top of the ground, rather than burying in deep furrows; but dryer and fighter soils will admit of deeper planting than letter and heavier. To crop suffers more from an excess of water than the <a name="potato90"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Later from heavy rains, standing i lathe field for any considerable time, is sure to work an injury, u i ness the roots of the plant are kept above its reach. By early planting, he meant from th'le st to the 15th of May in this latitude. The crop suffers frcid127mdrought, if it occurs about the time the <a name="potato91"><mark>potato</mark></a> begins to form. This is as likely to overtake the early planted as the later ; but, if this is escaped, the early planted is surest for a great yield and good quality. You are not likely to get a fully ripe <a name="potato92"><mark>potato</mark></a> from the top that has been killed by the fall frost. The .<a name="potatoes142"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted should be of good size, and not cut into small pieces. The seed put in the hill forms the capital for the plant to commence business upon. You might as well expect a vigorous blade of wheat or corn from a small and withered grain, as a strong plant from a small <a name="potato93"><mark>potato</mark></a>. 'his crop should not be put two successive years upon the same gr our id. In sandy loam, he had known the crop to fall off half thesecocid127td year, with the same treatment, and as good a season, except that the first crop was upon a newly turned sod. Mr. Hansom Took, of Saratoga, agent for the newly projected State prison, remarked that he had not recently been engaged in agricultural pursuits, and his information on this subject had been principally obtained in answer to inquiries. In the immediate neighborhood of his residence Saratoga Springs) very little, if any loss, had been suffered by this disease. The soil was dry and sandy. One intelligent farmer informed him that .n his own farm, where the soil was porous, he lost none of a crop yieldingab6iut 2,000 bushels; while of a field he purchased on a neighboring farm, before digging, here the soil was clay by, and retained much water, he lost the greater part of the crop. Another informed him, that where he planted the same kind of <a name="potatoes143"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in two fields of different soils, with but one days difference as to time, those upon a dry soil 'were uninjured, while he lost about the half of those grown upon a we soil. Mr. C. remarked that, although planted at the same time, those upon the wet soil would be later in coming to maturity; and it was believed by the owner that they were injured, by a very warm fall of rain before entirely ripe: "or. C. said, in conclusion, that, from what information he had been able to obtain on it his subject, it was the opinion of farmers in this country that the injury of the <a name="potato94"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop the past season was produced by a warm i rain 205 [a[ 75 followed by warm weather, and upon <a name="potatoes144"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> not fully ripe, or those in soils containing much water. Mr. Young, of the Assembly, from Queens county, in relatiobint the question of the president of the State society, " whether <a name="potatoes145"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, sound andeallhy when dug, had subsequently become diseased' remarked, that some <a name="potatoes146"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted in his vicinity the last season, when dug were apparently sound ; and that before his leaving home, in t December last, he ascrtainediin sorting one case containing eight bushels, that six bushels of them were completely rotten. In relation to the question which has been raised; as to the soil best adapted to the <a name="potato95"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and the quality of the seed he remarked, that the soil of the section of country he represented (long I s land) is in materially differed it from that of any other portion of the State, being principally a light sand, which is not admitted by all to be the best adapted to the growth of the <a name="potato96"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The <a name="potatoes147"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of Long I s land are general y of a meal y character, and superior quality. One striking evidence of that fact is, that they will frequently sell in the New York market for 50 cents perbushb1wwhen the Connecticut <a name="potato97"><mark>potato</mark></a>, grown upon more loam y soil is sellirigfor only 31- cents. In speaking of the disease among <a name="potatoes148"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, he would say that he was not aware of any particular disease, although the <a name="potatoes149"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of Queens county, the past season, were of inferior quality, and during the fall months large quantities of them rotted, which was generally attributed to the unfavorable season, It will be recollected that we had no rain during the whole: onhthof June, and the <a name="potatoes150"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which were not materially affected by the d taught, were sound, and our only god <a name="potato98"><mark>potato</mark></a>. We find it altogether preferable to plan tour <a name="potatoes151"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> very early or very late. Those planted as soon as: the frost will permit are decidedly the best; and it will be recollected that the young and vigorous plant is not easily killed by the frost, as one that is mature and ripe. The early planted <a name="potato99"><mark>potato</mark></a> gets its principal growth before the heat of midsummer, which usually brings with it dry weather a sure cheek to all vegetation. The <a name="potato100"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant in mid season (or late in the month of May) is usually checked by the scorching sun or drought of midsummer, (july and August) from which it never recovers and the consequence is, small size, light produce, and inferior quality. Those planted late in the season form and mature as the weather becomes more cool; aid the growth being more rapid, the <a name="potato101"><mark>potato</mark></a> is larger, and the produce greater than the early planted <a name="potato102"><mark>potato</mark></a>; bu it the flavor and richness are not as good, a too rapid growth not being congenial to the <a name="potato103"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I i relation to the mode of cultivation, (said Mr. Young) we take afield where corn was grown the preceding year, and now prepared for oats or barley, in' which a portion is reserved for <a name="potatoes152"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which is ploughed in drills about' three feet apart; in' with drills is placed a liberal quantity of stable or barn yard manure, as is always required in cultivating our laid. The <a name="potatoes153"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are then dropped about ten inches apart; we then plough a furrow on each side of the drill, covering up the manure; the fired w is left il this rough state until the sprout is about appearing at the surface withes of hickory are then wound among the teeth of a harrow, with: which the field is harrowed length wise of the drills, which partially levels the surface and kills the weeds; after the vine is well above the ground, we plough and he; before the vine is in full: blossom, we again plough, and v with the he hill up the rows. Nothing further is done until harvesting, which is accomplished by sloughing each drill length is e, which leaves the principal portion of the <a name="potatoes154"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the surface, to be gathered by the boys- aft of" hi[ 75 206 we harrow the field, and pick up the balance of the crop; which we are careful to protect from the rains or wet, and have housed the same day as gathered   n relation to the seed, we find the <a name="potato104"><mark>potato</mark></a> degenerates, like all other vegetation, With the exception of weeds. After cultivating one variety a few years, it is found that the vines lose their vigor the <a name="potatoes155"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of less size, the produce much smaller. A few years since, the most choice variety was a yellowish <a name="potato105"><mark>potato</mark></a>, called the "english white" then the celebrated kidney" or To ole <a name="potato106"><mark>potato</mark></a>; then the "pink eye" and now the " Verser" is the universal favorite. Professor Commons, of the geological survey, remarked, that the disease of the <a name="potato107"><mark>potato</mark></a>, as shown by the microscope, is located in the cellular tissue. The starch granules do not appear to be affected at first, nor until the disease has existed for some time. The disease itself is a true gangrene commencing in of lie cellular' tissue, at numerous points, till finally the whole becomes involved in it. The skin preserves its soundness for a long time after the rest of the <a name="potato108"><mark>potato</mark></a> is destroyed. Three causes may be assigned for this decay: 1. Rapid growth, promoted by high temperature and much rain just at the period of ripe king. 2. Constitutional decay of the seed, from age. 3. The nature of the soil, together with late planting. Such evidence was a deduced (said Professor Commons) to show that <a name="potatoes156"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, upon a clay soil, especially if planted late, were or have been particularly subject to the -disease; while those which were planted on a sandy soil, and were ripe when gathered, have not been wholly free from disease. But the experience of the speakers generally on this occasion enforces the position that early planting in a dry, sandy loarcid127cid127presents the greatest security from future attacks of the disease. The facts and arguments at this meeting, it may be seen by this abstract of discussion, did not justify a supposition that the theory of European writers, respecting the alleged de genera cy of certain kinds of <a name="potatoes157"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, is any wise applicable here, so far as the losses of last year are concerned. Of ar as the loss being occasioned here by the ' de genera cy" of certain, varieties of <a name="potatoes158"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, it is in proof that many of the best crops were realized from the oldest varieties. The     e most. hardy kinds, it seems, have been least affected ; and the least hardy such as the Verser, or <a name="chenango0"><mark>Chenango</mark></a>, Foxitechave suffered most. It was nearly the unanimous opinion of those who spoke on the subject, that the prevalence of the defect or "disease of last year was caused by the very warm and wet weather following a severe and long continued drought. The proofs on this subject, furnished by several speakers, were that <a name="potatoes159"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which were planted on dry soil, and so early that they reached maturity before the peculiar weather alluded to, were scarcely affected at all ;whereas the same varieties, planted later, and being in ant immature state when the change took place, were seriously affected when harvested, or rotted during the winter. The prevalent opinion of the meeting was, that the best mode, under any circumstances, consisted ill planting the best kind of seed at the earliest period when the ground is in suitable condition; the yield generally proving better, while the crop is less liable to blight or defect of any kind The porto roth writer in the Sang or Whig attributes the prevalent disease among <a name="potatoes160"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to the old age of the varieties which are most affected by it. the says: 'I have been forcibly struck with this truth, that where the <a name="potato109"><mark>potato</mark></a> has been attacked with the rot, it has been confined, with fe , exceptions, to those varieties which have been propagated the longest 207 75 ]while those which have been recently introduced from the natural seed areas fair as a milk maids cheek. The fact is, that most varieties are actually dying with old age; and, like the hard winter which hastens the old man to his tomb, so the past season has been rife with all the elements necessary to quick en these principles of decay, as we have been visited with almost every extreme to which our sickle climate is subject to far as the observation of the writer has extended, the <a name="chenango1"><mark>Chenango</mark></a> variety, which has been cultivated by farmers for a long series of years, has been most affected by the disease. The English whites and long reds have not suffered so much, because they have less constitutional defects; but these 'have for some years shown strong symptoms of decay in intelligent farmer of our acquaintance corroborates the opinion advanced in the above paragraphs, attributing the disease to the constant re planting of the same seed. He says that the dis temper has become so fatal in its consequences in some of the Eastern States, that the farmers call it the <a name="potato110"><mark>potato</mark></a> cholera. The farmers of Nova Scotia, who shipped large quantities of this root to Boston during the past season, have long been acquainted with the disease, and call it the rot. It seems to pervade particular farms; and sometimes appears in the stalk, like rust, long before the <a name="potato111"><mark>potato</mark></a> has arrived at maturity ; and, on cutting open the young root, the disease will be found to exhibit itself ii black spots throughout the inside of it. At other times, the disease will appear after the <a name="potatoes161"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been harvested, and buried or put into the cellar. The first indication of the disease which the farmer receives will be from an offensive smell, arising from their decomposition. His only recourse then is to remove them as soon as possible, as the dis temper, in a few days, infects the whole body, no matter how large it may be. The progress of this dis temper among the <a name="potatoes162"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in Nova Scotia seems to have been somewhat singular t would break out suddenly, and spread from farm to farm, and cellar to cellar, lingering a few years, and then entirely disappearing for a time. The farmers, supposing the epidemic was located somewhere about the premises, resorted to white washing and cleansing their cellars, but to no effect. At length the evil was discovered to be as stated above in the continual re planting of the same seed. Like all other plants, the <a name="potato112"><mark>potato</mark></a> finally degenerates and runs out. The Nova Scotians now plant the balls, and thus procure new seed, which, during the second year, arrives at maturity and full size. Need thus procured is proof against the rot; and by this practice they were enabled to furnish seed <a name="potatoes163"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to some of our Newengland farmers for last springs planting. The dis temper with this indispensable plant seems not to be confined to this side of the Atlantic, but has long been known to the people of I re land, whose <a name="potato113"><mark>potato</mark></a> eating prop enmities are so proverb i al. From a gentleman from that country, we learn that in 1816 the apple <a name="potato114"><mark>potato</mark></a> (which, for several years previous, was the favorite and most excellent of the many species then in existence in that country) exhibited symptoms of decay riot unlike those already spoken of, and ceased to be a reliable portion not only of the sea stock of the emigrant, but was seldom purchased for the more immediate use of the table. The result was, that the farmers discontinued its cultivation, unwilling to lose their time and tillage on seed which could no longer sustain the reputation of the stock; and this is still the custom there t would hence appear that, either unable or in disposed to inquire ii to the cause and nature of the decay, they came at once to the room of the evil, by[ 75] 20 rejecting the diseased esch lent altogether. In the subject of <a name="potatoes164"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I wish authority is not so very bad New York Tribune. Spotatoesfrom all directions we hear complaints of rot, or premature decay, in the <a name="potato115"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. His. crop is so important in the Northern and Eastern States, that we need no apology for being somewhat particular in our notices of it. The Cleveland (ohio) Herald says: 'the <a name="potato116"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in this section, which a few weeks since promised to be a very large one, we learn from our agricultural friends, is much injured by diseased <a name="potatoes165"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In many fields, a considerable share of the <a name="potatoes166"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are diseased and rotten and in some, so much as to be entirely worthless. Digging does not appear to arrest the progress of the disease in <a name="potatoes167"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as some have lost their crop after taking it from the hill. We are informed that, in some instances, diseased <a name="potatoes168"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have proved fatal to swine fed with them From the Rochester Democrat. The hear that, ii many sections of the country, the <a name="potato117"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop has been considerably injured by the rot. This is probably owing to some new disease, instead of the drought the same calamity having last year happened to that crop at the Last, when the season was directly the reverse of what it is now. It is dangerous using <a name="potatoes169"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> thus affected. We have heard of recent instances of the death of animals, to which <a name="potatoes170"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> partially delayed had been fed From the New Haven Heraldwe have been told that, in one town in this county, the effluvium exhaled from an un dug <a name="potato118"><mark>potato</mark></a> field was as offensive as white fish; and that this is the case at Horse Neck, &c. That at Vol chester, men could scarcely he hired at        $2 per day to remove these putrefying articles from the cellars and, in some places, farmers had ploughed them in deep, to get rid of them. In our own vicinity, many <a name="potatoes171"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> (more particularly those dug within a week) are afflicted with this malady. A friend has a crop raised from a hamper of wish <a name="potatoes172"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which had no rot affection among them ; but a row of Mergers, contiguous, were every one of them wholly rotten. It is said some persons have been afflicted with indisposition from eating <a name="potatoes173"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> this season; and that one person lost two hogs, which had died in consequence of having eaten of them. This being the case, the peculiar nature of the offensive virus generated must be different from that which takes place in decaying old <a name="potatoes174"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, kept late in the spring or summer, of which my hogs and cows have always eaten with impunity. The extraordinary offensive ness of <a name="potatoes175"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> affected in this manner was brought strongly to to our perception yesterday. A bushel of a choice kind, of small size, had, been dug from a dry piece of ground in the upper part of the city. Theyliad been placed in a shed room over night, where they were noticed by the cook, (an I wish woman) who had heard nothing said, and .had noticed noecayinag ones among them. The observed that those <a name="potatoes176"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had better be removed, as they rendered the place very offensive. The basket was emptied under the shade of a tree, and examined, and four or five small ones, only were found delayed some on one side, or at one end, from each of which an offensive efluvium of great intensity emanated; and one person, used to farming, &c, did not get over the effect of their influence for several minutes. D are strongly of opinion that <a name="potatoes177"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had better be left in the 209 [a[ 75 ground, to be dug when wanted, or till cooler weather; and purchasers had better buy but few at a time to put into the cellar. "MEDI  Custhe same disease prevails extensively among the <a name="potatoes178"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in Massachusetts, and the southern part (at least) of New Hampshire. From Paine, which is the most important <a name="potato119"><mark>potato</mark></a> growing State in the Union in proportion to its population, we have heard no complaint. In the contrary, theBangor Whig says: "the <a name="potato120"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in Paine will be better this year than for some years pastDissease among <a name="potatoes179"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> he have several times alluded to disease among <a name="potatoes180"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The same disease is noticed in the Amherst Express, Pittsfield Run, and Bridge port (on n) Farmer. It appears to be very extensive; and this crop, in many towns, is nearly destroyed. We have afield of' Mergers' that have nearly all rotted; while ' Garters' adjoining, appear much less injured. A writer in the last Pittsfield Run remarks is yet, I believe no one has accounted for this disease. In examining my own field, I find that each remaining green leaf is covered with small insects, about the size of the house flea, very black, which fly off when disturbed. The tender parts of the leaves appear to have been eaten, which may account for the premature decay of the tops' "sort hampton (MassDemocrat. Not among the <a name="potatoes181"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> he understand from a gentleman residing in West chester, (says the Courier) that the old trouble among the <a name="potatoes182"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> has returned in that county. In some farms the crops have so rotted in the ground that scarcely any portion of them will be worth diggings; and, in nearly all the fields, the injury has taken place to a more or less extent Cause of the <a name="potato121"><mark>potato</mark></a> failure For some time after the failures appeared, I durst not venture to offer my opinion on the subject; but, from seeing the fanciful opinions that began to be ventured as to the cause of failure, I turned my attention to the subject, and soon came to be satisfied that the evil arose entirely from the seed being placed in the ground when it and the manure were too dry to bring on vegetationCorfrespondent of thewyrshire agriculturists." Potatoeswe have heard complaints in this and neighboring counties of a disease among <a name="potatoes183"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which causes them to rot. The following is from the Green field (pass) Democrat' The failure of the <a name="potato122"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop seems to be universal throughout the Northern States. In this vicinity, scarcely any will be preserved' Thebarre Gazette says: 'early or quite the entire crop of <a name="potatoes184"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this region is lost. When dug, they are found to be diseased and rotten. Some have been dug early, and placed in the cellar in an apparently sound condition, and in a few days found to be decaying fast. They appear to sight and smell as if rotten. Several of our farmers have commenced sloughing them in, in the field. We learn that the difficulty extends to all the region about us. It is said some hogs have died, after being fed with them. To reasonable cause is given for this singular occurrence. Should the crop fail throughout New England in the same manner, great suffering as well as loss must ensue The senior editor of the Boston Courier, in a letter from Trenton, Oneidacounty, New Work, mentions that the <a name="potato123"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is nearly destroyed by rust in that region. In one farm he noticed, besides its necessary number of ordinary laborers, more than one hundred swarms of bees, which had 14[ 75 1 210 already made for their owner, during the present season, honey enough to purchase in the New York market all the luxuries, food, and wearing apparel, that a large family could require for its gratification, and give him a surplus in cash to add to his former capital his last statement, respecting the bees, &c, though it does not relate to the <a name="potato124"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, is yet sufficiently interesting to. allow it to stand Disease among the <a name="potatoes185"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> disease of peculiar character seems to have affected the present crop of <a name="potatoes186"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in some parts of the country, and is producing serious effects. The el fremont (N. H.) Eagle has the following article on the subject: " The <a name="potato125"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop he regret to learn that this vegetable, which a few weeks ago gave great promise of an abundant crop, has, on almost every farm in this vicinity, been damaged, and, in many instances, wholly destroyed, by a disease hitherto unknown among our farmers. The stock bears the same appearance as when struck by rust, and the vegetable immediately decays. When first discovered, many of our farmers went ,to digging, but soon found the decomposition did not stop When taken from the earth ; and in all cases where the damaged crop has been put into the cellar, so offensive has been the smell arising from them, that they had forthwith to be removed and buried up in the ground. It has been suggested that farmers had better not dig the crop at present, but let them remain in the earth until the damaged portion should become so far delayed as to be easily distinguish able. Time and unnecessary labor may thus be saved. We are told that the crop throughout the State has been similarly affected; also, in Vermont, Massachusetts, and other New England States. If the destruction has been general throughout the country, the loss, especially among the poorer portion of our population, will be severely felt he passed through Connecticut and western Massachusetts (hampden, Hampshire, and Franklin counties) a few days since, and found the <a name="potatoes187"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, almost every where, suffering from a modification of the same disease. The tops died prematurely, and before the <a name="potatoes188"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had gained their maturity but we did not learn that the <a name="potatoes189"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> (roots) had any where commence trotting. Some that we saw dug in Hampshire county were sound and good. The latest planted <a name="potatoes190"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> suffered, most" West field, Pass, Sov. 21.-The <a name="potato126"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop throughout this region, and very extensively, as you already know, has suffered serious injury from some cause not yet fully ascertained. I can add nothing accurate to the information already before the public ; but suppose that, although the disease affects alike <a name="potatoes191"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a variety of soils, yet it is worse in the mountainous districts than on the plains and near the Connecticut river. Garters seem to fare better than Mergers, though they do not by any means escape. Both early and late <a name="potatoes192"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are spoken of as doing better than those planted at the ordinary time. <a name="potatoes193"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> which appeared good when they were dug have rotted soon after, or turned black on being boiled Stories are told of hogs having died from eating the diseased roots. But there is difficulty in obtaining accurate information here, as the disease is less severe than in the neighboring towns. An insect about the size of a flea is the only ostensible cause of the damage; it appears, however, to confine its attacks to the leaves Disease among <a name="potatoes194"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> behave noticed, throughout the country, that <a name="potatoes195"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> show signs of premature decay. The vines generally hold green until the first frost; but this year, the vines of some entire fields 211 [a[ 75 Have commenced drying up, while the <a name="potatoes196"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have not yet reached their maturity. The crop will not be half a yield. We learn, from a gentleman who has passed through New York recently, that the same disease seems to be prevalent throughout that State. This is very singular, and isa subject of sufficient importance to claim the attention of scientific men, that the causes may be made known, and, if possible, the evils remedied another yearPittsfield (pass) Eagle." The same disease prevails among the <a name="potatoes197"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this region. We saw whole fields, two weeks ago, where the vines were all dried up; and we understand, from various quarters, that the crop is so injured, that good <a name="potatoes198"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be expected to be very scarce in the fallBridgeport Farmer. For the Journal of Commerce: " Ranks of the All kill, Range county, September 21, 1844.-Not-withstanding the intensity of the drought, and its long continuance, the <a name="potatoes199"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this section of the country are rotating to such an extent as to destroy nearly the whole crop. There are two kinds of rot the dry and the wet: The latter reduces the <a name="potato127"><mark>potato</mark></a> to a substance like paste, with tenacity sufficient to rope when held up, and the semifluid mass strings down like honey. The cause of this disease cannot be ascertained, or even guessed at. The <a name="potato128"><mark>potato</mark></a> is first attacked with the disease, after which the vines die and become dry, and in that state can be pulverized to a powder. <a name="potatoes200"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> have, comparatively speaking, been but recently introduced into use; but the consumption has become very extensive, taking the place of other food. Farmers will be obliged to turn their attention to the cultivation of other vegetables, if the <a name="potato129"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops continue to fail for years to come as they have done for two years past. The <a name="potato130"><mark>potato</mark></a> contains about 72 per cent. water, and 28 per cent. meal. The meal is composed of three distinct substances, viz: feu la, fibrous matter, and mucin age. The proportions of each may be set down at 16 per cent. feu la, 8 per cent. fibrous matter, and 4 per cent. mucin age. <a name="potatoes201"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> are often used for making starch, and sometimes for making whiskey.

An intelligent farmer from that section states, that in a field of 500 bushels of <a name="potatoes207"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, 474 bushels are rotten; and his neighbors fields are touched in the same way' The Providence Ran script of Friday states that three men in Cumberland are reported to have died, a day or two since, from eating diseased <a name="potatoes208"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>' The editor of the New Bedford Bulletin states that in different parts t[ 75 ]a] 212 New Hampshire, quite a number of cattle have lost their lives in the same way. in e farmer in Lanfrey lost eight or nine hogs, which had been fed upon his <a name="potatoes209"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and there are many other instances of a similar character in that section From the Massachusetts Slough man, September, 21, 1844."

In some fields where it has not been discovered till within the last five or six days, but few can now be found that are not affected more or less. It is the opinion of some, that there will not be enough saved for seed. There they have been dug, and put in cellars after the rot had commenced in some, the whole have been entirely spoiled. We are informed they are in the same condition in the neighboring towns and the adjoining parts of New Hampshire. The weather for about a fortnight previous to the first of September was very wet, and towards the last of August the vines rushed suddenly, being dead in three or four days after the rust began; yet they yield tolerably well. Now, sir, can you tell us the cause of this decay in the root ?a? and can they be as sorted so effectually as to save those not yet affected ?a? Or must the crop be a total loss ?a? "A Subscri  Ber" South Woodstock, Of, September 9, 1844."' We apprehend there are not many in this country who have much experience oh this subject. We hear many complaints this year, from various quarters, of the rotating of <a name="potatoes212"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the field; but, as we have never suffered from rot in our own fields, nor seen the disease prevailing in the fields of' others, we can do no more than theorise on the cause or causes of this attack in the most useful root with which Providence has favored us. Of     t has, in this country, been very generally supposed that the <a name="potato135"><mark>potato</mark></a> is not injurious to any soil that their tendency is to enrich, rather than tooimpoverish the grounds that bear them; though our own individual opinion has long been, that <a name="potatoes213"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are more exhausting, or at least more injurious to some kinds of soil, than I indian cor p is. In some of our sandy foams we find we have better harvests of grass and of hay after corn than after <a name="potatoes214"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> though both fields were equally manured." We also find that rotation is more necessary when <a name="potatoes215"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are planted, than in corn or other crops; that, when planted for two or three years in succession on the same plot, the harvest diminishes, and the vines are much more liable to rust. This has been noted in Nqecid127) Hampshire, where very large quantities have been raised for dis tilling; also in Paine, where the soil is well adapted to the <a name="potato136"><mark>potato</mark></a>. We have seen English accounts of diseases in <a name="potatoes216"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and to such extent that whole counties have discontinued all attempts to raise them. Some have recommended procuring seed from a distance, and others a strict rotation of crops, which would admit the <a name="potato137"><mark>potato</mark></a> but once in a number of years. We are inclined to think a clay by soil is less injured by them, and favors their production more than sandy loams. We have raised large quantities of them on our farm on the banks of the Kennebec; and though the soil there seems to suit them, they re more liable to rust than in Massachusetts. They are very apt to rust 213 [a[ 75 1 when you plant a field with them for two or three years in succession. The <a name="potato138"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant was considered poisonous in South America, whence it came, but it has much improved on transplanting. Met now, if you expose a <a name="potato139"><mark>potato</mark></a> for two days to the sun, it turns green, and is not fit for use. <a name="potatoes217"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> are thought to be light food, and easy of digestion; and this may be, when they are grown on a congenial soil, and become so ripe as to be meal y; burdino cooked food is harder of digestion than an unripe or watery <a name="potato140"><mark>potato</mark></a>, such as most people are obliged to eat, if they eat any, You will find that an animal which happens to vomit food two or three hours after eating will always heave up large bits of <a name="potato141"><mark>potato</mark></a>, if it has eaten any. Sometimes the* bits of <a name="potato142"><mark>potato</mark></a> only will come, the other food being all digested he can suggest no better remedy for the rot in <a name="potatoes218"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> than planting a field with them once only in a number of years, and then on land not very wet. Met grounds and wet summers are disagreeable to them. He once supposed the more wet from the clouds, the better would be the <a name="potato143"><mark>potato</mark></a> harvest; but it is not so. The present crop, in our vicinity, will be more than middling, though we have had a dry summer. Change of seed or tubes may also have a good effect, but both may not remedy the evil spoken of. We should like to hear facts or opinions from other correspondents on the subject of this complaint. We should like to know whether <a name="potatoes219"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not more liable to this attack when they are planted with green manure in the hill, than when it is spread over the field, and mingled with the soil Editor" The disease in <a name="potatoes220"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> Have you found out the cause of the strange rot in tie <a name="potato144"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop? is the anxious inquiry of almost every farmer we converse with. It is indeed an important question, for it affects interests of vast magnitude to the farmers of this country. The extent .of the evil is much greater than was at first imagined. We see accounts of the partial destruction of the crop in many parts of nearly all the New Englandstates, as well as this State; also in Canada, and the northern portion of, Ohio. In many parts of Europe, too, the injury sustained by this crop, from the same or a similar, cause, has excited much anxiety for several years past; and much discussion has been had respecting the cause and remedy, but with no better success in arriving at satisfactory results than in this country. Several correspondents, in accordance with our request, have, during the past month, sent us the results of their observations andcogitations on this subject; but, we regret to say, they are all so vague and contradictory, and embrace so few facts, that their publication would be of no benefit. In all matters of this kind, we want facts, not theories. Give us the whole particulars facts minutely observed and plainly described and we will do the the prizing, if any is necessary. In our exchange papers, and others that have been sent us, we find a vast amount of speculation, together with some facts and plausible philosophy on this subject still, however, we have seen nothing that, to our mind, appears like a definite and satisfactory explanation of the cause of the malady. In order, however, to throw all the light we can on the subject, and to assist our, readers in making up their minds, or in conducting further experiments and observations, we will give a summary view of the various theories extant, and the arguments that have been a deduced in their support, together, with some remarks of our own in relation to them nsectsMr. Henry M. Paine, of Oxford, in a communication for the Massachusetts Attract, says he examined the diseased <a name="potatoes221"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with a mi, 75 ]a] 214croscope that magnified nine thousand times. He found no insects in the roots themselves; but in the diseased s talks, near the junction with the roots, he discovered an insect of a dark brown color, having the body shaped like the soldier ant, with the legs of the hairy garden spider. In the fore body were two projecting sockets, plainly indicating that the insect had at some period belonged to the winged tribe he copy from the Attract the above representation of this insect magnified. The editor says: " Whether this insect causes the disease in the root, or the disease in the root causes the presence of the insect, is yet a looted question The editor of the West field (pass) News Letter says: The rot in the <a name="potato145"><mark>potato</mark></a> is not owing to an epidemic influence operating as a disease, &c but to an insect that has made it a nidus for the perpetuate on of its species He then refers to the numerous instances of injury from insects to fruit, crops, &c; but does not make out a very strong argument to our mind, nor evince much knowledge of entomology. From some of the infected <a name="potatoes222"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>" he says, " may be seen the insect in its papa state escaping; in others, you may, on boiling, find the rudiments of the insect in embryo and in others, no insects will be found, they having escaped into thegroundMr. Archibald Mcalister, of Salem, N. Y., in the Washington Countypost, says: "about the 1st of September I opened a few hills of pink eye <a name="potatoes223"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having delayed tops, when hundreds of small white insects were seen on the <a name="potatoes224"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; some of the <a name="potatoes225"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were entirely rotten. I however resolved to give the subject a more thorough investigation. Having washed a few of them perfectly clean, I examined and readily discovered that there were, first, minute punctures through the skin into the substance of the <a name="potato146"><mark>potato</mark></a>; the healthy appearance of the skin for a short distance around the perforations was changed to a brown color; second, a vesication or blister; third, a vegetable abscess of limited extent, filled with purulent matter, evidently showing that the <a name="potatoes226"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are very much infested by the insects, and were going to decay in consequence of the ravages of these borders; fourth, the appearance of moist gangrene, of a livid or purple color which is only a variety of decomposition, resulting from the injury inflicted by those insects The perforations in the skin appear to be made by the different kinds of worms. The most numerous are about half an inch in length, of a brown color; body oval, when full size. The other is a small brown worm, body round, and the size of a pin wire, an inch in length. In the <a name="potatoes227"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are small white spots, resembling <a name="potato147"><mark>potato</mark></a> starch, which I at first mistook for mould, but proved to be the castings of these destructive borersAs the <a name="potatoes228"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were past the flowering season when I commenced my observations, I had no opportunity to trace the history of these insects any further; and, consequently, their larvae are unknown to me. A good description of the larvae, and a more full account of their habits, seasons changes and transformations they undergo, are still wanted; it is probably the curculio, a genus of insects belonging to the coleoptera or beetles order. Judging from a few experiments which I have made, by sifting airslakedlime both on the sound and on those which have been punctured by the insect, I believe that it will destroy many of the insects, and have a salutary effect on the <a name="potato148"><mark>potato</mark></a> 215 [75 ]george R. Jerkins, Esq, in the Tic a Daily Gazette, says: " For several years past, I have been making a few observations, in order, if possible, to determine the cause of this disease. I find the vines of those <a name="potatoes229"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are rotten to be hollow for four or five inches above the surface of the ground; they bear the appearance of having been eaten out by an insect; and, in many cases, I discovered a small green colored maggot in the cavity. In scraping off the outer bark from the vine, I discovered that the leaf less buds had the appearance of having been eaten out, leaving the holes through which, I conjectured, the insect had passed. Those vines attached to a sound and ripe <a name="potato149"><mark>potato</mark></a> were solid, and partially green, I s it not possible, and highly probable, that all this evil may thus be caused by an insect ?"I n the Massachusetts Spy, Mr. Samuel Part well says: " From an examination of several varieties of <a name="potatoes230"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, from the same and different locations, I think I trace the disease, from its first attacks to itsconsummation in the total destruction of the <a name="potato150"><mark>potato</mark></a>. It is found more commonly, though not exclusively, in connexion with the green tops, on late crops. It commences in the eye or germ of the future plant, which first dies; and from this point it spreads wider and deeper, till the whole <a name="potato151"><mark>potato</mark></a> decays. In connexion with all its stages, except its most advanced decay, but more especially in its incident attacks, are found maggots, or, i argue, and other creatures, which I shall call insects; and even in the most delayed specimens there are, apparently, traces of their mischievous work. The larvae, or worms, average about a line in length; are slender, with dark heads, semi transparent bodies, and are sluggish in their movements The insects are, in some, invisible to the naked eye; others, a mere visible white point; and others, still, nearly a line in length, with numerous short legs, long antennae, of a white color, extremely active and shy were we have a goodly array of witnesses ; and more might be a deduced, proving that insects are sometimes found in the diseased vegetables, both in the roots and tops; and it is possible that they are the cause of the mischief; but the evidence is only circumstantial, and is far from amounting to proof. It is well known that decaying substances often attract the large of insects; and their presence in these cases is quite as likely to be the result as the cause of the decay. I influence of the atmosphere, ,c n the Amherst (pass) Express is a scientific communication, probably written by Professor Pitch cock, which contains much speculation, of but little value, together with some ideas worthy of consideration. We give two or three extracts Plants, being living beings, like animals, requiring a certain state of air, moisture, light, heat, and electricity, and proper food, will of course be liable to disease, like animals, from an excess or deficiency of any of the agents that affect them Thus, mildew results from an excessive perspiration from the leaves the blight in corn and oats has sometimes been the consequence of a great amount of electricity or lightning; the dropsy, or jaundice, results from a superabundance of raw juice, from frost, or bad cultivation; and blotches and cancer from a deficiency of nourishment or a sterile ty of soil But the specific character and cause g of disease in plants are comparatively but little known, yet we frequently see their effects; and my conviction is, that the failure of the <a name="potato152"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop this year is the result of disease. The[ 75 ]a] 216 tops failed first, and soon appeared as if they had endured hard frosts. Now, it is in the leaves and s talks that the juices and other principles that nourish the roots and tubes are prepared; so that, if these fail, the <a name="potatoes231"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> must be stopped in their growth, and their juices and other ingredients be left in a crude and half formed state. In other words, they do not ripe n, and of course are liable to decay. Those which I have seen appear like <a name="potatoes232"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> a few days after they have been frozen; and, on cutting them open, they look like half delayed wood. Was to the supposed poisonous quality of <a name="potatoes233"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> affected by this malady, all unripe fruit is unhealthy, more or less ; and I doubt whether this is hot about all we can say concerning these <a name="potatoes234"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> mean, that there is not any peculiar virus in them that needs excite a panic; and although it is true that the <a name="potato153"><mark>potato</mark></a> does belong to a poisonous tribe of plants the solanaceae or night shade tribe. And it is not impossible that when its secretions become unhealthy, they may more easily change into strong poisons than in other plants. But there is one principle on this subject, which, if regarded, may, I think, prevent all injury to man or beast. Boiling, or roasting, or baking unripe fruit, and even some very deadly poisonous vegetable substances, will render them comparatively harmless, and even highly nutritions. Thus the root called cassava, which is a deadly poison if eaten raw, is eminentlynutritious when roasted. There is no danger that man will eat the <a name="potatoes235"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> under consideration without cooking, and therefore there is little danger to men if they reject those water soaked ; and I think they ought, if possible, to follow the same rule as to the lower animals, viz: to boil the <a name="potatoes236"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> given to them, and the danger will be small strongly suspect that the strange disease, which, for several years, has so deeply affected the sca more, plane, or button wood tree, (plat anus accidental is) is analogous to that which has now assailed the <a name="potato154"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I was struck with the resemblance, when cut open, between a partially delayed branch of the sca more and a <a name="potato155"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the same state. I do not believe that in either case the disease results from parasitic plants or insects-two fruitful sources of disease to plants. Why may it not be some atmospheric agency, too subtle for the cognizance of our senses, like those which bring such epidemics as the influenza and the cholera over particular districts or continents ?a? Modern science has shown us that many of the most powerful agencies of nature are concealed from common, and even acute observation. May there not be others, yet un discovered, which deeply affect the delicate machinery of organic life ?"P. Prince writing the above, I have been examining my <a name="potato156"><mark>potato</mark></a> field, which is not large, but I find that the decay has made a good deal of progress within ten days; and also, as I fancy, the process of ripe king those <a name="potatoes237"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that are sound; so that it is now pretty easy, at a glance, to separate the sound from the decaying ones; and hence, in my opinion, it is almost time to dig them, as the tops and roots appear to have lost nearly all their vitality. After the sound ones are dug, I think they ought to be spread opt in the sun for several days, till thoroughly dry, before they are laid in a pile; and then, I fancy, there will not be much danger of decay. I find them in the worst state on the wet test ground. The Garter <a name="potato157"><mark>potato</mark></a> is the most delayed; the common round red ones nearly as much; and the ladies' fingers scarcely at all <a name="potatoes238"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> intended for food should never be laid in the sun. It may benefit those intended for planting. Met weather has, by many persons, been 217 assigned as the probable cause of the rot; among these, is the writer last quoted from. He saysSAs to the cause of this disease, I feel more in doubt. It must be something, however, derived from the atmosphere. It is so widespread, I incline to the opinion that the season has been too wet for this crop ; and yet, on inquiring of Professor Knell, who keeps an accurate register of the amount of rain in this place, I find the quantity for June, July, and August, to be less than for two years past. I am certain that my garden suffered exceedingly during the three past years from drought ; but this year it has been rather too wet. And I think the apparent discrepancy reconciled, by finding that this year the rains and showers have been more equally spread through the season than in the two previous years; and hence we learn that the amount of rain in a season is a very poor index by which to judge of the state of the soil as to moisture and dryness. I a p confident that in this region the ground has been too wet for some crops the <a name="potato158"><mark>potato</mark></a> among the rest; and I find that on dry land it is less affected than upon wet soil. If this be the cause of the disease, I shall expect to find that those parts of the country which have been dry will not have suffered much in this way n direct opposition to this opinion, many writers have attributed this disease to the drought. And it is well known that the past season has been uncommonly dry in most parts of the country. Deterioration of varieties, (cid127cThe editor of the Buffalo Commercialadvertiser says: "the disease has been on the increase for several years, and has excited great interest in Scotland, Germany, Sweden, and Russia. The better opinion in those countries is, that by long propagation from the tube, without recurring to the natural seed of the plant, it has lost a portion of its vital power, and hence is extremely prone to blight, rust, and to rot. We have paid considerable attention to this matter for the last eighteen months, and have found that many plants, last season and this, have perfected no blossoms or seed. Whenever balls are produced, they should be carefully dried, and planted next spring, with only a few <a name="seeds26"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in a hill, and cultivated in the usual way. <a name="potatoes239"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> thus grown, in Germany, have been imported into Edinburgh, and proved to be both sound arid excellent roots by several years' experience. The same trials have been made in Massachusetts, and on the Hudson river, with like success. The <a name="potato159"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is the most valuable of any grown in this State. The loss last season from rotating exceeded    $700,000, and we fear that this year it will fall but little below             $1,000,000."I n relation to the foregoing, we should state that the circumstance of the plants producing no blossoms or balls is no evidence of a lack of vital power. It is a peculiarity of several varieties, that they never produce flowers or fruit. An excellent new variety in England, twenty years ago, was named "not lowers" from this circumstance. Another objection to this theory is the fact, that Mergers, and several other comparatively new varieties, have suffered worse than the flesh colored and English whites, which are the oldest kinds known in this country. It does appear, how ver, that entirely new varieties, and seed obtained from other countries, are beast liable to be affected. The New Haven Herald says: " A friend has a crop raised from a hamper of (imported) I wish <a name="potatoes240"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which are free from the rot, while a row f 'mergers contiguous are every one affected[ 75 ]a] 218 The editor of the Albany Cultivator, speaking of the crop of Professorhall, near that city, says: "among several kinds planted on the same description of soil, we found that the Mergers had suffered most. The early June and some other kinds planted at the same time, in adjoining rows, were but little affected. The flesh colored, round blue, and long red varieties, have not been much injured, unless on wet heavy soils." In the same paper, Mr. M. Y. Tilden, of New Lebanon, says: " We also found that the flesh colored were less affected than the Mergers, Garters, or pink eyes Massachusetts paper says: " The disease affects alike <a name="potatoes241"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a variety of soils, yet it is worse in the mountainous districts than on the plains y and near the Connecticut river, Garters seem to fare better than Mergers, though they do not by any means escape. Both early and late <a name="potatoes242"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are spoken of as doing better than those planted at the ordinary timeManuring in the hill Some writers attribute the disease in <a name="potatoes243"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to the contact of manure with the roots in the ground. Among these, is the author of a treatise on the subject, published at Glasgow, Scotland. He recommends maturing only for the previous crop, or else using rotted manure, and incorporating it thoroughly with the soil before the <a name="potatoes244"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are planted. Several instances have been related in this country, where the <a name="potatoes245"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> manured in the hill, or row, were much more injured than those manured otherwise. A farmer in Vermont states that his <a name="potatoes246"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, where the land was manured with barn yard manure, are almost entirely cut off by the rot; while those in a piece manured with but* soil are perfectly sound and healthy. Among the foreign items in the last number of the American Agriculturists, it is stated: "his disease seems, to be as destructive in Great. Britain, I re land, France, Germany, Holland, and Russia, as in our own country and is attributed to many causes. The remedies suggested are to keep such as are intended for seed deeply buried in the ground all winter, thoroughly draining and sub soiling the land where planted; to pit them in small quantities; to select seed for planting not quite ripe, and such as have not the slightest appearance of being watery; living the land; obtaining new seed, either from planting <a name="potato160"><mark>potato</mark></a> balls, or from some distant country where they grow in a healthy state; after digging, spread the <a name="potatoes247"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the sun till they become dry and unfit for food, then s tow them away till required for planting; top dressing the plant with nitrate of soda and sulphate of soda and magnetic; selecting such tubes for seed as grow near the top of the ground, and are quite green; to plant the seed whole he would add to this, dressing the land with common salt, charcoal, much soil, and using no under composed manure New Genesee Farmer' The <a name="potato161"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot The first cage of this disease which came to our observation happened three years ago. In a quantity of <a name="potatoes248"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> brought from Nova Scotia, about 10 per cent. of them were found to be unsound; some showing, on the removal of the skin after cooking, a day black spot, covering frequently one half of the <a name="potato162"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and often leaving the other half perfectly good and meal y; some of them, on breaking open, emitting a strong disagreeable smell, and showing the color of the <a name="potato163"><mark>potato</mark></a> to have changed from the natural white to a dingy yellow. These last specimens of the disease were in different stages of progress, like those having the dry black spots but they differed from these last, by affecting uniformly the entire tube r. I n some of them, the color had but slightly changed; and though the smell was perceived somewhat, yet the <a name="potato164"><mark>potato</mark></a> was eat able. In others, the smell 219 [a[ 75 Ll had become so offensive, that, although it could not be discovered till the <a name="potato165"><mark>potato</mark></a> was cut or broken, it was immediately thrown away.  We did not then pay much attention to the disease, supposing it to have arisen from some local peculiarity of soil or cultivation, and not a matter of much importance, as it did not show itself to any serious extent Last year we heard much of this disease in the middle States, where the crop was very much lessened; and in the autumn, it was found to have made its way to some extent in New England, and to have slightly affected some fields in this vicinity. We had some excellent <a name="potatoes249"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raise inNewburya fifth part of which, probably, during the winter, were infected with the dry black spots, in some instances covering and destroying the whole tube r; and some Nova Scotia <a name="potatoes250"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which we were called to observe during the winter, and which were put into the cellar in good order, sound as those of the preceding year, were found in a short time to have become completely rotten, and, on opening the barrels, a mass of semi liquid matter, occupying not more than half the space, was found. His decomposition had proceeded so far and so rapidly, that we were disposed at first to attribute it to the <a name="potatoes251"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having been frozen before they were placed in the cellar; but as similar cases have appeared where there was no possibility of frost having reached them, it was no doubt the effect of disease. This year, the disease has affected a great many <a name="potatoes252"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in Neweengland, as well as in the middle States. In New Hampshire, its ravages have been very great; how far it has prevailed in this vicinity, we have not yet ascertained. We had placed in our cellar, about six weeks since several barrels of excellent <a name="potatoes253"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, raised in New bury, equal to the best Nova Scotia or I wish apple <a name="potatoes254"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> we have ever eaten, and which, on repeated trials, showed not the slightest symptom of disease ; but, within the last three weeks, have discovered that they are rapidly becoming infected with the black spots, and a few of them are already entirely soft and rotten he have found, on inquiry and research, no satisfactory cause assigned for this disease. Some attribute it to the atmosphere; some to the soil; and others to an inherent disease in the tubes themselves. This last, as far as the explanation goes, is probably correct; although on newly broken upward land, it is said, the disease does not make its appearance. This kind of land, we believe, has always produced the best <a name="potatoes255"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and the evidence is not yet conclusive that the ravages can be stopped by planting on such land, because it has been found that <a name="potatoes256"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which, when dug and placed in the cellar, were in a perfectly sound state to all appearance, have sometimes been entirely lost by the disease before spring he find that this rot has prevailed in Germany, England, I re land, Scotland, the United States, and Nova Scotia, for several years; but not until within the two last does it appear to have been so extensive in the Unitedjstates as to excite much interest and anxiety among farmers. Associations of farmers and agricultural chemists in Europe have been busily engaged in investigation g the nature of the disease, but have arrived at no satisfactory conclusion. The most plausible opinion, which was first advanced by a distinguished German writer, and which is adopted by the large cultivates in I re land and Nova Scotia, is, that it is owing to the continual re planting of the same seed; and that, to preserve the <a name="potato166"><mark>potato</mark></a>, new varieties, must be frequently produced from the seed n I re land and Nova Scotia, the disease has been known, to some extent, for nearly thirty years; and girl I re land, we are told, the far famed[ 75 ]a] 220 apple <a name="potato167"><mark>potato</mark></a> had become so constantly infected with it, that its cultivation was some years ago entirely abandoned, and it has become now extinct. I n' Nova Scotia, the progress of this dis temper among the <a name="potatoes257"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> seems to have been somewhat singular. It has for a series of years been found to pervade particular farms sometimes appearing in the stalk, like rust, long before the <a name="potato168"><mark>potato</mark></a> has arrived at maturity; and, on cutting open the young root, the disease is found to exhibit itself in black spots throughout the inside of it. At other times, the dis temper has appeared after the <a name="potato169"><mark>potato</mark></a> has been harvested and put into the cellar the first intimation which the farmer received being an offensive smell arising from their decomposition ; and experience has taught them, in this contingent y, immediately to full over the whole mass, and remove every defective <a name="potato170"><mark>potato</mark></a>, as it has been found rapidly to spread over the whole if this is not done. It has sometimes broken out suddenly, and spread from farm to farm, and cellar to cellar, lingering a few years, and then entirely disappearing for a time. After trying many remedies, the farmers in that region adopted the plan of planting the balls, and thus procuring new seed, which, in two or three years, arrived at maturity and full size. We should be inclined to copy their example in this respect, and also to seek for other remedies such as planting on s ward land; sloughing in, or depositing in the hill, lime, salt, or some other substance, which could do no harm, and might operate as a preventive. In particular, where there was any fear that the <a name="potatoes258"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the cellar might become infected, we should be inclined to try putting in occasionally a layer of lime among the <a name="potatoes259"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> Our farmers, generally, are not careful enough to make experiments, and note the results. If experiments are carefully followed up, and the results accurately noted, an immense find of knowledge is ultimately gained, even if not more than one in a thousand proves successful. There is an aversion among many farmers to carefully making and recording experiments, which are of great disadvantage to themselves and to others. He recollect, several years ago, on a small, spot of the old garden soil, we lost your <a name="potatoes260"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by worms, for two successive seasons most of them being found so badly eaten, on digging, as to be unfit for cooking. The third season we tried the experiment of putting nearly a teaspoonful of salt into each hill at the time of planting. The experiment was successful; and we had a fine little crop of entirely fair and good <a name="potatoes261"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. We lost the garden the next year, and had no opportunity to try the experiment any further Newburyport Herald. Not in <a name="potatoes262"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>' I.

They are affected, more or less, in fields all over, town, and in the adjoining towns, so far as my inquiries have extended 221 [a[ 75 and some farmers let them remain in the field, concluding that they are not worth digging Now, as to the cause, we have no knowledge to guide us; for the oldest inhabitants that I have conversed with never remember the like happening before. There are various opinions. Some think they are diseased, poisonous, and have communicated their effects to those that look well, and they are not eat able. Others are of the opinion that a worm or insect has done the mischief; but I have examined a great number, in their different degrees of decay, and I discover nothing with the naked eye. The conclusion that have come to is this: As we had no rain in this town and vicinity from the 4th of August to the 26th of September, which wetted the ground to the depth of an inch, (during this interval of time the sun had most of the time shone bright, and very hot for this season of the year) the ground being very warm, and no rain to cool it, those <a name="potatoes266"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which had arrived at such an age in their growth became sun baked or burnt; the vines died immediately, and they began to rot. <a name="potatoes267"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> placed near a warm fire, and suffered to remain there some time, and then placed in the ground, or on the ground, will be affected in a similar way.

October 14, 1844."The last Amherst Express contains an interesting article (which we attribute to Professor Pitch cock) on the cause of the extraordinary and disastrous failure of the <a name="potato173"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop at the present season He expresses the opinion, that the failure of the <a name="potato174"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop this year is the result of disease. And, by way of showing how he comes to this conclusion, he remarks that the tops failed first, and appeared as if they had endured hard frosts. And as it is in the leaves and s talks that the juices and other principles that nourish the roots and tubes are prepared, if these fail, the <a name="potatoes269"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> must be stopped in their growth. They do not risen, and of course are liable to decay. Like all unripe fruit, they are unpleasant and unhealthy. He expresses doubt in regard to the cause of the disease. He thinks, however, it must be something derived from l the atmosphere, since it is so widespread. He inclines to the opinion that the season has been too wet for this crop; though, by reference to Professorsnells register of the amount of rain that has fallen in Amherst during the months of June, July, and August, he finds the quantity to be less than for two years past. Still, though he doubts not the entire accuracy of Professor Knell S account, he is certain that his own garden suffered exceedingly from drought during the last three years, while this year it has been rather too wet. He reconciles the apparent discrepancy by reference to the fact that the rains have been more equally spread through the season than in the two years previous; and, hence, that the amount of rain in a season isa very poor index by which to judge of the moisture and dryness of the soil. He is confident that the ground in this region has been too wet for <a name="potatoes270"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and he finds that in dry land they have suffered less than in wet soil.

There is no peculiar virus in them that need excite a panic. Though the <a name="potato176"><mark>potato</mark></a> belongs to a poisonous tribe of plants, cooking renders it harmless.

Farmers are puzzled to find out the cause of rot in <a name="potatoes276"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; but if they can get any light here, it is more than we can find. The season is here called a wet one, and this is assigned as the cause of rot.

Met us know what others think on this point Massachusetts Slough man, October 12, 1844." Are of potatoesexposUreMr. Editor: Being a subscribe r to your valuable paper, permit me to say a word, through it, concerning the article found in the Amherst Express, and which you attributed to Professorhitchcock, respecting the <a name="potato177"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot. With all due deference to the opinion there advanced, I think the writer, whoever he may be, entirely mistaken when he says the season has been too wet for this crop; for it was certainly very dry in this region, during the months spoken of in that article, and for some time after they were found to be rotating. But there is a great falling off (say from one-fourth to one half) of the crop in this section. Of find the rot the most destructive among those varieties which have been the longest propagated, while it is less so among those more recently introduced from the balls. I planted a kind (by some called Mohawks, which I have known for thirty years) in the same hills with a kind called Western reds, which were more recently introduced, and have invariably found, on digging them, the present week, that one half of the former are wholly rotten, or so nearly so that I left them on the ground, while not one the least defective was found among the latter. But, sir, what shall I say about the writers mode of preserving them when dug ?a? Profound chemist !a! Surely, Mr. Editor, you rightly remarked when you said dry book farming, this !a' Why, sir, I supposed that every 223 [a[ 75 boy large enough to dig <a name="potatoes281"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> knew that to let <a name="potatoes282"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> lie exposed to the rays of the sun, one half day even, had a tendency to injure them and I am of the opinion that <a name="potatoes283"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> spread in the sun for several days, agreeably to the directions of the writer above named, will be found to have acquired a property from that l urinary, or from the atmosphere, or from both, (perhaps they imbibe oxygen from the atmosphere, which may tend to render them poisonous) which will disqualify them n for the use of man or beast. In proof of this position, I will adduct a little of my practical experience in point. I exposed about a bushel of the kidney <a name="potatoes284"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to the sun in the open air, and, on examination a few days after, I found that their upper surface had become changed from white to green and that although they remained perfectly sound, as when first left out, yet they smelt strong; and on cutting and lasting them, their interior was found as green as their exterior, and they tasted as strong as they smelt n regard to the time of digging, and the mode of preserving them, I found, on inquiry, that many were inclined to dig early, as they said, in order to save them; but such persons were unable to separate the good from those which at that early part of the season were imperceptibly defective; and were obliged, after letting them remain a few days in their cellars, to carry them out again, a filthy mass. Others concluded it would be better to let them remain, good and bad, in the ground, as long as they could, and not freeze up, when, on digging them, they might with safety put those that then appeared fair into the cellars; and I think this is the more judicious course. I have just dug mine, and find that the defective are obviously so, and need not be mistaken. Low admirably <a name="potatoes285"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> keep in the ground !a! " Why, sir, it is as natural for them as for chipmunksand wood checks to remain in th ground. And were <a name="potatoes286"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as well secured from the frosts, light, and atmosphere, as are those quadrupeds, we should find in the following spring, that, instead of coming out shrivelled, and ugly, resembling those animals, they would come out improved in appearance and flavor There are various ways of preserving them in the cellar r, (though many prefer burying them deep in the sand upon a side hill, in order that they may not be injured from rains) better than the usual mode of turning them down upon the cellar bottom; for, when thus treated, they usually taste of the ground. In order to keep well, they should, on being taken out of the ground; be put immediately into tight bins, (the more dirt with them the better) which, when filled within about six inches of the top with <a name="potatoes287"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, should have a covering, as of straw or boards, or perhaps of dirt, sufficient to exclude them from the light and air."

Now rich when cooked as soon as they are dug, provided they have had time to ripe n in the ground. Met weather could not be the chief cause of the rot, for in New England it has not been a wet summer. Within 30 or 40 miles of this city it has been an uncommonly dry season, including the whole of September, when <a name="potatoes289"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted most Editor Massachusetts Ploughmanthe following are a few facts which I have collected from observation and inquiry :a[ 75 3 224" 1st. <a name="potatoes290"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> in this vicinity have rotted in grounds naturally both wet and dry perhaps a little oftener in the latter. Those <a name="potatoes291"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> slightly killed in hoping have suffered most. Observe : I do not give this as a reason, but Simply as a fact 2d. The rot has prevailed most in ground most highly dressed with barn manure, especially if placed in the hill. When <a name="potatoes292"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted without any manure, they have rotted very little. Two pieces on similar ground, (rather wet) the one manured from the barn, the other with hair, lime, flushings, &c, from the manner y, both applied in the hill; the first rotted badly, the other very little. Two pieces, the first dressed broadcast, and in the hill, from the barn ; the other broadcast, with a com post of barn manure and swamp much, much and ashes, and clear manure, both dry the first was planted early, the latter late; the first rotted in the field, and being dug in the hot weeks in September, rotted after being put into the cellar; while the latter, dug at odd jobs from the middle of September to the middle of October, suffered very little. This piece had plaster put on at the time of planting, and after the <a name="potatoes293"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were up." 3d. The Chenangos have rotted most, the old whites and yellows next, and (of the kinds raised to any extent here) the reds have rotted least. In some instances, the tops have rotted near the surface of the ground, and come, when pulled, without drawing any earth or <a name="potatoes294"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with them. Sometimes the rot causes the <a name="potato178"><mark>potato</mark></a> to become white and hard a sort of dry rot. In others, it is wet changing the <a name="potato179"><mark>potato</mark></a> to a mass of putrid matter, giving out an extremely offensive odor. Sometimes the heart of the <a name="potato180"><mark>potato</mark></a> becomes delayed, leaving the outside fair; while others rot upon the outside first 4th. It is a fact, too, that stock and swine' fed upon these <a name="potatoes295"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, partly delayed, have, in some instances, been evidently injured by them. Others, having been fed liberally from the same, have received no detriment. These are a few, statements which I can substantiate at any time. I send them to you, to use in any way that will best promote the objects we have in view, viz: detecting the cause, and finding a remedy for the disease. Disease I have inadvertently called it. Perhaps I am in error here it is the very thing to be decided; and I would not harrogate so much to myself. It has been by many here (being a new thing under the sun to them) attributed to the extremely hot weather during the last week in September ; but, if that were the cause, why did not pieces on similar ground, and under the same cultivation, suffer alike ?a? By others, it has been ascribed to drought; but, if this were the cause, why have some wet lands, and wet places in certain pieces, rotted more than the dry lands near by ?I n this particular, nothing seems to be uniform the rot prevailing sometimes in wet, at others in dry soils. Right on the subject we earnestly seek hours, with much respect" S. F. Perleynaples, October 17, 1844."" (3 Our Naples correspondent has our thanks for the above facts and comments. He agrees, in the main, with most farmers who have taken particular notice of the rot. It is certainly difficult to account satisfactorily for this unusual visitation. We are not very confident that we are correct, but we will suppose the extreme hat of September is the chief cause of the rot, and see how that supposition consists with the other facts of the case225That heat is the chief cause of it, generally, in fruits is nd roots, none will deny. Apples, in heaps, always rot sooner i hot 'death li than in cool weather, and <a name="potatoes296"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and turn is are often spoiled by rot when they are, put in large heaps, in cellars, early in September. Extreme heat, therefore, without any tiunaturrla moisture, will cause <a name="potatoes297"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to rot." All will are that September was unusually warm. To ore can show a whole week in that month, i within forty years past, of such hot weather as we felt in the latter part of that month. The air is often as hot in July, and not often hot her; but we have reason to suppose that the long continuance of hot weather in September caused the earth to be warmed more and deeper than a hot turn in July will do. The sun and air cannot warm the soil so deep in the summer months as in September, for the same reason that June, with a vertical sun, never has the air so warm as the air of July. To, also, it is Usually warmer, each day, after the sun has passed the meridian, than 1 when he is directly over head." Now, supposing our conjecture to be right, let us see whether all the other facts that have been noted correspond, or whether any of them are irreconcilable with the supposition. All our correspondents agree thatgrotuds highly man red from the barn yard have more rotten <a name="potatoes298"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> than when none is applied' and that when it is put in the hill, the case is worse than' when it is spread `ver the ground. These facts corroborate our conjecture, for all know that barn manure increases the heat of the soil." In other agreed fact is, that sandy loams have a larger proportion of rotten <a name="potatoes299"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> than clays have; and all know that sandy loams are warmer than clay by loams. We have yet heard of no instance, in Paine, of red <a name="potatoes300"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotating on cold clays." But why have Chenangos and blues rotted more than long reds? He believe the fact to be, that early Chenangos were uncommonly good, and free from rot. L We heard no complaint of any that were dug as early as August ; they were not exposed to the heat of September. But late Chenangos, blues, and other kinds that ripe n earlier than the long red, suffered more, because they were more ripe; for all ripe fruit and roots rot sooner than the unripe; and the long red seldom ri pens before the frost comes it often remains unripe till spring, when it is found rich and good. Ranges and lemons are plucked in the West I n dies while green, otherwise they would rot on their passage But some <a name="potatoes301"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> i are more hardy, more enduring than others; the long reds have now held out longer than any other kind, and rather improve with length of years. They may resist decomposition longer than common <a name="potatoes302"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> Another fact stated by our correspondent, and confirmed by numerous witnesses, is, that <a name="potatoes303"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which were killed up most with earth suffered least. In cool summers, <a name="potatoes304"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> yield best, when they are not planted deep but many of our visitors tell us this season that their deep covered <a name="potatoes305"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are better than those which were buried slightly. Now, it is well known that farmers are much inclined to put less earth around their plants in hoping than they former did, and that they make no hill for their corn. The objection to hilling corn is, that the roots are buried in cold earth. May not the modern practice of hilling but slightly have some effect to produce rot in a very hot season ?in the whole, we have no facts presented that military with the sup[ 75 ]a] 226 position that the extreme hot weather late in the season, when the earth must have been heated uncommonly deep, was the principal cause of therotThe only objection to this supposition, in our own mind, is, that, irate w Work, and in some other places, the same complaint of rot that we now hear was made last year, when September was not an uncommonly hot month Editor Massachusetts Slough man. From the New England Farmer of October 30, 1844. We had marked, for transfer to our columns, an extended account given in the London Gardeners Chronicle) of the late discussion at Glasgow respecting the causes of failures in the <a name="potato181"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop; which latter (a sour readers may already know) has been for several years similarly affected in Great Britain, as it has for the two last years in portions of this country. In preference to publishing the lengthy account above referred to, we copy the following sycosis of it from the Dublin Farmers' Gazette, which gives the sum and substance of the discussion: "iota to failures n last weeks paper we had the pleasure to copy from a Scottish contemporary a report of the highly interesting discussion which took place at one of the forenoon meetings of the Scottish Agricultural Chemistry Association in Glasgow, on the subject of <a name="potato182"><mark>potato</mark></a> failures. This meeting had been announced for some time. Some very eminent agriculturists attended it; and nothing can better show the exceeding difficulty of the question looted, viz: ' What is the cause of the <a name="potato183"><mark>potato</mark></a> failures ?a? and is there a remedy for them' than the discrepancy of opinion advanced on the occasion." The general opinion of scientific agriculturists appears to be, that there is a liability inherent in every plant which has, for a long period, been cultivated in the same soil, to become deteriorated; hence the universal belief in the advantage of changing the seed ; and that, in the case of the <a name="potato184"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the most likely means of avoiding failure would be to procure a new generation of plants from seed (not tubes) of a healthy crop. But, in the discussion to which we are referring, Mr. Bird woods experience gave the death blow to this cherished opinion: the needlings were found to be as liable to decay as any others Plant your <a name="potatoes306"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> whole, and use only such seed as have the eye plump; protect from frost, and (says theory) you will have no failures. Not so fast, says Mr. Our net, of Had girth; I have done all this, and still have experienced failures or. Alexander, of South bar, had never witnessed a failure in early planted <a name="potatoes307"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Now many, within a few miles of Dublin, would give a great deal to be able to say the same truly. Why, early planted <a name="potatoes308"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, with us, are the most liable to failure; and as to this gentleman s other statement, that the failure of <a name="potatoes309"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is traceable to some ill treatment, especially by st owing them in large masses did it not occur to him that, up to 1832, no failures were caused by such treatment ?a" Mr. Allison, of Years, stated that <a name="potatoes310"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> taken for seed from those which, for two seasons, had not been cut, would not fail. It is, we fear, mere assertion. Whole <a name="potatoes311"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, although not so liable to failure, we believe, as cut ones, still, it is notorious, do fail." Mr. Anderson, from the north of I re land, as appears from his statement, has been most successful in his efforts to avoid failures; and the 227 [a[ 75 ]means he adopts (viz: living the ground, planting only in drained land, pulverizing the soil well, and not leaving either the manure or seed exposed to the effects of the sun and wind) are based on sound practical knowledge. His experience, however, that <a name="potatoes312"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have been prevented from blossoming are not less liable to fail, does not accord with that of others. The successful practice of Mr. Need, as mentioned at the meeting by air Robert Rates on, of digging <a name="potatoes313"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> intended for seed before they are quite ripe, and leaving them on the ground to be dried in the sun, although Professor Johnston declared that he had never heard of it, is known and practised successfully by almost every gardener with his as heaved kidneys intended for forcing." And as to Mr. Flemings experience, that the cup <a name="potato185"><mark>potato</mark></a> does not fail, we can only say that such is not the experience of the farmers of this country his discussion was, in fact, an epi to me of the innumerable essays which for the last twelve years have appeared on the subject of the <a name="potato186"><mark>potato</mark></a> failure, and which may be resolved into this that we are utterly ignorant of the cause of the failures; and that our only chance of avoiding them is to use mountain grown (which often means un ripened) seed, which has been preserved from heating in narrow pits; to plant in a dry, deep s6ilusingmoist manure, and not permitting the seed to lie exposed, even for a few minutes, to the p arching influences of sun or harsh windDDiblinFarmers' Gazette planted between one and two acres mostly on new land, with very little manure ; hold them once, and got about 250 bushels to the acre. The rot, so much complained of in other places, has affected some, but not very badly; perhaps I should have thought but triflingly of it, had it not been so universally spoken of elsewhere. I think I have seen the like before, or something similar to it. It is what I should call the dry rot. I have examined some of the injured ones, and can find nothing that appears very singular or unaccountable in or about them. A similar rot occurred in my crop of 1838, (I think it was) they were pink eyes I then raised, which were injured. The long reds, to my knowledge, were never so affected. The most of those examined now in a. partial state of decay are found, where the least speck of rot has begun on the outside, with the stem and heart also affected in about the same ratio. Those deepest in the hill are generally affected the most. My crop the present season is as meal y and delicious as any I ever used. Among the several varieties raised by many this year, there appears considerable difference as to their liability to that disease if so it may be called. The long reds, or A Flat as, are not touched ; while the buck eyes, (a new kind with me) the whites, pink eyes, and I wish apples, are more or less affected." As to the cause of the rot, we hazard no conjectures. Were it not for the many c agitations of others upon this point, we should be likely to think it owing to some peculiarity in the season. It may be so still; time may tell. The present has generally proved a good season for <a name="potatoes314"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. If the rot should come on again the next year, and the next after that, we shall be likely to think more seriously of it. Met us wait and seems' to the poisonous effects of this rot, we have no faith in it, further than we believe all delayed vegetables un wholesome for man or beast. Respectfully, "B.

Massachusetts Slough man, November 16, 1844.tDisease of the <a name="potato187"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops good deal of apprehension is manifested by farmers in this region, as well as elsewhere, in consequence of the appearance of the rot, or disease, among <a name="potatoes315"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The evil does not appear to be very general, as yet, in western New Work; but it has appeared so suddenly in so many places, and is so virulent in its nature, that it naturally excites many fears for another year. It is, indeed, a serious matter to the farmers of this country ; and it becomes every one to try to ascertain, if possible, the cause, and means of prevention, of the malady. Any theories and speculations on the subject are afloat, both in this country and in Europe; but we have seen none, as yet, that, in our mind, seem in accordance with reason, or confirmed by experiments. We will allude to some of these next month; in the mean time, we shall be glad to receive communications on the subject from any persons who have made observations in regard to it Some things, however, appear to be certain, and may be of immediate advantage to our readers: " 1st. The disease is not confined to any particular kind of soil or locality. Some have informed us that it appeared only in dry soil, and others in moist 2d.

The disease spreads more rapidly among the <a name="potatoes318"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, after being dug and placed in a heap, than while in the ground; consequently, if it is thought they are affected, it is better to delay digging till late in the fall. Mr. Hudson, of Hayne county, informs us that a neighbor of his, perceiving that his <a name="potatoes319"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> appeared very ripe, dug them, and placed them in aloft of a mill for a few days to dry. In passing near the window one night, he noticed what he thought to be a light in the room where the <a name="potatoes320"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were stored; and, on going in, he was astonished to perceive the whole heap covered with phosphorus cent light, and emitting the odor peculiar to rotten <a name="potatoes321"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It was soon evident that the disease had spread through the whole heap, although, when dug, very few rotten ones were discovered, and they were thrown out." 5th. The presence of the evil may generally be detected in the field by the rapid and premature decaying of the tops, and the smell of rotten <a name="potatoes322"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> perceptible on walking over the ground. In digging, the affected roots have somewhat the appearance of having been frozen and thawed, though they are not commonly so soft. Sometimes the decay is in spots, and partially covered with a small white fungus or mould New Geneseefarmer, October, 1844. For the Boston Cultivator. Not in polatoesMessrs. Editors: Last year (1843) I found, when 1 began to dig and get in my <a name="potatoes323"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, there was a considerable number rotten, and a great many painted, which I took great care to have picked 29 [a[ 75 out, as all my neighbors were complaining of their <a name="potatoes324"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being in the same, situation, and I had them put in the cellar. But, about the middle of December, my family complained of the bad smell in the cellar; upon which I examined, and found the <a name="potatoes325"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a bad condition; and I took them out of the bin, and picked them over again; and, when returning them into the bin, in every layer I put about half a peck of soaked lime, and mixed it well through them; and so on till all was in; which I do believe stopped the rot and bad smell, as there were but very few found affected afterwards. This spring, when I began to plant my <a name="potatoes326"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I took about a table spoonfuls of; soaked lime and put it into each hill; and when they were up, and before they were hold, I made a mixture of 8 bushels of reached ashes, 2 bushels of lime, and 3 bushels of ground plaster, and stirred them well together. I made a scoop that held about one will, and I put this full of the mixture on each hill, close to the s talks; and I found, when I began to use them in the summer, that they were all sound, and continued so and I had not one rotten <a name="potato188"><mark>potato</mark></a> when I took them up in October, although my neighbors on both sides of the farm had scarce any sound ones to get in.

Until within about[ 75 ]a] 230 two years, my <a name="potatoes333"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were good. Last year I had two fields of them. In one there was scarcely a defective <a name="potato191"><mark>potato</mark></a> to be found; on the other, one-fourth were diseased. The <a name="potatoes334"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on elevated ground, two or three years in cultivation since clearing, were sound; the others, on land seventeen years, to my knowledge, under cultivation, were bad. Dr. Peers had a variety of <a name="potatoes335"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which turned out far better than others a pale and smooth <a name="potato192"><mark>potato</mark></a>, four inches long. In Wisconsin, the <a name="potatoes336"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are well grown, and a great crop. For this disease, I think a variety of causes may be assigned. Atmospheric influence is probably one, affecting the <a name="potato193"><mark>potato</mark></a> like rust in wheat. The evil begins at the top of the <a name="potato194"><mark>potato</mark></a> stalk and wherever the stalk is defective, there also is the <a name="potato195"><mark>potato</mark></a> more or less defective. In my <a name="potatoes337"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, some were sound outside and bad within; in others, the surfaces were affected. The disease may proceed from r some chemical action in the atmosphere, or from peculiar location, as high or low, new or old land; but I wish to impress it upon the institute, that some varieties are more affected than others. Mr. Mei He. The New England Farmer speaks of 1832 as a year in which the disease of the <a name="potato196"><mark>potato</mark></a> was noticed.

Smi Of E, of Schenectady county, New Work. I found this <a name="potato197"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease very bad two years ago. My <a name="potatoes339"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, planted very early, for new <a name="potatoes340"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, were good this year. Last season, my <a name="potatoes341"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being planted late, (25th June) corn having failed, grew very rank, and were affected by the diseaseMARCUS J. Blakesley, of Sole ville, Room e county, New Work. The <a name="potatoes342"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were affected differently, in different sections of the country. The rot commenced last season, when the disease was like rust in wheat. Upon pressing the stalk, water burst from the sap vessels, and the bark would separate from the stalk. This season, the disease was like matter in a sore. Upon pressing the stalk, a substance like matter was forced out of it; the bark separated; there was mould at the eye. There appears to be a deficiency of starch; the wood y fibre is sound. Last season, the <a name="potatoes343"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> dug early 'generally proved good. Those last dug were affected. This season, those first dug proved good. I did not remain to see the last dug. My uncle tried the following experiment with his <a name="potatoes344"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>: Relied two rows, a shed two rows, and put gypsy sum (plaster) on two rows in the old way. In these experiments, fresh stable manure was used, together with the articles named. He found those treated in the old way the best; those limed the worst. Sole ville land is much of it hard pan clay. The upland hard pan s ward is better for <a name="potatoes345"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> than the loam of the valleys. Some of our farmers deem it as necessary to have sound and healthy <a name="potatoes346"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for planting as they do sound and healthy animals for breeding, Our best <a name="potatoes347"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are flesh colored. Our pink eyes and Mergers are the worst. Some of the flesh colored failed. Presi     Dent. Were any of yours imported or. Blakesley. One that I know of. The seed <a name="potatoes348"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were from the neighborhood. Mr. Of  Nor, of New Work, stated that Mr. James May, of West chester, had informed him that his <a name="potatoes349"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, raised with farm yard manure this season, were diseased, so that he threw away 20 per cent. of them; that on land where he had used concentrated manure he had good <a name="potatoes350"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 231 [a[ 75 ]or. Butler. I S the concentrated manure of which you speak so ruble, or is it insoluble in water or. Of  Nor. It was the poudrette; a part of it is so ruble. When properly prepared, the greater part of it is insoluble in water. Mr. Blydenburgh. There is a difference in the <a name="potato198"><mark>potato</mark></a>, as to liability to this disease. The Mergers were diseased last year. I was afraid to plant them this year. I went to my neighbors, and obtained some good ones also, some from the State of Paine. The red ones turned out almost all good, while the Mergers were one third diseased. Presi     Dent. Had you any foreign <a name="potatoes351"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in your vicinity or. Blydenburgh. One that I know of. Colonel Clark. I believe that this disease originates from the attack of insects or animnalcule, which prey on the leaves; thus injuring the respiratory organs of the plant, and depriving it of the elemental food which is absolutely necessary to the formation of the starch in the <a name="potato199"><mark>potato</mark></a>; the pulp portion, deprived thus of its due proportion of starch, becomes perish able, and decays. To melons and pump king, when their leaves are destroyed, dwindled and perish. From similar causes, the tubes of the <a name="potato200"><mark>potato</mark></a> suffer for want of a proper supply and assimilation of their food. Mr. Holmes. I am intimate with Mr. James May; I know his farm it has a cold soil; poudrette brought the crop two or three weeks earlier than usual. Colonel Clark. As to poudrette, the effect of it is vigorous vegetation. I examined the wheat field of Mr. Down send, near Astoria, this season the growth was great; the yield 35 bushels per acre, weighing 60 pounds to the bushel. It was attacked by the fly; but it appeared that its growth exceeded the injurious power of the enemy, who was found in the outer sheath, not having power to penetrate the grain. The field was also remarkably free from all weeds, and was one of the most beautiful crops I ever saw. Mr. Browne. I offer an opinion that this <a name="potato201"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease is an imported one. It had existed some eight or ten years in Great Britain. When there was a scarcity of <a name="potatoes352"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> here, two or three years since, we imported large quantities from thence; the disease, before that time, was unknown there. Mr. Teschemacher, of Boston, tried, by microscopic examination, to find out the cause. He discovered in the <a name="potato202"><mark>potato</mark></a> a growth of fungus, which isa plant analogous to the mushroom family. It is also seen as a blue or green mould in most places; it is often seen in apple cores, and in the interior of nuts. These hung i <a name="seeds27"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are invisible to the naked eye; they are readily carried about by winds, and will penetrate wherever air will. Being once introduced from Europe, their extensive dissemination here is very easy. These <a name="seeds28"><mark>seeds</mark></a> falling on the <a name="potato203"><mark>potato</mark></a>, in favorable circumstances as to moisture, &c, cause the disease. Mr. Teschemacher suggests the application of common salt to the soil; perhaps other chemical salts may answer the same purpose. The dry rot in timber is an analogous disease. Salt, chlorides, metallic oxides, &c, injected into the pores of timber, (kyanizing) prevent the dry rot; and, in certain soils, these salts might prevent the disease of the <a name="potato204"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Dr. C. T. Jackson, of Boston, one of the ablest chemists in the country, is now engaged in examining this subject. His fungus, of course, terminates only in circumstances favorable to its growth. He all know the tendency of old lands to produce fungus[ 5 1 232 or. Cooper, of New Jersey, selected those tubes which had the plump est, fairest eyes, with success; and continued the same seed upon the same farm for forty years, without deter i oration. The insect theory is not newtherebing no insects preying on the <a name="potato205"><mark>potato</mark></a> that has not existed for many years, I do not think there is any thing in that In some parts of the country where hay was scarce, the <a name="potato206"><mark>potato</mark></a> tops were cut at the time of their flowering for feed to cattle, and the tubes were afterwards found just as good arid n a bunidanit as if the tops had riot been taken off. Colonel Clark. That must have been in the infancy of their growth. When the insect seizes the tops, the tubes are deficient in starch. Mr. Holmes. One single remark: In October last, I went to a boat to select my <a name="potatoes353"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. There was a variety on board pink eyes, Chenangos, and others, I selected mine; some of them I found to be a little defective. There were some Garters among them; (the Garter <a name="potatoes354"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were shown they were sound. Or. . I s not the father of that <a name="potato207"><mark>potato</mark></a> present or. Carter. Some time back, I made a report to the club on the culture of that <a name="potato208"><mark>potato</mark></a>, recommending that they be planted near the surface, so that water cannot stand til on there. Any have followed that recommendation. <a name="potatoes355"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> so managed have remained good this season, as far as I can learn i <a name="potato209"><mark>potato</mark></a> will not bear remaining very wet. Mr. Loss presented <a name="potatoes356"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and explained the disease by showing that those planted having been checked by drought, and afterwards started bycopioutsrains, sent out tubes which deprived the <a name="potato210"><mark>potato</mark></a> of its starch; thus raising disease in it. The new tubes form themselves from the substancedfihi old oe si, without new tops of fibrous roots being produced. The diseased <a name="potatoes357"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had been planted between the 1st of June and middle ofJUily. Those planted before and after were good. Presi     Dent. I rise to make a few remarks on this subject. This discussioncid127imr help us all for the next years <a name="potato211"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. Suggestions awaken others. By contrasting opinions and facts, deductions of value may be obtained, In our farm, last year, we tried <a name="potatoes358"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> where lime had been put the fear be fore, at the rate of 60 bushels to the are; it was on a part of or garden, which was also well manured at that time. Another trial was made on a field which had been well manured; sheep had run upon it. Both the field and garden are old, high, loam y land. To lime was put on the did. The <a name="potatoes359"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the garden were planted in April, and dug up in August; they were perfect. In the sheep field the <a name="potatoes360"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted in the last of May or beginning of June, and we hardly had our seed <a name="potatoes361"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> restored to us. I am inquiring for results. One says the <a name="potatoes362"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are less affected on new than on old land. Our business is to find the cause and the remedy. Time has been mentioned as tried, and of no avail. With us, it appeared to produce good results. We must go back to first causes. The wisdom of Providence ordains a special adaptation of soils. Rotation of crops is necessary to save our lands from exhaustion. All old soil was once virgin. The :science of botany tells us that plants run out their races. Our <a name="potato212"><mark>potato</mark></a> is over three hundred years in cultivation. I s it showing signs of exhaustion ?a? I to essential ingredient is starch. One gentleman said thattheistarch was defective. What is the cause of that? It has been suggested to me, that some form of copper was needed. Sulphate of copper is said to be a preventive of rust in grain. This disease is compared to rust 233 [a[ 75 ]cannot the science of chemistry throw some light upon the subject ?a? .n all this discussion, I see a brilliant proof of our want of an agricultural school, to which such questions of immense magnitude should berbeferrb do. 93 For the New England Farmer. The Of  Sease I N <a name="potatoes363"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Mr. I Breck: Mr. James Grown having kindly brought me some of the <a name="potatoes364"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> infected with the disease which has this year committed such ravages on this vegetable, I proceeded at once to investigate the subject. The peculiar smell and the reputed poisonous qualities of this diseased <a name="potato213"><mark>potato</mark></a> made me nearly certain that it was a species of funds a .position which think has been confirmed by my examination with th e microscope. The appearances which I examined were st. A nearly black dip pop ration of the <a name="potato214"><mark>potato</mark></a>, just below the skin, penetrating one-sixteenth to one quarter of an inch into the substance, and apparently through the skin, in little black invented tu me factions, like pustules. It i probable that in these h les ,the vegetation of the fungus first begins, :and, spreads underneath. d. In the surface of the skin, where these pustules were enlarge there had produced a grayish slim y substance, of a very: offensive sm1lLThe black mass, divided, in a drop of distilled water, exhibited under the microscope a number of long, oval, and very irregular That pe dark bodies 6 interspersed among the cells of the <a name="potato215"><mark>potato</mark></a>, Any of these cells appeared lacerated; but this might partly have been proud ed by the mnechapicaaction of d dividing, although I think not age the r. The grayish slim y mass was semi transparent and indistinct, even when mixed with the distilled water, and exposed to the strongest light I could third w on it. In order to discover a remedy for this disease, I decided on applying various substances to this fungus, with a view of effecting its decomposition, and. examining their action under the microscope. The first application was salt ; and the action of this was so instantaneous ad decided, that did not proceed to any other. A portion of the dark substance was placed on a piece of glass on the microscope stand, in a drop of distilled water, and then thoroughly examined. A little salt, on the fine point of a pen knife, was then added. Nearly instantaneous change took place. The dark colored masses separated; much of them seemed to pass away; and, instead, there appeared numerous dark, slate colored globular bodies, which I easily rec0pgised as the spores, or reproducing bodies of the fungus. With the grayslimyspbstance, the effect was still more striking. All the indistinct I i me disappeared, the mass became clear and transparent, and left nothing but this e innumerable dark g lobules floating about in the drop of water. It seemed to me, then, that the salt destroyed all the vegetation ,of the fungus leaving nothing but the reproducing spores, which are probably _indestructible by salt. The spores of hung i are the bodies by which they are reproduced and spread, and are analogous to the <a name="seeds29"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of other vegetables; and these spores are generated in such enormous quantities, that many hung i, like this on the <a name="potato216"><mark>potato</mark></a>, spread with inconceivable rapidity; but[ 7 ]234 in order to ve get ate, they require certain favorable conditions and circumstances, which yet require investigation. These favorable conditions are, in my opinion, prevented by salt, as it destroys the fungus vegetation. Therefore, wherever the disease existed this year, 1 recommended a liberal supply of salt to be spread on the soil, and trust it will eradicate the evil. It is, at all events, a remedy which cannot do much injury, if it does not succeed. During the examination of the black substance, I of course recognised the grains of starch, which appeared sound ; but, wishing to know whether the fungus had affected them, I added a little iodine; the grains immediately took the usual purple color, and, I think, were not at all injured; indeed, it appears to me that the injury takes place by the rupturing of the cellular parts of the <a name="potato217"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I am aware that it requires some practice to judge well of the appearance under the microscope; but I repeated these examinations six or seven times, and always with the same results; still, I should be glad to have them repeated by others, whether their correctness be confirmed or not. Mynmicroscope, being made by myself, is, of course, very inferior to those now manufactured in London and Paris; and it would be very desirable that some of our scientific societies should import one of these, the cost of which is too high for persons of moderate income. It might be made accessible, under certain conditions, to those desirous of undertaking such investigations as these; for there are many cases where the action of various substances on the causes of animal and vegetable disease is examined to very great advantage under the microscope, and effects seen which cannot be observed in any other way. Should any gentleman possessed of one of these superior instruments be desirous of examining this disease, I would request of him to look at the action of sulphate of iron, sulphate of soda, or of ammonia, or any other substance which can be cheaply applied to the soil as a preventive; and to give notice of his observations, either in your or some other agricultural periodical; for I see with delight any thing that can bring nearer to each other science and agriculture. Hours, J. E. Teschemacher. Boston, October, 1844. No. 94THE Of  Sease I N The <a name="potato218"><mark>Potato</mark></a>. From the New England Farmer. Mr. Breck: I am glad to see in your paper of the 2d the numerous communications stating facts and suggesting causes of the disease in the <a name="potato219"><mark>potato</mark></a>. A more dreadful calamity can hardly be conceived, than the destruction of a crop essential to the existence of thousands. In a subject of such general interest, any one may claim a hearing, and to be heard with attention. The remote causes of the disease are most difficult to ascertain, and, after all, must be mainly left to conjecture. But, for this, every fact in each man experience is important. I do not find a single supposition of your correspondents that is in any degree confirmed by my experience. My ground (less than an acre) was never ploughed since creation until this year; it is not, therefore, in the 235 [a[ 75 ]common meaning of the word with farmers, "old" it has not suffered from drought or too much wet; it has been manured as I have manured for the same crop these thirty years, and planted with the same variety of seed that I used thirty years ago the " old fashioned blue" and "long red" except the <a name="chenango2"><mark>Chenango</mark></a>, a much later variety ; and this last is the only one that I can ascertain is diseased. The vines were strong, and the <a name="seeds30"><mark>seeds</mark></a> abundant. The disease is hardly discernible, in many cases, until after the <a name="potato220"><mark>potato</mark></a> is cooked, when it shows itself in black blotches, like a rooted fungus, extending considerably below the surface, readily separating from the <a name="potato221"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which appears as if it had been frozen, and is more or less dis colored. I n some hills I have found much of the fruit quite rotten, and very offensive to the smell; whilst, in some cases, the same tube r was partially delayed, and the remainder apparently sound The only circumstance at all unusual in my planting or culture this year, is the fact that my <a name="chenango3"><mark>Chenango</mark></a> seed was partially frozen too much so to be fit for the table; and, in consequence of the great severity of last winter, this was doubtless the case in a thousand other instances. May not this diseased seed be the cause of the diseased progeny? A great proportion of the diseases of animals and vegetables, it is well known, are transmitted. I s not this disease of the <a name="potato222"><mark>potato</mark></a> only another instance ?it kin, in his little work on this disease, favors the idea here suggested, as does also a writer in the High land Agricultural Society S Transactions. It is noticed by these writers as having existed in Europe as far back as 1815, and as having been particularly destructive in Scotland in 1835. Complete renovation, It kin says, is only attain able by raising new varieties from the seedWATERTOWN, Massachusetts, October 5, 1844. No. 95 To the editor of the New England Farmer. The Of  Sease I N <a name="potatoes365"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Not having seen any communication objecting to the views I have taken $ of the cause of the disease of the <a name="potato223"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and which subsequent examinations have only tended to confirm in my own mind, I resumed the investigation of the subject. The results I now offer to you for publication. I have first to notice the idea that this disease arises from worms which are found in the delayed <a name="potato224"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and remark 1st. That the worms are the same which are found in all rotten <a name="potatoes366"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, from whatever cause the decay may arise 2d. The <a name="potato225"><mark>potato</mark></a> decays previous to the worms appearing; for the worms are never found in the sound part of the <a name="potato226"><mark>potato</mark></a>, eating their way in or depositing their eggs. For have I ever seen the worms in that part of the <a name="potato227"><mark>potato</mark></a> in which the fungus has already commenced ve getting; it is only in the most rotten part that the worms exist, after the fungus has caused this decay 3d. Salt instantly kills the worms, as any one may satisfy himself with the assistance of the common compound microscope. Under the full impression of the existence of the fungus in the <a name="potato228"><mark>potato</mark></a>, two questions present themselves[ 75 ]236 1st. I s the fungus the cause of the decay, or merely a growth on the tube, already diseased from some other cause ?a? And 2d. When, and in what part of the plant, the disease originates; and how is it propagated and disseminated ?the probability is, that the fungus is the cause of the disease; for the fungus appears on the skin of the <a name="potato229"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and can be traced by its gradually dark color penetrating from the outside, by degrees, into the sound inside ;the outside fungus developing itself first, and producing slime and rotten ness, while the inside yet remains firm and sound. If the fungus resulted from the <a name="potato230"><mark>potato</mark></a> first becoming rotten, and thus forming favorable circumstances for its vegetation, then the presumption is that we should occasionally (although perhaps rarely) find parts of the <a name="potato231"><mark>potato</mark></a> rotten without the fungus ; which I, at least have never yet seen. I have often seen heaps of rotten <a name="potatoes367"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, without ever before observing this peculiar fungus, which on account of its smell, cannot be mistaken. If this was, therefore, a disease merely affecting the rotten <a name="potato232"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and not the sound one, it would have been long a g, and much more often, observed. Dr. All roth, an excellent German botanist, who appears to have closely studied the fungus family, observes in the Linnaea, (a botany cal periodical published in Germany) vol. 16, for 1842, that he has ascertained the disease called there the <a name="potato233"><mark>potato</mark></a> scab or wart a kind of swelling or tumor, ending in rotten ness to be a species of subterranean fungus, which he calls erysibe subterranean, of which he gives a long scientific description. I am not sufficiently versed in this subject to decide whether this description agrees exactly with the disease at present under discussion, but it appears to me to differ in several particulars. The second question, as to the origin and propagation of this fungus, is one which presents great difficulties in its solution. These arise partly from the knowledge of the propagation of the fungus family being yet in its infancy, and partly from the want of means of pursuing the study of this microscopic subject properly. From the almost universal accounts of the tops of the plants having first died down, and thus indicated the disease, it has suggested itself to me, even if this fungus is really a subterranean species, whether it has not been propagated and disseminated by spores floating in the atmosphere, and attaching themselves to the stalk of the <a name="potato234"><mark>potato</mark></a> ; or that ve getting and extending themselves downwards until they reach the point of junction with the tube r, there producing decay and the death of the upper part of the vegetable, and afterwards disseminatingthemselves through the tube r. A parallel to this, probably, exists in the mushroom a fungus which is naturally produced from horse droppings, when, by being kept dry for a considerable time, they have arrived at a favorable state for the development of the spores. These spores have probably attached themselves to the sterns of the hay which has been eaten by the horse, have passed through its stomach, and remained in an inert state until favorable circumstances have produced their development in the droppings. I regret that I had not commenced this investigation early enough to have examined the stalk, and its junction with the tube r, with the microscope, on the first appearance of its drooping; as all the proof now to be expected from experiments can only be of a negative character. However, here are such results as I have obtained 1st. One of these much diseased <a name="potatoes368"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was cut in halves; each half was placed on half a sound <a name="potato235"><mark>potato</mark></a>, in perfect contact, placed under a bell 237 [a[ 75 glass, in a damp dark atmosphere, temperature 57 to 62. In five days the sound <a name="potato236"><mark>potato</mark></a> was not in the slightest degree contaminated" with th t fungus or the worms 2d. A while diseased <a name="potato237"><mark>potato</mark></a>, covered with black spots, was placed under a glass in the same circumstances as experiment No. 1, in contact with awholesoun d <a name="potato238"><mark>potato</mark></a>; the fifth day the sound <a name="potato239"><mark>potato</mark></a> remained un contaminated and without worms 3d. A whole and much diseased <a name="potato240"><mark>potato</mark></a> was buried two inches below the soil, which was damp, but not wet. A sound <a name="potato241"><mark>potato</mark></a> was buried in the same soil, two and a half inches distant from it; the temperature kept as before 57 to 62. In five days, this latter remained quite sound t is possible that five days is not long enough; I have therefore left them all in the same, state, and shall not touch them for three or four weeks. Should any change take place, I will inform you. As 1 do not seek to establish any favorite theory, I trust my remarks may in cite to observation, and provoke discussion; and provided the practical and useful truth on this subject be discovered, I do not care much whether it be by myself or by others. J. E. Teschemacher. No. 96THE <a name="potato242"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Plague. From the Cultivator. The disease which largely affected the <a name="potato243"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in Europe aid America during the last two or three years, (though in this country chiefly during the last season) is exciting anxious inquiry among the community, and close observation among scientific men. Mr. Teschemacher, of Boston, has published the result of his observations; and we now add the opinion of another gentleman of New England, Professor Charles T. Jackson, who left the following hasty note, in reply to inquiries made while he was passing through this citySALBANY, September 23, 1844." Dear Of    R: While passing through the western part of New Work, my attention was called to a peculiar disease which affects the <a name="potato244"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant and, having heard something about it in Michigan and Wisconsin, I was anxious to examine the first <a name="potato245"><mark>potato</mark></a> field where the disease could be witnessed. This I had an opportunity of doing in or near the village of Trenton, N. Y., where a very intelligent farmer exhibited to us the ravages which had been effected by it in his fields. The disease was first indicated by numerous small drops of honey dew on the stems of the <a name="potato246"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant about a month ago. When followed a rust, with death of the stems; and the disease was found to extend along the bark to the <a name="potato247"><mark>potato</mark></a> tube r, which is asubterraneous stem, and not a root, as some have supposed. I observed that the <a name="potato248"><mark>potato</mark></a> began to rot next to the skin, and the disease penetrated inward, in many cases, to the depth of half an inch. To fruit or <a name="potato249"><mark>potato</mark></a> balls formed on any of the diseased plants. The plants looked parched and blackened, as if they had been killed by frost." I learned that where lime had been used in the preparation of about atablespoonful to a hill, there no disease has appeared; also, that after the vines had become affected, the best remedy was to cut the stems off close 75 ]a] 238 to the ground. The good farmer in Trenton said that his crop had suffered very severely; and that where he had formerly raised average crops of 300 bushels to the acre, he shall this year raise but 50 bushels. The German population, who depend on digging <a name="potatoes369"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on shares, will severely suffer this season. I would invite you, sir, to inquire into the origin of honey dew. I find various theories offered, but none of them satisfactory. I have heard the disease of the <a name="potato250"><mark>potato</mark></a> ascribed to the age of the plant reproduced continually from tubes; but this cannot be the fact, for no such distinction can be found in <a name="potatoes370"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of various ages and kinds. The yellow, red, pink eye, and <a name="chenango4"><mark>Chenango</mark></a>, have all equally suffered this year. To peculiarities of soils or of manures appear to afford any explanation; for the plant appears to have been affected in one as much as another 4 The <a name="potato251"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops in Wisconsin, as I learn from a farmer just from there, have suffered severely; as have those of I illinois and Michigan. T. Jacksondisease in <a name="potatoes371"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> he see, by the New England Farmer, that Or, Teschemacher continues his experiments with a view to ascertain the cause of the <a name="potato252"><mark>potato</mark></a> malady. We have before stated that he has discovered a fungus attached to the <a name="potato253"><mark>potato</mark></a>; he is now of the opinion that the fungus is the cause of the disease. His reasons for the opinion are, " that the fungus appears on the skin of the <a name="potato254"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and can be traced by its dark color, penetrating from the outside, by degrees, into the sound inside the outside fungus developing itself first, and producing slime and rotten ness, while the inside yet remains firm and sound. If the fungus results from the <a name="potatoes372"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> first becoming rotten, and thus forming favorable circumstances for its vegetation, then the presumption is, that we should sometimes (though, perhaps, rarely) find parts of the <a name="potato255"><mark>potato</mark></a> rotten without the fungus; which I, at least, have not seen." Mr. T. observes that he has often seen heaps of rotten <a name="potatoes373"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> without having noticed this peculiar fungus, which cannot be mistaken, on account of its peculiar smell. He thinks, if it were a disease merely affecting the rotten <a name="potatoes374"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, it would long ago have been observed. In regard to the propagation of the fungus, Mr. Teschemacher is induced to think, from the fact that the tops of the <a name="potatoes375"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have generally died down, and thus indicated the disease, that it has been propagated by the <a name="seeds31"><mark>seeds</mark></a> or spores floating in the atmosphere, and attaching themselves to the stalk of the <a name="potato256"><mark>potato</mark></a>; or that ve getting and extending downwards to the point of junction with the tube r, there producing decay and death of the upper part of the vegetable, and, afterwards, the decomposition of the tube r. In regard to the idea that insects have caused the defect in <a name="potatoes376"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, Mr. Teschemacher observes, first, that the worms which have been found in them are "the same which are found in all rotten <a name="potatoes377"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, from whatever cause the decay may arise; and, second, that the <a name="potato257"><mark>potato</mark></a> decays previous to the worm appearing, for the worms are never found in the sound part of the <a name="potato258"><mark>potato</mark></a>, eating their way in or depositing their eggs; and it is only in the most rotten part that the worms exist, after the fungus has caused thisdecayHoney dew he would call attention to the remarks of Dr. Jackson and Mr. Old, in this number, relative to the defect in <a name="potatoes378"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having been occasioned by "honey dew' The circumstance mentioned by Mr. Old, of the <a name="potatoes379"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> over which a carpet had been spread remaining green and healthy, while the remainder of the field was destroyed or much injured, is worthy of particular remark 239 [75 ]of Nchester, (CONN) November 6, 1844. Disease of the <a name="potato259"><mark>potato</mark></a> or. L. Pucker : Among the various speculations respecting the disease of the late <a name="potato260"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, I have recently heard a cause assigned, which appears to me more satisfactory than any I have seen in print. It seems that, on the night of the 15th of August last, there was a honey dew, (as it is called) a g luminous exhaustion with a sweet taste, which settled on the herb age and leaves of the trees throughout this region of country." A neighbor of mine informs me that a farmer of his acquaintance, in Hartford county, on the afternoon before the falling of this dew, removed a carpet which his family had spread out on his grass, and spread it on apart of an adjoining <a name="potato261"><mark>potato</mark></a> patch, where it remained through the following night and morning; and that, after the tops of the <a name="potatoes380"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the rest of the patch had entirely delayed, the tops which had been .covered by this carpet continued green until fall; and that while the rest of the crop almost wholly rotted, the part under the carpet gave a sound and abundant yield. Another neighbor informs me that, on the morning when the 'honey dew appeared, he heard a farmer say that it would kill the <a name="potatoes381"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> Now, this honey dew is a phenomenon of which I have never before heard; but to you, and most of your readers, it is probably familiar. I t seems, at all events, if it prevailed over the Eastern and Middle States at the time mentioned, to afford a rational and satisfactory solution of the much vexed question. A g luminous substance, covering the <a name="potato262"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops at the period of their most luxuriant vegetation, would stop the pores, and cause sudden death. The disease and death of the tops would cause the tubes to decay in the precise manner they have done Please give your views on the subject, and oblige yours, "JOHN Boydrespecting the nature and cause of honey dew, we believe neither philosophers nor agriculturists are entirely agreed. It has been said that this substance is the exudation of insects called a p hides, or plant lice. That the sweet substance which has been known to exude from these insects has been sometimes called "honey dew" is no doubt a fact; but that the honey dew is always derived from the insects, we cannot believe. Fields of rye, and other grain, are sometimes struck with the " honey dew" when no signs of insects can be discovered. Several theories have formerly prevailed on this subject. but, so far as we are acquainted, the most generally received one at the present time is, that a peculiar state of the atmosphere occasions the bursting of the sap vessels of the plant, by which the sap is exuded to the outside of the stalk and leaf. The sap, then, becoming acrid, together with the derangements in the functions of the plant, is supposed to occasion the blight or rust in grain. And hence the prevalent idea that the honey dew always produces blight. We are not prepared to touch for the correctness of the bursting of sap vessels, &c. Our own opinion is, that the matter is not yet fully understood ; and we would recommend continued investigation and observation, and have no doubt additional light will be obtained. The communication of Rev. Mr. Abbot, in a late number of the Newengland Farmer, seems to support the theory mentioned by Dr. Jackson and Mr. Old. Mr. Abbot thinks that the wet and the warm weather profit ]240ducedfanf overflow of sap. He found the s talks and leaves of roots were burst on, and a gum city substance oozed' out. He thinks a similar effect was prided on the <a name="potatoes382"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and that the disease which has affected them is similar to rust and' blight in grain. Since writing the abbe: we have met with the following explanation oftildeiw and honey dew; in -report of a lecture delivered by Mr. Key wood, before a farmers' club in England. The former he states to b i raised by the rapid evaporation of water from the leaves of plants after a wet spring, when the salts the water contained were left on the surface of such plants as were' already matured; while others, which were in a growing state, appropriated them to their uses; hence this effect on late Swedes, and on early nes. Money dew was caused by an excess of carbon in the plant, which could only occur in dry weather, when the other ingredients could not be furnished for it to combine with. No. 97 For the Farmer and Mechanics. Of Essay Of Honey Dew. From the .inaleetic Magazine, Philadelphia; 1815; vol. 5, page 54.. Mr. Fleet: Finding that a writer in the Cultivator refers the disease of the <a name="potato263"><mark>potato</mark></a> to the action of honey dew, I have been prompted to send you the following extractSMy: design in this essay is to give a brief statement of certain facts relative to the appearance of the honey dew in Carolina, which appear tom imitate against the received theories of its formation; together with a concise view of the opinions of ancient and modern writers with regard to this peculiar substance." The production of honey dew is influenced by the sea so f the a year, evidently by the state of the atmosphere. Of     n Carolina, it most" frequently appears in the months of May or June, during a long absence of rain i, and after a succession of warm days alternating with cool nights." Early in the morning it is found on the leaves of plants, grapes &c of the consistence of diluted honey, transparent, and resembling in taste the sir up of refined sugar; the Viscidity of it increases with the heat of the sun; and about ten or eleven o clock it ceases to be fluid, giving to theleadecid127ia shining and glossy appearance. Situations also appear to influence the production of the honey dew. I ti ave observed it in the greatest abundance near the margins of stagnant marshes, ponds, and savannahs. In the district of Marion, South Carolina, is a morals extending fifteen or sixteen miles in length, and one or' two in breath; it contain is no trees of o nsidelrable magnitude, except the iypfissiad a few perennial shrubs, but a bounds with annual succulent aqiiaticplants and grapes. Dear the edge of this morals, during the seas or and state of the atmosphere alluded to, the honey dew is produced in such quantities as to moist en every shrub, and to cover the grass Horses, which feed at large in the vicinity of the morals, may be fond t 24 [a[ 75 ]at eight or nine o clock in the morning with their manes and tails agglutinated to a mass with this substance. The particles of pine leaves and grapes carbonated by the fires which sometimes ravage extensive tracts of country in March and April, are frequently observed cemented with large masses, and in situations where, apparently, the honey dew could not have dropped from overshadowing trees. Warm S of bees inhabit almost every excavated tree; arid from their honey, the poor inhabitants of this sterile region derive no inconsiderable support were follow some later quotations, from " Line" and others. Sfenega, in his History of California, says that Father Piecola observes that in the months of April, May, and June, there falls with the dew a kind of manna, which becomes inspissated on the leaves of trees. He adds, that he tasted it, and, though not so white as sugar, it had all the sweetness of it. The good father, according to the common opinion, speaks as if the manna dropped from the sky The writer in the Cultivator says : "the disease was first indicated by a few small drops of honey dew on the stems of the <a name="potato264"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant t will be noticed that honey dew a bounds in swamp y places. In these places, the so ruble mucous products of fermented organic matter also abound. In the absence of rain, are not these mucous products in a measurevaporized, and afterwards deposited as dew ?a? If so, are we to be surprised at meeting the same phenomena in cultivated fields during a season of drought, when for a series of years we have been in the habit of maturing the fields with similar so ruble mucous products? These products are contained in both fermented and un fermented barn yard or stable manures. You will notice that the honey dew has been seen upon "the pine leaves and grapes, carbonated by the fires." Therefore, in that instance, it could not have been produced by insects, neither could it have fallen from over spreading foliage. There could have been no "bursting of sap vessels, "since the leaves were dead. ,I t must, therefore, in that instance at least, have been a honey dew: in other words, organic matter va prized while it a mucous state, and deposited again as dew. I touch this point, since it appears like another attempt to prove poor Same Nature guilty of producing for us rotten <a name="potatoes383"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. When all the organic parts of the soil (excepting neutral salts) are brought into an insoluble state, and circumstances made favorable for their slow combustion, instead of their ferment at ion, we will then not be led to refer the disease of the <a name="potato265"><mark>potato</mark></a> to the presence of honey dew; and for this simple reason honey dew cannot appear under such circumstances. Respectfully, F. Morti Mer Butler. No. 98PELHAM Farm, Ulster County, December 18, 1844. Dear In Your letter, requesting to be informed more fill y respecting the rot in <a name="potatoes384"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> than is contained in the report made by Mr. A B. Alien, editor of the "agriculturists" (page 354,) of a conversation I had with him on the subject in- November, was duly received. In answer thereto, I would state, that I am fully convinced the decay throughout the country is caused mainly by insects; and I am led to this belief by the i foo wing experiments 1675] 242 n the year -1843 I planted a field of several acres in drills, harrowed the ground level, and top dressed it with 200 bushels of oystershell lime and charcoal dust to the acre. The yield was 432 bushels per acre: At the same time, the <a name="potatoes385"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> throughout the country were more or less delayed; likewise, a parcel of the same seed, planted contiguous to the above, not lined, was also delayed. This year (144) I planted the same seed in the following manner: The ground was thrown into drills, and manured heavily with barn yard manure. The <a name="potatoes386"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were cut into single eyes 14 days before required for planting, and covered with plaster. Aimed a few, for the sake of experiments specified. They were sprinkled with small white (almost imperceptible insects, and were, consequently, rejected, Those limed were free. I planted them in the drills on the manure, 9 inches apart; tops, centres, and ends, separately, to mark the difference in growth, which was not very great. The first three drills (300 feet in length) were covered with dry charcoal dust, No. 2. Three drills covered with oystershell lime. No. 3. To do bone dust. No. 4. To do poudrette. No. 5. To do unleashed ashes. No. 6. To do new mown grass and plaster. No. 7. To do fine salt. No. 8. To do delicate of potash. No. 9. To do gun no. Rid so on throughout the field, each alternate 3 drills with a different substance, except 6 drills, in which the same seed was planted without any composition except the barn yard manure; and adjoining them, 6 drills planted with superior French <a name="potatoes387"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, received three weeks before directly from Are. The furrows were then all reversed by the plough, and the <a name="potatoes388"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> covered; after which, a heavy stick was drawn by a pair of horses across the furrows, to level them.

Cultivationwhen ,they were 4 inches above ground, the earth was ploughed from them. After an interval of six days, it was ploughed to them again; the field, being in perfect, order, required no other attention during the season. In the 3d of October they were ploughed out, and proved to be perfectly sound, with the exception of the 12 drills of pink eyed kidneys and French <a name="potatoes390"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, without composition, which were entirely rotten. 600 bushels vere pitted immediately, and not examined before the 5th of December, when they were found to be perfectly sound. During the summer, I examined fields in But chess, Ulster, Albany, andSchenectady counties, and invariably foi up insects v with numerous legs, and in some instances a small worm, not unlike the apple worm in form, but red, and very minute, ensconI  red i thin the witheiaihg vine. The cone -243 [a[ 75tJcliusion I came t to was, that these insects fed upon the albumen requisite t of am the perfect tubes :and, consequently, when dry, it was either whollydecayedfrorn an excess having been abstracted, or, if apparently sound so much had been taken as to produce decay by degrees; thus, after being stored, a sort of f u legs appears upon the tubes, and the consequent decay is rapid. I leave you, sir, more learned in these matters, to decide whether the fungus is caused by insects or not. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servants L. Pell, Ll on. 11 To Ells Worltcid127. No. 99 Discussion in the New York Barn mrs' Club, November, 1844Polatoeso, wool, 4 c. Or. Partner. I notice that the disease is referred to the action of a fungus. I have examined diseased <a name="potatoes391"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; the disease seemingly originates in a fungus, the marks of which are peculiar. In examining an apparently sound <a name="potato266"><mark>potato</mark></a>, small elevations are to be seen near the eye. Gradually the skin opens, and a black fungus makes its appearance. Thenulmber of black fig i having this power of bursting the skin is very great; they are termed crypiogamoes. Their first appearance is like a black wart, which then begins to spread itself, making an ulcerated surface. The black character soon leaves the spore did succeeds; these latter are of a white ash color. The <a name="potatoes392"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> become spongy often soft and putrefying. This different termination I consider as the same disease, I n. Germany a distinction is made; the one state is called dry rot, the other wet rot. The origin of 0 his disease is a fungus; the remote origin issomlethling else. Certain conditions are requisite for the growth of the spores- of the fungus. An unhealthy state in the plant promotes their growth. Plants in a healthy growing state are rarely attacked by fungus; probably, therefore, some change takes place in <a name="potatoes393"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> before the fungus begins. Farmers are the most singular class in the world; they do not make observations, or apply to scientific men, when their crops are assailed by an enemy. The reason that we know nothing about the <a name="potato267"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease is, because the farmers let them rot before acquainting scientific men with the presence of the disease. But I will state that this disease is an old one, having been long known in Germany and England. One of the most fertile causes of this disease is the habit of using farm yard man  uses -in a state of fernentation. Hung i of all kinds (except two or three are continually produced from such manure. Should we -adopt a new mode of preparing far yard manures, this disease would pass away. I refer to their preparation byeremacausis, (slow combustion) Smut has no where been Been t along u the English seacoast, except where much farm yard manure has been used. I would recommend that some of our farmers next year prepare manure with lime and earth by that process, without feirmentiing it. I appeal to: M r. Butler, who has had much experience in the preparation of manures in the dry way, and is present. I ask whether he elias ever seen f union them ?or- Aller . Never, si r. ,or. Partner. Any, bad <a name="potatoes394"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are now pushed into market. To[ 75 ]a] 244 guard our citizens against them, I recommend that none e bought without careful examination especially such as are covered with mud or 'but wash several, and examine critically. If there are small swellings, (often not larger than a pins head) you may presume that they are the first symptoms. If you find the skin burst and thrown back, with a black spot appearing, you may be sure that disease is there. The dry rot often appears in a whitish surface. If the wet rot sets in, it is black and soft worms are to be found in the putrefying parts. Mr. Butler, I have been convinced that many of the diseases with Which we are afflicted soon after the eating of succulent vegetation, (as green corn) arise from the impure fluid substances taken up by plants from the earth. I determined to investigate the matter, and some years back tried the process of eremacausis in the manufacture of manure. Through this process, manures are brought to an insoluble state, but are still susceptible of further decomposition through eremacausis, or slow combustion, and consequently they become gradually converted into gases and water. Thus the plants are principally fed upon gases, in place of fluid organic matters. I found that both <a name="potatoes395"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and corn grow soft and unhealthy when manured with ordinary barn yard manure, but that they grow uniformly dry and meal y with lime prepared manure, or with manure manufactured by the process of eremacausis. The club will remember my previous communications on the preparation of manures after this process, when I call to mind dry rotted manures since such is the practical name by which this process has been presented to them. Dr. Partner. Any diseased <a name="potatoes396"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been brought from Germany, for seed, to the United States. Mr. Anderson has tried lime, broadcast; his crop is good. For. Butler. When lime is used upon land direct, some time should be allowed for its action upon the organic matters therein, before the crop be put in. I present a communication on the disease of the <a name="potato268"><mark>potato</mark></a>. [Referred to the publishing committee or. Wakemanai presented a communication from Or.  A. Cher ff. I t relates to the disease of <a name="potatoes397"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. [referred to the publication committee ]for. Garter. Barn yard manure that retains moisture is not good for <a name="potatoes398"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It should be well de composed. <a name="potatoes399"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> may be growing in the field and flourishing today, and become diseased to morrow, if wet weather set in. One diseased <a name="potato269"><mark>potato</mark></a> may, through its dampness, communicate decay to an entire heap. But, if the <a name="potatoes400"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> be mixed with mould, the disease will not communicate. I would recommend, in keeping <a name="potatoes401"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, that they be mixed with ashes, or with the dust of coal yards. Dr. Field. The disease has not affected my early crop. Similar '<a name="potatoes402"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted late have turned out almost a perfect failure. I think, therefore, that the failure is owing to the dry season. My late crop grew well until the dry weather came on. Mr. Bridgman thinks that the disease is owing to hot, dry seasons. In such seasons, the leaves cannot assimilate the food. The plant is thus brought into a diseased state, and the root is disposed to decay from a want of nourishment; even after the drought, rain does 00 good bit rather injury, by hastening decay. There are crops which ,ill not grow as ,well i in a wet season as corn; turmnipsin a hot season. The stimulating properties of manure hasten disease. We always observe a difference on the same field in the crop; some are more liable to rot than others. Early crops were good, owing to the variety; early varie24575 ]times filed, while late varieties were perfected, because the dry weather did of affect them. New lands are the safest, because they retain a proper condition of moisture. My <a name="potatoes403"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> upon wet lands are destroyed, owing to a want of under drainage. Time has been used upon all of my lands. The lime was drawn on my low land last fall. A com post of much and line was put upon my high land. Not manure has a tendency to hasten the decay of <a name="potatoes404"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Mr. Took. I recommend new seed. Last year I purchased black <a name="potatoes405"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, My <a name="potatoes406"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are sound. Farmers near me have rotten <a name="potatoes407"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Dr. Butler. Have I not been previously informed that you used mucktriet d with ashes upon this land ?or Took. Yes, sir, that is the manure I used. No. 910THE <a name="potato270"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. Communicated to the Farmers' Club, November 19, 1844, by F. Mortimer Butler. The <a name="potato271"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot being under discussion, permit me to offer a few remarks on the subject. We are informed, by Mr. Sign all and others, that new uplands give sound <a name="potatoes408"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. By new land, as explained, we understand virgin soil the mixture of vegetable mould and earth. With the character of such soil we are familiar ; it is loose and mellow. The vegetable mould, one of its main constituents, and to which it owes its mellow ness, is insoluble in water, strongly resists ferment at ion, but readily yields to slow combustion. From such facts we are enabled to read the result. The mould of the upland virgin soil favors the infiltration and evaporation of super abundant moisture the soil is soon brought into proper condition; slow combustion sets in, and through it the mould is gradually converted into gaseous bodies and the vapor of water. Thus, plants growing in virgin soil are fed mainly upon gases, water, and saline bodies; the crop proves healthy and firm. Exceptions are to be found in undulating places; where the soil is a rete native one, incident ferment at ion occurs, instead of slow combustion. Mr. Garter has presented to the club a system which, in his experience, and that of others, has, proved a successful one in the cultivation of the <a name="potato272"><mark>potato</mark></a>. This system provides the removal of super abundant water; and consequently favors the slow combustion of the organic matter previously contained in the land. Exceptions may occur ; but, by correcting in the first place the manures made use of, these exceptions will cease. Bring the manure to that crumbly state, wherein, like vegetable mould, it shall be insoluble, but susceptible of slow combustion. By Mr. Blakesley we are informed that lime in the hill has been tried upon old land, and the crop proved to be much rotted. In this instance, as I have been personally informed by -or. B., the lime was put immediately upon the seed <a name="potato273"><mark>potato</mark></a>. In the presence of caustic lime, plants will to certain degree be deprived of one of their main constituents oxygen. Had perfectly mild lime been used, the result would have been far different. By the president we are informed that lime, together with manure, had been spread .upon a garden the: previous year; the garden was then tilled, and ti his last season :plant id with <a name="potatoes409"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The crop proved good. By rate of lime combines, with so ruble vegetable and animal substances, 75 ]24 forming compounds, which, upon drying, or being, acted upon by atmospheric air, become insoluble in water. Gradually these compounds separate, the lime becomes a carbonate, and the organic n matter becomes mould, In the successful experiment of the president, it will be seen that the lime, under the circumstances in which it was placed, had ample time, before the <a name="potato274"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was put in, to convert the organic matter there present ii to mould, and for itself to become mild, by passing into a carbonate. Fellow ness of soil is thus produced. The effect upon the crop corresponds with that of nature in the virgin soil, as given by Mr. Sign all, and with the practice of Mr. Garter. The ultimate end is identical being the insoltiMbility of the organic matter, and its slow combustion. Mr. Minor presentspoudrette and sound <a name="potatoes410"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Of   i the manufacture of poudrette, the so ruble night soil is principally converted into an insoluble inodorous powder, similar in mechanical properties to n mould. I to so ruble portions are neutral salts ; these are stimulating, while the insoluble portions suffer slow combustion, and become food for the plants. There can be no doubt of the good effect of poudrette, provided thorough tillage, with drainage, as recommended by Mr. Garter, be first attended to. Fungus and insects have been offered as a cause. There is yet a remote cause favoring the growth of fir thus and life of insects. This remote cause is overcome by proper drainage, tillage, and change of character in the manure. It pleases me to realize that the mind of the farmer is about being awakened. Simple decay has too long been confounded with ferment at ion. For many years I have tried to call the attention of farmers to the difference in the nature of decompositions occurring in the forest and the swamp. To meet the mind of the farmer, I called the decomposition occurring in the forest, "dry rot ;" that taking place in the swamp, "ferment at ion." Professor Lie big has appeared in the field the decomposition occurring in the forest now stands as' decay" or" eremacausis." This latter term, compounded from the Greek, when translated into simple English, is " slow combustion." The action is the same as that to which I have referred as "dry rot." When our farmers realize the difference between slow combustion and ferment at ion, and follow the light embraced therein, we will not be troubled with diseased <a name="potatoes411"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. A Welsh paper says : We have not had so good a harvest for years. Our wheat this harvest reaches 64 pounds a bushel, which we believe is about the average weight in Essex and the best wheat growing counties in Englandno. 9110From the New York Farmer and Mechanics, <a name="potato275"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Only G. A. Scherpfcommunicated to the New York Farmers' Club, November 19, 1844, by H. Veins, Esq, secretary to the Farmers' Club. The circumstances occurring in agriculture are so varying, that it is often hard to come at the true causes of effects, which show themselves in very different ways and degrees. Met, through all the observations made yesterday at the club, and the experience related, one grand line could be followed, which points to the same cause to which the disease was ascribedinGermany, where it prevailed some six or seven years ago. This grand 247 cause is the use (or perhaps abuse) of animal manure not sufficientlydecomposeda proceeding which, in Germany, nobody would think of. There, the old practice was to plant <a name="potatoes412"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in ground which had been manured the year before, and first bore a crop of grain, or plants of the cabbage tribe, It is true, the quantity obtained is far less than here; but the quality is a different thing. From German publications that sometimes fall into my hands, I have learned that the same disease has been prevailing there, and the cause has been ascertained to be the adoption of the new practice of maturing the ground with animal manure simultaneously with the planting of the <a name="potatoes413"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The disease disappeared as soon as this practice was dropped. Comparing the observations related yesterday in your meeting, this conclusion seems to be the true one. General Tallmadge stated that he got good <a name="potatoes414"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with manure iwelllimed land; but we know how powerfully decomposing lime acts upon animal matter, and attracts free ammonia. Mr. Minor stated that <a name="potatoes415"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> manured with poudrette were sound; but poudrette, although a high animal manure, contains no free ammonia, and very little ammonia cal salts, and is (at least in France) treated with lime. Several others stated that <a name="potatoes416"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> they had planted in new ground, without manure, were sound The Run newspaper, a few weeks ago, related that a farmer in Vermont states that his <a name="potatoes417"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were all rotten where the field was covered with barn yard manure, and sound where much had been used. Taking hold of these facts, we may drop all minor variations of observations, such as variety of <a name="potato276"><mark>potato</mark></a>, appearance of the stalk and leaves, insects, &c. It is too well understood, that if any plant does not find in the soil a sufficiency of its constituents, it will be found wanting. A ground without sulphates and phosphates will bring but poor wheat grain. And if there is in the ground a superfluity of constituents not congenial to the plants growing on it, may they not be injured by them ?a? By whatever symptom this injury will become obvious, the first cause may be the same, and the symptoms may be so influenced by diverse circumstances. The common observer will easily get confused, and not be able to come to exact conclusions. I have seen it stated that some optic in had subjected the diseased part to a powerful microscope, and discovered animalculce therein, and ascribed to them the defect. Door observers! they take the effect for the cause, forgetting that all putrefaction of animal or vegetable matters must create industry animal cuba. Those who believe the disease an imported one are mistaken, I am fully, convinced. Last year I consumed only I wish, English, or French <a name="potatoes418"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and never could find a trace of this disease in them. This moment I can show <a name="potatoes419"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, planted from the same I wish or French seed; and a minute examination will discover small traces of the disease, but so little as to escape notice very easily. But let them be propagated for some years more, and they will be more penetrated by it. Another circumstance is, that it seems to be certain that the (so calledMercer <a name="potatoes420"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are the most injured by it; and, at all events, whenever there were <a name="potatoes421"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> brought from Europe, this variety has not been imported; it being not in favor, and scarcely known in Europe. Very body knows that sound <a name="potatoes422"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> here have at all times contained many tubes with a small cavity in their centre; the pulp immediately round it being thin, always of a very watery consistence, often of a. globular shape, de 75] 248 t aching easily from the better outer part of the <a name="potato277"><mark>potato</mark></a>. This is like a disease which I have found in <a name="potatoes423"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> here these twelve: years. whilst cannot recollect but very rare instances of it in Germany. For twenty-five years I ate <a name="potatoes424"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> there, where it is quite a curiosity when it occurs; and which disease I had not in the <a name="potatoes425"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which I planted, without manure, in Jersey and on Long I s land, in sandy land. I will close with the expression of my full belief that American farmers will not have good or sound <a name="potatoes426"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, unless they drop their- practice of planting them in a heap of manure, of which all root crops are not fond. The same experience has recently been made in Germany, and equally in France, in the planting of sugar bees. Richly maturing the ground gave large crops; but the sugar manufacturer found that he had to work up a large quantity of pulp, in which there was no more sac charing matter than in half the quantity of small bees planted in un m manured ground. That in the be et is sugar, is in the <a name="potato278"><mark>potato</mark></a> starch, viz: the feu la; of which a small, regularly shaped <a name="potato279"><mark>potato</mark></a>, planted in dry sand and vegetable soil, contains as much as a big blown up lump, with half a dozen excrescences, grown in a heap of put re scent manure. No. 912 From the New England Farmer, November 20, 1844. The Of  Sease I N <a name="potatoes427"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. The alarming progress which the destructive epidemic or disease in the <a name="potato280"><mark>potato</mark></a> has made in New England, has naturally excited much inquiry into its cause, and what is likely to prove a remedy for it. We can hardly look into a newspaper, but we see some new theory advanced. The remarks and observations of the various speculators upon the matter are so vague and contradictory, that darkness, rather than light, is thrown upon this perplexing subject. Mr. Henry Paine, of Oxford, in a communication to the Massachusetts Attract, says: "he examined the diseased <a name="potatoes428"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with a microscope that magnified a thousand times. He found no insects in the roots themselves; but in the diseased stalk, near the junction with the roots the discovered an insect of a dark brown color, having a body shaped like the soldier ant, with legs like the hairy garden spider. In the body were two projecting sockets, plainly indicating that the insect had, at some time, belonged to the winged tribe." It is not in our power to insert a cut of the insect, which is given in the communication. A scientific friend assures us that it is evidently the common a his, or, plant louse, frequently found on the stalk of the <a name="potato281"><mark>potato</mark></a>, (particularly when in an unhealthy state) and which often creeps down to the root; that this cannot have any thing to do with the disease, as it has been known by him on the <a name="potato282"><mark>potato</mark></a> vine for the last thirty years. We have been much interested with. Mr. Teschemachers views on the subject, and sincerely hope he will succeed in ascertaining the true character of the disease, and in discovering a remedy which will prove effectual. If salt (as he supposes) will prevent it, it is of easy application and small expense, and at the same time beneficial to the soil. Mr. Teschemacher desires us to add to his communication in the last weeks Farmer, that "the worm in the diseased <a name="potato283"><mark>potato</mark></a> is the same as that which breeds in the mushroom. and other hung i, x which family is its natural 249 [foid? to, that the fungus erysibe of Dr. Wallrothis the same as there do of other writers, arid what is commonly called rust. Our friend Dr. Ana, of Lowell, has received from Rev. Mr. Abbot, ofWestford, a communication on the <a name="potato284"><mark>potato</mark></a> malady, which was kindly forwarded to Mr. Teschemacher, for publication in the New England Farmer, "LOWELL, November 14, 1844."D Ear Of    R: The New England Farmer of this week, and this letter, came to me at the same time. I send it to you, hoping that the facts may assist you in your researches into the cause of the <a name="potato285"><mark>potato</mark></a> malady. By friend, Rev. Mr. Abbot, is a sound, philosophical, and practical farmer. He received a premium from the agricultural society for his improvement of the 'come' referred to in his letter. If you think the facts arid theory may help to -elucidate this matter, please hand this to our friend Wreck, for his paper. For myself, I have not yet formed an opinion. I want light. I look upon it as a matter whose causes and cure are to be determined by such experiments as you are now pursuing; and perhaps we shall, after all have to call it an epidemic, of whose causes we shall be as ignorant as of those affecting the human race With regard, very truly yours, "SXML. L. Danamt. Teschemacher" Westford, November 11, 1844."DEAR Of    a: My theory is, that the disease in the <a name="potato286"><mark>potato</mark></a> is similar to the blight or rust in grain that is, that it is caused in much the same way. My reasons for this opinion are the following: I think two causes conspired to produce rust in grain, which I will endeavor to illustrate by a fact. When I was endeavoring to bring my come meadow into a productive state, !a! sowed that part of it which is entirely surrounded by a ditch with oats and grass seed, intending to now the oats for fodder. The season was warm and dry so dry that corn was seriously injured by the drought; yet, when the oats headed out, they looked so well that I determined to let them risen ; but just when the grain was beginning to fill, there came a great rain, and, in one or two days afterwards, I looked on them, and found the s talks and leaves were cracked open, and a gum my substance issuing out of every fissure. This appearance convinced me that I should have no, grain if I let them stand, and I had them immediately mowed for fodder. Was there not a chemical action going on in the earth, during the long time of warm dry weather, by which food for plants was elaborated, and remained un dissolved till the rain prepared it for the plants in such abundance that they could not contain -it, and consequently burst, and let the fluid which, had there been no rupture, would have filled the grain) issue out at the fissures" The state of the weather the past season has, I think, been rather peculiar. We had several small showers and light rains, which kept the top of the ground so moist that plants at no time exhibited the appearance that, they do in a severe drought. There was but one rain after <a name="potatoes429"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted, and before the blight, which wetted the ground to any considerable depth ; and it is probable that even that rain did not reach the roots so as materially to affect them- For some time previous to the blight, the ground 250' 75 ]was dry, and the weather very warm for the season. Met the vines of my <a name="potatoes430"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> remained green, mind apparently health and grown ring, till t e great rain came; and then, in two. or three days, the leaves withered, turned red, and died. The weather continued so warm, that no one believed that they had been injured by frost. That the <a name="potatoes431"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were injured about the time of the rain, I believe all admit; and that the cause of the injury was what have suggested, I infer from several facts. My <a name="potatoes432"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted on an old pasture, which I had ploughed to free it from bushes which infested some parts of it. The land was very stony, and the labor of digging and removing the stones made it late before I could plough and plant it. I had but little manure to put on it, and, contrary to my usual practice, I determined to put what I had in the hills. The greater part of the field was manured with a poor com post made of mud mixed with a very little dung from my barn cellar; a small part was manured with chip dung taken from the door yard there these manures were used, the <a name="potatoes433"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were nearly all sound, except in a valley which had received the wash from the road, and had, from that cause, become richer than the greater part of the field. More than a tenth part of the <a name="potatoes434"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised in this valley were injured, more or less, by the rot. I manured part of several rows with dung taken from the barn cellar, and applied it in its full strength. The vines where this manure was used were very large, but the greater part of the <a name="potatoes435"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were -rotten ;and the facts were the same on a place where com post had been prepared for several years." May we not infer, from the facts above stated, that the great rain which preceded the blight in the <a name="potato287"><mark>potato</mark></a> vines caused a flow or pressure of sap in the vines which they could not sustain, and consequently could not properly elaborate the fluid which descended from them to the tubes and that this imperfectly prepared fluid corrupted the <a name="potatoes436"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>? If my theory be correct, we should expect the malady to be greatest in just such instances as it was greatest in my field. Some kinds of <a name="potatoes437"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be able, from their different constitutions, to bear a sure it better than others, and all kinds may bear it better in some stages of their growth than in others. I have not heard that <a name="potatoes438"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which had completed their growth, or nearly completed it, before the rain, were injuredEPHRAI M Abbotdr. Saml. L. Danano. 913For the To ton Cultivat4ordi  Sease Among <a name="potatoes439"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Messrs. Edi  Tors: Of the fact that a disease has raged among <a name="potatoes440"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> this fall, too many of your readers are undoubtedly well aware, from the ravages it 'hasn made in their own fields. The effects of the disorder are visible wherever it exists, which I believe is very general over a, large section of country; and the actual loss which must result from its prevalence must be great. As yet, the papers have said very little upon the subject of this disease, which, in Berkshire, is a new as well as a most unwelcome visiter. Met the subject is one of a magnitude which calls for an invest i 251 .75 nation from every individual ; and the result of these investigations should, in some way or other, be brought before the public mind; so that it nay be va preventive of its recurrence, or a remedy for its progress, in its daily stages, may be found. Under these impressions, we have concluded to offer the result of our own observations, sustained by that of many of our neighbors, as to the how and wherefore of this new come r. The first thing, perhaps, which should be brought into notice, is the season as it has passed with us. Early in May, we had an unusual quantity of rain, so that planting was much retarded; yet, in consequence of the favorable character of April for getting in crops, the labors of the season were in advance of what they are most years; so that, notwithstanding the heavy rains, corn and <a name="potatoes441"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted as early, and earlier than inmost seasons. Those rains were heavy, and calculated to leave clayeylands in a compact condition. After they subsided, and about the time for <a name="potatoes442"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to set, there was rather a deficiency of rain, in so much that the grass crop, to some extent, felt its effects ; consequently, <a name="potatoes443"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> did not, as a general thing, (so far as we have been informed) set for more than half a usual crop. When again came on the rains, and a great deal of cloudy weather, which continued until the last of August. Thus much for the season. Next, the disease; which evidently and conclusively, as we think, has its origin in the stalk. Now it is planted there, is a matter on which various opinions exist. Some are confident that it arises from the depredations of a black bug or fly, from feeding upon the leaf until it is nearly consumed. This opinion, however, we think must be erroneous, from the following facts, viz : the black insect alluded to is no new visiter among us; therefore, if it was going to destroy the <a name="potatoes444"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, it would have done it years ago. When, again, many fields exhibit but faint vestiges of its operations on the leaves. We have seen, in <a name="potato288"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields where the rot has extensively prevailed, the leaves dried as perfect, in all their parts, as <a name="potato289"><mark>potato</mark></a> leaves ever were. And, finally, the disease appears to have its origin on the stalk, where it sometimes first develops itself by presenting a very small surface, which continues to extend until it has spread around the stalk, so as to stop the circulation of sap before the leaves dry up, while at the same time it extends itself upward and downward. The appearance of this spot resembles that of a frost bitten, <a name="potato290"><mark>potato</mark></a> vine in November; while, perhaps, the stalk below it exhibits various appearances, from those first induced by the disease, to (as you approach the ground) an almost healthy green ness. These observations have induced us to suppose that the disorder is a rust, produced in a manner similar to that by which the rust on wheat or rye straw originates a bursting of sap vessels, from a super abundant flowing of sap. It appears evident that the disease which produces the rot originates in the stalk, from the fact that it appears there while yet the tube has no mark of the disease upon it. When it does reach the <a name="potatoes445"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, it develops itself in small spots, similar in color to those which appeared oil the stalk; and most usually seats itself among the eyes, from which the shoots of a new crop would originate. I to appearance very closely resembles that of a slight burn on the human flesh; and, by slight friction, the skin of the <a name="potato291"><mark>potato</mark></a> will rub off like the skin from a burn, and a watery substance exude, as in the latter case. From this stage, its progress may be watched until it has spread over and through the <a name="potato292"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and rotating, with a very nausea us odor, follows. When a <a name="potato293"><mark>potato</mark></a> first exhibits appearances[ 75 ]a] 252 of the disease, there is no remedy, unless i the part affected is entire y c tout; and, it may be, not then rot it must, and rot it will. Now, we will suggest a query, without venturing an opinion. Our object is rather to elicit information on this subject, than to make a vain show, of wisdom. I s not the disease originated in the tube r in consequence of the circulation of sap being cut off in the stalk, so that t it cannot be elaborated in the usual manner in the leaves; and by its being obliged to return in its un manufactured state, impregnated, it may be, by disease in the stalk, which it conveys by inoculation to the tube r? When another query may arise. Why are not all <a name="potatoes446"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the same hill affected in the same way ?a? This may be owing to various causes. A <a name="potato294"><mark>potato</mark></a> may have become so nearly detached from the vine (which is the case with all <a name="potatoes447"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> at full maturity) as to have that circumstance operate as a preventive for there may be other ways, of which we have no knowledge. But we go one step further: If the theory we have hinted at be correct, (and we hope to see the subject fairly examined) the first operation to be performed on the disease seizing the stalk, as it appears to us, should be to cut off, either by pulling or mowing the vines, all communication between them and the tube. Both experiments have been tried among us this season; but we fear the work of rotten ness, in both cases, had so far advanced as not to admit of a fair trial. It was certainly so with regard to pulling: so far as we have heard king, probably, to the fact that it was a new disease and the farmers did not know what to do, and therefore neglected doing a y thing until its ravages were too far advanced to be stayed. Somedugtheir <a name="potatoes448"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, but that was of little avail. Those that were going to rot, would rot in spite of them; and when placed in proximity with their neighbors, they are very apt to communicate the disease to them upon the principle that misery loves company, we suppose. It has generally been concluded, whereabouts, th that the. better way is to let them remain in the hill until the usual time of digging ; and if they will rot, rot there. We think, however, that this part of the' story is told for the present season; for, in digging, a few days since, for feeding, we discovered n n new cases they were either very sound or very rotten The disease first appeared in this region early in August, and its locality was in a low land field, very near a swamp. The last green <a name="potato295"><mark>potato</mark></a> vine we saw was in September, (about the 10th) on a light dry field. It has been remarked, that those planted on dry sandy soils have suffered much less than those in other localities. To variety has been exempt from the attack. The disease showed itself first on the new and more esteemed varieties; and the orange (which is a valuable <a name="potato296"><mark>potato</mark></a> for all seasons, if properly cooked) and flesh colored, were the last smitten. But we have already occupied more space than we designed at the beginning. We therefore drop this topic, in hope. of hearing much from others, and some time being able to say more ourselves, Hours, truly, W. Baconpsriuhimond, (less) . Kept e mber 2 7.23 [a[ 75. No. 914 From the Boston Cultivatora agricultural meeting at 'the State House, January 7, 1845. After the meeting was organized, the disease in <a name="potatoes449"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was discussed. Mr. Allen, of Plymouth, spoke of the great evil its alarming effects, and the importance of investigation g the subject and finding a remedy, if possible. He stated that a gentleman, noted for his scientific attainments, had suggested that salt might be a remedy, and he recommended experiments with salt. Mr. Allen, of North field, remarked that he was in Canada last season, on the It. Lawrence, and this disease did not prevail there; and he did not discover it till he arrived within 70 miles of Sang or. Mr. Stone, of the Senate, said it would be well to know what kinds of <a name="potatoes450"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were affected. In Worcester county, the Nova Scotia <a name="potato297"><mark>potato</mark></a>, or each bloom" was the only kind that had escaped. He recommended the appointment of a scientific committee to investigate the subject. Mr. Allen, of Plymouth, said it had been stated that animals and human beings had been destroyed by eating diseased <a name="potatoes451"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and, as there was much alarm on that account, it would be well to investigate the subject in this bearing. Mr. J. M. Earle, of Worcester, said that he had examined into this disease before the papers said any thing on the subject. He believed that it had been much longer in the country than was generally supposed, and that it had been gradually extending. For three years it had been extending in New Took. In Pennsylvania, it prevailed the most in mountainous regions. A friend of his used about half a spoonfuls of salt to a hill of <a name="potatoes452"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, when they began to set, to prevent injury from worms; and they were excellent where the salt was used, the others were not worth harvesting. /the Presi     Dent stated that he ploughed part of a field last fall: on the other part he spread manure in the spring, and turned it under. Oinbothparts he put com post in the hill, and all were affected alike with the disease not one fifth were sound. Chenangos, that were planted early, were free from disease. Mr. Earle named two cases in which cattle had been fed freely on diseased <a name="potatoes453"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> without any injury; and another, of a how that was fediberaly on them, and he did well second agricultural meeting at the State House, January 19, 1845. Subject: the <a name="potato298"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease. On. Levi  Of Ncoln in the chair. Mr. Teschepi Macher, of Boston, opened the discussion. He first read from a pamphlet, published in Germany a few years ago, on this disease, which prevailed there to an alarming extent. There were many conjectures as to the cause of the disease, such as the manure, soil, &c. There the seed was gut, the injury was greater an affection of the tube r commencing at the cut t part. t in e had made i numerous examinations on diseased <a name="potatoes454"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>: Theamell was like decayedfiungus, and he wa inclined to the opinion that this 75 254 was the cause of the disease. Hung i are very fine particles of vegetable matter that float about in the atmosphere, imperceptible to the naked eye. He had examined many <a name="potatoes455"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with a view to learn the cause of this disease e -inspected some <a name="potatoes456"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in which the disease had just commenced. In cutting them open length wise, he discovered small white worms, about one fourth of an inch from the skin. At that stage the disease had not affected the starch. From the depositions of these worms, the cells became thickened, which gave to the <a name="potato299"><mark>potato</mark></a> its peculiar appearance in this disease. He tried to prop agate the disorder by placing diseased halves of <a name="potatoes457"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in contact with other halves that were sound. In five or six days no effect was produced; but in two weeks the sound parts had become contaminated, and in six weeks they had decayedMr. Beckminstera, of the Ploighman, remarked that we had in September, about two weeks hot her weather than had been before for fifty years and this might, in part, be the cause of the disease o As it was more common when manure was in the hill, it shows that heat is a cause, as heat is produced by the ferment at ion of the manure. Mr. A. W. Force. of Hamilton, said that he had one kind of potatothebleofburfifths of which were diseased. He had raised these on his place for several years, and they had not been affected before. He had furnished some of his neighbors with the same seed, and their crops were not injured. He planted Chenangos, and they were cut, but not affected with this disease. The disease could not he owing to heat, as long reds were never better. He was feeding swine with his diseased <a name="potatoes458"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and they had not been injured. It was not owing to the seed running out, for the long red had been long among us. As salt prevents smut in wheat, and as <a name="potatoes459"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have not been so. much. affected on the seaboard, where sea weed and salt manures are used, salt may be a preventive. M. Abel Gleason, of May land, planted three or four acres of <a name="potatoes460"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on green s ward ;some were rotten. He gave one or two bushels to nine hogs, and they ate them. Next morning, one could not rise. He gave her half a pound of salts in new milk, and in four hours she was well. He manured in the hill. A neighbor, planted <a name="potatoes461"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> adjoining him, (only a fence between) and manured in the hill, and he had not one rotten one. The " veto" <a name="potatoes462"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted most. He thinks the kind of manure had some effect, for where he used pe at manure the disease was lost. Mr. Peter Fay, of Southiborough, observed that the first he heard of the disease was in the first week in September. His vines were then greet but soon they were diseased, and in 48 hours the tubes were, affected also. The disease commenced at the top, and proceeded downward. Before the vines were affected, there was no disease in the <a name="potato300"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The malady was worse on old ground and on low land. He had three varieties. Shelves were most affected e the vetoes next, and the long reds were scarcely any injured. He fed to stock those that were the most affected; so did others in the town, and no damage was done. Peri Page, of New Bedford, inquired of Mr. May whether, in any case, the <a name="potatoes463"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were affected, unless the tops were diseased; to which Mr. May replied in the negative. A gentleman from Chester said that the vines seemed struck with a sudden blast. He supposed that it was occasioned by atmospheric influence: Mr. My Of Briackatt, of Sturbridge, inquired whether <a name="potatoes464"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted early or late were most affected. Some of his neighbors planted early 255 [a[ ]on dry soil, and their crops were good. There was no blast on the vines. This disease produced a sudden effect. The leaves on all wilted in a single day, and soon the <a name="potatoes465"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were rotten .a' A gentleman from Connecticut said that the early planted were not much affected, Ohio Mr. Allenx from Plymouth county, said that he would give the experience of a man in his county. He planted a field of <a name="potatoes466"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> a part descending to the south and a part to the north; both parts treated alike and that part having the. southern exposure was much affected, and the other part was not injured. Great heat may have some effect, as the most injury was done where the heat was greates. In some parts, the long red s were not affected; but in Plymouth county some say that this variety was most affected. The Abingdon blues seem to have sustained the most i ri jury. He thought the best seed was from the late planted, and farmers should plant some late, for that purpose. Friend To M. Earl, of Worcester, remarked, that he travelled considerably last fall, and he made many inquiries as to this disease, and examined diseased <a name="potatoes467"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in many places; and a il seemed to agree that those planted early generally escaped. Chenangos were much affected. He did riot think that great heat occasion ed the disease; for we often have greater heat in July ad August, to which early <a name="potatoes468"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are exposed, th~n at a later period in the season; of course, the early planted are, exposed to the mo- t heat, The disease was considerably developed before, the warm weather in September. In some cases, part of a field of <a name="potatoes469"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was killed, while the rest esaped1Hon. Mr. Of . Llingoam, of the Senate, said he thought that salt would have no good effect l He planted an acre, using sea weed, help, and barn mantle. The <a name="potatoes470"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were all dry at the same time, and appeared good. They were put in the cellar. In three or four weeks, on boiling them, it was found that the long reds were much l affected, and turned black under the skin They were all overhauled, and the long reds were much diseased, and the Uhlans about the same; but the Chenangos were not injured. The principal part of the sea weed and help were on the part planted with long reds. Mr. Cole, of the Cultivator, stated that, after all that' had been said, we had not discovered the cause of this disease. What appeared to be a cause in one case, had in effect in another. He had for some time thought that it was occasioned by atmospheric influence, which could not be explained, as 1 le stated at the previous seeing, in the same manner as diseases which affect mankind and animals. Some persons are predisposed to disease, and are affected, while others escape. To some varieties of <a name="potatoes471"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are hardy, and escape this disease; while others are tender, and predisposed to it. This is not owing to old varieties. The Deane <a name="potato301"><mark>potato</mark></a> (called also the veto and Abingdon blues) is more affected, generally, than the long reds, which have for a long time been among us; while the veto has been more recently from the seed. The reason that early planted <a name="potatoes472"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were less affected is because this blight prevailed late in the season. Any things assigned as causes are only predisposing causes. He had found, from experience, that <a name="potatoes473"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted late were best for seed, and grew the most vigorously. It is important to find preventives of the disease, though probably no complete remedy will be found. Hardy varieties- should be preferred; seed, for late planting, if not affected, will be be so Plaster may be useful. Mrf75 ]a] 256 Everett stated the other evening that the injury was least when plaster was used. A Mrnetterville, of New Jersey, found that his <a name="potatoes474"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were affected, in 1843, after being put into the cellar; and so he picked out those that were affected, and put half a peck of soaked lime to each layer of the others, and they kept well. In planting, last spring, he put a table spoonftilof lime in each hill; and after they were up, and before hoping, he applied to each hill about a will of a mixture of lime 2 bushels, plaster 3, and ashes 8, He had not one rotten <a name="potato302"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the fall, while those of his neighbors were much diseased. Although lime may not be a complete remedy, it may have a favorable effect. Mr. Of Homas Kearpto, of New Bedford, observed, that needling <a name="potatoes475"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had been equally affected with others; that the disease commenced at the stalk, and progressed up; that late planted had been most injured. On. Mr. Foote, of Berkshire county, said that William Cartridge, of New York city, well known as a good practical chemist, in preparing apiece of sandy land on Long I s land for <a name="potatoes476"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, mixed with the surface soil a large portion of pulverized charcoal, and he had a good crop. The Presi     Dent remarked, that the whole discussion reminded him of the remark of an old physician, who was on consultation in a case of spotted fever; and, having examined into the case, and his opinion being required, said" It is death." To, from all that has been said on this subject, it only appears that it is death to the <a name="potato303"><mark>potato</mark></a>. No. 915ON The Of  Sease I N The <a name="potato304"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Cropi n the periodical works of agricultural literature; the attention of the reader has been particularly directed, of late, to the subject of dry rot in <a name="potatoes477"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The great loss of produce in harvest occasioned by this disease makes it necessary, for the future, that great care should be taken in the management of this vegetable, now of such great importance, on account of our rapidly increasing population. Naturalists, who have been called upon for advice upon this subject, seem to differ as to the cause of the disease. Some of them affirm it to be a species of fly; others attribute it to small hung i, or parasitic al plants, which occasion the scab and corruption of the <a name="potato305"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Dr. Sprengel tries to prove that the pro t oxide of iron present in the soil, being rendered so ruble by the ammonia of the manures, (particularly of sheeps dung) exercises a great influence upon the putrefaction of the <a name="potato306"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Getting out with this theory, he considers the different effects of marks, in the cultivation of the <a name="potato307"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant, to be dependent on the greater or less proportion of pro t oxide of iron which they contain. He thinks it probable that the bad effects of the marks which contain pro t oxide of iron upon the <a name="potato308"><mark>potato</mark></a> n may be prevented, by exposing them for a considerable period to the action of th,'air, by which means the; pro t oxide is converted into peroxide of iron. Any also believe that the i constant cultivation of the <a name="potato309"><mark>potato</mark></a> ,from the root has weakened the vital energies of the plant, and try to account for the disease, and consequent failure of the <a name="potato310"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, in this way 257[ 75 n the 2d part of volume 4th of Her dllgemeinen Landwirthschaflichenanlathscrijt, published by Or, Sprengel, is given an ont line, shown in he: following valuable remarks and suggestions proposed by the celebrated. Standinger, of Gros Flotbeek, near Hamburg. The cultivation of the <a name="potato311"><mark>potato</mark></a> is one of the principal objects of farming in the vicinity of Hamburg, owing to their use for particular economical purposes, the growing of corn being only a secondary consideration. This is particularly the case in Flotbeek, where the cultivation of the <a name="potato312"><mark>potato</mark></a> has been practised on a large scale, ever since its introduction by the late Baron On Right, in 1786. Though M. Standinger has resided there ever since 1793, and has been engaged partly as a land steward, and partly as a tenant, and has been constantly mingling with practical men, there can be no doubt but that he has had great opportunity of experience in all relating to the <a name="potato313"><mark>potato</mark></a> culture. In all this long course of practice however, he has never witnessed any thing like the disease described by the author of the paper in the previously mentioned part of Her Jallgemeinelancdwirih ch aft lichen Monathscrift. It certainly has happened several times in Fplotbeek, that when the <a name="potatoes478"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, in wet weather, have been laid too close, and mixed with too much earth, they have become infected with disease in the interior of the bulb, and have put refined; and even when the <a name="potatoes479"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which had not suffered from this putrefactive process were planted out, not half of them terminated; and those which did shoot, had but a sickly growth, and gave a poor crop. This, however, was not caused by disease, but arose from too much heat in the <a name="potato314"><mark>potato</mark></a> heaps or pits, which occasioned ferment at ion in the <a name="potato315"><mark>potato</mark></a>, just as is the case when corn lies too thick, and heats. From the marks given by the author of the paper alluded to, viz: that blue spots can be plainly distinguished when the <a name="potatoes480"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are cut through it is evident that a stagnation of vital action has taken place in the interior of the <a name="potatoes481"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which increases when they are kept, and which eventually is the cause of the sickly growth of the young plant. From these facts, it is plain that, in the opinion of the author, the newly planted <a name="potato316"><mark>potato</mark></a> has within itself the <a name="seeds32"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the dry rot. The natural conclusion from all this is, that such <a name="potatoes482"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should neither be cultivated for a ed nor for planting out. But, as whole districts are occasionally infested with this disease, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to obtain perfectly sound <a name="potatoes483"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for planting. For this reason, the author, in the. Hamburg Correspondent en, recommends the raising of <a name="potatoes484"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the seed apples, by a simple method; by which, even in the first year, large and useful <a name="potatoes485"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be obtained. The author, in .the _lgemezinemLandwiirl hschaflichen Monathscrift, seems, however, to doubt this mode of raising from the seed apples; and, in confirmation of his opinion, refers to an experiment, by which he found that <a name="potatoes486"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which were .raised from seed three years before had suffered from the same disease.  As many may now be afraid to cultivate the <a name="potato317"><mark>potato</mark></a> from the seed apples as a: means of preventing disease, .the author believes he has not begun a useless work, when he undertakes a more minute examination of the previously mentioned outline of the rise see of <a name="potatoes487"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The author of the outline just mentioned supposes this disease to arise from two causes. He considers the principal reason to be a small fly, very much resembling the insect called the "vinegar fly" and which the celebrated; philosopher, Ehrenerg, has declared to_ be a species of sciara17[ 75 ]258 Further, he thinks that the disease is decidedly infectious, because in ten different kinds which he had procured from Berlin, and planted in a field in which Gibraltar <a name="potatoes488"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which had suffered from the disease, had been previously grown, all of them, with the exception of the Dutch sugar <a name="potato318"><mark>potato</mark></a>, became infected; from which he concludes that the diseased Gibraltar <a name="potatoes489"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had infected those from Berlin, which the author presumed were previously in a sound state. With respect to this hypothesis, that the before mentioned flies were the cause of the disease, and the necessity there exists for their extirpation, he writes as followsSHe found that five weeks after he had harvested a crop from a field planted with diseased <a name="potatoes490"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, they began to undergo a dry corruption and that even if externally they had a sound appearance, they had internally a number of the blue spot called stagnation spots, which, when the <a name="potatoes491"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were boiled, remained hard* were rejected by cattle, and which could not be used for the manufacturing of brandy; as, besides being unsuited for the purpose, the <a name="potatoes492"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> would not go through the crushing mill. In these <a name="potatoes493"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> he noticed white maggots with black heads. He now enclosed some of these <a name="potatoes494"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a large perfectly closed glass vessel, and saw, to his astonishment, that, after four or five days, maggots and flies would be distinctly detected inside the vessel. The latter were of the size of the vinegar fly, and had a greenish color and long wings The glass was cleaned, and again filled with <a name="potatoes495"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. After two days, two flies were seen; and after ten days, ten flies were counted. From this experiment, it would appear that the maggots before alluded to are the cause of the failure of the <a name="potato319"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop Further on, he observes: " Any such <a name="potatoes496"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, after planting, were then carefully lifted with a spade, and in the mould red (mother <a name="potato320"><mark>potato</mark></a>) were found a great number of maggots, worms, small spiders, and beetles. The question now occurs, Are these beetles and worms the cause of the putrefaction of the <a name="potato321"><mark>potato</mark></a>, or generated by the putrefaction ?a" As I have always observed in <a name="potatoes497"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are sound when cut, but which have been cultivated in the neighborhood of diseased ones, a great number of the previously mentioned flies in the harvest and spring, which is not the case with fresh <a name="potatoes498"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and as I found, in the spring, maggot sin the cavities of the <a name="potatoes499"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I am of opinion that the flies are the cause of the disease in <a name="potatoes500"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> Finally, the author grounds his hypothesis on the following observations He says, " Three partially rotten Gibraltar <a name="potatoes501"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted in a garden, surrounded by sound ones. All three, at first, went on miserable but, owing to the richness of the soil in the garden, this unhealthy appearance vanished in a short time, in so much that they gave a luxuriant crop, and in that respect were not to be distinguished from the others. Someday S afterwards, however, I found a number of gray <a name="potato322"><mark>potato</mark></a> flies covering around the Gibraltar <a name="potato323"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the sunshine, but which were not to be found on the other <a name="potato324"><mark>potato</mark></a> s talks. As the large luxuriant bulbs had swelled up the earth round about the roots, and thus occasioned cracks in the soil, it was obvious that the flies had been derived from thence These are the authors arguments upon which he founds the supposition* This, the reader will remark, was precisely the character of the disease among ourselves 259 75 ]that the flies above mentioned are the cause of the disease. Met us now for a moment consider the authors observations. He plants thin, sickly Gibraltar <a name="potatoes502"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, surrounded by others perfectly sound. These at first came up somewhat unhealthy, but afterwards grew very luxuriantly. Tracks were observed in the soil, about the roots of the s talks. All this seems, therefore, to show that from diseased <a name="potatoes503"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were obtained large and sound ones, which sent out vigorous shoots. The author finds a great number of the previously mentioned gray <a name="potato325"><mark>potato</mark></a> flies covering around the Gibraltar <a name="potatoes504"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and draws the conclusion that they are derived from the loosened soil. From his observations, it is evident that the sickly shoots from the partially rotten Gibraltar <a name="potatoes505"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> produced three large and luxuriant <a name="potato326"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants, with excellent bulbs; and still he tries to prove that the flies are the cause of a disease which did not exist. We should conclude, from his experiments with the different species of <a name="potatoes506"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> obtained from Berlin, that the disease was not occasioned by the Gibraltar <a name="potatoes507"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, but that it had its origin in the soil. The author does not make the slightest mention whether the <a name="potatoes508"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> surrounding the Gibraltar <a name="potatoes509"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which gave such a luxuriant crop, were at all infected by their vicinity. The fact of maggots and flies being found when <a name="potatoes510"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having wood y stagnation spots were included in a glass vessel, by no means proves the authors theory, but rather the contrary, as the origin of the disease was already in the <a name="potatoes511"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and the maggots and flies were merely consequent on the disease; but they were obviously not the cause of the stagnation spots, nor of the incapacity of the <a name="potatoes512"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to terminate, which was clearly consequent on the spots; and below the s talks of the plant were afterwards found maggots, worms, and small spiders. The author should have been content with the correct hypothesis, that these beetles, worms, &c, were occasioned by the putrefaction of the <a name="potato327"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and should have dispensed with the unnatural supposition that these insects are the cause of the corruption of the <a name="potato328"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The instance of the fly called the horse sing fly, or Hessian fly, which in some provinces of North America is said to be productive of so much mischief to the wheat, and to which the author refers, is by no means a well selected example, and proves more against than for the German authors, who have themselves visited America, and witnessed the damage which the natives affirm is caused by this fly, but which is, in reality, occasioned by an exudation of a sweet liquid called honey dew, which spreads over the plant, as if it were covered with gum, and prevents its perfect growth. The flies and insects, however, being very fond of this sweet liquid, collect on the straw The author also contradicts himself when he says that the formation of blue spots must be due to some external influence, or to some chemical agency. This seems to be absolutely necessary, because the <a name="potatoes513"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are converted into this blue substance, and thus become assimilated, so as to afford nourishment to the insects; for it is probable that they could not live upon the <a name="potato329"><mark>potato</mark></a> in its fresh state* The great Linnaeus was also in error in supposing that the ergot (scale corneum) was produced by the bite of an insect, because he always found the insects wherever the corn was suffering from this disease; whereas, in reality, the flies, being fond of the sweet drops ex using from the plants, are always to be found upon them 75 260 is the author says that he has not yet concluded his experiments, but intends to prolong his observations, Nature will, in all likelihood, soon put him on the right track. The means of preventing this disease, which the author gives, are all either palliations, or proceed from the absurd hypothesis that the flies so frequently mentioned infect the fresh <a name="potatoes514"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and that these again infect others. The only specific means of preventing the disease would be to try and procure <a name="potatoes515"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from a country where the disease did not exist; but as large quantities would be required from such a distant country, this remedy would be very expensive, and sometimes impracticable; and thus the cultivation of <a name="potatoes516"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the seed apple is the only radical cure for this disease. At this .method has other advantages, which will appear hereafter. As this plan has hitherto been considered a very troublesome and tedious one, I shall try to explain how simple it is I shall take the liberty of making use of a paper of mine, published in " Men Hamburg her Correspondentenas my text book, as it is probable that few of my readers have had the opportunity of consulting the work. Hence I entertain, then, the general view that the disease had its origin in the degeneration of the <a name="potato330"><mark>potato</mark></a>. It has long been observed as well in the animal as vegetable kingdom, that degeneration is transmitted by individuals, as well to race as to seed; in so much that, among vegetables, healthy seed occasions a marked increase in the quantity of produce. When the same species of <a name="potato331"><mark>potato</mark></a> is cultivated for a number of years on the same kind of soil, the crop obtained sensibly diminishes. When these circumstances are varied in such a manner that the <a name="potatoes517"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> obtained from a clay soil are again planted on a sandy soil, and .so, vice versa, from this again to a soil only mixed with clay, then, the circus stances of temperature being the same, no diminution is to be observed in the crop. When, therefore, a tenant has the misfortune to raise such <a name="potatoes518"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as, when all possible care has been taken in gathering them, (namely, that they have not been dug up in wet weather, mixed with moist particles of earth, or laid in deep pits in too thick layers over one another) undergo the dry rot, it is natural that such <a name="potatoes519"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not to be used for planting, but that others are to be tried, which are not infected with this disease. But as the disease may extend over so large a district that it may be difficult or impossible to obtain sound <a name="potatoes520"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for planting, it is necessary to resort to other means namely, to the cultivation of the <a name="potato332"><mark>potato</mark></a> from the seed apples and, in doing so, it is necessary to pay attention to the following directions n the autumn, when the <a name="potatoes521"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are taken in, which is not generally done before the s talks are withered, there may be collected a large quantity of the seed apples, which are to be preserved in a vessel through the winter, under such circumstances that the mucilaginous matter which is contained in the fresh apples surrounding the <a name="seeds33"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may be completely frozen ; which has the effect of allowing the <a name="seeds34"><mark>seeds</mark></a> to be washed out and separated with greater facility in the spring. This work is to be done in January, and the small <a name="seeds35"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are in February (if the weather permits, or, if not, in March )to be sown in a large garden bed, as thinly as possible, in rows from ten to twelve inches apart. These rows can be placed under a hothouse window and, in that case, the operation can be performed in January During frosty n lights, however, the beds must be covered with straw. When, the small <a name="potato333"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants begin to be visible, they appear with two small i sprouting leaves; the third leaf already looks like a rough <a name="potato334"><mark>potato</mark></a> leaf. The rows in 261 [a[ 75 ]the garden bed must be kept clear, as the young <a name="potato335"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants, grow much more rapidly in the light. The land on which these young plaits are to be planted out must be previously well manured; and, if in a garden, well turned over with a spade; or i, in the case of a large quantity of seed apples being taken, and there being consequently a great number of young <a name="potatoes522"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be planted out, a large piece of ground is to be selected, free from weeds, (and which, if possible, is to be a second rate old lea) which, after it has been well matured, must be ploughed as deep as the vegetable mould renders it prudent to go. When the greater part of the <a name="potato336"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants have grown to the height of from four to five inches, they are to be hold by means of a hand he, and the soil so loosened about them that their large plants can be drawn out with a slight pull of the hand. In the same plant will then be observed two distinct kinds of roots, namely: the usual fibrous nourishing root, and other short and somewhat thicker white roots or twigs, which have a broad hatchet shaped extremity, upon which small <a name="potatoes523"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are already to be seen. The larger plants are to be carefully gathered out from the smaller ones, and laid in a hand basket along with lumps of earth which adhere to them. The small plants are again pressed down into the soil with the hand, to allow them to grow larger. and when they have obtained a sufficient height, they are to be planted out in the way above described. In the garden, or piece of ground, lines are now to be marked out, first along the length of the field, and then across the breadth, two and a half feet apart; the soil being of course previously well disintegrated by sloughing and narrowing. I n the exact point where these lines cross one another, holes are to be made with a diable, which must make so large an opening that there shall be plenty of room to introduce the <a name="potato337"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant. The earth is then pressed down around the plants, with the hands. If it should happen that some of the plants are too small, two of them may be put into the same hole. The most suitable time for transplanting the young plants is, with regard to the weather, as well as to the growth of the plants, from the beginning of April to the middle of May. As soon as the first weeds are seen, they must be extirpated with the hand he, particularly round the roots of the young plants. When the plants begin to grow larger, and show leaves, the spaces between the plants are to be ploughed up with the simple <a name="potato338"><mark>potato</mark></a> plough, which cuts through the roots of the weeds in such a way as not to cause the soil to rise up. In doing this, the horse must be led by a boy, else many of the plants would be destroyed by its feet. If the weather is moderately fine, the plants grow healthy, and enlarge in leaves, twigs, and stem, just as rapidly as those plants which are cultivated from the bulbs, and which lie in the soil three or four weeks before their leaves are visible above the surface of the soil; so that the <a name="potatoes524"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised from the seed apples can be gathered with the plough just as soon as those which are cultivated from the bulbs. At the period when the seed <a name="potatoes525"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> begin to flower, the attention of the farmer is particularly requisite, inasmuch as many varieties of flowers are to be observed arising from the apple, from which the <a name="seeds36"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are collected. The author has cultivated <a name="potatoes526"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the seed six and thirty years, and has obtained <a name="potato339"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants which have produced white, flesh colored, light, and dark blue flowers. Each variety of flowers had also a particular form of leaf, as well as certain peculiarities, both in the bulb and in their taste[ 75 262 The <a name="potato340"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants, however, always gave a greater number of flowers, resembling those of the plant from which the seed was taken; and sometimes only a few varieties could be observed. For example: the apples taken from a large cattle <a name="potato341"><mark>potato</mark></a>, with strong stems, and large coarse grained leaves, and the <a name="potatoes527"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised from them, showed the same general analogy in their appearance. Those who wish to cultivate <a name="potatoes528"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with advantage from seed, so that they can be used the first year, must not neglect to put sticks to every separate variety of plant. with a mark of the kind of flower; so that, in harvest, those <a name="potatoes529"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which had different flowers may not be mixed together. When the time arrives for gathering them, all those having the same kind of flower must be carefully separated from the others, and preserved; so that the farmer is thus able to choose those which he finds to please him best, both as to taste and appearance, and with regard also to the purposes for which he means to cultivate them; and which may be either for the manufacturing of brandy, or for use as food, both for cattle and for the table. Upon harvesting the seed <a name="potatoes530"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, one observes, with astonishment, that the s talks are just as large as those grown from the bulbs; but the experimenter will probably be still more astonished, particularly if he has never before tried this mode of cultivating <a name="potatoes531"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, to find that below the s talks are to be seen a great number of large <a name="potatoes532"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; or perhaps lie has formerly entertained the very general opinion, that <a name="potatoes533"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised from seed never attain, in the first year, a larger size than that of from a pea to a nut But, at the same time, it must not be forgotten that, below the s talks of the <a name="potatoes534"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised from seed are frequently to be found a great number of small <a name="potatoes535"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which is dependent on the variety of seed from which the <a name="potatoes536"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are raised. For example: when the seed apples are taken from a variety called the Dutch table <a name="potato342"><mark>potato</mark></a>, there is always to be found a larger number of these small ones than is the case when the seed is taken from the large cattle <a name="potato343"><mark>potato</mark></a> with white or red skins. When the plants raised from seed are grown in a warm place, so that they are sufficiently large to be transplanted in April, provided no night frosts occur, which are always very hurt full to young plants, and the ground is kept loose and free from weeds, these plants give just as large a crop as would be obtained by planting the bulbs from which the seed was taken. This mode of cultivating the <a name="potato344"><mark>potato</mark></a> (from seed) has been known from sixty to seventy years; but it has been very little adopted, which is owing to those who have made the trial sowing the <a name="seeds37"><mark>seeds</mark></a> too thick, and thus leaving the plants too little room to grow. Under these circumstances, the <a name="potato345"><mark>potato</mark></a> could not well be larger than peas or nuts; and, in consequence of these imperfect trials, the opinion has very naturally obtained, that it requires from three to four years before the <a name="potatoes537"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised from seed can attain any considerable size. Even so long ago as the year 1804, the author published an outline of the mode of raising <a name="potato346"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants from seed, as well as of the mode of transplanting. But this outline has either been unknown to agriculturists, or has been overlooked by them. When this method has once been introduced, even though only partially, into practical agriculture, it is probable that the value of the <a name="potato347"><mark>potato</mark></a> for the use of man will be estimated more highly than it has ever previously been. We are yet ignorant what new* Most gardeners in this country know very well how to obtain large <a name="potatoes538"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the seed in a single season 263 75 ]varieties may be obtained by this mode of culture, with regard to nutritionmealiness, and fine flavor, and which may yet be obtained, far superior to any thing hitherto known to us; because all the kinds hitherto known to practical farmers have degenerated very much from the seed or stock from which they were at first raised. The cases are similar with the varieties of the <a name="potato348"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and with our fruit trees. A bud or twig of an improved tree, when it is grafted on another, brings forth the fruit of both varieties of trees but when the seed is employed, only one variety is obtained; and so it is with the <a name="potato349"><mark>potato</mark></a>. During the experience of more than forty years, the author has never seen it otherwise than that the bulbs, when planted out, always produce the same varieties, both of flowers and bulbs. It never happens that a bulb having a white skin produces a bulb having a red one. The bulbs can, of course, be larger or smaller; but they always retain the character of the original variety, as well with regard to the flowers as the bulb. The latter are not the fruit of the plant, but merely s icons from it, in the form of bulb s exactly like the bulb of an improved fruit tree. The different varieties of the <a name="potato350"><mark>potato</mark></a> may be produced in the same way as the varieties of fruit trees are generated by the kerseys or stones. I t, however, sometimes happens, when <a name="potatoes539"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are cultivated in a garden, or even in afield, and are planted year after year on the same spot, that from the seed apples spring up a number of small plants at the same time that the land is next year planted with <a name="potatoes540"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. If it happens that one or more of these <a name="potato351"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants grow upon the spot where a bulb is planted, they both grow up i together, and their plant produces greater or smaller bulbs, which, under these circumstances, may very easily be overlooked. When the farmer frequently cannot perceive this, it is not to be expected that a common laborer can do so. When <a name="potatoes541"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, grown under such circumstances, are again planted out in the following year, differences are to be observed in the crop obtained, and one is apt to believe that this is owing to the degeneration of the bulb. The author has very frequently observed, that when he has sown barley or oats on a piece of land upon which <a name="potatoes542"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had grown before, and had borne seed apples, (all varieties do not yield seed apples) between the barley or oats were a number of small <a name="potato352"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants, which were not generated from the bulbs left the year before, but were produced from the seed of the seed apples. He has often taken up these plants, and transplanted them; by which means he obtained new varieties. To recur again to the outline of the <a name="potato353"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, mentioned in the commencement, in which the author considers the disease to be caused by the seed <a name="potatoes543"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being too seldom changed, through which is occasioned a weakness in the vital energy of the whole organism of the plant. As a proof of the truth of this circumstance, the following may suffice: That in the neighborhood of Hamburg, as well as also in Vol stein, there is not the slightest trace of this disease to be seen, and no complaint of it has ever been heard; the reason of this being, that, in the vicinity of Hamburg, there is always an opportunity of obtaining good seed <a name="potatoes544"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, inasmuch as a great number of vessels arrive with <a name="potatoes545"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from Holland, Eastfriesland, and the marsh districts of Hamburg. From these vessels the farmers in the neighborhood bring their seed <a name="potatoes546"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; because experience has proved that these <a name="potatoes547"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, when cultivated, generally give a better crop than those grown upon their own land f there be really no disease in the Hamburg <a name="potatoes548"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, might not some of them be easily, brought to this country for seed ?a[ 75 264 The <a name="potatoes549"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> :grown i from the seed apples d seem, also, to have a: more vigorous growth than: those which are obtained from balls, that have been used for seed for many years. In those places, therefore, where this disease exists, and where there aren of opportunities of obtaining, easily, an exchange of seed <a name="potatoes550"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from those places where it does not exist, the mode of cultivating <a name="potatoes551"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the send apples, above described, is the quickest and surest method of eradicating the disease. No. 916REMEDY For The Rot I N The <a name="potato354"><mark>Potato</mark></a>. Mr. Editor : I notice, in the November number of the Cultivator, complaints made about the "r of" in <a name="potatoes552"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I was troubled with it for many years, and, having found a remedy, give it for the benefit of your readersoThe rot in <a name="potatoes553"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this section of the country commenced about ten years ago. One third of a crop was frequently lost by it; and often, in the spring, hundreds of bushels have been thrown from the cellar quite useless. For some years past, I have used soaked lime, which I sprinkle on the <a name="potatoes554"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as soon as they are cut for seed, and shovel them over in it, and plant them immediately. Since I have adopted this plan, I haven rot lost a <a name="potato355"><mark>potato</mark></a>, either in the ground, or after they were put in the cellar and such of may neighbors as follow my example are alike fortunate, and in no way troubled with the rot. When other <a name="potatoes555"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were troubled with the rot, three varieties of mine were exempt from it, viz: the " cups" "black apple" and "red apple <a name="potatoes556"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I shall be glad if any of your correspondents can explain why they, with the same treatment, were not subject to the rot like other kinds. I find it best to plant each kind of <a name="potatoes557"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> separate; otherwise, if the seed is mixed, a few years will produce quite a different kind of <a name="potatoes558"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I have often raised seed from the <a name="potato356"><mark>potato</mark></a> balls, adopting the mode recommended in the November number. The <a name="potato357"><mark>potato</mark></a> will obtain its growth in four years; but the second year, the best variety may be selected for yield, i ill and for the table. About seven years since I raised from the ball an excellent kind of <a name="potato358"><mark>potato</mark></a>, resembling very much the " white blue nose" which I call "towards." They yield largely, and are of fine flavor, and preferred here to the (a( white blue nose f any of the above varieties of <a name="potatoes559"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are wanted in your neighborhood, I can ship them to Boston ; and if you will accept a barrel as a sample, I will forward them as you may direct. Hours, truly, Joseph Walton. Of. Andrewss, N. B., November 20, 1844. Remarkswe thank our respected correspondent for the above statement. The mode by which he has succeeded in preventing the rot in his <a name="potatoes560"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is certainly worthy of a trial by our farmers. The experiment will cost but a trifle, and 'can do no harm, if it should fail of success onlour265 [7 ]soils. A barrel of samples, of such varieties as 'or. W. may deem best, will be very acceptable. They may be shipped to Bostoirin the spring, to the care of A. D. 'helps, 124 Washington streetdibany Cultivator. No. 917ROT I N <a name="potatoes561"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. For the Salem Gazette. Having seen various communications respecting the disease that affects the" <a name="potato359"><mark>potato</mark></a>, none of which (with the exception of Mr. Teschemachersseem to be authorized by: the appearances which the diseased <a name="potato360"><mark>potato</mark></a> exhibits, I have thought it h might interest those who are examining the subject to see the following abstract from the .anna les des Sciences Naturellesof September, 1842, which is given in the Microscopic Journal for 1842,page 322. To far as I have been able to inspect the diseased <a name="potato361"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the appearances here described correspond with those I have witnessed, and generally with such as are described by Mr. Teschemacherexcept that I have not seen the extreme hardness that is mentioned, nor have I taken sufficient time to form an opinion of, the contagious character of the disease. The communication was by M. de Martins, from observations made through several years in Germany. M.: de Martins, on the dry gangrene of <a name="potatoes562"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, observed for several years past in Gernannypotatoes affected with this disease become as hard as stone, so that they may be struck with a hammer without breaking. They retain this hardness in boiling water, and resist even the action of steam that renders this affection a matter of serious importance in agriculture is the fact, that, at its commencement, it causes no trace of alteration, although, when the <a name="potatoes563"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are planted, they are no longer capable ofgerminnatingThe disease appears to have first shown itself in 1830, in several districts contiguous to the Rhine. At present, it has been observed principally in the Palatinate between Cologne and Buried, near Erfurt h; in Saxony, Mechlenburg, Boreria, and Silesian. It appeared as a true epidemic; and, like all diseases of that kind y presented many singular characters, difficult to be explained. It occurred; indifferently, on all varieties of the <a name="potato362"><mark>potato</mark></a>. In examining the gangrenous tubes which were sent to him from different parts of Germany, sufficiently distant from each other, M. de Martinsfound on all of them a minute mildew, more or less developed, to which he gave the name offusisporium sol and. His observations convinced him that the presence of this minute fungus was the cause, and not the effect, of the disease, as had been supposed by several agriculturists, and even by some distinguished botanists. His epidemic, then, of the <a name="potato363"><mark>potato</mark></a>, appears to belong to that class of diseases which are attribute able to the development of a parasitic vegetable. It bears considerable analogy with the ergot, mildew, rust, &c, and it is: to be feared that it will prove as difficult of eradication as these latter." The symptoms differ according to the degree of development of the disease. At first, the <a name="potato364"><mark>potato</mark></a> presents no external appearance of it, exceptilhgsome reticulated spots of a deeper color, caused by the partial designation of the cut ice. In a short time afterward, the <a name="potato365"><mark>potato</mark></a> becomes still more[ 75 ]a] 266 dry, and presents in the interior several portions of a blackish, livid color and there are now observe able, also, very minute portions of a whitish color, which are the rudiments of the fusisporium sol and, which appears, like any other mycelium, in the form of a ratified fibrous tissue of extremedelicacyThese rudiments of the fungus are found dispersed here and there, in greater or less abundance, in the interior of the <a name="potato366"><mark>potato</mark></a>, where its growth is extremely rapid. It penetrates the epidermis, and appears on the surface in the shape of little whitish filament out tufts, at the summits of which innumerable s po rules, or grains, are developed, which are very readily dispersed. At the same time, the <a name="potato367"><mark>potato</mark></a> becomes more and more dry, and acquires such a degree of hardness that it cannot be divided without considerable force. The interior of the tube r then resembles a species of t ruffle, and is extremely compact, the surface being studded with minute whiteprotuberances of the consistence of chalk, and which are, in fact, nothing more than the filaments of the fungus united in great numbers." If the internal structure of the <a name="potato368"><mark>potato</mark></a> be examined at this stage of the infection, the cellular tissue will be found partly dried, shrivelled, and torn, and the juices contained in the interstices of the cells altered. The feculapresents a great many granules, slightly swelled, frequently wrinkled and torn, and upon many of them will be observed extremely minute points, in the form of irregular watery excrescences, flat, articular, convex, and located, &c. These minute corpuscles are the beginnings, or prima staminaof the fungus. Should sufficient moisture be retained in the tube ra, these growths are rapidly developed, ramify, and form the parasite of which we are speaking The succession of the phenomena described may be readily followed, on placing a portion of the affected <a name="potatoes564"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in water; the mycelium then becomes elongated, and assumes the form of confer void filaments During the development of this little parasite, the <a name="potato369"><mark>potato</mark></a> loses so much of its moisture, that at last it does not contain more than 0.35, though in the healthy condition it contains 0.73, or nearly so. The fibrous part becomes of a bluish color, and is converted partly into ulm in; the mucilaginous matter is diminished, and the albumen disappears. However easy it may be to observe and trace the various changes which take place in the exterior of the <a name="potato370"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and to appreciate the more marked botany cal characters of the parasite, it is much more difficult to learn how this fungus is formed in the interior of the latter, and in what manner its propagation is effected by granules or spores, which are not seen to penetrate through the layers of the epidermis tissue to the interior of the cells, which, nevertheless, appear to be the seat of the primary development of the fungus Three different theories have, up to the present time, been proposed as to the mode in which the grains or spores of parasite hung i act when they affect another plant, in the tissue of which they may be propagated." Some authors believe that the spores penetrate into the plant through the s tomato. M. Revolt, relying upon an observation made on the granules of a puccinia, asserts that they elongated themselves in the plant. The first of these explanations considers the propagation of these hung i as a sort of dissemination; the second, as a sort of en grafting; the third theory, which is supported principally by Night and Decandolle, affirms that the sporulesof the parasite fall to the earth, whence they are introduced into the plant with the juices absorbed by the roots 267 [a[ 75 ]some granules offusisporium sol and were sprinkled on the untouched and moist surface of a healthy <a name="potato371"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which had been brought from a country where the malady had not yet appeared. A few weeks after, the epidermis showed some gangrenous spots. The <a name="potato372"><mark>potato</mark></a> withered visibly losing apart of its juices; and, after some months, the fungus was seen to come out from the interior, in the form of a white eruption. Now, as the grains of the fusisporium could not perforate the epidermis, in order to penetrate into the interior, this propagation must have been effected in some other way; and this was not, apparently, either by dissemination or en grafting t is evident that it was by an organic proceeding, which may be named' infection' since it presents the greatest analogy with the inoculation of a contagious virus. Martins presumes that the s po rule of this minute fungus exerts an action altogether peculiar upon v the cellular tissue with which it is found in contact; that it alters the juice contained in the first cell it meets with, and that it thence propagated the alteration from cell to cell, in such a way that in a very short time the juices contained in the whole tissue of the <a name="potato373"><mark>potato</mark></a> are infected and altered, so that they react on the parenchyma, which is thence morbidly changed. In this view, these juices, diffused in the interior of the plant by a sort of absorption, act there as a virus, sun generisThus, the appearance of the fungus in the interior, and afterwards on the surface of the tube r, does not depend on the development of a certain number of its s po rules penetrating into the cellular tissue, but rather on a total change effected in the juices of the plant, which have become ended with the faculty of reproducing the fungus. In this way may be explained the simultaneous ness of its production in the interior of the tube r, and the organic alteration of the latter; so that, under the influence of a foreign organism, which is opposed to it, it ceases to produce its s talks, its leaves, and new tuberaThis mode of explaining the propagation of the fungus agrees equally with microscopic observation. In <a name="potatoes565"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> affected in the first degree, minute and extremely delicate cellular productions, globular or elongated, simple or articulated, are observe able, situated close to the intercellular canals, contiguous to the epidermis; which productions present the greatest analogy with the rudiments of the fungus, which, at a more advanced period, are found dispersed in infinite number on the grains of the feu la. The admission can scarcely be avoided, that this entirely new formation is (so to say) a kind of organic deposit e, which is produced in the infected juices, and which eventually so alters the characters of the <a name="potato374"><mark>potato</mark></a>, that it presents rather the aspect of a fun go id substance, and from which the fusisporium solanisprings, and from which it protrudes as a sort of organized efflorescence." <a name="potatoes566"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> affected with this malady may be compared to a sort ofpictrafungajaWhen they are placed in circumstances unfavorable to the development of the fusisporium, the germs of which have been for some time engendered, these latter escape from them like the bolt us tube master of th epic tra fun ga ja of Naples. Fresh tufts of the minute mac echo appear in succession, and at different epochs, on the surface of the same <a name="potato375"><mark>potato</mark></a> his dry gangrene is the more formidable to the agriculturists, from the multitude of the granules produced by the fusisporium, from the ease with which they are spread, and from the long persistent vitality of the sporulesof hung i; in which long levity, it is most probable, the s po rules of this mycelium participate[ 75 268" There is also another affection of the <a name="potato376"><mark>potato</mark></a>, named l gave. le maude on Karl ze) which has been observed principally in the calcareous districts ofThuringia, in Upper Bavaria, and in Austria. It has some relation to the development of a minute, fungus, of very simple structure, of the genus of the pro o my ces. It affects chiefly the parts situated under the epidermis, and appears to be less formidable than the dry gangrene to. 101HEMP. From the Louisvillecourier. In all parts of Europe, the- greatest attention is: paid to the preparation of the ground. It is invariably ploughed three times once before winter, and twice in spring. At the last: sloughing, no more ground is ploughed up, per day, than can be followed up by sowing on the same day; as the seed falling into loose and moist ground produces, in consequence, a considerable increase in the crop. I em p, as cultivated :in Europe, requires deep sloughing. The hemp seed is selected with much care, as the good success of the crop depends much on the selection of the seed; and, it is said, seed from one and the same field can only be used for two years on the same spot. In Brittany, they procure seed from Russia; in the vicinity of Enjoy, they obtain seed from the Dauphin6; and the Dauphin6 gets its seed from Piedmont and Naples. The quantity of seed required for a certain tract of land depends on the purpose and fabric for which the hemp is intended to be used. Thinly sown seed will produce strong and coarse hemp, suitable only for the manufacture of cables and the coarsest kind of weaving. Need sown very thick will produce tall and thin hemp; the fibres of which, being soft, silk y and flexible, are fit for the manufacture of fine white linen. In theDauphin6, where the most hemp is cultivated for the manufacture of white linen, forty pounds of seed is used per acre. Biter the plants commence growing, they are carefully examined two or three times, until they reach the height of six inches. Wherever the plants appear too thick, the weak est ones are pulled up by the roots, and in such a manner as to leave the remaining ones every way two or three inches distant from each other, if it is desired to produce fibres fit for the manufacture of fine linen ; if intended to produce coarse hemp, suitable to make cab les and sail cloth, the plants are left more than twice that distance from each other. The maturity of the plant, towards fall, is watched with the greatest exactness and particular it y. The male hemp is pulled first, after the dust from the blossom ceases to fall, and the upper leaves begin to turn yellow. To secure white, soft, and silk y fibre for the spinning wheel, the male hemp is pulled. before the leaves begin to get yellow. For the purpose of spinning and weaving into fine linen, the male hemp is always preferable to the fibre of the female hemp, which is invariably coarse. About six weeks after the male plant is .pulled, the female matures, and is pulled. The male and female hemp should never be pulled together, as theyneiverripen or come to maturity at the same time, and the .two kinds cannot be rotted together 269 [a[ 75 ]when this is done, the s talks are ready for the process of immersion for the purpose of rotating, which is the most important operation in the preparation of hemp. If his process of immersion should be badly managed, the whole crop would be destroyed by it. It requires practice and experience ; but, above all, strict attention and constant examination. In France, there is a certain class of men, called masters" who follow exclusively the business of the immersion of hemp. The farmer hands to the master the hemp in bundles, as taken from the field, and pays hiimonebundle out of every thirteen. The limp is immersed, whenever it can be done, in running water. Previous to the immersion, the s talks are separated and as sorted, according to their size, length, and color; and hemp immersed at one and the same time must be of the same degree of maturity, as different stages of maturity cause a serious injury to its beauty, whiteness, and strength. It is said that the bad smell in extensive water rotating establishments does not impair the health of the people engaged in this business. The operation of breaking hemp is either done by hand, a few s talks at a time, or by an apparatus for the purpose. The operation varies in differetitcountries; and in France, the hemp, after it has passed through the brake, is spread upon a common threshing floor, and beaten with grooved blocks of wood, which clears it from the 'remaining dust and wood y particles. Hemp intended for the manufacture of fine fabrics undergoes another process, by which it is ,refined" or made so soft and flexible that it can be spun and wove into the very finest fabrics. In France and Germany, they have softening machines for hemp. It is then hack led on combs, or by a hacking machine; and if it should be required to bring it to a still higher degree of brightness, a peculiar instrument is used, termed a polisher, made out of wood or iron. Mr. He Foster has successfully introduced in Europe a machine for spinning and weaving hemp into any kind of fabric, from the coarsest to the finest. The largest quantity is consumed in the manufacture of cables, rigging, and sail cloth, for naval purposes ; but in Dauphin6 every kind of linen is fabric a ted from hemp ; and, in the vicinity of Verona, there are annually at least 20,000 pieces of linen manufactured. The average price is about 200 francs per piece; which makes 4000 000 francs. Exclusive of this, there is much table cloth woven, which is celebrated for its beauty and durability. The natives of that country having no use for linen, transport the same in great quantities to the interior of France, and from thence to the fair of Surg os, in Pain. Verona has no large man factories for linen; yet the peasants in the vicinity mostly cultivate their lands, and also weave linen. The inhabitants of the town purchase threads, and give them to be woven by the country females; and, as soon as a piece of linen is finished, it is brought to market, which is held on a fixed day of the week, and sold to a linen broker. The linen of Verona is known throughout all France; and, before it is exported, each piece is brought for inspection before the commercial committee, who testify that the linen is of hemp. It is then stamped, by a particular stamp, with these words: " While de Verona tout chancre. Verona linear of hemp, from threads Los. 35 and 40, is very little different in its appearance from n the linen made of flax. The table cloths are woven on the i machine loom of M. Her ar. Their magnificent whiteness is in comparable, and the art of perfect be aching appears to be an hereditary gift, from generation to generation[ 75] 27OThe good success and results of the culture and the manufacture of hemp occur always in parts of countries where the land is divided into small portions amongst the farmers for instance, in Dauphin6, where every family has its own patch of hemp the land for it being selected near the dwelling houses, so as to enable them to protect it better. The sloughing, and other hard work, is done by turns amongst the families alternately; as to hire laborers is difficult, on account of their scarcity, and the highness of wages. The lighter work (such as the thinning of the plant, the pulling and breaking) is all done by the members of the family amongst the females, children, and old people. The proceeds therefrom are put into a box (tire like) where the money of the treasury is kept. They spend in this way all their idle hours on the farm, without loss of time. At Enjoy, in France, the farms owned by lords are not divided as inDauphine. These lords rent out their lands to families, (their tenants who pay for the privilege to cultivate hemp. In all cases, the rent for hemp land is much higher than for any other arable lands. For instance, inAnjou, a hectare (about three acres) of good arable land for wheat will bring an annual rent of from                 $10 to                 $12 per hectare. And for hemp will bring from      $30,     $36, and     $40, and in some places more. In the valley of the Boire, where the hemp grows the best, the rent for one hectare (or three acres) of land amounts to     $80. Enjoy hemp of a good quality most resembles the Russian hemp exported from Fig a. It has been estimated that the expense of cultivating three acres of hemp in Enjoy will average, say went of three acres of the best land -150 francs. Forty loads of manure, cost 3 francs each, (2 400 pounds to the load) will answer for one crop of hemp and one crop of wheat the next year; one half the improvement, then, falls on the hemp, which is -60 "three sloughings, narrowing, levelling the ground, sowing 0 examining the plants, &c, will cost -140 The seed for three acres, thin sowing, will cost -45 "the pulling, drying, and binding in bundles -45 The immersion, or rolling process, and the breaking -150 Thus leaving a clear profit of 130 francs, for every three acres of land, to the farmer, or about    $8 an acre, clear of all expenses. The intelligent farmer of Kentucky will at once perceive that, in competing with the old countries of Europe in the culture of hemp, more than one third of all the expenses they are compelled to incur can be saved by him, as he has not the same onerous rent to pay for the land, and our soil is sufficiently fertile without much maturing. This saving to the Kentucky farmer is nearly double the clear profits realized by the Europeancultivator. These facts in regard to the culture of hemp in Europe, and the different purposes to which it is applied, are well known to those who have taken a sufficient interest in the subject to investigate it; but I have given them, in this communication, more particularly upon the authority of Mr. Butowsky, inasmuch as his report was published as an official document by order of the Russian Government; and, in consequence, its accuracy can be relied upon. To one can doubt, after a fair examination of the mode and expense of cultivating hemp in Europe, that the Unitedstates, and particularly the States of the West, can produce an article equally as superior in every respect, and at a much less cost. And when we consider the various purposes to which every quality of hemp can be271appliedwhether it is the manufacture of cables, sail cloth and rigging, coarse and fine linens, table cloths, bagging, bale rope, t wine, sewing thread, and many other things of common use and necessity no fear need be entertained of an over production. Manufacturing establishments will always spring up wherever the raw material can be obtained the cheapest; and there is no reason why the United States should not supply Europe with not only hemp for all naval purposes, but also goods of various kinds fabric a ted from that material. We can certainly produce hemp here cheaper than they can; and even, by under selling them in their own markets, we can realize to ourselves enormous profits. I shall take the liberty, before concluding this already extended communication, of quoting again from Mr. Butowsky, who, in bringing this subject before the Russian Government, says: "to neglect the cultivation of hemp, surely, would prove neglecting an inexhaustible source of riches. Suppose it should at present be managed under more substantial arrangements, (although it is already profitable would we not avoid unpleasant sensations, by hearing of the advance of other nations? The farmer, the manufacturer, and the merchant, might conduct this important branch of industry in perfect harmony, seeing the advantage thereof secured to themselves, and knowing how to take the first rank as hemp cultivates and manufacturers in Europemr. Butowsky has not said one word here that is not applicable to this country; and, as the attention of our farmers and of our General Government has been drawn to this subject, it requires no prophet to foresee that, in less than a quarter of a century, the Russians will find their most formidable competitors in the culture and fabrication of hemp on this side of theAtlanticiNo. 12HEMP. After cutting, whether with cradles or hooks, several methods of fitting hemp for the s tack are in practice among farmers; two only of which we deem worthy of notice. Against each of these there is urged a single objection only, (so far as we know) which will in due time be noticed. The more common of the two modes we design to notice is, to allow the crop to remain spread out upon the ground three or more days after cutting, binding up on the third or fourth day, while a portion of the bottom leaves are yet green; these bundles being set up in small shocks, to remain a few hours during the hot her portion of a clear day, will be ready for the s tack. The other practice is, to tie up and shock as soon as cut, opening and turning the bundles in each shock once during the process of drying. The advocates of the latter practice reject the former, because, as they allege, that portion of the crop which lies at the surface, exposed to dew and a hot sun for three or four days, loses its fair color, and becomes unfit for the finer qualities of water rotted or fair dew rotted hemp. The advocates of the former practice object to the other, because it contemplates always having so large a portion of the crop in shock as three or four days' cutting, at a stage in which it is susceptible of great injury from the rain. While we leave to each individual the exercise of a sound discretion in the choice of modes to save his crop fair, we earnestly hope no one will fail[ 75 ]a] 272 to do so. All will find it advantageous, though intending to grow only for the: bagging and rope trade. for it is well ascertained that, to render a crop most productive, and at the same time most manage able at the brake, an even rot" must be had. But this can never be the case, when, by neglect, or (as last year) by unfavorable weather, rain and dew have darkened and partially rotted a portion of the hemp lying exposed before s tacking, while the bottom portions remain unchanged. I increased production, however, we consider neither the sole nor the great reason why the grower should attempt to secure his crop fair. I increased production, without a new market, is indeed rather to be avoided than desired; seeing that the great surplus now in this country keeps both bagging and rope, and the raw material, at so low a price. It is therefore mainly because fairness in color is an indispensable condition to entering either of the markets we are about to recommend, that we urge it upon the hemp grower. We think self interest should prompt every one to aid in raising the hemp interest from its present prostration, by diverting a portion of the production into new channels of consumption. From our own personal observation, and from the oft tried experiment of a few pioneers in waterrottinghemp, we can safely say that the farmer will be able to realize, at the present low rate of hemp, from     $6.50 to .  $7 per hundred weight fo for fair, well cleaned, water rotted hemp, without hacking, from the hand brake ; and for a very superior clean article, he may expect    $8 or more. Hair dew rotted rates something below these prices. Waterrollingthis process is best performed in pools excavated near a running stream, faced with stone work or plank. The water should be let in and out of the pool, at pleasure. Nothing, as practised in such pools many of which are now in use in Kentucky we are assured, is neither expensive nor unhealthy. It is hauled from the field or s tack; put in without untying the bundles; and, when rotted, is hauled off again to some convenient place, and the bundles set up in very small shocks, or leaned against " bent the bundles being placed on each side of the bent she bundles, being thus arranged, will dry in ordinary spring or fall weather without injury. Attention should be given, lest the hemp mould in warm or wet weather. When dry, it should be secured in stacks or sheds, if not to be cleaned speedily in the brake; and there, we are assured, "lies the great obstacle to immediate success in preparing water rotted hemp. The lint being separated from the stalk by solution, ere the wood y part is rendered brittle by partial decomposition as in the ordinary dewrottingprocessa bundle of water rotted hemp in the brake is tough and elastic, like a bundle of rods; and the dry house seems absolutely necessary, in order to render the hart brittle and manage able. Practical observation will be found necessary to gain a knowledge of the business in detail. Some disappointment must be expected. We caution the novice against attempting too much. Taking, under the present imperfect state of machinery, is tedious; and he should, therefore, have only such a stock rotted as will give full employment to his brakes in winter bearing in mind the fact that, unless for some such urgent reason as giving future employment to brakes, it is better to brake as fast as one rots. Hair dew rolling his is the simplest, and perhaps, at the same time, the most profitable way of preparing the hemp crop; nothing more being required than, after s tacking the hemp, uninjured by rain, and letting it re ni ain one years barely to spread, it on grass land about t the first of December27375 j During a cold winter, the lint is separated by freezing and thawing, and the article comes to the brake as fair as the best water rotted. Erie of the peculiarities of this process a knowledge of which may prove of importance to the cultivate oris this: as the period of the completion of the rotating process approaches, red blotches will appear both on the stalk and lint, The hemp should now be watched. In short, this mode of preparing hemp varies little from the ordinary treatment of the article. The leading conditions are-one years sweating in the s tack; a grass s ward, to prevent dirt or muddy water from staining the lint; and a period of the year when there are frequent alternations of freezing and thawing. Were, again, the novice should be put upon his guard. He will perceive that the weather most favorable for breaking has been expended in rotating. Met him be prepared for a rush when the breaking commences, or let him s tack for a season of leisure. No. 103 1. Time of sowing hemp hemp is generally sown in this latitude during the month of April ; sometimes in the latter part of March; and not un frequently in the early part of May. A good deal, of course, depends upon the season, in so change able a climate as ours; but, taking one year with another, I should fix upon. the middle of April as the most eligible period for committing the seed to the earth 2. Rode of putting in the crop The ground should, if possible, be ploughed in the fall, that the winters frost may reduce the clouds perfectly. If this cannot be done, then the same result of complete pulverization must be reached by repeated deep sloughing narrowing, and rolling with a spike or smooth roller. The necessity, for this, very particular preparation, you will see explained in my communication above alluded to. When it is thus brought into thorough tilt h, and level led by the harrow, it is then sown broadcast, exactly as you do wheat; regulating the quantity to the acre by the character of the soil, taking care never to fall below one bushel and one peck, nor to exceed two bushels. When sown, plough it in with single horse " bull tongues a species of plough between the counter and shovel, free from the objections and uniting the advantages of each. Follow the ploughs with a roller. The roller is recommended for the final operation, in preference to the harrow, for two reasons: 1st, because it presses the earth to the seed, and promotes their vegetation; and 2d, because experience has taught that narrowing inclines the land to bake, if it should be followed by a heavy rain before the hemp comes up, and a crust may thus be formed which would smother many of the tender germs; whilst experience has prove n that land pressed together with a roller, and then soaked with rain, will crack and c rumble as it dries, instead of forming a hard crust 3. When matured, and how saved The crop matures in from twelve to sixteen weeks. The proper time for saving may be easily determined, though exactness in this is not so material as in most crops. When the male s talks, which bear the blossoms, begin to cast the pollen, (which will be observe able whenever the hemp at this stage is disturbed by wind, by a succession of clouds, like dust, which rise over the field) the hemp is in the best state for saving. This last process, whether it is pulled or cut, is 187 75] 274 a laborious operation, and requires strong hands. Whether the one or the, other mode is observed, it is necessary, to prevent confusion and tingling that each hand should take a through" corresponding with the length of the hemp. After it has remained upon the ground a few days, for the sap in the stall to dry out, tie it up in small bundles about the size of a small sheaf of wheat, using for this purpose the stinted s talks of hemp, which you will find in abundance throughout the field. Met it up in shocks of two or three dozen bundles each, to remain until it is entirely cured; Which you will determine by the dryness of the stalk, showing that there is an absence of all sap 4. Subsequent management Some permit it to remain in the shocks as we left it in the last paragraph; while others put it into stacks, to remain till the time for spreading it out to rot. The latter is certainly the preferable mode, though involving a great deal of additional trouble. It should be spread for rotating, on the same ground upon which it grew, about the last of October or first of November. The time required to rot it, of course, depends upon circumstances, of which every intelligent farmer will be a competent judge. Were, it ordinarily i requires several months; with you, it would require less time. To ascertain when it is sufficiently rotted, have a hand of it broken; and if the wood breaks easily, and separates readily from the lint, and the lint is strong, your hemp is well watered. Very slight experience will make you master of this. Your next step is to have the hemp set in shocks, neat and well built, with the tops so bound together as to keep them firm against winds and secure from rain. The breaking follows; and for this you should embrace all cool and dry days, as they alone are suitable for the operation. Your brakes should be made broad behind, (from 18 to 20 inches between the seats) narrow in front, and sufficiently heavy to give them steaminess; the legs of the bench to be put on with keys, instead of wedges, that they may be tightened at pleasure. The process of breaking is very simple, but it requires several years' practice before a hand is able to do what is esteemed a full days work 5. Raising and preserving see deed should be planted about the first of April; perhaps, in Carolina, three or four weeks earlier would be better. Some prefer doubling it in drills four or five feet apart; others planting in a check, the same distance with corn. Both i nodes answer well. I t should be. kept clean, and well cultivated. When it has attained a foot in height, it should, be thinned, so as to afford the plants full room to grow freely. When they have attained their growth, and the male plants have generally cast their pollen, they should be pulled or cut, leaving only a few of the fresh est scattered through the crop. His will give more room for the female plants to branch and spread, which they will continue to do until arrested by excessive droughts or frosts. When the ponds begin to open and drop the seed which sometimes precedes, but always follows, a keen frost it should be cut without delay. In the morning, when the dew is on the plant, is the most favorable time for this operation. When cut, it should be set up in loose, open shocks, to dry; which will require ten or twelve days of good weather. As the <a name="seeds38"><mark>seeds</mark></a> scatter out very easily, great care is necessary in securing them. i The 'best node I have ever tried is, to have a large tow linen sheet made and spread it at the base of the shock, upset the shock on it, and beat the heads off. Have a 275 [a[ 75 ]wagon or cart, with a close body, at hand, to convey the contents of the sheet, a sit is filled, to some place of security. When you have collected it on your barn floor, be att i with light flails, and run it through a fan in ill. The seed, when clean, should be spread over the floor, and suffered to remain for some days, until they are thoroughly dried, then put away securely in earners where the rats (who are as fond of them as of old cheese) cannot possibly get at them. If thrown into a heap immediately after they are gathered, they are liable to have their ve getting principle destroyed by heating. Need carefully managed will sometimes come up the second year, but, in nine cases out of ten, seed two years old will not ve get ate. General remarks- The yield of this crop, of course, varies like that of every other with the exception in its favor, that it is subject to fewer disasters. To land, however, should be put in hemp which is not exceedingly rich. With such land, the product will be rarely less than 600 weight to the acre, and may reach 1,000 or 1,200. If the crop is cut before the seed forms, it impoverished less than any crop known. There the crop is spread upon the land for watering, the reduction in its fertility is scarcely perceptible in a term of five years. -managed upon the foregoing plan, my crops have averaged, me between six and seven cents per pound at home, yielding me a much better profit than my tobacco, and costing me infinitely less trouble and laborlMany in the West, and some here, are abandoning the process of de trotting, and are endeavoring to water rot after the Russian mode. They are induced to do this from the fact that the Government has offered a price for the article, provided it is made suitable for naval cordage; which, if the farmers are successful in the new mode of rotating, will make it an exceedingly lucrative business. The process is simple, but requires care. I have however, as yet, no experience ii u i. I am now constructing vats, with the intention of water rotating my next crop. Should you be inclined to water rot, and desire any information, I will cheerfully communicate such as I have. The price offered by the Government is,       $280 per ton of 2,240 pounds. No. 104 in estimate of the quantity of bagging manufactured in the year 1844 throughout the Western country. In Kentucky there are 500 hand looms in operation, which manufacture an average of 400 yards each per week, or 20 000 yards per annum: total -10000000Five power loom factories at Louisville, New Albany, Cincinnati, and Days ville, produce per annum -3800000Eighty hand looms in Tennessee and North Alabama produce an average of 15,000 yards each per annum: total -1200000Fifty hand looms in Missouri produce -750000Total amount of bagging manufactured in r the West during the year 1844 -15750000The average quantity of bagging used in baling cotton is 6 yards to the[ 75 J 276 bale. Thus sufficient baling is manufactured this year to cover 2,625,000bales of cotton; which, when added to the bagging lying over unused, front the work of previous years, is from 25 to 33 per cent. more than will be required for the coming cotton crop of 1844 45, presuming it will reach the enormous amount of 2,500,000 bales. The quantity of hemp used in the manufacture of bagging is 14 pound to the yard, which will make, in 15,750,000 yards, 23,625,000 pounds of hemp; and as the quantity of bale rope manufactured bears an average proportion of 1 pound to the yard of bagging, the quantity of hemp consumed in that article will also amount to 23,625,000 pounds; making a total consumption of hemp in 1844, in the articles of bagging and rope, of 21,000 tons. The production of hemp during the years 1842, 1843, and 1844, in Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee, has greatly exceeded the demand for consumption and export; and the consequence is, that from 5,000 to 8,000tons of surplus hemp will remain in the farmers' hands un sold until next year; and this heavy surplus will greatly injure the price of the crop that will then be ready for market, unless the farmer, by water rotating his crop, opens a new outlet for it at an improved price. Russia raises, it is said 120 000 tons of hemp annually, which, owing to the mode of preparation, can be used in all naval and other purposes, where the Kentucky dew rotted hemp cannot. Russia is almost exclusively an agricultural nation; and it is with fifty millions of serfs that she is able to produce such an immense quantity of hemp and grain. In Kentucky there is land enough that can, or could, be made to produce 100,000 tons of hemp; but the difficulties with which the farmer has to contend, are first, the want of a proper knowledge of the most expeditions and economical mode of waterrottingand, second, the insufficiency of labor, which must be overcome by the invention of a machine that will brake and prepare the hemp ready for market at a much less cost, and with more expedition, than the mode now in operation by the common hand brake. There are several gentlemen, men of science, intelligence, and enterprise, who are devoting their talents and genius to those subjects; and whenever their labors are crowned with success, and these obstacles (which now for naso great a drawback to the agricultural and manufacturing wealth of Kentucky) are removed, we can, with perfect prudence, anticipate an increase in the hempen interest of this State of more than twenty fold in less than five years. This can be proved by a short statement of the facts, viz The hemp crop of Kentucky (say) is 15,000 tons, and worth     $60 per ton. This is all dew rotted. Now, had it been water rotted, it would have brought              $180 per ton, or just three times as much. The value, then, of the crop is increased by water rotating three fold; and by the substitution of machine labor in the stead of hand labor, in all the modes of preparation, at least sent or eight times as great a quantity of an article three times as valuable would be produced with the same force, and in a shorter period of time, than ein now be done. The American hemp, it point of strength of fibre, durability, and firmness of quality, can advantageously compare with the very best Russia hemp; but, it is neither prepared in the process of rotating in a proper manner, nor is it ever cleaned as well in the brake as it should be. These facts, together with an examination of the dark colored, badly rotted, and slovenly cleaned article that is often sold to the manufacturer as hemp, prove most conclusively that the culture of hemp in Kentucky is yet i its youngest infancy, and that this great staple product can 277[ 75 ]be made to yield, instead of two millions of dollars a year, at least -millions of dollars, without the out lay of a single dollar of additional expense. When this improvement in the culture and preparation of hemp shall be effected, there will be brought about with it a revolution in the manufactures of our State, that will tend even more to add to the general wealth and prosperity. I instead of consuming the best hemp in the manufacture of bagging and bale rope, fabrics so coarse and unsightly, and ill prepared, as scarcely to deserve the name, and in the manufacture of which we bring our best material in competition with the tow and refuse help of Europe instead of this, our worst tow, by the adaptation of machinery to its manufacture, might be used for making a much superior article of bagging than is now made, and our good hemp would be used in making canvass, or sail duck, ship cables, cordage, and even fine linens. What a field is here open for industry and enterprise !a! Now many millions of dollars might be added yearly to the wealth, of our State, by the mere application and employment of the means and resources nature has given us !a! But of hemp not a particle better or finer than ours, the finest fabrics are now manufactured, in France, Germany, and Great Britain. Machinery of the most perfect kind has been in successful operation for years in those countries and every kind of fabric, from the finest linen cambric to the coarse Dundee bagging, is there n manufactured, and bought by us at high prices, when we have growing at our very doors, spontaneously, as it were the very material with which we could make the same articles, and furnish them to the whole of Europe at half the price we are now paying to. 105 Rcular Of Ameri  Can Hemp. Gentlemen : We take the liberty of addressing you relative to this important staple of the West, having recently given it much of our attention, with the view of obtaining such information relative to an improved preparation, &c, as would be interesting or useful to those of our Western friends who may be engaged in growing, with a view to for warding to this market. It has been well established, that, in some of the most important requisites, hemp of American growth is intrinsic ally superior to the Russian, or any foreign production; while it possesses all, at least, in equal perfection ; and that proper care and attention in preparation is alone necessary in order to bring it to the standard, and to command the highest rates of the best imported hemp. From the large portions of the West capable of producing it to the best advantage say Kentucky, Missouri, I n diana, Ohio, and I illinois we are induced very confidently to believe that, in a few years, at farthest, not only our entire home consumption will be supplied by hemp of American growth, but that it will also form a new and very important staple in the exports of the country. Up to the present time, the receipts of water rotted hemp, of a quality suitable for tarred cordage for the navy, have been so small as to have no influence on the rates, and very tittle bearing on the large and increasing[ 75] 278 consumption of the country; though we are pleased to notice that the quantity received during the past season has been larger than that of any former year; still the demand, both for the naval and merchant service, continues to be supplied mainly by imports principally from n Russia. Russia hemp, which may be quoted as the best standard in regard to general preparation, is as sorted into first, second, and third qualities, designated "clean" out shut" and "stuff clean" according to the following requisites, viz: equality in length and color, freedom from tow and s hives, as well as to its intrinsic qualities. It is put in hands or bundles of from 12 to 15 pounds, at full length, but fastened very firmly at or near one end; and to those, especially, who may be engaged in waterrottingwe would recommend, so far as may be practicable, a similar classification, and putting into hands previous to baling. The rates for Russia hemp, during the past year, have varied but little, and have ranged from        $275 to            $200 per ton for the different qualities while Western water rotted, from various degrees in clean ness and general preparation, embrace a very wide range say                  $125 to              $195. The importance of adopting the water rotating process is, we presume, generally well understood at the present time, yet we have reason to believe that, from the want of experience, deficiency in labor, and, in some cases, natural conveniences, it will be adopted but gradually; and that much the largest portion will continue, for a time at least, to be sent forward dew rotted. It may be remarked, that, until the present season, the principal production of the West has been consumed at home, in the manufacture of rope and bagging for Southern markets; and, consequently, the very heavy receipts of dew rotted the present, as compared with former years, have met a very great degree of inexperience on the part of the manufacturers and consumers, (not only of this, but of other markets) in regard to the qualities and capabilities of Western hemp, which, with the very imperfect manner and care in preparation, has tended to reduce the rates much below its true value, as compared with foreign hemp. The most valuable harvests of Western hemp noticed the present season have raised from 4. to 5 feet in length; and we believe the error is not un frequent of supposing that a very great length is desirable. We remark, however, that a large portion received at this market has been much less valuable, from its extremely luxuriant growth, and consequently harsh qualities, being suitable for bale rope only; and we would suggest that when the soil is of such a nature as to produce too rank a growth, it should be corrected by sowing more thickly, and thereby producing a finer, and more silk y, and in ore valuable staple. The consumption of foreign, hemp at this market, of the lower grades, (say Vanilla, His al, &c) is large the rates ranging from                  $125 to                $155, and paying a duty of from          $20 to         $25 per ton, (russia and I italian,     $40;) and we have much confidence that, with proper care bestowed upon Western dew rotted, by thoroughly cleaning from tow and s hives, it will, ere long, entirely supersede the above descriptions; and we attribute the extremely low rates of the past season much less to a large production, than to the imperfect manner and care of preparation, and the careless order in which it has gene, rally been sent forward. A very large portion, especially when shipped from so great a distance as Missouri, has arrived in extremely bad order, from insecure baling; and we would urge upon shippers the importance of correcting the manner of baring 279[ 75 i and would recommend having the bales covered by a strong wrap per allowing one or both ends to remain open) and thus preserving it in comparatively good order, and at the same time affording an opportunity to have it. permanently marked. We would also notice that, contrary to general expectation, the various new purposes to which dew rotted hemp has been applied, especially for tarred cordage, and for which it has heretofore been considered entirely unsuitable, have created an improved demand and rates; and the very heavy stock recently upon i the market has been taken by the manufacturers, while the demand continues active at                 $105 to              $115, with a fair prospect of further improvement. We feel very confident, therefore, in the belief that the better knowledge and experience of our manufacturers, with the additional care which we trust may be bestowed in preparing it for market, will insure much more favorable rates for the present than the past season. We shall give a prominent share of our attention to the sale of Western hemp, and are prepared with storage peculiarly favorable for exhibiting it to the best advantage; and having a large acquaintance with manufacturers and consumers, we feel well prepared to do justice to .this very important Western staple. Very respectfully, yours. Swm. Mckee & Of, Philadelphiacurti S: & Stevenson, Bostonno. in. Flax. Paterson, December 20, 1844. Of    R: I have been favored with your letter of the 12th instant, asking my opinion ,as to where the best flax is grown tending, mainly, to remind me of a promise which I made you at Washington; with which I will proceed to comply as far as my recollection of what you require will serve. Had you, however, put your letter in the form of particular questions, I would have replied more fully than I can now do, from not precisely knowing what you desire to be informed of. Flax that is good for one purpose may hot answer. for another; but, speaking without reference to the economy of its application, I should say they would stand thus The Flemish flax is the best; I wish next; Russian, Russian, the New Work, and, lastly, all the flax, grown in this State. The Flemish is left to go to seed, and is water rotted in the curing. I wish, Russian, and Russian, are pulled when the bloom falls, and water rotted. All the American I have ever seen is left to go to seed, and is dew rotted the worst possible process for the manufacturer. When the crop is left to seed, it will make less flax. The average abroad, from their agricultural reports, will be about 600 pounds; whilst in this State, in the best districts, it will scarcely average 500. One cause of this may arise from higher cultivation, and more attention to, as well as the mode of, curing; but the great difference will arise from the different periods of pulling. To the manufacturer it is very important. The water cured flax will make a stronger thread; bear the variations of the atmosphere, the process of coloring, without injury, and bl each a clear white without much difficulty. The dew rotted flax will not make so 75 280 even or so strong a yarn; it rots if stepped in water and dried frequently, the, changes in the atmosphere easily destroying it. It is so much weakened in coloring and be aching, as to be almost unfit for use; and the difficulty and expense attending the latter process is so great, that I do not think it is ever attempted to make it white any where. I have tried it frequently, and with powerful chemical agents; it is scarcely possible to bring it to a uniform color. The quality of the flax you may form some opinion of, by knowing the relative values for manufacturing uses. The following prices were paid last season, viz :cents. For the Flemish -14 For the I wish -for the Russian 12 head -10 to do 9 head -for the Camelia, (russian) -for the American, (all sorts) -6` to 71 f you will take these prices, and carry out the product per acre, you will find that the result of the water cured would be greatly to the advantage of the grower over the dew rotted flax, including the value of his seed. The process of water rotating, I should think, would be far less troublesome, tedious, and expensive, than the dew rot, if this be attended to properly; but, as it is, our farmers spread it but on the ground, and let it take all the chances of the weather, in hot suns, rains, and winds; ;and thus the quality is so deteriorated. But if they attended to the flax, de trotting it must be every way disadvantageous, compared with the wet process; for it appears to me, in a water tank made of wood, (say the length of a board 12 feet; 6 boards or 36 inches wide, and 3 or 4 feet deep) into which place the flax, slanting the root down at an inclination of 15 or 20 degrees, then cover the whole with stones. Place the tank thus filled where the water could run in at top, and out at bottom on the opposite end. The flax could be cleaned and rotted without difficulty; for, if it was undertaken at a hot season of the year, and the process became too rapid, by taking out the plug the both the he water could be very easily changed. But I would prefer, if I were a grower, to commence rotating in October or November, (after pulling the flax in the bloom) as in those months the temperature would be better suited. It would require to be frequently examined, in all cases; and when the fibres part readily from the wood, and become slim y to the feel, it is time to remove it for drying; which could be done by standing it against a fence, or stretching two lines across a field parallel to each other, and placing your flax upright, root down, between them where, as they would be more exposed, the drying would be sooner accomplished. The different kinds of flax this year in the process, which is the first manipulation it undergoes, yielded as follows The Dutch, 37 pounds of tow to 100 pounds raw flax wasted 4.

The consumption of flax in this country is increasing every year. Since commenced manufacturing, in 1820 or 1821, there have been 12 man factories established; and there are now, I believe, only 3 in operation. The difficulty we labor under arises from foreign competition. There are little or no duties on the importation of the manufactured article, and on the raw material the duty has been oppressive; in truth, it has been an interest entirely overlooked. The duty on flax imported is now 20 dollars per ton say 1 cent per pound; all manufactures not specified 25 percent. ad valor em. The duty on flax amounts to (on Russian, the principal import) equal to nearly 20 per cent; so that the domestic article has about 5 per cent. protection against cheap capital and labor of foreign countries. The duty on bagging is so heavy, that very little is now sent forward. The duty on cat iv ass is about equal to the duty on the raw flax from which it is made. The duties on t wine are the same as on the quantity of raw material which enters into its manufacture; and so it is with the whole lint. I have often been surprised at this, as Western people are quite as much interested in the production of flax as the Southern people are in their cotton; for it is really mortifying that we should not be ex porters of the article, with such land and intelligent people as we possess. The best machine for cleaning flax is an invention of Messrs. Graves &men wick, of Buffalo, New Work. I think they tell me it costs         $250, and will clean a ton of flax in the working day. My impression is, they use it in secret have never sold it; nor do I know if they have taken out a patent there for. They clean flax, and sell it; I am often times the purchaser, and it is very good. I have no doubt any one desirous of having such a machine could obtain the pattern from them. I do not know what more ;I can say to you; but if I have left any point untouched, or not made myself understood, you can write me further, and   will answer you frankly. The navy of the United States used canvass of domestic manufacture, made minder their special direction, since the year 1819, until last year ; when, by the existing law in relation to this matter, to take the cheapest article, (being the lowest bidder) they have got intothe use of Scotch canvass, which is rejected in the British navy, except for lining, as can show you by the contracts. No. 121COTTON Beds. From the Jackson (mississippi) Southron2encourage the home market Curious calculation, showing how two entire crops of cotton in the United States may be disposed of The sub joined letter to one of our fellow townsmen, from a planter in our vicinity, is worthy of serious consideration. The greatest evil the cotton planter has to meet now, is that arising from the over production of cotton; and just so long as we continue to produce as we have done, without taking care to encourage an increased consumption of the article, this evil will not be remedied. As to the sub joined letter, we think the writer unnecessarily fearful that 75] 282 he may be considered extravagant. We can see nothing impracticable in the scheme, and we look forward, with confidence to the time when we shall learn that half the people in the United States are sleeping on cotton mat tresses, in preference to any of the. various articles now used for bedding either do we think he has enumerated more than half the advantages it possesses. In addition to those mentioned by him, we would name superior cleanliness; ver min will not abide it; there is no grease in it, as in hair or wool; it does not get stale, and acquire an unpleasant ord or, as feathers often do to eradicate which, they are sometimes put into an oven and re dried; moths do not infect it, as they do Fool; it does not pack, and become hard, as mass does; nor does it become dry, brittle, and dusty, as do straw, hay, or sucks. Besides its advantages in all these particulars, it is in many cases medicinal. For example: it is well known that raw cotton, worn t on the parts affected, is one of the best and most effectual cures for rheumatic affections: Sleeping upon it, merely, with the intervention of cotton ticking and a cotton sheet, would not prevent its medicinal action. Again: added to the great advantage over every kind of bedding (except hay or straw) mentioned by the writer of the sub joined letter, (namely, its cheapness) it is the best, most easy, and most health full bed of any. It is certainly superior. to .all, except feathers; and it possesses over feathers the advantage that it does not cause that lassitude and inertia produced by sleeping upon the latter. If any one doubts that it is one of the easiest beds he has ever slept upon, let him spend a few nights in one of the clean, nice ,comfortable beds, under the careful supervision of the tidy landlady ofSLindsey House" in, this city. They are used generally in that neat and comfortable establishment, and we, believe altogether. We have known many lodgers in them there, who, never having heard of cotton beds, supposed they had been sleeping on feathers; and not only that, but the best feathers, i to. We were deceived ourselves in the same manner; and the prejudice we are certain we should have entertained against cotton beds, had we suspected& we were to be lodged, in one, was thus overcome, and much to our surprise, when we found that we had been sleeping upon cotton. We therefore advise every one, especially all those interested in the growing of cotton, to try cotton beds, But cotton is preferable, altogether preferable, not only for the bed itself, but for the covering. To a great extent, we believe it has already been employed in what are called variously -a: comforts" and comfortable sand apt names are they to designate the article. These are nothing more than a thick layer of cotton, carded into what are called at the North "cotton bats, "between envelopes of calico or muslin. Thirty cents for the cotton, and one dollar for the calico, will make one of these "comforts" sufficient to over spread the largest bed, equal to three woollen blankets, worth four dollars and a half, and decidedly lighter and more pleasant in every respect. To our friends at the North, we say, try the cotton bedding. ,you have an advantage over us in the cheapness of the ticking and calico, and in the labor of making it; which :would more than pay :for the freight on the cotton, and make them cheaper than we can. You a would, have an advantage, also, in the quality 4 of the articles thus made, by subjecting the cotton to the operation of your machinery, which we do not possess. The cleanliness nd buoyant y of the .cotton for beds would be increased, by running it through the machine called a "picked" in your cotton factoriescid127. and. in 283 [a[ 75 carding it for the " comforts" with less trouble, and more evenly, by means of the carding machines driven by water or steam power. We are aware that there is a prejudice against such changes as we propose in articles of everyday use. We do not believe it would be an easy matter to get the effeminate occupant of 6 beds of down" and " downy pillows" to give them up in favor of so cheap a substitute as so common an article as cotton. But, by persons in moderate circumstances, and those who have use for all the: activity of which the body is capable, and still like a good comfortable bed, the superior cheapness, and the unimpaired elasticity of the frame arising from the use of cotton beds, we feel confident the proposed change will be considered of and tested. To cotton planters and cotton manufacturers we say, you are particularly called upon to give the cotton beds a trial: to the first, that everything with them depends upon an increased consumption of the article ; to the latter, that we of the cotton growing region, particularly we, of -mississippi, the largest cotton growing State in the Union, ,are .determined to sustain you. You will see, by the calculations in the following letter, how very much you may assist us in disposing of the surplus of our crops for several years to come; while, as we confidently believe, you will -be benefiting yourselves, and adding to the comforts of hundreds of thousands. Snear Jackson, October 11, 1844."DEAR Of    R: In a casual conversation with you a few days since, upon the subject of our great staple cotton its present and probable continued depreciation in price, the gloomy prospects of the cotton planter, and other subjects connected therewith, we fully agreed that its over production was the principal cause of its present low price; and that, unless some new source for its consumption could be found, the planter had nothing to expect but its continued ruinous depression. The article of cotton, like all other productions of labor, is governed in its price by that general law of commerce, demand and supply. In our conversation, I mentioned one source of consumption which is now little used, and which, if believed in and adopted by the American people, will add very much to the consumption of the raw material, and consequently cause an increase in its price. I mean its use for bedding. You wished my views up op the subject, in writing, which I now send you. Receive them for what they are worth, and nothing more. Of     set out with the proposition that cotton is the cheapest, most comfortable, and most healthy material for bedding, that is known to the civilized, world. In making this broad and bold assertion, I know I subject, myself to the imputation of extravagance and presumption. But there is no truer maxim in practical life than the quaint old one, that 'the proof of the. pudding is in the chewing of the bag' That it is the cheapest, I submit the following calculation, or statement, for the correctness of which I appeal to every reasonable and practical man. I will first state, however, that the materials which are generally used by the civilized world for bedding are the following, viz: hair, wool, feathers, moss, sucks, straw, or hay." The most costly is hair; next in value is wool; next, feathers; next, sucks, (when properly prepared) next, moss; and last, straw or hay have not the means of ascertaining, with any degree of certainty, the relative quantities of the different materials above mentiqpedthat are used in the United States for the purposes of bedding. 75 ]a] 284 hand you a statement of the cost of a bed, or mattress, made of the different materials have mentioned; and also the cost of a good mattress a price at which they can be made, and furnish a reasonable profit to the maker. If there is any reason or truth in the calculations I have made, you will readily perceive the immense consumption of the raw material it will lead to. New sources for the consumption of cotton are being discovered every day. I to peculiar adaptation for uniting with other fabric s such as silk, flax, wool, &chas added much to its consumption for the last few years. Very avenue should be opened, and every encouragement should be given, to new sources that may be opened to increase its consumption; for in that consists the safety of the Southern planter." Statement." Most of a hair mattress They are generally sold by the pound, and cost from 50 to 75 cents per lb; 30 or 40 lbs. will cost               $15 or           $20 .a." Fool 30 lbs. of wool, at 30 cents per lb,  $9 ; 12 yards of ticking, at 12- cents per yard,             $1.50; labor, thread, &c,       $2.75-total              $13.25." Feathers 40 lbs. of feathers, at 30 cents per lb,                 $12; 15 yards of ticking, at 12 i cents per yard,             $1.87 ; labor, &c,       $2.75--total               $16.62-." Loss mattress, ready made,                 $12; shock do,                 $12.":The labor of properly preparing the sucks constitutes its main cost, and which cannot be done for less than the above price, and all materials furnished. Scotton30 lbs. of cotton, at 8 cents per lb,       $2.40; 12 yards of ticking, at 12- cents per yard,             $1.50; labor, thread, &c,       $2.75-total     $6.65."I say nothing of straw or hay, as they are but little used." You thus see at a glance the relative cost of a bed or mattress made of the different materials. In point of cheapness, the cotton is far preferable ;in durability it is equal, if not superior, to any of them. Six years' use of them convinces me of the facts to the next branch of my bold assertion their comfort and healthinessI am, you know, as fond of a comfortable bed as any one. Myself and family have used them for the last six years, and we prefer them to either hair or wool for both winter and summer. Any of our acquaintances about Jackson have used them for several years; and to them I appeal for the correctness of my assertion Before I close my letter, permit me to indulge in a speculation of the probable effect the universal use of raw cotton for bedding, if adopted by the people of the United States, would have upon its production The United States at this time is supposed to have 20,000,000 of inhabitants. It is fair to presume that, upon an average, it requires a bed for every three persons. This, then, would give (say) in round numbers 7000 000 beds or mat tresses. To make that number, then, at 30 lbs. to the mattress, it will take 210,000,000 lbs. of cotton, which, at 400 lbs. to the bale, gives 5,200,000-more than two of the largest crops of cotton ever raised in the United States." But it is not by any means to be expected that the people of the Unitedstates would at once dispense with the beds, which they have at present in use. I am not fully informed at what periods, or length of time, bedding made of hair, wool, and other materials mentioned, have to be laid aside, and their place supplied by the same, or materials of a different sort. Some persons think -years, according to the value and durability of the materials of which they are made. I have not the means of ascertaining 285 but, if the cotton grower can succeed in convincing the people at large of the correctness of these views, it must inevitably lead to a gradual substitution of raw cotton, to the exclusion, in a great degree, of other materials for bedding. The annual amount consumed will depend upon the confidence in the cheapness, comfort, and health i ness of the article While I am speculating on this subject, indulge me in another. Suppose Europe, which now consumes four fifths of our raw cotton, should embrace these views, and substitute it as an article of bedding: imagination could hardly conceive, and arithmetic could hardly calculate, the amount it would take to supply the demand But I tire your patience ; I will close. It is an interesting subject to the planter. I could write a homely upon it (and a sensible one, too, I think) as long as a modern political dissertation upon the tariff' I claim no merit for the originality of these views or suggestions. Public attention was called to this subject several years since, in a series of numbers published in the ' Clinton Gazette' and attributed to the pen of our worthy countryman, Dr. W. W. New if correctly, I know not hours, respectfully, For an interesting article on cotton seed, as affording oil, by J. Hamiltoacooper, Esq, but received too late for insertion here, see appendix No. 42.]No. 122 Verpool Cotton Market Of 1844. From a late Liverpool paper. In addition to the information given in another column, we annex the following from the circular of a highly respectable house engaged in the cotton trade, at this port: "assuming the quantity held in the interior to be the same as at this period last year, the consumption will be found to have increased about 9 50 bales weekly. Their it is considered that this increase has taken place in a year, in which the transition from the spinning of coarse to finer numbers of yarn has been very general, which tends to limit the consumption of cotton, no stronger proof, if the fact itself were not sufficiently notorious, could be a deduced of the advance made in the spinning and manufacturing departments of trade, and the consequent prosperity of these great branches of national industry." To recapitulate the events of the past year has always been one of the objects of our periodical circular; but, on the present occasion, they are of so simple a character as hardly to present any thing beyond the mere record of disappointed hopes and expectations." In January the sales of cotton were of vast magnitude, averaging weekly upwards of 70,000 bales; and of this amount, speculators took more than one half. It was the supposed confirmation of shortness in the coming supply that led to such enormous transactions; and, as a consequence, to an advance upon prices which had already risen 30 per cent from the lowest of an additional to. per lb. The month of February (after the we el terminating on the 3d when the sales were 109,526 bales, or 8,600more than the memorable week in 1825, the largest week previously known was much less animated that n January; but the receipts in the American i[ 75, ]a] 286 ports having, by the advices, fallen off o00ooo bales from the corresponding period of the preceding year, holders still felt great confidence. I n the face of a decided indisposition on the part of spinners to hold stock at the current rates, and in spite of the efforts making publicly and privately to counteract the advance here, no other cry but that of short crop seemed to be listened to; though it ought to be observed that in New Work, where parties are proverb i ally sanguine, when advices were received there of English consumers being unwilling, notwithstanding their good trade, to pay an increased speculative price for cotton, or even the advance already established and were combining together, not merely to prevent the market from going higher, but to effect a reduction, by working short time, and, using up their stocks an unfavorable effect was instantly produced and became the first cause of arresting the operations of American speculators, and inducing the ni to pause. Were the consequence of the same information was hardly perceptible; and it was not until about the middle of the month of March that the strong excitement began to diminish. The packet which arrived on the 14th gave the first serious blow to the expectations of the holders. The receipts into the ports were much larger than had been anticipated; and this fact, not only much alarmed the timid, but began to stagger the n most incredulously. Speculators soon became frightened, and, resolving in many instances to sell, they rushed out of the market with considerable precipitate on. Prices, as a consequence, gave way before the end of the month, .d. to d. per lb; and even at, this reduction there was no facility in making extensive sales. The feeling throughout the month of April continued unfavorable to holders; and although the accounts from india were universally of a most encouraging description, prices again felld. to I d. per lb. But the middle of the month of May was the period which finally dis abused the most confident; when, by the packet of the 1st, the receipts into the ports had already exceeded 1,750,000 hales. His amount had been hitherto looked upon by. many as nearly the maximum of crop. It now became a matter of certainty that it was not even the minimum; and 2,000,000 bales were soon regarded as much nearer the probable result" It was now that the market lost all its previous comparative steaminess. I i vain did some persons reason upon, the excellence of trade, the abstract low ness of prices, the impossibility of continuing to import cotton at the existing low rates, and upon the unfavorable appearances (just then beginning to be alluded to in the American letters) of the coming crop; buyers looked at nothing but the present stock and the expected supply; all other arguments were thrown into the shade, and proved unavailing to induce the trade to make a single purchase beyond what was immediately requiredAPrices, as was natural in such a state of discouragement, continued to give way, and the quotations were reduced during the month id. to -d. per lb. In June this further depression led to a slight, but only temporary reactionrThe fears of those who had supposed the crop might even exceed two millions of bales, began, in some degree, to subside ;and symptoms of reviving activity on the part of, speculators again were manifested. Spinners, also, who, by their long withdrawal from the market, appeared nearly exhausted their purchases having averaged, for a period of three months, only 18o000bales weekly, against 25,000 bales for the preceding three months) now became buyers; but the arrivals were so great as again to occasion fresh uncertainty, and to operate as a complete counterpoise to other favorable ten 287 [75 agencies. 277,500 bales were imported in the first fortnight; and 378,000bales in the whole of the month. In July, the advices from the States, of drought in some districts, and foundations in others, slightly improved the prospects of holders; and, looking again forward to another coming crop, they imagined they saw in the distance a repetition of the events of the previous year. This feeling, and the good state of trade, combined to sustain the market partially; but the weight of stock, (which amounted to one million of bales, two thirds being American) and the pressure that it necessarily occasioned: were considerations too powerful to be resisted. In August, the bad effects were more and more visible. The state of trade remained good, but the stock was so large as to be almost unmanageable. It is true that reports of damage done to the crop were in circulation, the result of injury from worm and cater pillar; but a deaf ear in general was turned to these, and to all other accounts of a like nature. Holders (particularly the speculative portions) began to doubt the propriety of resisting any longer the power of general opinion, and many were now tempted to realize their losses. September was, from the urgency of the like motives, if possible, more dull than August ; and October again was equally un promising. The previous advices of injury done were then said to have been exaggerated, and that the evil had been repaired; and, in addition, the season was stated to be unusually early. November in no degree improved the chances of holders; and during the early part of the present month, the desire to sell rather increased than diminished. In vain have accounts been looked for by each succeeding packet, of diminution of estimates; but this has not yet taken place, although the belief that such will be the case, and that the crop will not exceed 2,200,000 bales, has led during the last three weeks to large and important transactions, and to an advance in price of fully id. per pound. The steamer of the 16th brings nothing new The fall in price from the beginning of October (when the quotations for fair cotton were as low as in June, 1843 the period of the greatest depression ever before known) until the late revival of demand, has bee id. per pound, or twelve per cent; a fact that can only be accounted for, at a period when money was abundant, by the general discouragement which the great losses of the season had mainly contributed to produce. Now these losses have occurred is very obvious. At the close of last year, few believed the crop as likely to exceed 1,800,000 bales; several thought 1,600,000 not an improbable result. The idea of 2,030,000 bales, which turns out to be the truth, was hardly once entertained. Very known event seemed, for a ong time, more and more to confirm the opinion of short crop; but the premises proved fallacious. It is difficult to imagine, after this, that either sellers or buyers can, for some time at least, place any confidence in the estimates transmitted. It may be that it is impossible, on the one hand, over so large a surface of country as is now planted with cotton, to calculate exactly upon the production; and, on the other, to ascertain what quantity remains over in the planters' hands from one crop to not her; or, it may be that injury is only relative, and that what is serious at one time of year, at another is easily repaired. Even the receipts ii to the ports seem to afford no sure criterion; for the rivers being high or low, may diminish or increase the quantity of cotton brought to market. In short, experience has shown so many supposed accurate tests to be ut i certain, that, for the future, estimates will be valued at little; and it is not improbable that, having reposed our faith upon them, and been disappointed one year, we may in another fall into the[ 75 ]a] 288 opposite extreme, and disregard all suppositions, when they are really entitled to credit. Even last year, the crop might possibly have been (as was reported) small, had only ordinary circumstances occurred; but the advancing rates at the close of the season induced the picking of at least 100,000 bales extra; which, judging from the very great inferiority of quality, would never have been gathered, but left to rot upon the ground, had it ever been contemplated that such description would be sold, as it has been, from 21d. to 31d. per pound. It is plain that high prices tend to make a large crop, and low prices a small one; and this principle applied to the present position of the United States may lead to such a result, hereafter, as may cause us to deplored the unremunerating prices which have been paid, and to look back upon the late heavy fall as ultimately not so undeservedly beneficial to the spinning interests of Great Britain as many now deem it to be. Of     n conclusion, one circumstance in reference to the future prospects of cotton, though not bearing very immediately upon the subject, should not be passed over in silence; and that is, the change which has taken place this year in the system of the Bank of England. I to charter has been renewed upon certain conditions; and the one which may have the greatest influence upon markets generally, is the limitation of its paper circulation to fourteen millions, upon security, and to an amount not exceeding the gold and silver it holds in its c offers. Now, though the moment may never arrive when the quantity of specie should be so reduced as to curtail the circulation to little more than the amount named, and upon which only bank notes can be issued; yet, as there is no power by which, in such a crisis, a remedy could be found, all persons contracting engagements ought to be impressed with the tendency of the change, and to bear in mind that the nature of the restriction upon the Bank of England is to make money dear and merchandise cheap. But, with this and all other circumstances duly weighed, there is still nothing in the future that is calculated to generate alarm; and whilst the state of trade continues to be as favorable as it is and there is every reason to suppose that the commercial operations now going on are based upon the most solid foundation) it seems not un reason ;able to suppose that cotton presents one of the most eligible objects of investment, and, as such, will continue to attract the attention of capitalists throughout the next year. It is not likely that, at the present rates, any loss can arise; whilst, if the least adverse occurrences were to arise as to the coming crop, an unprecedented advance would not be impossible. Upon the prospects of this, it seems, after past experience, useless to speculateand yet the whole question resolves itself into one of supply. However ridiculous the assumption of 2,600,000 to 2,700,000 bales may appear l still the very mention of such an amount has not been without producing some pre judicial effect. Such an assertion has had its believers, real or pretended. It is clearly so much the interest of the numerous parties who resort to the States as buyers for European account, to signify the crop in the first instance, so as to depress the American markets, that it ought not to be a matter of surprise that a willing ear is given to any statement, in the beginning of the season, which points to a large growth. If the crop should reach any thing like 2,500,000, or 2,400,000, or perhaps even 2,300,000bales, there can be no great hope at present for the market, provided shipments in proportion come regularly forward ; for, though the consumption is increasing, and will become still larger, if the total consumption of the world in American cotton is 2,250,000 bales, even at this rate it would 289 [a[ 75 ]require the revolution of another season, and that an unfavorable one, to bring about a great or decided change But it ought not to be forgotten that the planter may keep back his supply, and that finally he may change his object of cultivation from one description of produce to another; it being und enable that, without adequate return, he cannot pursue his natural calling. It is true that slave labor is said to be in a different position from free, and to present a difficulty to a certain extent. But the question is only one of degree ; and the same reasoning eventually must apply to all cases. If cotton cannot be grown to pay at the present rates, it is assuredly certain it will not be raised; and, in spite of: every argument to the contrary, it is hardly possible to suppose that, at five cents, (which, according to the existing quotations, will be the price of the average of the crop) planters will be induced either to grow or to sell. The future is involved in doubt; but the preponderance of the reasoning is in favor of cotton, and the evidence of this is daily manifested in increasing confidence and extensive sales to. 13NORTHAMPT6ON, Hampshi   Of County, Mass. Dear Of    R: The favorable notice of silk culture in document No. 109,from the Patent Office report of February, 1843, is my apology for presenting the enclosed samples of paper, made of mulberry foliage and bark. Unfortunately, the external cut ice of the bark had not been removed; producing the spots, but does not injure the paper for the use intended, which was for the purpose of depositing silk worms' eggs upon something dark and this being un bleached, is considered adapted to the habits of the silkworm, and is now in successful experiment. The four samples are all of one batch; the dark est, having more of the outside cut ice, was most buoyant, rose to the top, and came off first. A quantity of genuine Wanton foliage, which retains its verdure in greater perfection and later than any other mulberry, is gathered, dried, and sent to the mill for making paper, bleached, without spots, fit for cotton paper, as hoped; and, if successful, I shall take pleasure in sending you a sample, to be preserved with the enclosed. I began, some ten or eleven years since, to bring silk culture into notice among the members of the Hampshire Agricultural Society, believing that if we tried the right kind of trees, (such as used in China) we could raise silk, yet could not afford to pay             $1 per tree, as then asked for multicaulisnotreflecting how easily they could be propagated by cuttings and layers. Under this view of the subject, I wrote to the Rev. E. C. Bridgman, missionary at Wanton, China, a native of Hampshire county, with the request that he would procure and forward me some mulberry seed of the most approved kind for growing in China, for the use of members of the agricultural society. He promptly attended to the request; the seed was forwarded, and sown in the spring of 1834 or .1835. It grew finely, and developed a splendid leaf. About two years since, while Dr. Parker, with a China man, was here on a visit, on being shown the Wanton foliage, it was readily recognised. As the trees had grown here very luxuriantly, and developed a larger leaf 19 75 ]a] 290 than in China, Dr. Parker suggested that our soil might be more congenial to the plant than even China, its native soil. Soon after receiving the seed from Wanton, a friend sent me another parcel from the south of Asia, with high commendations, that if it would grow here, it would be of essential benefit to the -united States for raising silk. It succeeded well, and is more hardy than the white mulberry, very productive in small branches, and a good sized leaf. I named the latter Asiaticcanton. These two kinds are highly approved of for feeding silk worms the Wanton for leaf feeding, and the Asiatic for branch feeding. I have, however, almost every variety which was propagated during the mulberryspeculationcovering, altogether, some ten or twelve acres, besides a large number of young Wanton and Asiatic needlings of this years sowing, from seed of my own raising, to enlarge the plantations. A few days since, the Rev, William Richards, of the Sandwich I s lands, with the young prince, called on me. At a former visit, I had supplied him with Wanton mulberry seed, silk worms' eggs, and dry mulberry foliage to use in case the eggs should hat ch on the passage ; but they did not watch until his arrival home. About the same time, other eggs had been received there from China; but the cochons raised from them were not one quarter as large as the American, and must have required some 10,000 to 12,000 to make a pound of silk, while in America2400 to 3,000 would make a pound. Mr. 'it comb, also a silk grower in one of the islands, having the American and Chinese, crossed them ; but the crossing produced cochons so small as to require from 5,000 to 6,000 to make a pound of silk, while not over 3000 of the American would be required to do the same thing. M'. Richards was shown several pamphlets, newspapers, cap and writing paper, supposed to have been made of mulberry bark. He said rags were not used in I india, China, or the islands, for making paper, but they always make it of some vegetable leaf; that the bark was too valuable for that, and was used to make fabrics. He, as Americans, have the appropriate soil and climate for the Wanton and Asiatic mulberry, with the pea nut variety of worms, which, being managed with due care and attention, together with the skill, ingenuity, and perseverance of Ametricansand, in addition, could we have the aid of our country to encourage new beginnerswe might hope to compete with any nation in the production of silk, their cheap labor and cheap living to the contrary notwithstanding. There is abundant evidence that worms fed exclusively on the Wanton mulberry have been larger, and produced heaviercocoons, by one third in size of worms and weight of cochons, than by other feed. I have supplied an order of the pea nut variety of eggs, to go to Guatemala, Central America; and Wanton seed, of my own raising, t go to Rio, South America; and now have an order for a number of the genuine Wanton mulberry trees, roots, or cuttings, to go to Him a, South America, where the applicant went on business, a few years since, taking with him a fewmulticaules, at       $2 each now multiplied to 50,000; who, without any practical knowledge of raising trees, reeling and manufacturing silk, or having seen a silk worm or re el until he introduced them in 1843, has now present ted me with beautiful samples of f loss cochons, reeled and sewing silk, done by ladies as a diversion, without any assistance, and very little instruction from him. The silk is of good quality. Samples had been sent by a mercantile house in Him a to England, for an opinion of the quality; but no return had been received when he came away. He has come to this 291 [75 ]place with a native Spaniard, to obtain more perfect information in all the branches of reeling, twisting, coloring c; to procure machinery, with a view of enlarging operations, so that he might turn off twenty-five pounds per day of sewings, cords, brains, &c. He represents the climate and soil as adapted to the culture of silk, and could feed every month in the year; that the necessaryes of living are procured with but little labor; that the laboring population are indolent, the wealthy classes too proud to labor. He feels encouraged of success, and that he can introduce habits of industry by silk culture, that would counteract their natural indolence; and he will inform me of his success in due time, that maybe more interesting than speculations upon what he intends doing. He has engaged several to perfect themselves in reeling c, to accompany him when he returns to Him a with his machinery. He has become so satisfied with the superiority of the genuine Wanton mulberry, that he has engaged to take it on with him for propagation and use. I have letters from widely distant locations, rendering favorable accounts of this years success in growing silk, and in corroboration of the prevalent opinion that the silk cause will finally prevail, and become of great national importance. I have several letters on this subject-one from a gentleman presiding over one of our most ancient and eminent literary institutions, under date of June, 1844. His coursing about the culture of silk, he writes as follows: "If this earnest waking up to a scientific and practical consideration of the subject be not soon crowned with signal success, it will not be for want of enterprise or skill in our countrymen, but merely from the high price of labor here, compared with the scanty wages given in other silk growing countries. Even this consideration, though it n may retard for awhile the complete success of this department of productive industry, will not prevent its ultimate triumph. Another gentleman, under date of August, 1844, writes from the fares t, that the soil and climate of the Western and Southwestern States are admirably suited to the growth of the mulberry and raising silk worms, and that eventually the two great staples of the Western and Southwesternstates will be silk and wool. It is the opinion of competent skilful silk manufacturers, who have made critical experiments upon the On gee silk so called) of foreign make, by tests which they consider satisfactory and decisive, that it is only a vegetable production, and that the material was never operated upon by the silk worm. There can be no reasonable doubt about the ultimate success of silk culture in some future years; but to accelerate that desirable event, which may constitute an important American staple for revenue, (which might not only enrich the Government, but reward the labor of personal enterprise) a bounty is deemed necessary to stimulate and encourage that portion of the agricultural population whose circumstances or health shall disqualify them for the more laborious exercises of the fields, to commence operations upon a new and untried crop. Our extensive imports of raw and manufactured silks are encouraged by us as consumers, instead of being producers. We now contribute to support foreign enterprise and industry, to produce the article of silk, which we might, with proper encouragement, raise ourselves, not only for our own consumption, but for exportation. Very respectfully, yours, &c. S: .a.  Dani Of Stebbi Of, Hiryr I a >ELLswoRTrH, Esqcommissioner of Patents 29 2 to. 132CULTURE Of Of    Of. From the American Agriculturists. As requested, I forward you a sketch of Mr. Hills cradle for feeding worms, and the following account of the culture of silk Side view of feeding cradle. Transverse view of feeding cradle. I have five patches of mulberry, (in all, ten or twelve acres) two pa feels of which you have seen. The one adjoining my garden, by estimation, may furnish foliage sufficient for a million and a half of worms. Themulberries consist of the white, black, al pine, brows a, more t ta, a lata, multicaulis, Asiatic, and large leaf Wanton. The two latter I prefer for my own use the Wanton for early feeding with foliage, and the Asiatic for branch feeding. The Wanton is highly approved of for producing heavy and firm cochons, which, by competent testimony and experiments, have been found in favor of the Wanton feed as five to eight, and is the true species used by the Chinese, as testified by a resident missionary, the Rev. E. C. Bridgman, and more recently by Dr. Parker, while on his late visit to the United States. I consider the pea nut variety of worms the best for producing the most silk of a good quality. From an elevated plat near my cocoonery, you had a view of our extensive meadows spread out at the foot of Count Holyoke. My cocooneryyou have examined, with its fixtures for feeding silk worms the mode of open feeding, ventilator, and ventilation g cradles. Since you left, the whole has been completed, with ham locks suspended over the cradles, easily put in motion, and so constructed that no off al can drop into the cradles beneath, nor interfere with the rocking motion or winding; the arrangement is much admired, and estimated to accommodate half a million of worms, or more, to be fed at a time. About half of the cocoonery has hur does oflattice work, covered in part with gauze getting four feet wide and four- -of in . 293[ 75 tiers in height. The cocoonery is supposed to be sufficiently open on the sides, ends, and roof, to admit a free circulation of pure air. The flooring is the natural earth. The past winter has been uncommonly severe on grape vines, fruit, and, forest and mulberry trees; the Asiatic I found the most hardy of any other, and the Wanton the earliest in foliage. In the 2 1st and 22d of May were severe frosts, destroying garden vegetables, and injuring some early mulberry foliage; ice was formed in many places. The accounts from Vermont and New Hampshire are so disastrous as to delay early feeding while in Sort hampton, June 14, at one of my plantations, you saw silkworms in the act of winding, and others in good forward ness. In the day of your departure, I received a letter from a distant silk grower, a stanch promoter of the one early and open crop system, that, on account of the un propitious season and condition of his trees, he would delay fetching out his worms until the last of June, and then make his great effort upon one crop. To provide against premature watching of silk worms, or the disaster of an early frost, it is advisable to have foliage gathered and dried the year preceding; which, being pulverized and moistened with water, may be given the worms until new foliage appears; and the worms will eat it freely. To obtain the most and best foliage of the mulberry, it will be necessary every spring to cut or head them down within three or four inches of the ground, and preserve the s talks for bark silk. I have a quantity of them saved, and bark peeled from the large Asiatics, to be used for making bark silk, and a quantity of mulberry leaves saved for making paper. The whole process has not yet been carried out with either, but has been successfully done in France, as testified by M. Frassinet. I am endeavoring to have it demonstrated here, by subjecting both stalk and peeled bark to the operation of steaming with soap and water, to facilitate the separation of the bark from the wood, and the outside cut ice from the fibrous substance of the bark, before trying the operation of the brake for dressing, carding, spinning, &c. Should it prove successful, it will be made public. Hopes are entertained that what has been done may be done again; that Yankee ingenuity and perseverance may prove a match for foreign cheap labor. The present time has been called the age of invention and improvement. But if there is nothing new under the sun; and if what is, has been and may be again, then we may hope to be benefited by the reproduction of astonishing results in all coming time; and even now, while there has been anxious inquiry for some easy mode to separate the bark of the mulberryfrom the wood, an historical fact has been recently communicated, by which, some two hundred and forty years ago, in the year 1600, an accident occurred, which resulted in the manufacture of a handsome fabric from the fibrous bark of the mulberry, with the inference that the bark had been previously used for the manufacture of cordage, on account of the superior strength of the fibrous bark over that of other materials used for cordage. Under date of June 6, 1844, I have been favored with a letter from the president of one of the most ancient and eminent literary institutions of our country, who expresses his opinion of the progress of silk culture as follows: " I am gratified to find a renewed and more general interest excited at the present time. If this a waking up to a scientific and practical consideration of the subject is not soon crowned with signal success, I am satis294fled it will not be for want of enterprise or skill in our countrymen, but merely from the high price of labor, compared with the scanty wages given in other silk growing countries. Even this consideration, though it may retard for a while the complete success of this department of productive industry, will not prevent its ultimate triumph The above is the opinion of one of the most scientific men of the age, and who, in early life, was himself a silk grower. His opinion accords with that of many others of high consideration in the United States. While viewing the flourishing condition of one of my mulberry patches you asked with what it had been manured ?a? and received for answer, ashes and the deciduous foliage. The foliage, you thought, could be gathered for making paper, and answered, that there would be sufficient defective foliage left to manure the land; the foliage is richer than any stable manure, and stable manure should never be applied to the mulberry. I have not had occasion the last five or six years to use even ashes as a manure, but keep the land in good tilt h by frequent hoping. If you found thesemulberries more flourishing than others you had seen, it may be attributed, in a great measure, to frequent hoping, and dressing with the delayed mulberry foliage. The soil is a light sandy loam; and, previous to its being stocked withmulberry, would not yield the value of                 $10 in any crop; and now, my fee der says, if his worms do well, he hopes to take      $800 for the crop !a! Part of this lot being stocked with al pine, brows a, and Asiatic mulberry, of 6 to 10 feet in height, in rows 3 feet apart; and having grown so vigorously as to shade each other, and liable to have spotted leaves to avoid this and procure more, larger, and better foliage, I have cut away or headed down every other row, within three or four inches of the ground; and from the stumps have sprung up a multitude of thrifty sprouts, now fit for use, and the leaves three times larger than the leaves on the standard trees so fresh and tender, that it is hoped, in some measure, that they may answer the purpose of needling foliage, so highly recommended by M. Frassinet, who has the following en corium on needling foliage : that 100 pounds of such foliage is worth near 200 pounds of old leaves to make the same quantity of cochons; in fact, worth nearly double the quantity of other foliage. I have caused considerable bark to be stripped from the Asiatic trees cut away for manufacturing purposes; and M. Rouviere, of Lyons, has proved that the bark of young shoots, submitted to the same process as hemp, yields abundant silk fibre to make beautiful tissues. I should advise silk growers to preserve the shoots, have them barked in the best way, and the silk y fibre rotted, carded, spun, and wove. M. Rouviere asserts that it will be not only fine and strong, but take the most beautiful colors. Of the bark, ropes and nets are made in the More a, and may be used with great advantage in the manufacture of paper, together with the foliage. The Wanton and Asiatic seed sown this year are in a flourishing condition for plantation use, exclusive of several mulberry plantations which will be for rent, or growing silk on shares, next spring. Up to the first of July, worms have been uncommonly healthy the probable effect of more open ventilation than in former years. Mr. Cab ney, consul at May al, (now in Boston) has two millions of worms at present on feed. S. Hit marsh, at Jamaica, has 360 of what he calls c realized native eggs, in constant feed, which go through the whole course to the cochon in 24 days. The eggs hat ch in 10 days after 295 [a[ 75 ]being laid. He has received the silk report, and made such improvement as to save, in all, nine tenths of the usual labor. The silk cause at Jamaica occasions great interest in England for its prosperity and success. D. Stebbi Of. Northampton, Mass, July 1844. No. 14. Method Of Manufacturi  Of Sugar. New Orleans, December 30, 1844 6 received in due time your favor of December 9, 1844. In answer, I reply by a sketch of my remarks concerning the portion of the crop already made on Dark woods plantation. Before the apparatus was ready to work, Dark wood made by the common process 130,000 pounds, at an average rate of 1,620 pounds per acre. It was sold at 4- cents the pound. The market was then 1 cent higher than it is now. It would not now be worth more than 34 cents. From each thousand pounds of sugar, they obtained 70 gallons of molasses, and burned 3 cords of wood, including the fuel which supplies the steam engine. Since the new apparatus worked, Dark wood made at a daily rate of 12,000to 18,000 lbs. within twenty-four hours 500 000 pounds at an average rate of 2,750 pounds per acre. The sugar being of two different qualities, in the following proportions: the four fifths of the first (say 2,200 pounds sold up to this date at 6 cents, and the remaining fifth (say 550 pounds sold for 4 i cents. For each thousand pounds of sugar they obtained only 14 gallons of molasses, and burned 1 cord of wood, including the supply of the steam engine. They employed the refuse cane alone. Molasses in both cases has been sold at 18 cents the gallon. Berwick & One, the as signers of the apparatus and process of which     am the patentee and inventor, may ascertain the following: 1st. An increase of 40 per cent. in the quantity of sugar obtained from the cane. 2d. An increase of 50 per cent, in the price. 3d. A saving of two thirds of the fuel. From the above, it may be easily perceived that the advantages of this new process are such as to double the revenue of a plantation. The saving of fuel and sufficiency of the refuse cane to make the crop is a question not only of the greatest importance for the planter, but also highly deserving the attention of the whole State of Louisiana. There are today many plantations where the whole of the wood is cut and consumed, and where, the owners are unable to make any more sugar on account of the deficiency of fuel. There is also an immense extent of lands, and the richest of the State, which would never be applied to the cultivation of the sugar cane, on account of a total absence of wood. Such difficulties are remedied if the refuse cane is sufficient. Berwick & One have determined to construct three different sizes of the apparatus, (los. 1,2, and 3,) sufficient to make 6,00O, 12,000, and 18,000pounds of sugar within twenty-four hours, with cane juice at an average density of 8. The prices are such that a planter may cover his expenses by the increased value of his first crop, and without any direct out lay[ 75 296 to mineral agent but lime has been employed for clarifying. It shows at once that the advantageous results obtained grow entirely out of the apparatus itself. It worked well, in the most satisfactory manner, and without interruption. It has been managed by four hands only. The sugar is dry, free of molasses, and ready to be shipped, and reach uninjured the Northern ports of the United States, and sustain there the competition of Porto Rico and West I india produce. I am unable to come now to a more specific conclusion; but I shall endeavor to send, within a fortnight, to Mr. Ellsworth, a complete and correct statement of the full trial made by Dark wood. I hope to be ready in proper time for its admit dance in the annual report. This statement will be followed by some comparative remarks about Desraness process going on in the island of Cuba. I do not wish to see any particulars of the process itself printed this year. I claim publication only for the results obtained. I ought to be careful against infringements. Hours, Norbert Of  Elli Eux. Dr. Flei Schman. No. 151MAPLE Sugar. Sugar has been manufactured in New Hampshire ever since its settlement. The first settlers, however, were more immediately engaged in the lumber trade, and made that business their main support for nearly a century; but, on leaving the tide waters, where the tall pine in all its beauty mostly had been manufactured into lumber for the West I india market, their attention was directed to the manufacture of map le sugar. But this was so little understood, and necessity so drove them for support, that, in order to extract the juice from the tree, an incision was made with an axe in the tree, of about 3 inches deep, and from 6 to 12 inches wide, which soon encircled the tree, and, together with the wind, soon destroyed one of the most beautiful and useful trees of New Hampshire. This done, sugar making fell off in a ratio almost to its total extinction, and so continued until what we call the second growth of map le trees grew up of sufficient size for extracting the juice; since which, the manufacture of map le sugar has been slowly improving, so that within a few years it has begun to assume a systematic course, which promises the most happy results. Sugar is now made to some extent. One circumstance I will mention. In the town of London, near the centre of the State, 35 tons of sugar have been manufactured for several years past (to average it) from the map le tree. This statement is not exaggerated; some individuals have made a ton in a season. The process is all simple, and easy to be performed. One incision is made with an anger about three inches in the tree, into which is introduced a plug with a hole in the centre, through which the juice passes to its end, under which a clean bucket is placed, and fastened to the tree by a nail driven into the tree no rain or snow being suffered to be mixed with the juice. When necessary, the juice is collected and put in a reservoir in 297 [a[ 75 ]the building, where it is elaborated in iron boilers seton arches, and passed out of the boilers as soon as it can conveniently be done; this becomes necessary, as being kept long in the boilers would dis color it, and affect the flavor. When a sufficient quantity has been- obtained by the above process, it is first cleared by adding milk about four quarts to twenty-five pounds of sugar; then strained, and again heated and s dimmed until all appearance of s cum has disappeared; it is slowly boiled until it granulares, being cautious to prevent over heating it. It is then put in fir king, the bottoms of which are perforated with holes, with several sticks passing through the fir king, serving as conductors to lead off the molasses ; the tops covered tight, so as to exclude the air. In this situation it must remain about six months before fit for use. A gentleman who made the last season 1,500 pounds of sugar (a sample of which I enclose you) from 250 trees, informs me it was the most profitable farming business he did for the year; the whole expense, after the fixtures were prepared, not exceeding sixty days' work, which will give 25 pounds to each days labor, or       $2.50 per day, at the price for which it sells. I have used some of the sugar in my family; it does not dis color the tea in the least ; is clearer than muscovy do, Jamaica, or Havana, white or brown, and has less sediment. I must observe that few towns equal London; and perhaps in more than half the towns in the State very little is made. I am happy to observe, however, that the quantity is yearly increasing, and the quality improving. Respectfully, yours, Jeremi Of Of Lson. No. 152RUTLAND, New York, December 22, 1844. Of     : Your favor of December 4th was duly received, and I am happy to inform you, as far as I am able, what you desire to know of the process by which I made that sugar of which you have seen a small sample. First, the plan and manner of tapping the trees in this town is very nearly the same; that is, with a half inch or five-eighths anger, and a s pile inserted in the hole, and a pine tub to catch the sap from each tree. I gather my sap to one large reservoir once in 24 hours; then it is boiled each day to sir up, which is about half the sweetness of molasses; it is then taken out and strained through a flannel cloth, and put into a tub or barrel to cool and settle for 12 hours use a sheet iron pan set in an arch of brick; the pan is made of Russia iron, eight feet long, four feet wide, and six inches deep, it is then taken out, and I am careful not to move the bottom where it has settled, and place it in a kettle, and heat it to 98 degrees. I then add for 100 pounds) the whites of four eggs, two quarts of milk, and one ounce of saleratusthe eggs well beat up, and the sale rates well dissolved and stir the whole well together in the sir up ; and when the s cum has all risen, it is to be taken off, and be sure it does not boil before you have done swimming it, When it is boiled until it is done, which you will know by dropping some into water ; which, if done, will form a wax. It then must be taken from the kettle, and placed in tin pans to cool and form the grain and, as soon as the grain is sufficiently formed, I then pour it into tunnel shaped boxes to drain, and, after 24 hours, I place a flannel cloth on the top[ 75] 298 and take the plug from the bottom, and let it drain. The flannel cloth I keep wet from day to day. The sample which you have seen was done in this way, with the addition of being repeated after once draining. Should you wish for further information, or a more extensive sample, please send me word to that effect, and it will be cheerfully given. You will please accept of my thanks for your kindness. Hours, &c. Moses Eames. On . H . Ellsworth. No. 153EXHI   Of Of Of Of Maple Sugar I N New York. The samples of map le sugar surpassed any thing of the kind we have seen; they were as white as loaf sugar. We have samples before us. The process of clarifying this sugar having been communicated to us, and it being both new and important, we give it to our readers. The liquor is strained, and put into sheet iron pans under a stone arch, and boiled. I to three gallons of sir up stir half a pint of milk and the white of two eggs then place it in a sheet iron pan on a stove until it boils. Train and boil it until it will grain; and then let it stand about six hours before it is drained. This drain is made with four pieces of board, converging to a point; the molasses drains off at the bottom ; a wet flannel cloth is kept on the sugar three days. This is the recipe by which the young lady (MissWhite, of Delaware county, New Work) perfects the process of clarification. No. 161CORNSTALK Sugar. Now Harmony, I Ndi  Ana, November 19, 1844. Of    R: You having deemed my communication to the I n diana Statesman worthy a place in your last report to Congress, I am induced to send you some account of my experiment this year in the manufacture of corns talk sugar. As I have but little to add to my last years statement on the growtlrand manufacture, I shall confine myself principally to a comparison of the product and expense with that of raising corn, our great staple production. Having hut a small farm, and being desirous only of making sugar sufficient for my own use, my experiments will not compete with others who have gone more extensively into the business; but, as regards the results, they are perhaps, in most respects, as conclusive as any other. Should any statement, however, be sent to you more satisfactory, you can cast this aside. I planted this year three-fourths of an acre, the land being hillside, and subject to wash. The soil was thin and light, and the crop of s talks was by no means a good one. There were 33 rows in the piece, the average of which yielded 14 lbs. to the row of the crystal liable :sir up. This will give for an acre 616 lbs; and, as I am still inclined to believe that it yielded two thirds 299 [a[ 75 sugar and one third n molasses, (perhaps more sugar, as I have no means of proving this accurately at present) I think it would be fair to estimate it at 5 cents per lb, which would give for the acre      $30.80. Side by side, in the same field, I had corn. This yielded about 50 bushels to the acre; and estimating this at 16 cents per bushel, its value here in the crib, it would give for the corn    $8. The cultivation of each, up to the time of pulling off the ears, is the same: the pulling off the ears I will offset by the pulling off of the corn. I will now endeavor to estimate the expense of getting the s talks and manufacturing the sugar, and de duct this from the amount above stated and, after de ducting the expense for hushing the corn, compare the resultsBlading, cutting, and getting s talks to mill -a-             $1.00One man 11 days, at 50 cents per day -5 50 Horse hauling 2 days, at 25 cents per day -50 Grinding: man and horse 52 days, at 75 cents per day -4 124 Boiling 11 days, at 50 cents per day -5 50 duel: 2 cords of wood, at             $1 per cord -2 00 interest and repairs on fixtures -3 00 21 622Value of sir up -30 80Nett value -9 17 Balance of corn -8 00Husking corn: one man, two days -1 00 7 00 Balance in favor of sugar experiment -2 17. It will be seen, by a reference to the statement of Mr. Tillotson in your last report, that the cost for blazing, grinding, &c, (without allowing anything for interest and repairs) was, for four acres,     $31, or  $7.75 per acre. His allowance for the man, per day, is the same; for the horse, 50 cents. For the horse I have only allowed 25 cents. Throwing out the item for interest, and it would leave the expense per acre              $17.62---more than double the amount of Mr. Tillotsons calculation; showing how much the expense might be reduced on a large scale, and where they have the experience and convenient fixtures. It will also be seen, by a reference to Mr. Tillotsons statement, that his product was 200 gallons of the sir up for the four acres, or 50 gallons per acre. By dividing my 616 pounds by 12 pounds, (the weight of the gallon of sir up) it will be seen that my yield was over 51 gallons per acre. I now propose taking a brief review of the other statements contained in your last report, with such observations on their practices, or my own, as may occur to me. Mr. Summer, of Richmond, never could get the thermometer to rise higher than 226. We never found any difficulty on this head, except in one instance in last years experiment, when, on examination, it was four into be burnt on. the bottom of the kettle; and this was believed to be the cause. In that instance, it would not rise more than 230; at all other times, fee had no difficulty in raising the heat to 236 or 238.[ 75 ]a] 300 The next statement is Mr. Deadericks, of Tennessee. Mr. D. found difficulties in crystal ligation, and thinks that "the age of the s talks most congenial to the granulating process is when the corn is just becoming too hard for the purpose of cooking." I should think that leaving the ears on this long would be fatal to the richness of the juice, and also probably soto the granulation. I have had no difficulty with the crystal ligation; it commences in from twelve to forty-eight hours after the boiling has ceased, and the result is somewhere between two thirds and three-fourths sugar. The next is Mr. Adamss. Mr. A., after stating his success and his difficulties, sums up by saying that there are some four or five things that need to be made clear and well established, before complete success will attend our efforts 1st. The first is the clarifying the juice. I am of the opinion that the lime is not necessary, and perhaps not useful, in the clarification. We have found no difficulty on this head, after a little experience; the only thing that is necessary is to take care to skin off all the impure ties as they rise to the surface, before it commences boiling. Should the boiling commence before this is completed, a little of the cold juice thrown in will restore it to its original state, and the process can easily be continued till it is perfectly clear. The lime, I believe, is only necessary to neutralise the acid 2d. Some means by which crystal ligation may be more sure and perfect. As I have observed before, I have had no difficulty on this head, and am inclined to believe that there would be none if the boiling is sufficiently rapid, and the temperature raised to 2 370 or 2380.3d. The third is noticed in my remarks on the second 4th. Training or removing the molasses from the grained sugar. I, like or. Adams, have found difficulty here; and can say, with him, when the crystals are well formed, the whole mass seems to be of an adhesive gum my nature, that renders it strongly rete native of its molasses 5th. A corns talk taste to the sugar. The sample sent you is just as the molasses has drained from it. My opinion is, not that it has a corns talk taste, but a slightly acid taste; and I think, if it was freed from its molasses, the sugar would not have this taste; the molasses, though clear, and not so dark colored as the Louisiana molasses, has more of this acid taste. Now, it will be seen that the only difficulties with me are the drainage and this acid. Probably the same means will at once remove both these difficulties. Time is perhaps the neutralise r of this acid, and its only use in its manufacture. As I have said before, I do not deem it of any use in the clarification; and, moreover, I have been told that many of the boilers of cane juice do not put in the lime till after the juice is clarifyed; thereby showing that it is only used as a neutralise r, and the error has most likely been hitherto in not using a sufficient quantity. I used double the quantity this year that I did the year before, with but very little difference in the result; but I used the clear lime water, or simply what the water itself would take up; and I find, on inquiry, that. this is a very small portion. Unless some one throws some additional light on this subject, I shall use it in future in another form, and larger quantity. There is nothing in Mr. Humphreys communication but what has been already noticed in the preceding remarks, except that I deem all straining sand stoppings to let it settle, after it has once gone to the fire, as not only useless, but detrimental to the process. Some gentlemen speak of pans for the evaporation, five or six inches 301 [a[ 75 ]deep. I cannot conceive how it can be boiled with sufficient rapidity in such shallow vessels. I should think they ought to be double or treble the depth. I am told the cane sugar boilers build up brick work around the tops of their kettles to a considerable height, to prevent the liquor from flowing over. It has been suggested, that pulling off the tassels would be a better mode and secure the object in view more easily than pulling off the ears. I made, this year, an experiment to test this; and am satisfied that it cannot be done to any practicable extent. I planted in my garden, about the 15th June, a small patch of corn. I planted it thus late, to insure its not being impregnated by any corn in the neighborhood. As soon as the tassels began to show, they were carefully cut off; and this was done, from day to day, as long as any appeared. In examination, it was found that there was scarcely an ear but had some grains on it, and most of them were from one-fourth to three-fourths filled. I suppose that in one night one tassel might do considerable damage, and thus render all daily care abortive, and totally impracticable for a large piece. It has also been suggested, that the fodder that is stripped from the s talks would, in some measure, compensate for the operation. Unless the land is sufficiently rich without, I think it would be better to give it to the land. I threw mine into the furrow, and, as soon as I had done, I ploughed a furrow each way on to it, and left it to rot. This will account for my not having made an item of it in the comparison between corn and sugar. There remains but one thing more to notice, and I have done; that is, the proper time to use the s talks. I have not had as much experience on this subject as I could wish. My principal experience, I should say, has been with s talks rather late. The first that ever I tried (in 1841 a small quantity) was with young s talks : the sir up had grained sugar in it. The same year, some was pressed from s talks grown after the 1st of July: this, also, had grained sugar in it. Both these had somewhat of a corns talk taste; though this might arise from its not being properly treated in the first steps of boiling. My two last years, as I have already observed, have been late. Of the last I shall now speak. A severe drought in August hurried on my s talks to maturity before I was ready, and I began to be apprehensive that I should lose them. Having no one but myself and wife, who managed the boiling, it took us twelve days, as we could only press and boil every other day; but the juice and the yield was as good on the last day as on the first, and I believe that it might have been begun a week (or perhaps two) earlier, and continued the same time later, without making any material difference; thus showing that no critical period, as some have suggested, is necessary. I perhaps owe some apology to the gentlemen on whose communications 1 have remarked. I can only say that it has been done with a view to arrive at correct conclusions on this subject; and I trust, if they find anything in mine that does not agree with their own experience, they will make equally free remarks. And if they or others have arrived at any conclusions that have escaped me, I shall also be glad to hear it. Respectfully, John Beal. On. Of   L. Ellsworth[ 75 ]a] 302 to. 162CORNSTALK Sugar And Molasses. To the Editors of the Tennessee State Agriculturists. Athens, November 28, 1844. Gentlemen: Believing that the manufacture of corns talk sugar and molasses is forthwith susceptible of being made a matter of the greatest importance, it is deemed expedient to enter into details that perhaps will be considered unnecessarily minute by some who are not yet a p prized of its great value. For it is certainly true, that, if the necessary care and attention be not bestowed on the whole process, from the first to the last, an inferior article will be the consequence, and which may induce the experimental ist to abandon the business in despair and disgust. Dear before last, having met with the essay of Ebb on our subject, it was concluded to give this new project a trial, sufficient to enable me to determine whether or not it was capable of being made an object worthy of serious attention. The result was decidedly favorable: and accordingly, last year, a more efficient apparatus was provided, with the intention of making a sufficient quantity of sugar and molasses to exempt me from the necessity of purchasing those articles no inconsiderable affair, where a large family has to be supplied, at a cost of 12 i cents per pound for the first, and             $1 per gallon for the last named article, especially in a part of the country where money is so scarce that it requires profound sagacity, deeply laid and successful strata gem, and vigorous exertion, to obtain a sufficiency to enable one to live decently, and to pay all their dues at a proper time. The object proposed was, to a great extent, realized; but not being a p prized of the quantity that would be necessary to last a whole year, it turned out that we had not made quite enough; our stock becoming exhausted about the middle of April, and from that tim until the latter part of July it becoming necessary to resume the purchasing of sugar. During the last season, however, an ample supply has been made rather over 100 gallon s equivalent to a hogs head of sugar. This quantity could have been extended to eight or ten barrels, if a sufficient supply of stalls had been provided ; for, by planting the corn at various times, the molasses season can be prolonged from the middle of July to the middle of October. Your or five other mills were in operation in this region during the past summer, at which were variously made from 10 to 60 gallons. Now, what has been accomplished by a few individuals can be done by every farmer in the State; and if this should prove to be the case, it is evident that no trivial revolution in its commercial transactions would be the result. Assuredly it is as absurd and unnecessary for a farmer to purchase sugar and molasses, as it would be to import his soft soap, candles, or any other article of ordinary domestic production. The mill should be made with three rollers, at least 20 inches in diameter, and 26 inches long, 4 inches above the cogs, (the cogs 4 inches wide) and 18 inches below the cogs; the neck sought to be about 3 inches long and 6 inches in diameter, with a smooth iron band fitted on, to prevent their wearing. The stem of the middle roller should be 12 or 13 inches in diameter, and 5 or 6 feet long; the neck to be received in a corresponding hole in a transverse beam, resting on two posts about 25 feet asunder. This arrangement will cause the mill to run more equally than if there was no support above. There should also be 303 [a[ 75 some contrivance of keys and wedges, with which to adjust the outside to the middle roller. This, however, must be left to the ingenuity of the builder of the mill, as it cannot easily be made intelligible on paper. For the sake of convenience, it may be proper to assign to the corn stalk two stages in its growth, as the most suitable for making molasses and sugar, to wit: 1st. When just in roasting oars. 2d. When it has passed out of roasting ear stage, and become too hard for cooking, and thence to the commencement of fodder pulling. The sir up made from the s talks during the first or roasting ear stage, if boiled moderately thick, will very much resemble honey, both in appearance and taste. In the second stage, (which     consider, on the whole, the proper one) or when the corn has become too hard for cooking, the sir up will more nearly resemble that made from the sugar cane, and is the age of the stalk at which the sir up is most disposed to grand late. As you approach fodder pulling time, the molasses will become darker, and not so agreeable to the taste. In the first, or roasting ear stage, it requires 10 gallons of juice to make 1 gallon of sir up. In the second stage, or two weeks later, 8 gallons will do the same. One hundred moderately large s talks will make one gallon of sir up, boiled to the point of granulation ; that is, when, on taking a small portion (as warm as it can be borne) between the thumb and fore finger, it can be drawn into a thread a a inch or an inch and a half long. One gallon of such sir up is equivalent to ten pounds of brown sugar, for any of the purposes for which that article is commonly used. Talks from which the ears have been pulled in the embryo state will afford one-fourth more sir up than will those on which the ears have been permitted to arrive at their full growth. Small s talks will yield about the same quantity of juice as large ones; that is, the product of a given weight of either will be about the same. Large s talks, however, are preferable to small ones, as it requires nearly as much time to strip and prepare for the mill- the latter as the former. As regards the speedy granulation of sir up, the same difficulties have been experienced as heretofore." It is, however, satisfactorily ascertained that, if properly made, and placed in shallow vessels, and in a moderately warm situation, it will grand late, if sufficient time be allowed it for that purpose. Last season a small portion was set aside, and five months elapsed before the crystal ligation was completed; leaving, however, little or no molasses. At present, I have parcels which, since last August, have been slowly undergoing the process some of them now ready for draining ; and doubtless, in a few weeks more, the whole will be completed. My apparatus for boiling consists of a large iron kettle, and also one of copper, made from the lower part of a second hand still, the noble being removed, and the aperture closed by a piece of copper riveted on it; an iron band, nearly an inch wide, surrounds the top, and riveted; the edge of the copper being turned over it, a broad lip is formed in front, for the convenience of pouring out the sir up; two ears are welded on the band, in an opposite direction, with holes in them to receive two large rings, for the purpose of lifting it off the furnace; there ought, also, to be one behind, This kettle is about 3 feet in diameter, and nearly 1 in depth, and holds about 35 gallons, and answers amiably, as the boiling can be finished in it about one third of the time that is required in one of the ordinary depth. A shallow swimmer* It is evident that super abundant mucin age in the juice prevents the speedy granulation of the sir up; and it is hoped more mature experience will remove this and every other obstacle to complete success, 75 ]a] 304 of tin, about eight inches by six, with holes in the bottom and rounding at the end, fixed in a wooden handle, will be found far. more convenient for swimming than the lad le in common use. It will expedite the business if the fodder be stripped off the s talks the evening previous to the morning when they are intended to be cut ; and afterwards the whole of the sheaths or sucks, as they are called) about the joints must be carefully removed, and s talks perfectly clean. It is all important that the juice be pressed out and set to boiling as speedily as possible after the s talks are cut. Not more than two hours should elapse before this is done; for if the s talks are permitted to lie, or the juice to stand longer than the time mentioned, ferment at ion will commence, and infallible injure the quality of the molasses. As soon as a sufficient quantity of juice is received from the mill, it should be allowed to stand a few minutes for the coarser particles to subside, and then strained through a coarse cloth, and a table spoonfuls and a half of clear lime water added to each gallon of juice, and then poured into the kettle, and carefully watched and s dimmed during the whole process of boiling. When iron pots or kettles are used, it is absolutely necessary that they be entirely free from rust, as the smallest portion of this would impart a dark color and ferruginous taste to the sir up, and also a dusky hue to coffee, when used in that way. With the fixtures above mentioned, and one horse, we made seven or eight gallons per day; but, being in no hurry, generally ceased grinding about four o clock in the afternoon, in order to finish boiling before night. By using two horses, or extending the operations to some time after dark, ten gallons daily could have been easily made. The molasses thus produced has over and again been pronounced, by numerous persons who have par taken of it, to be superior to the imported article; all, without exception, were fond of it; whilst among them were several who reject the use of cane molasses altogether. It may not be amiss here to repeat a remark made in a former communication, to wit: that, when intended to be used in coffee, the preferable and most convenient mode will be to mix it with the coffee when first made, and boil all together. It is probable that the influence of prejudice will, for some time, prevent a general substitution of corns talk sugar and molasses for the corresponding article of Louisiana and the West I n dies; for there is something repulsive in the idea that a product of common corn stalk (an article with which we have been so familiar from our infancy) should come in competition with a similar one of the far famed sugar cane, that comes from so great a distance, and costs so much. In view of the foregoing facts, it appears every way reasonable to believe that, before another year rolls round, a sufficient quantity of sugar and molasses can be made to supply our own wants in that respect. Yes, if every farmer in four or five of our most populous counties would each make only three or four barrels, it would probably amount to a greater quantity than is annually imported into the State. But will this be done ?I t may well be doubted; for it is a melancholy truth, that, with few exceptions, there does not appear to exist among the farmers of Tennessee especially those of Last Tennessee) a much greater amount of agricultural and manufacturing intelligence, enterprised and industry, to one might reasonably expect to find in a colony of free negroes. Of Lli Of H. Deaderi  Of. P, S, Persons desirous of further information on this subject can find 305 several interesting communications in relation to it in the last report of or. Ellsworth, Commissioner of Patents, amply confirming every thing I have advanced. I need, without this additional testimony, I should not have written a 8 confidently as I have done, lest, otherwise, I might perchance be honored with the suspicion of being an enthusiast on the subject. W. H. D. No. 163WASHI   Ngton, October 18, 1844. Of    R: I now do myself the pleasure to comply with your request, respecting the manufacture of sugar from the juice of the corn stalk. You say that the liquor extracted from corn s talks gives plenty of sac charing juice, and of a quality nearly equal to that of the cane; but parties experimenting upon it have not been successful in granulating it. This is not infrequently the case in new districts where the cane has been introduced, and often perplexed some of the old and experienced sugar boilers; but, on mature examination and inquiry, the difficulty has invariably been found to be in the evaporation; and I have no hesitation in saying that such is the case in this instance. In reference to my former letter, (in January last) you will find that I have detailed to you the method as now practised in the West I n dies and Brazils, and, I presume, is similar to the one followed in other sugar countries. You will perceive that I am an advocate for the vacuum pans as the means of evaporation ; they not only have established their superiority over all other methods, but they produce a superior quality, as well as an increase in quantity. As you appear to take considerable interest in this matter, I shall be happy in giving you the use of my filter, as well as my personal attendance, provided a small vacuum pan is used. I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant, John Watson. On. H. L. Ellsworthi  . No. 164BosToN, January 12, 1845. Dear In: I received your letter, and your last years report, and also the sample of corns talk sugar. I now write to say that I gave the sample of sugar to my friend Richard You le, jr, and requested him to make an analysis of it, and to send me the results. He has done so; and I now enclose his letter for you, which please make such use of as may answer your purpose. I had formed the opinion that the sac charing matter existed in two different states in the corn stalk, dependent on the degree of ripe ness of the plant; which opinion the researches of Mr. You le have proved to be correct. The s talks he analyzed last autumn were not ripe enough to give cane or crystal liable sugar. Hence none was obtained, and only close or grape sugar was found in the expressed juice 20[ 75 ]a] 306 consider this discovery one of great practical importance; for it hot only serves to explain the numerous failures :in a king corn sugar, but also indicates that great care must be take to cut the s talks at the right degree of ripe 1 ness, or when cane sugar is formed. I : e have arranged matters so that next summer we can test this question; and . Or; You le. ill continue his researches and experiments on a crop of corn, which will be under his control, so that he may not again be disappointed by the carelessness of the farmers, as he was last year by the cutting up the crop he had reserved for researches. We ought to have experiments made on 'all the different varieties of corn, so as to be able to select the most profitable for the sugar culture. The subject is of sufficient importance to come under the patronage of Congress; for if corns talk sugar can be made profit ably, it will be a matter of no small importance to the Western States. I s it not desirable to make some experiments on the sugar in the dried corn s talks? It appears to me that much of the mucilaginous matter maybe got rid of, by al loving the s talks to dry; and then, by grinding or chopping them up, we might dissolve out the crystallized sugar, and leave much of the foreign matters. This method has been used in France in separating be et sugar. It will have the advantage of allowing the farmer to suspend his sugar making until winter, when he has more leisure. The s talks should be dried as rapidly as possible, to avoid ferment at ion. The best way would be, to cut out the joints, and to dry the split shafts of the s talks in an oven, or by dry warm air, in a room heated by a stove. It may also be important that researches be made to ascertain whether it is possible, by a cheap method, to convert grape into a crystal liable or cane sugar. We know it is one of the most simple experiments, readily performed by the chemist, to convert linen fibre into grape sugar, so that from a pound of rags he can make more than a pound of sugar. He can also readily convert starch into grape sugar by similar processes. Now, is it not possible to carry the process further, and to change the grape sugar into cane sugar Most respectfully, your obedient servant, Charles T.. Jackson. On. Henry L. Ellsworth. No. 165EAST Bosowso January 10, 1845. Uda Of    K: I have had time to make only a partial examination of the specie in o 'f iomrstalk sugar which you were iso kind as to send- me a few days since; but this was in reference to what is most important to be known about itrnaely: the amount uncrystalhibable sugar 'which itnfeains, as compared 'with saw 'sugar produced from the cane. To a scar ain this po in .ma de use f What is called the copper test, or 307 [a[ 7 ]a pot as sic solution of t art rate of copper, which has the remarkable property of yielding a precipitate of pro t oxide of copper to a boiling solution of grape sugar, while it remains entirely unaffected by a similar solution of crystal liable or pure cane sugar. To that, from the quantity ofprotoxide precipitated when the test is added to boiling solutions of any two samples of sugar, we may judge of their relative value. For the purpose of comparison in the present instance, I selected some Cuba sugar of the same external appearance, in respect of color and granular texture, as that of the sample you sent. I brought both to the same degree of dryness, as near as could be ascertained, and then weighed out 50 grains from each parcel. These two portions were dissolved in separate capsules, with a large proportion of water, and heated to the boiling point. At this stage, the test was added. A precipitate was immediately produced in each of the capsules. These were allowed to stand at rest over night, and the next day the super incumbent solutions were carefully decanter. The precipitate s were afterwards repeatedly washed with hot water, till all traces of foreign matters were removed, when they were put into the drying stove of ourrefinery. When perfectly dry, the capsules, with their contents, were weighed; and after washing out the latter, the capsules were replaced in the scale. The difference of weight in each case was, of course, that of the precipitate; and was found to be exactly two grains for both samples. I conclude, therefore, that this specimen of corns talk sugar is quite equal in value to Cuba sugar of the same shade of color. It would appear, from the reports of many experiments made on the juice of corn s talks, that while, in some cases, it has been made to crystallized with considerable facility, in the greater number of cases it has either yielded no crystals at all, or has been brought to a state of concrete on, rather than crystal ligation. I am of opinion that these different results l are to be ascribed to the fact that the s talks which afforded the juices used in these several trials were in different states as respects ripe ness. It is probable that, at one period in the growth of the stalk, all the sac charing matter which it contains is nothing but grape sugar, and that this passes gradually to the state of cane sugar during the progressive development of the plant. I f, therefore, the stalk is cut too early, no degree of care in clarifying and boiling the juice will enable the operator to bring it to a crystal line state. It is important, too, I imagine, that all the s talks should be sufficiently ripe ; for if any considerable quantity should be below the proper degree of ripe ness, their juice, when mingled and boiled with that of the s talks which have reached that degree, will act as a leave n in re converting to grape sugar the crystal liable sugar of the latter. The great desideratum, then, in this chatter of corns talk sugar, I believe, to be to ascertain, more precisely than has yet been done, what is the most suitable treatment for the s talks in the successive periods of their growth, and when is the best time to cut them. That good sugar can be made from corn s talks, there is no doubt; but there is as little doubt that good sugar a is not always, and not often, produced from them when the attempt is made. Met some one tell Of how the experiment may always: he successful, and then we s ha be better prepared to 75 ]a] 308 decide whether it will be an economical use of a portion of our soil to devote it to the culture of corn s talks for this purpose. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Of  Chard Soule, J. Dr. Charles T. Jackson. No. 17. Sugar Of <a name="potatoes567"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, Grapes, And Starch. From Dr. Tres Dictionary. About two years ago, a sample of sweet mucilaginous liquid was sent to me, for analysis, by the honorable the commissioners of customs. I twas part of a quantity imported in cases at Full from Rotterdam. It was called by the importers " vegetable juice." I found it to be imperfectlysaccharified starch, or feu la; and, on my reporting it as such, it was admitted at a moderate rate of duty. Three months since, I received a sample of a similar liquid from the importer at Full, with a request that I would examine it chemically. Heir formed me that an importation just made by him of 30 cases of it had been detained, by order of the excise, till the sugar duty of 25s. per cut of solid matter it contained was paid upon it. It was of specific gravity 1 362, and contained 80 per cent. of illsaccharified feu la. In the interval between the first importation and the second, an act of Parliament had been obtained for placing every kind of sugar, from whatever material it was formed, under the provisions of the "' be et root sugar bill." As the saccharometer tables (subservience to the laying of the excise duties under this act) were constructed by me, at the request of the president of the board of trade, I well knew that 50 per cent. of the sir up of the be et root was deduced as a waste product, because be et root molasses is too crude an article for the use of man. Well saccharifiedstarch paste, however, constitutes a sir up poor, indeed, in sweetness, when compared with cane sir up, or that of the be et root; but then it does not spontaneously black en into molasses by evaporation, as solutions of ordinary sugar never fail to do when they are concentrated even with great care. Hence the residual y sir ups of saccharified feu la may all be worked up into a tolerably white granular mass, which, being crushed, is used by greedy grocers to mix with their dark brown bastard sugars, to improve their color. It is only within two years that sugar has been in this country manufactured from <a name="potato377"><mark>potato</mark></a> starch to any extent, though it has long been an object of commercial enterprise in France, Belgium, and Holland, where the large coarse <a name="potatoes568"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are used for this purpose. The raw material must be very cheap there, as well as the labor; for <a name="potato378"><mark>potato</mark></a> starch, or flour, for conversion into sugar, has been imported from the continent into this country in large quantities, and sold in London at the low price of 10s. pere it. The process usually followed by the <a name="potato379"><mark>potato</mark></a> sugar makers, is, to mix 100 g allons of boiling water with every 112 lbs. of the result, and 2 lbs. of the strongest sulphuric acid. This mixture is boiled about 12 hours in a large sat made of white deal, having pipes laid along the bottom, which are con 309 [a[ 75 necked with a high pressure steam boiler. After being thus saccharified, the acid liquid is neutralised with chalk, filtered, and then elaborated to the density of about 1.300 at the boiling temperature, or exactly 1.342when cooled to 60. When sir up of this density is left in repose for somedays, it concretes altogether into crystal line tufts, and forms an apparently dry solid of specific gravity 1.39. When this is exposed to the heat of 220,it fuses into a liquid nearly as thin as water. In cooling to 1500, it takes the consistence of honey; and at 100 Fahrenheit it has that of a viscid varnish. It must be left a considerable time at rest before it recovers its granular state. When heated to 2700, it boils briskly, and gives off one tenth of its weight of water, and concretes, on cooling, into a bright yellow, brittle, but very deliquescent mass, like barley sugar. If the sir up be concentrated to a much greater density than 1.340, (as to 1.362,) or if it be left faintly acidulousin either case it will not grand late, but will remain either a viscid magna, or become a concrete mass which may indeed be pulverized, though it is so deliquescent as to be unfit for the adult e ration of raw sugar. The Full juice is in this predicament, and is therefore, in my opinion, hardly amenable to the new sugar law, as it cannot by an means be worked up into even the semblance of sugar. Good muscovy do sugar from Jamaica fuses only when heated to 280;but it turns immediately dark brown, from the dis engagement of some of its carbon at that temperature, and becomes, in fact, the substance calledcaramel" by the French, which is used for coloring brand is, white wines, and liquors. Thus we see that starch or grape sugar is well distinguished from cane sugar, by its visibility at a moderate heat, and its in alter ability at a pretty high heat. I to sweet ening power is only two fifths that of ordinary sugar. A good criterion of incompletely formed starch sugar is its resisting the action of sulphuric acid, while perfectly saccharified starch or cane sugar is readily de composed by it. If to a strong solution of imperfectly saccharifled grape sugar, nearly boiling hot, one drop of strong sulphuric acid be let fall, no perceptible change will ensue; but if the acid be dropped into solutions of either of the two other sugars, black carbonaceous particles will make their appearance. The article which was lately detained by the excise for the high duties at Full is not affected by sulphuric acid, like the solutions of cane sugar, and of the well made <a name="potato380"><mark>potato</mark></a> sugar of London; and, for this reason, I gave my opinion in favor of admitting the (so called) vegetable juice at a moderate rate of duty. I subjected the solid matter obtained by evaporating the Full juice to ultimate analysis by peroxide of copper in a combustion, tube, with all the requisite precautions, and obtained in one experiment 37 per cent. of carbon, and in another 38 per cent, when the substance had been dried in an air bath heated to 275. The difference to 100 is hydrogen and oxygen in the proportions to form water. Now, this is nearly the constitution of starch. Lane sugar contains about 5 per cent. more carbon, whereby it readily evolves this black element, by the action of heat or sulphuric acid. An ingenious memoir, by Mr. Drummer, upon the distinguishing criterion gum doctrine grape sugar and cane sugar, has been published in the 3 9th volume of the "Anna len der Theme und Pharmacie." 1 have re310peated his experiments, and find them to give correct results when modified in a certain ,way. His general plan is to expose the hydrate of copper to the action of solutions of the above mentioned vegetable products. He first renders the solution alkaline; then adds solution of sulphate of copper to it; and either heats the mixture, or leaves it for some time in the cold. By pursuing his directions, I encountered contradictory results; but, by the following method, I have secured uniform success in applying thecriteria, and have even arrived at a method of determining, by a direct test, the quantity of sugar in diabetic urine. I dissolve a weighed portion of sulphate of copper in a measured quantity of water, and make the solution faintly alkaline, as tested with turn eric paper, by the addition of potash lye in the cold; for, if the mixture be hot, a portion of the disengaged green hydrate of copper is converted into black oxide. This mixture, being always agitated before applying it, forms the test liquor. If a few drops of it be introduced into a solution of gum, no change ensues in the hydrate of copper, even at the boiling heat; which shows that a gumma te of copper is formed, which resists decomposition. But thecupreous mixture without the gum is rapidly blackened at the boiling temperature. I do not find that the guai mate is re dissolved by an excess of water, as Drummer asserts. Starch and tragacanth com post like gum; in which respect I agree withTrommer. Starch, however, is already a perfect criterion in iodine water. Mr. Drummer says that solution of doctrine affords a deep blue colored liquid, without a trace of precipitate; and that, when his mixture is heated to 8 50 C., it deposites red grains of pro t oxide of copper, so ruble in tmlriaticacid. I think these phenomena are dependent, in some measure, upon the degree of alkaline excess in the mixture. I find that solution of dextrinettreated in my way, hardly changes in the cold; but when heated slightly, it becomes green; and, by brisk boiling, an olive tint is produced. It thus betrays a tendency of transition into sugar. Solution of cane sugar, similarly treated, undergoes no change in the cold at the end of two days; and very little change of color, ever at a boiling heat, if not too concentrated. And sugar, treated by Drummer in his way, becomes of a deep blue; it can be boiled with potash in excess, without any separation of or angered oxide of copper. Starch or grape sugar has a marvellous power of reducing the green hydrate of copper to the orange oxide. I find, however, that it will not act upon the pure blue hydrate, even when recently precipitated ; it needs the addition, in every case, of a small portion of all ali. Met ammonia does not seem to serve the purpose ; for, in using the ammonia sulphate of copper in solution, I obtained unsatisfactory results with the above vegetable products. The black oxide of copper is not affected by being boiled in solution of starch sugar f solution of grape sugar" (says Drummer) " and potash be treated with a solution of sulphate of copper, till the separated hydrate is re dissolved, a precipitate of red oxide will soon take place at a common temperature, but it immediately forms if the mixture is heated. A liquid containing a hundred thousandth of grape sugar, even one millionth part" says he" gives a perceptible tinge (orange) if the light is let fall upon it." To obtain such a minute result, very great nice ty must be used in the dose ofalkali, which I have found it extremely difficult to hit. With my regular 311 [75ed alkaline mixture, however, I never fail in discovering an exceedingly small portion of starch sugar, even when mixed with muscovy do sugar and thus an excellent method is afforded of detecting the frauds of the growers. I find that manna deoxidizes the green hydrate of copper slowly when heated, but not nearly to the same extent as grape sugar, which reduces it rapidly to the orange, oxide. If an excess of the hydrate of copper test, be .used, there e will be a :deposit e of green hydrate at the bottom of the vessels under the orange oxide. To apply these researches to the sugar of diabetic urine: thisshoquldfirst be boiled briskly, to de compose the urea, and to dissipated its elements in the form of an ammonia, as well as to concentrate the sac charing matter, whereby the test becomes more efficacious ; then add to the :boiling urine, in i a few drops at a time, the .curious mixture, containing a known quantity of sulphate of copper, till the whole assumes a greenish tint, and, continue the heat until the color becomes bright orange. Shouldd it remain green, it is a proof that more hydrate of copper has been introduced than has been equivalent to the de oxidising power of the starch sugar. I have found that one gr a in of sulphate of copper in solution, super saturated very slightly with potash, is de composed with the production of orange pro oxide by about 3 grains of <a name="potato381"><mark>potato</mark></a> sugar ; or, more exactly, 30 parts ,aft he said sulphate, in the state of an alkaline hydrate of copper, pass altogether into the state of orange oxide, by means of 100 parts of granular istarhsugar. Thus, for every 3 grains of sulphate so changed, 10 grains of sugar, may be estimated to exist in diabetic urine. Ice tate of copper may be used in the above experiments, but it is not so good as the sulphate. The chloride of copper does not answer, Specific gravity is also an important criterion applied to sugars. That of the cane and be et root is 1.577; that of starch sugar, in crystal line tufts, is 1.39, or perhaps 1.40, as it varies but a little with its state ofdryneasAt 1.342, sir up of the cane contains 70 per cent. of sugar. At the ,sane density, sir up of starch contains 75' per cent. of concrete matter dried at 260 degrees Fahrenheit, and therefore freed from the 10. per cent of water which it contains in the granular state Thus another distinction is i obtained between the two sugars, in the relative d enmities of their solutions at like sac charing contents per cent. No. 181 The Culti Vati Of Of Dyers' Madder Of Of Arti Cle . Of Amerfcan Agri  Cultureby M. B. Batchamrubia Tinctoriathe quantity of m adder consumed annually in the United States, and imported from abroad, is perfectly astonishing to those who have given no attention to the subject. Unfortunately, our public records do not give very exact information on the subject. Mr. Ellsworth, as the nearest approximation he could obtain, gives the amount of 5,000 tons. E tim ating, this at the low average price of ten cents per pound, it makes the round sum of one million of dollars, paid annually to foreign countries for an, 75 ]a] 312 article that can be produced as good and cheap at home paid, too, by a people loaded down with indebtedness, and disgraced by the forfeiture of plighted obligations. The cultivation of m adder has heretofore been represented as a tedious and laborious operation, requiring much care and skill, as well as outlays of capital. The directions have been mainly gathered from foreign works, detailing the methods practised by the plodding Dutch in Holland and Germany. These accounts have appeared so frightful to Americans, that none of them have dared to undertake the business; and Yankee enterprise and labor saving ingenuity have never been exercised upon it. It is true, the crop requires three or four years to arrive at maturity, and needs considerable labor and some knowledge; but the quantity of land it occupies, and the amount of labor it requires, are far less, in proportion to the value of the crop, than those of any other farm crop that can be named. These assertions are fully corroborated by the experience of an enterprising American farmer, Mr. Joseph Swift, of Erie county, Ohio, who has been engaged in the cultivation of m adder for five years past. A detailed account of Mr. Swift S mode of culture, and its results, was obtained at his residence last winter, by the writer of this essay, and published in the Newgenesee Farmer for March, 1843. From this account, it will be seen that, after having informed himself on the subject, and becoming satisfied that the business was practicable and profitable, he at once planted nine acres a quantity that would astonishiMynheer An Hollander. This he allowed to grow four seasons, and the crop was harvested and sold in the fall of 1842. The following are some of the results of his experience. *the product of the best land was at the rate of 2,000 lbs. per acre; and he is certain that, with his present knowledge, he can obtain 3,000 lbs. per acre; which is more than the best average crops of Holland or Germany. The quality was superior to the average of imported m adder. The labor required, including the whole time, with the digging, cleaning, threshing, &c, was from eighty to one hundred days' work per acre. The out lay, for buildings, fixtures, &c, did not exceed fifty dollars. The value of the crop was at the rate of fifteen cents per pound, at which price he sold most of it; notwithstanding the circumstance of its being unknown to purchasers, and all the prejudice that usually exists in such cases. The result, then, in figures, fairly stated, stands thus, for an acre of good land properly managed By 2,000 lbs. of m adder, at 15 cents per lb. -a-      $300.00Contra.-To 100 days' work, mostly boys, at 75 cents per day -a-   $75.00Use of land 4 years, at   $4 per year -16 00 Grinding, packing, &c. -9 00- 100 00 Leaving a net t profit per acre of -200 00 or. Swift was one of the earliest settlers of that section of the country, having resided nearly thirty years on the farm he now occupies, which consists of about 400 acres of choice land, mostly alluvial, in the valley of 313 [a[ 75 the Vermilion river, seven miles fro in Take Erie. At my request, he furnished me with the following practical directions for the cultivation of m adder, which, he remarked, must be understood as intended for those who wish to cultivate only a few acres, and cannot afford much out lay of capital. Those who wish to engage in the business on an extensive scale, would need to adopt a somewhat different practice. Soil and preparation The soil should be a deep, rich, sandy loam, free from weeds, roots, stones, &c, and containing a good proportion of vegetable earth. Alluvial ' bottom" land is the most suitable, but it must not be wet. If old upland is used, it should receive a heavy coating of vegetable earth, from delayed wood and leaves. The land should be ploughed very deep in the fall, and early in the spring apply about one hundred loads of well rotted manure per acre, spread evenly and ploughed in deeply; then harrow till quite fine and free from lumps. Next plough the b field into beds four feet wide, leaving alleys between three feet wide ;then harrow the beds with a fine light harrow, or rake them by hand, so as to have them smooth and even with the alleys; they are then ready for planting. Preparing sets and planting ladder sets, or seed roots, are best selected when the crop is dug in the fall. The horizontal uppermost roots, with eyes, are the kind to be used; these should be separated from the bottom roots, and buried in sand in a cellar or pit. If not done in the fall, the sets may be dug early in the spring, before they begin to sprout. They should be cut or broken into pieces containing from two to five eyes each, i. e. three or four inches long. The time for planting is as early in spring as the ground can be got in good order and severe frosts are over, which in this climate is usually about the middle of April. With the beds prepared as directed, stretch a line length wise the bed, and with the corner of a he make a drill two inches deep along each edge and down the middle, so as to give three rows to each bed, about two feet apart. I to these drills drop the sets, ten inches apart, covering them two inches deep. Right or ten bushels of sets are requisite for an acre. After cultures soon as the m adder plants can be seen, the ground should be carefully hold, so as to destroy the weeds, and not injure the plants; and the hoping and wedding must be repeated as often as weeds make their appearance. If any of the sets have failed to grow, the vacancies should be filled by taking up parts of the strongest roots, and transplanting them. This is best done in June. As soon as the m adder plants are ten or twelve inches high, the tops are to be bent down to the surface of the ground, and all except the tip end covered with earth shoveled from the middle of the alleys. End the shoots outward and inward in every direction, so as in time to fill all the vacant space in the beds, and about one foot on each side. After the first time covering, repeat the wedding when necessary, and run a single horse plough through the alleys several times, to keep the earth clean and mellow. As soon as the plants again become ten or twelve inches high, bend down and cover them as before; repeating the operation as often as necessary, which is commonly three times the first season. The last time may be as late as September, or later if no frosts occur. By covering the tops in this manner, they change to roots, and the design is to fill the ground as full of roots as possible. When the vacant spaces are all full, there will be but little chance for weeds to grow; but all that appear must be pulled out 75] 314 The second year deep the beds free from weeds, plough the alleys, and cover the tops, as before directed, two or three times during the season. The alleys will now form deep and narrow ditches ; and if it becomes difficult to obtain good earth for covering the tops, that operation may be omitted after the second time this season. Are should be taken in covering the tops to keep the edges of the beds as high as the middle ; otherwise the water from heavy showers will run off, and the crop suffer from drought. The third year Very little labor or attention is required. The plants will now cover the whole ground. If any weeds are seen, they must be pulled out; otherwise, their roots will cause trouble when harvesting them adder. The crop is sometimes dug the third year; and if the soil and cultivation have been good: and 'the seasons warm and favorable, the m adder will be of good quality; but generally it is much better in quality, and more in quantity when. left until the fourth year. Digging andharvestingThis should be done between the 20 t th of August and the 20th of September. Take a sharp shovel, or shovels and cut off and remove the tops within half an inch of the surface of the earth then take a plough of the largest size, with a sharp counter and a :double team, and plough a furrow outward, beam deep, around the edge of the bed; stir the earth with forks, and carefully pick out all the roots; removing the earth from the bottom of the furrow ; then plough another furrow, beam deep, as before, and pick over and remove the earth in the 'same, manner; thus proceeding till the whole is completed. Washing i and drying is soon n as possible after digging take the roots to some running stream to be washed. If there is no running stream convenient, it can be done at a pump. Take large round sieges, two and a half or three feet in diameter, with the wire about as fine as whieatsievesor, if these cannot be had get from a hard ware store sufficient screen wire of the right i fine ness, and make frames or boxes about two and a half feet long and the width of the wire; on the bottom; of which nail the, wire. I nthesesievesor boxes, put half a bushel of roots at a time, and stir them about in the water, pulling the bunches apart so as to wash them clean then, having a platform it hand, lay them on it to dry. To make a platform, take e two or three common boards, so as to be about four feet in width, and nail lets across the under side. In these spread :the roots; about two inches thick, for drying in the sun. Carry the platforms to a convenient place, not far from the house, and place them side by side. in rows east ,and west, and their ends north and south, leaving room to walk 'between the rows. Elevate the south ends of the platforms about eighteen inches, and the north: ends: about six inches from the ground, putting poles or sticks to support them. This will greatly facilitate the drying, After the: second or third dayd drying, thee m adder must be protected from 'the dews at night, and from rain, by placing the platforms one upon' another to a convenient height i and covering the: uppermost: one with boards. Spread them out. again in the morning, or as soon as the danger is over. Give or six days of ordinarily fine weather will dry the m adder sufficiently, when it may be put away till it is' convenient to kill dry and grind itilndryingeThe size and mode of constructing the kill may be varied to suit circumstances. The following is a very cheap plan, and sufficient to dry one ton of roots at a time. Place four strong posts in the ground, twelve feet apart one way and eighteen the other; the front two 14 feet high and the others 18. But girths across the bottom, middle, and top, and nail boards perpendicularly on the outside, as for a common barn The boards must be well seasoned, and all cracks or holes should be plastered or otherwise stopped up. Take a shed roof of common boards. In th t inside, put upright standards, about five feet apart, with cross pieces, to slip port the scaffolding. The first cross piece is to be four feet from i thefld6rthe next two feet higher, and so on to the top.

In the cultivation of the m adder root, the mineral composition of the oil is almost unimportant, although it has been remarked that it succeedsbet315S75[ 75 316 her in those soils in which the proportion of hum us* or vegetable mould is the greatest. As to the physical properties, the most superior soil for the growth of the m adder root is that which is specifically the lightest in proportion to its bulk; that which will take up most water, and in which evaporation is the s lowest; that which adheres the least to the tools in working it, and which, being dry, adheres least together. There are two ways of cultivating the m adder root: 1st. Cultivation on the small scale, which is done by hand, and on small patches of ground; 2d. Cultivation on the large scale. Cultivation on the small scale When a person has a piece of ground which is suitable to the growth of m adder, he should first of all break it up to the depth of a metre, t unless it should lately have been worked to some depth. This is generally done by the spade. The operation should take place during the winter; the rain and frost break up the clouds, which, on the approach of spring, will become pulverized. It should be done when the ground is in such a state that, although there is sufficient humidity in it, it will not adhere to the implements made use of. Manure should be carted upon it during the whole winter. There are some lands upon which the quantity of manure to be employed might (as we nay say) be unlimited, and they would produce a crop of roots in proportion to the quantity thrown ion; but it must be understood that if is only upon porous, light, fresh soils, that the experiment of putting on such a super abundant quantity of manure should be attempted. When the manure has been well spread over the ground, it must be ploughed in cross wise, so as to cover it lightly, and the narrowed, to make the surface even. The furrows in which the m adder <a name="seeds39"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are to be sown are then traced out with a small hand plough. The furrows ought to be five feet and a half in width, with a space between them of about fourteen inches; thus the lines would be traced at six feet eight inches distance from each others his operation being completed, a man- takes a hand furrow, and hollows out a deeper furrow along each ridge; he is followed by a woman or child, who throws the seed into the furrow. From 400 to 450 pounds of seed to every hectare J will be the necessary quantity. The <a name="seeds40"><mark>seeds</mark></a> should be regularly distributed, at not more than one and a half inch distance from each other, and in every direction; they should not be sown in lines. When the man has completed his furrow, he will, on returning, open another alongside of it the earth turned up for which will serve to cover the seed which has been sown upon the first; the woman still follows him, and sows the seed in the new furrow ; and so on, till they come to the sixth, which remains without being sown, and which forms the interval between the first and second ridges. As soon as the m adder makes its appearance above the ground, immediate care should be taken to have it properly needed, in which the agriculturists cannot be too particular; and this must be repeated whenever fresh weeds begin to show themselves. This wedding is to be done by hand. The women and children must go on their knees, in the space between the furrows, and pluck out with great care the roots and filaments of every weed. This should be followed, in every instance, by covering the* Moody fibre, in a state of decay, is the substance called humusSee Liebigs Agriculturaaghemistry, chap. 3; published by J. Winchester, New Yorkta metre is 39( inches, English. B A hectare is 2 acres 1 room and 35 perches, English; or 11,960 square rods 317 [a[ 75 m adder plants with a light layer of earth, taken from between the furrows and this is for the purpose of making the ground firm around them, and to replace that which the pulling up of the weeds may have removed. Theweeding must be repeated more or less often, in proportion to the pro density of the ground to produce weeds; and one ought to calculate upon three weddings being sufficient during the first summer. It will require equal to 22 days' work of a woman upon each hectare, every time it is done, upon such lands as produce weeds only in moderate quantities; but the quantity may be much more considerable in soils where vegetation is particularly, vigorous. In the month of September, the furrows should be covered two or three inches deep with earth ; and in this state the m adder passes the winter. At the time the top of the plant will have begun to wither from the effects of the cold nights, and will soon after become dry, the question is not so much to defend it from the frost, which it with stands well, as to oblige the plant to form new roots in the earth with which it is covered, to the end that it may show itself above ground. The first vegetation in the spring is so vigorous, that it pierces through the layer with rapidity, and the new stem shows itself as soon as the first warmth of spring is felt. During the second year the wedding must be continued but if it has been carefully done during the first, the m adder plants, having taken firm hold of the soil, would not allow the growth of many extraneous weeds. The plants are lightly earthed up after every wedding, as before. However, there are many persons who do not take this precaution after the first year, pretending, with some show of reason, that the pulling up of the weeds cannot affect the m adder plants, which then have become firmly rooted. When the stem is in flower, it is cut for fodder, or it is left to run to seed. Opinions are divided as to these two methods. Any persons think that the mowing compels the plant to push forth a new shoot, which impoverished the root; but, on the other hand, it may be argued that allowing the stem to come to maturity will impoverished the plant, and rob it of all its succulency. As to the fodder, it is of an excellent quality almost as much esteemed as ulcer ne. It is well known that it has the property of turning red the bones of animals which feed upon it a circumstance often remarked in countries where the m adder grows. Experienced cultivates can judge from the produce of the first years fodder what will be the produce of the roots themselves; for it has been found that they are equal in weight to the fodder cut the first year, and double that of the second. The third year does not require any other labor than the mowing of the stems; and finally, in the month of August or September, as soon as the rains have sufficiently penetrated the ground so as to render it easy to be worked, the taking up of the roots themselves is proceeded in. It is necessary that this should be completed before any fears can be entertained of frost, which might prove very injurious to the quality of the roots while they are laid out to dry. To do this, men are placed on every furrow; and sometimes two on each, if the ground be very stiff, and require much labor. With their spades they turn up the ground before them, and keep digging down as long as they perceive any filaments of the roots. Before each laborer is placed a cloth, into which he throws the m adder a she gathers it. Whenever this is full, it is carried to the area upon which the crop is to be 75 318 spread, for, the purpose of drying it it is turned over with a pitchfork, toSclere it from the earth and dust which may adhere to it. It is then conveyed to. some dry place, for humidity would render it liable to become, mould, ,and would completely deteriorate its quality.

The first work of breaking up the earth is done with a strong plough; all the other labor of the intermediate years is done by hand, as in the small cultivation. The work of turning up the roots is done also with a strong plough, the mould board of which is more turned up than usual, to prevent the earth from falling back into the furrow ; its handle is of wood, but all the rest of wrought iron. It is constructed altogether up n on the principle of the plough called con tried. There are, however, two small wheels attached to it, as a sort of fore carriage, to render its progress more steady. The agriculturists should take care to have a double set of the principal parts of the plough, to prevent delays in case of accident. To this plough is generally first yoked a pair of oxen, and before the mare placed as many horses as the tenacity of the ground may require. The calculation is generally made for six pairs of horses, beside the oxen, for lands of ordinary stiffness. With these means about half a hectare may be ploughed in a day. The ground should be opened to the depth of about twenty inches. When such a considerable strength in cattle cannot be obtained, the furrows must be ploughed over twice; and in this way it may be managed i ithThbre pairs of cattle, which would do the same work, but take double the time to perform it* 'Totakeup the root, 20 men and women would be required to each     pp pg when the m adder is not very thick, as is usually the case in thecpimpact soils o which we are speaking.

Madder Seedthe very high prices which the m adder dyes of France and Holland have attained are sufficient to excite the attention of our intelligent agriculturists. It is only necessary to take into consideration the immense quantity of m adder consumed in the various man factories of the Unitedstates, to be convinced that the cultivation of this plant would be attended with great advantages, and that it may be undertaken with certainty of profit. The m adder root can be cultivated in almost every climate. The sands of Silesian, the marshes of Zealand, the arid soils of the south of France and Persia, produce it, and of almost equally good quality. It is well known that atmospheric influences make but little impression upon a root, the valuable part of which grows beneath the surface of the soil; and what a powerful guarantee does this circumstance afford to the cultivatorof the m adder. It protects him from all varieties of temperature which so frequently destroy crops of a different nature. For those who cultivate the root, a crop is assured as soon as the seed which they have put into the ground begins to terminate. A special report upon the cultivation of this plant was laid before the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and a prize awarded to the author. It was written by M. de Aspirin, Beer of France, member of the I institute, and formerly Minister of the I interior: The above extract is made from it, which is itself sufficient to instruct all who wish to direct .their attention to this new branch of cultivation in this country. French m adder seed, obtained from last years crops, may be had of the subscribers, who have received a consignment of a considerable quantity. J. M.

The great i depression in in every kind of agricultural produce i makes it the 4 duty of patriotic citizens to point out any new :eg table: products wanting 320 in the practical arts. Of these, there are some five or six, hitherto imported from foreign countries, that can just as well be grown by our farmers as by foreigners. These are m adder, indigo, Civilian sum a ch, (thus cor maria) I italian sum a ch, (thus cot in us) weld, (rested a lutiola) and word. I undertook to bring these articles to the attention of our agriculturists some fifteen years since, but the then high price of produce paralyzed the effort. I will again bring them to their notice, and, I hope, with better effect. Gibson quotes a wise maxim from the Zendavesta: " He who sows the ground with care and diligence acquires a greater stock of religious merit than he could gain by a repetition of ten thousand prayers shall, in this article, treat of the cultivation of m adder. The consumption of it is very large, and would require many thousands of acres to supply the home market. I believe the cultivation of m adder has been successfully prosecuted, on a small scale, in the neighborhood of Tic a, State of New Work, for some years past. About the year 1816, I bought some dried roots in the market of Cynthiana, Kentucky, that I found of very good quality. I have tested some roots brought from South America, where, I am informed, it grows wild, and it proved superior to any European m adder I ever used. Mrs. Madison made a report to the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, many years since, on m adder raised under her direction and the report was accompanied with a sample of cotton dyed an Adrianople red, that has never been exceeded in color by any European d yer. Dambourgue informs us that the roots taken from the ground, and washed, will, by using four pounds for one, produce all the effect of the best prepared. This fact is highly important to manufacturers, as it points out to them an easy and cheap way of obtaining the article for their own consumption, at less than half the price paid by them for the foreign article. These facts will prove incontestably that our soil and climate are admirably adapted for the cultivation of m adder. The only impediment to our success lies in the fact that it requires from two to three years to realize a crop, and our farmers are ever impatient for quick returns. I shall commence by describing the mode of culture, and then give the process of drying and grinding for distant markets. Preparation for the crops t will be necessary to plough the land deeply for m adder, before the winter, into high ridges, in order that it may be exposed to the action and influence of the frosts and the atmosphere. Early in the spring these ridges should be well harrowed down by a heavy long tied harrow, and then ploughed again in the contrary direction to a good depth; and after this, when the land is not perfectly clean from weeds, or not rendered sufficiently fine and mellow, another sloughing and another narrowing should be given. In the last operation the ground should always be left in as level and even a state as possible. It is then ready for the reception of the plants. Owing andplantingThe sets or plants may then be obtained either by sowing the <a name="seeds41"><mark>seeds</mark></a> upon a bed of earth which is rich, and made perfectly fine by digging and taking in the spring, and then lightly covering it, or from offsets or suckeds from the old plants. In the first method, on the plants appearing, they should bee made perfectly clean by wedding, and be set out at the distance of three inches in the beds by the he; in this way, by keeping the ground quite clean, and well stirred about the plants, they will be ready to set out in the second autumn, though it will be mostly better to defer the business till spring. It requires about thirty thousand 321 [a[ 75 plants for setting an acre of land. The most suitable time for taking these ties shown by the plants having attained the height of 10 or 12 inchesfrbio the ground, and the suckeds having thrown out l fibrous roots from their bottoms. This may be seen by drawing up a few of the plants, and, usually about the latter end of May or beginning of June. Besides, it is necessary that the sets shall have formed root fibres at the cotton is before they are removed; as where that is not the case they never succeed well. The land being prepared as directed, and the plants provided, a sufficienituumber of laborers are to be employed, that the work may be performed as expeditiously as possible. In taking off the sets, much care is necessary not to injure them. The number of plants that can be set in a short time should be taken up at once. They should be prepared by having a third part of their tops cut off. A sort of thin matter should be made by mixing good vegetable mould and water well together; and as m adder roots contain a large portion of free potash, I would recommend an addition of half a pound of potash to the matter used for the shoots, for every five pounds of fire would, and this first dissolved in, the water before mixing with the mould. I n to this matter the roots and the sets should be well dipped before they are placed in the earth, as by this means the necessity of watering the plants afterwards is prevented. This work is executed by a person before the planting commences. Two others are employed afterwards in distributing the plants, so as to be convenient for putting them into the ground. These sets, after the land has been .formed into beds five feet in breadth with two feet between each for intervals, are put in by means of a line and a diable, beginning at a distance of six inches from tile outside, and setting a row of plants at a distance of five, six, or more, inches from each other then removing the line two feet further on them, and putting in another row; and so on, till the bed is finished. In this way, each bed contains three rows of plants, at two feet distance each. After cultivation. -is some of the plants are liable to die soon after the work has been performed, it is necessary, in the course of two or three weeks, to look over the ground, and put fresh vigorous plants in the places where the others have been destroyed. It is of the greatest consequence to the growth that it be kept perfectly clean from weeds, and that the mould be occasionally stirred about the shoots of the plants. Of. Partri  Dge. For the American Agriculturists. Culti Vati Of And Manufacture Of Madderno. I I . Before giving directions for the manufacture of m adder, as practised .iaEurope, I will inform in or farmers of the mode pursued in Kentucky of cultivating it. They first dig the ground to a good depth, making the mould very light and mellow; they then plant sn all roots in rows; and when they have thrown up s talks of about a foot in length, they bend them down, and throw over item, a layer of mould ; these will throw up p fresh slabs, which undergo the same process. This covering up is continued until the third year, when the bed is opened .with a pitchfork, and all the roots huge enough boris" are washed and dried under a shred. The smaller roots are plaited I s, fresh beds. The beds must be kept clean from weeds. The s talks, when laid down become roots. The roots most valuable for coloring are from the size of a small goose quill to that of the little finger. If i such larger, the coloring matter will be of little value; and if many such are ground With the smaller roots, the whole mass will be injured. I shall now proceed to describe the manufacture of m adder roots for the market. I transcribe this account from A. Are, on the arts, &c, published in England last year: The m adder, taken from the ground and picked, must be dried inrdertp be ground and preserved. In warm climates, it is dried in the open air but elsewhere stoves must be employed." The string y filaments and epidermis are to be removed, called may  l; as a so the with, so as to leave nothing but the ligne out fibres The preparation of m adder is carried on in the department of the shone in the following manner: " The roots are dried in a stove, heated by means of a furnace, from which the air is allowed to issue only at intervals, at the moment when it is judged to be saturated with moisture. The furnace blue occupies a great portion of the floor; above are three close gratings, on which the roots are distributed in layers of about eight inches. At the end of twenty-four hours, those which are on the first grated floor, directly above the stove, are dry; when they are taken away and replaced by those of the superior floors. This operation is repeated whenever the roots over the stove are dry. The dry roots are threshed with a flail, passed through manners similar to those employed for wheat, and then shaken upon a very coarse si eve. What passes through, is further win no wed and sifted through a finer si eve than the first These operations are repeated five times, proceeding successively to sievesstill finer and finer, and setting aside every time what remains on the si eve, What passes through the fifth si eve is rejected as sand and dust. After these operations, the whole fibrous matters remaining on the si eve are cleaned with common manners, and women separate all the foreign matters which had not been removed before. For dividing the roots, afterward, into different qualities, a brass si eve is made use of, whose meshes are from, to k inch in diameter. What passes through the finest is rejected; and what passes through the coarsest is regarded of the best quality. Theseoots, thus separated, are carried into a stove, of a construction somewhat different from the first. They are spread out in layers of about four inches in thickness, on large latticework frames; and the drying is known to be complete when, on taking up a handful and squeezing it, the roots break easily. In quitting the stove, the m adder is carried, still hot, into a machine, where it is minded small, and a si eve separates the portion of the bark reduced to powder. This operation is repeated three or four times, and then the bolter is had recourse to. What passes through the si eve, or the brass meshes of the bolter, is regarded as common m adder; and what issues at the extremity of the bolter is called the flour. Lastly, them adder which passes through the bolter is ground in a mill with vertical stones, and then passed through sieges of different sizes. What remains above is always better than what goes through. The manufacture of m adder roots appears to be a very formidable operation; yet, when reduced to practice, I suspect most of the difficulties so apparent t in description would vanish.

The object of this essay is to point out to our r agriculti rises the effect peculiar soils have on the quality of m adder, and t our doers the effect different waters have in developing the coloring matter, affecting its brilliancy and permanent y. The following is transcribed from A. Tres late work on .arts, manufactures, &c: .ladder contains so beautiful and so fast a color, that it has become of almost universal employment in dyeing; but that color is accompanied with so many other substances which mask and de grade it, that it can be brought out and fixed only after a series of operations more or less difimcultand precarious.

Before the time of Haussmann, an apothecary at Collar, the m adder bath was subject to many risks, which that skilful chemist taught doers how to guard against, 'b introducing a certain 1 quantity of chalk into the bath. A change of residence led Haussmann to this fortunate result. After having made very fine reds at You en, he encountered the greatest obstacles in dying the same red sat Logelbach, near Collar, where he went to live. Numerous trials, undertaken with a view of obtaining the same success in his new establishment, proved that the cause of his favorable results atRouen existed ii the \later, which contained carbonate of lime in solution while the water of Logelbach was nearly pure. He then tried a factitiouscalcareos water, by adding chalk to his dye bath. Having obtained the most satisfactory results, he was not long producing here i as beautiful and as solid reds as he had done at You en. This practice be ca n, soon general among the calico printers of Alsace, though in many dye f work i the chalk is now replaced by lime, potash, or soda, But when the, m adder ofAvignon is used, all these ant acid correctives become unnecessary, because it contains a sufficient quantity of carbonate of lime an important fact first analytically demonstrated by that accurate chemist, M. Henri Schlumberger, of Mulhausen. Avignon m adder indicates the presence of carbon 75 ]a] 324 ate of lime in it by effervescing with dilute acids, which Alsace ladder does not." M. Pullman found a free acid resembling the malice in his analysis ofrnadders; but his experiments were confined to those of Alsace. Themadders of Avignon are, on the contrary, alkaline, as may be inferred from the violet tint of the f roth of their infusions; whereas that of the Alsace ladders is yellowish, and it strongly riddens lit must paper. This important difference between the plants of these districts depends entirely upon the soil; for ladders grown in a calcareous, shell y soil, in Alsace, have been found to be possessed of the properties of the Avignon m adder. The useful action of the carbonate and the phosphates of lime in them adder of Avignon explains why ladders treated with acids, which remove their calcareous salts without taking away their coloring matter, lose the property of forming fast dyes. Any manufacturers are in the habit of mixing together, and with advantage, different sorts of m adder. That of Avignon contains so much calcareous matter, that, when mixed with them adder of Alsace, it can compensate for its deficiency. Some of the latter is so deficient as to afford colors nearly as fugitive as those of Brazil wood and quercitron, The Alsace ladders, by the addition of chalk to their baths, become as fit for dying Turkey reds as those of Avignon. When the water is very pure, one part of chalk ought to be used to five of Alsacemadder; but when the waters are calcareous, the chalk should be omitted. Time, the neutral phosphates of lime, the carbonate of magnetic, oxide and carbonate of zinc, and several other substances, have the property of causing m adder to form a fast dye, in like manner as the carbonate of lime n a memoir published by the Society of Mulhausen, in September, 1835, some interesting experiments upon the growth of ladders in fictitious soils are related by M. M. Kechlin, Person, and Schlumberger. Patch of ground was prepared, containing from 50 to 80 per cent of chalky matter, and nearly one fifth of its bulk of good horse dung. Lips of Alsace and Avignon ladders were planted in March, 1834, and a part of the rows were reaped in November following. These roots, though of only six months' growth, produced tolerably fast dyes; nor was any difference observe able between the Alsace and the Avignon species; while similar slips or cuttings, planted in a natural non calcareous soil, alongside of the others, yielded roots which gave fugitive dyes. Others were planted in the soil ofPalud, transported from Avignon, which contained more than 90 per cent of carbonate of lime, and they produced roots that gave still faster dye s than the preceding. Three years are requisite to give the full calcareousimpregnation to the indigenous ladders of Avignoni t appears to me, from the above stated facts, that the highly beneficial effect of calcareous soils on m adder is owing to the oxygen furnished to the plant by the carbonic gas so abundant in such soils; or why should oxide of zinc answer as well as the carbonates in raising the dye in the kettle and making the color permanent ?our farmers will observe that limestone soils are the best for m adder, and that it cannot be too highly impregnated with carbonaceous matter. In such soils, two years will be all sufficient time to raise a crop. Of. Partri  Dge325 [75No191MUSTARDCULTI Vatedzfrom the Farmers' Cyclopedia. The species of snap is, generally grown in the kitchen garden for domestic purposes, are the white mustard, (S. alba) and the common or black mustard, (S. nigh a) The first is the one grown for salads but the seed of both is employed in the manufacture of mustard The soil they succeed in best, is a fine, rich, mould y loam, in which the supply of moisture is regular; it may much rather incline to lightness than tenacity. If grown for salading, it need not be dug deep; but if for seed, to full the depth of the blade of the spade. In early spring, and late in autumn, the situation should be sheltered; and, during the height of summer, shaded from the meridian sun. For salading, the white may be sown throughout the year: from the beginning of November to the same period in March, in a gentle hot bed appropriated for the purpose, in one already employed for some other plant, or in the corner of a stove. From the close of February to the close of April, it may be sown in the open ground, on a warm sheltered border; and from thence to the middle 'of September, in a shady one. Both the white and the black, for seed, may be sown at the close of March, in an :open compartment. For salading, it is sown in flat bottomed drills, about half an inch deep, and six inches apart. The seed cannot well be sown too thick. The mould which covers the drills should be entirely divested of stones. Later must be given occasionally in dry weather, as a due supply of moisture is the chief inducement to a quick vegetation. The sowings are to be performed once or twice in a fortnight, according to the demand. Cresslepidium sat ovum) is the almost constant accompaniment of this i salad herb; and, as the mode of <cultivation of each is& identical, it is only, necessary to remark, that, as dress is rather tar die r in ve getting thanrrhustard, it is necessary, for the obtaining them both in perfection at the marie time, to sow it five or six days earlier. It must be cut for use while young, and before the rough leaves appear, otherwise the p urgency of the flavor is disagreeably increased. If the top is cut off, the plants will, in general, shoot again; though this second produce is always scanty, and not so mild or tender. For the production of seed, whether for manufacture of mustard 'd future sowing, the insertion must be made broadcast, thin, and regularly raked in. When the needling shave attained four leaves, they should be hold, and again after the lapse of a month, during dry weather being set 8 or 9 inches apart. Throughout their growth, they mucid127st by kept free from weeds; and if dry weather occurs at the time of flowering, water may be applied with great advantage to their roots. The plants flower in June, and are fit for' putting When their ponds have :become devoid of verdure. They must be' thoroughly dried before threshing and storing. For forcing, the seed is most conveniently sown in boxes or pans, even if a hot bed is appropriated to the purpose. Dans of rotten t an are to be preferred to pots or boxes of mild. But, whichever is employed, the seed must be sown thick, and other restrictions attended to, as for the open ground crops. The hot bed need only be moderate. Air may be admitted as abundantly as circumstances will allow. W. Johnsons Kitchen Garden. I[ 75 3 326MUSTARD1FLOUR Of.

The time is not far distant, if not already at hand, when the interests of the American farmers will be best promoted by devoting a portion of their time and land to the raising of many crops which are now imported from countries refusing (except when their own crops fail) the surplus of theAmierican far tens, and thus not only raise the prices of their grain crops by diminishing their quantity, but secure to themselves a large amount of money which is annually sent out of the country to purchase these crops. Mustard seed is one of them, which can be raised here to a profit; and for which, if the seed is delivered clean and in good order, the demand will be found very active and certain. Respectfully, C. J. Fell & Brother, Mustard manufacturers, 64 S Front street. No. 193PiI  Ladi Elphi   A, October 21, 1844.lsT: To E Frerend: We are today in receipt of your favor of the 19hinstaifit, asking for the residence of J. H. Parmtel e, from whom we purchased the mustard seed, as stated in our communricai son published in the Farmersicabinet of the 15th instant. We regret We are not at present able to answer your inquiry satisfactorily. The information we have given in that paper was drawn from him during a conversation had at the time we purchased his seed. At the time that gentleman was here, We had no intention of publishing any thing on the subject of the culture of the seed, but, on mentioning the crop to several farmers of the interior of our State, who subscribed to the Cabinet, they requested us to put the information in such form as they could scan and ponder on at their leisure, and we promised them to give a communication to the Cabinet; and we shall be pleased if it should be productive of any good to any part of our citizens. In answer to your question as to the danger of over stocking the market with mustard seed : If its culture is gone into with a " multicaulis" energy, the den find for the manufacture at the present "infant state" will not be equal to the supply; but if, on the contrary, the farmers move with theirisuial caution ii lid prudence, and sow each but a few acres, we think there is no fear of over stocking the market. The seed produced upon American soil always commands a preference over the imported; and if the manufacturer can rely upon a supply of seed of American growth, even at one cent per pound or fifty cents per bushel over the cost of importing it, no orders for foreign seed will be sent out by them. The manufacture of mustard in this country is yet in its infancy, and has only been undertaken oh a large 75 ]a] 328 scale since the passage of the tariff, giving a protection of 30 per cent. I n these two years, such improvements have been made in machinery, and such knowledge obtained, as has enabled the manufacturers to produce an article which commands a preference over any heretofore imported; and we should not be considered too sanguine when we state, as our firm belief, that the importation of manufactured mustard in 1845 will not be more than one third as much as in any of the last five years; and that, with our superior American seed, our manufacturers can sup plant the English article in markets it has never yet been sent to. If such be the case, or if a prejudice in other markets should prevent the manufactured mustard being exported, the American seed has only to be tried by English manufacturers, to command with them the same preference as we give to it here. In these views of the case, we think that the demand for seed is much more likely to exceed the production, than the production to exceed the demand. You shave, however, better information at Washington, of the probable demand for seed, than we have here. We have written to a friend for a statement of the importation of mustard and mustard seed, but are, as yet, without the information. The Westhaveheretofore supplied their own factories; but we learn that the increased demand for American mustard has compelled them to look to the Last this season for their supplies of seed, and we have now an application from Kentucky for seed; and our friends at Cincinnati, under date of the 15th instant, say "the fact is, the manufacturers here, and in Kentucky and It. Louis, consume nearly all that is brought into this market." Our supplies for the last two years have, in part, been drawn from the West, and, with the exception of the lot purchased from Mr. Parmelee, we do not think, this winter, we will be able to get a single bushel there. We have thus given you as much of the information asked for as atpisent lies in our power, without reserve; and regret that we have been p compelled to extend our letter to so great a length. In the hope of giving you the address of J. H. Parmelee shortly, We are, respectfully, yours, &c. C. J. Fell & Brother. H. L. Ellsworth, Commissioner of Patents. No. 194 From the Ohio Cultivator. Great Crop Of Mustard Seed I N Ohi   O. Or J. H. Parmelee, residing a few miles below Panes ville, in the Muskingum valley, cultivated the past year 27 acres of brown mustard, and the product (as sold to Messrs. Well & Brother, of Philadelphia) was as follows 114 barrels, containing 382 bushels, weighing 521 pounds per bushel, making go 100 pounds of seed; for which they paid him 8 cents per pound or 1,608--being a gross product at the rate of   $59.25 per acre. The soil on which this crop was produced is good lively bottom land containing a fair proportion of sand, having an open sub soil, and was in corn for a number of years previous. It was well ploughed and narrowed as early as it would work well in spring, (in April) and the seed sown with 329 [a[ 75 a drill t arrow, in rows the first one foot, and the next two feet apart, thus :1 foot 2 feet 1 foot. The <a name="seeds44"><mark>seeds</mark></a> should be dropped one to two inches apart, (rather more than a quart to an acre) and the plants thinned to two or three inches. :such care and labor is requisite to keep the ground entirely free from weeds, as the <a name="seeds45"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of weeds would greatly injure the value of the crop at harvest. I need, this labor constitutes the largest item in the whole expense, Mr. Parmelee uses a horse, with a small cultivate or so constructed that, in passing between the wide rows, one of the teeth goes between the narrow ones. Our advice, however, would be, to make all the rows two feet apart, (to save labor in cultivating and hoping) and, if the ground is in good condition, the plants will )e sure to fill all the space, when at maturity, and yield as much seed as if the rows were closer. In harvesting, great care is necessary to avoid shelling. It is cut by hand, with a sickle, (we believe) and laid in rows a short time to perfect the ripe king; then hauled to the barn on a s led, with a wide frame at bottom covered with canvass. It is then threshed and cleaned like ordinary grain. One thing should be borne in mind by those who may contemplate raising this crop namely, that the seed (some of which is sure to shell in harvesting) is a sore and lasting plague to other crops that may follow it so that it is best to keep the same land devoted to this purpose as long a sit can be done with advantage. For fear that Mr. Parmelee may think we shall spoil his trade by inducing too many to engage in the business, we will here state that we happened to meet one of the Messrs. Well above mentioned at an exhibition in Delaware last fall, and he then informed us of the crop of Mr. Parmelee, and remarked that the demand for the seed is so extensive that it vill require many such crops to be produced annually to supply it, or to have any material effect on the price. And as the principal part of the, supply for this country is now imported, patriotism demands that this information should be diffused, and the supply produced at home. Notei. -the account of Mr. Parmelees crop, as published in the Farmers' Cabinet and several other papers, contained some errors, both as to product and cultivation, The 100 bushels of tailings' should read, 100 pounds. We had our information from a near neighbor of Mr. P. No. 20. From the Farmers: Encyclopedia. Culture Of I Ndi  Of.

Dear- Of    R: I take the liberty to call your attention to the cultivation of one of the most valuable of vegetables, destined, at no distant day, to expel from our markets one of the most extensive articles of imports, and now admitted free of duty. I mean oka, whose excellence in soup is universally known and acknowledged. I to ripe <a name="seeds48"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, burned and used as coffee, cannot be distinguished therefrom; and many persons of the most fastidious taste have not been able to distinguish it from the best " Cava." It is very easily grown. The <a name="seeds49"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may be sown in May, in drills 4 feet asunder, an inch deep and 8 inches apart, and cultivated like corn or peas. It sends up a strong stalk, and yields a great abundance of <a name="seeds50"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and the " coffee made from it is very healthy. I think it matter of great importance, especially to the Western States, and here with send a bag of <a name="seeds51"><mark>seeds</mark></a> for distribution. Very respectfully, J. F. Callan. On. H. L. Ellsworth. Extract from the Farmers' Encyclopedia. Vera, (hibiscus esculentisThis plant is extensively cultivated in the West I n dies, from whence it has been introduced into the United States. The ponds are gathered green, and used in soups. They form an important ingredient in the celebrated lumbo soup of New Orleans and other Southern places. The ponds are filled with <a name="seeds52"><mark>seeds</mark></a> and a mucin age, of a bland and highly nutritions quality. Hence, the oka is frequently recommended to persons afflicted with dysentery and other bowel complaints, eaten either boiled or made into soup. When butte red and spiced, they afford a rich dish; and, with vinegar, they make a good pick le. The plant comes to maturity in the middle States, and the ponds are abundant in the Philadelphia. market. Those who become once accustomed to this wholesome vegetable contract a great fondness for its peculiar flavor. In Louisiana, add other Southern States, a dinner is scarcely considered complete without oka cooked in some way or other; and the poor consider it one of their greatest blessings. The ponds are of a proper size when 2 or 3 inches long, but may be used as long as they remain tender. Of fit for use, they will snap asunder at the ends; but if too old and wood y, they must be rejected. One peck of the tender ponds are to be cut cross wise into very thin slices, not exceeding one-eighth of an inch in thickness; to this quantity, add about one third of a peck of tomatoes, previously peeled and cut into pieces. The proportion of tomatoes may be varied to suit the taste. Coarse piece of' beef (a skin is generally made use of) is placed in a pot or digested, with about 2- gallons of water, and a very small quantity of salt. This is permitted to boil a few minutes, when the s cum is taken off, and the oka and tomatoes are thrown in. With these ingredients, in the proportions mentioned, the soup is very fine. Still, some think it improved by addition of green corn, Him a beans, &c. The most essential thing to be attended to is the boiling, and the \excellence of the soup depends almost entirely on this being done faithfully; for, if it be not boiled enough, however well the ingredients may have been selected and proportioned, the soup will be very inferior, and give but little idea of the delightful flavor it possesses when well done. A properly constructed digester is decidedly the best vessel for boiling this or any other soup in; but, where such a utensils is not at hand, an earthen pot should be preferred; but on no account make use of an iron one, as it would turn the whole soup perfectly black, instead of the proper color, viz : green, colored with the rich yellowv332r75 333 3[ 75 ]of! tomatoes. 1 The time usually required for boiling oka soup is about 5 hours; during which, it should be occasionally stirred, and the ingredient smashed. When taken off, the original quantity will be reduced to about one half, and the meat" done to rags" the whole forming a homogeneous mass, of the consistence of thick porridge.

Dear Of    R; The cultivation and growth of ce very, that most excellent and wholesome winter vegetable, requires the close attention of the gardener to bring it to perfection. A practical gardener will soon learn the art; and for the benefit of those who have yet to learn it, I beg to hand you the result of my own experience for the last 25 years. In this country, it is not necessary to sow the seed before the month of May, and then in the open ground, well manured with stable dung thoroughly cured, and not less than a year old. The color, whether white or red, is a matter of taste. I generally mix my seed, and thus have both species. The seed is slow of vegetation, but, if good, never fails to terminate. Whether the seed be sown broadcast or in drills, is a matter of no consequence; as the seed being very small, the plants are sure to shoot up thick. To soon as the sprouts have attained the height of an inch, they should be pricked out in a bed of rich mould, at the distance of about three inches each way from each other. You cannot have good strong stock y plants without pursuing this method. If left standing in the needling bed, they will grow swindling, weak, and consumptive. To more attention is required, excepting that of keeping the plants perfectly free from weeds, until August, when you will find the plants strong, healthy, and vigorous. Any time in this month, dig your trenches 18 inches deep and as many wide. For this purpose, I generally occupy the ground that has been used for early peas. The quality of the ce very, and chiefly its growth, depend entirely upon the next step. The trenches should be half filled with thoroughly cured stable manure. I have found the manure used for early hot beds the best. It never fails of success. The increased ferment at ion of the manure, by the repeated waterings of the beds, the escape of the ammonia and noxious qualities of the manure, renders it sweet, and capable of imparting the mildest and richest flavor to the plant. If fresh manure from the yard, of whatever kind, is used, the ce very will invariably grow strong and rank, with as little delicacy of flavor as there is in the manure. With a garden fork of four times, strike through the manure in the trench into the earth beneath, and bring it up fresh, carefully mixing it with the manure as you proceed from one end of the trench to the other. Attention to this point i indispensable to the growth of good ce very. The plants taken up should be trimmed about the crown, just at the topofiihe root; all the 'young suckeds taken off, leaving the plant tail and neat, with all its main s talks. With a diable, which should be as large as[ 75 ]334 the handle of a spade as the roots will now be of considerable size, begin at one end of the trench with your face towards the other, and set in a single row of plants in the middle of the trench, and not less than 6 inches asunder; water them well. To teetotaler loves water better than ce very, It cannot have too much. The roots of this plant require more room than is generally allowed them, as any one may see when they are taken up for the table. Farthing up the plants should be delayed until they have attained a good size; and then it requires care, especially the first time. I always get intothe trench myself, and, holding the plant with all its s talks firmly in my left hand, with a short handled small he draw the earth up round the t plant, without allowing it to come in between the s talks. When this is done, and the plants thus protected, you may, with a spade, strike off the edges of the trench, and partially fill it. As the plant grows, (as it now will, if well watered in dry weather, with great vigor) continue to earth up, and by the 1st of November the plants will be two feet above the level of the earth, with a main stalk the size of a mans arm. Sometimes, particularly if the season be dry, ce very is liable to be attacked by a fly. In that case, you will see the tops of the ce very turn brown and wither. The moment that symptom appears, no time is to be lost in calling in the doctor; for the whole crop is at stake. The cause of the disease is the sting of a fly upon the leaves of the ce very. The egg is deposited between the integuments of the leaf, and soon patches into a small white worm sometimes visible on opening the leaf to the naked eye, always by the aid of a microscope. If not attended to, the disease gradually descends to the root, and the whole plant falls a sacrifice. Amputate every defective and diseased leaf; and early in the morning, whilst the dew is on, soft on to the whole of the plants fresh soaked lime. One such powdering is generally sufficient; but if not, give them another dose, and the first rain that falls will wash the plants clean, and you will probably see them fresh, green, and stretching away towards maturity. With regard to the mode of securing the crop for winter use, gentlemen have their fancies. I prefer leaving the plants in their original trenches, ear thing up to the top of the plants, and covering with straw litter and boards, so as to protect them sufficiently from the frost, to be able to take them up as wanted; and this always fresh and and sweet. I do not fancy disturbing the roots, and transplanting into narrow qu a utters. Finally, any one in this country who wishes to have "first rate" celerymust cultivate it himself. Common laborers are sure to spoil it. Professional gardeners are seldom found, and generally too expensive when they are. Your obedient servant, Juni Of Smi  Of. On. H. L.

No. 23. Extracts from Ulcers Principles of Agriculture. Of Soi Of, &c blackish t hue on the. soil usually induces the supposition that it contains an abundance of h muss and, in the majority of instances, this opinion will prove correct, unless the color arises from the presence of oxide of iron or manganese. 'the remarkable fertility of land colored by hum us does not admit of its being long mistaken All doubts upon the subject may, however, soon be removed, by submitting a ball of the earth in question to incandescence in an open crucial e, which will allow the atmospheric air to come in contact with it; in this case, if the dark color arises from the presence of hum us, it will speedily disappear, and the earth will become quite white an, effect which is not produced when the dark hue arises from the oxide of iron. The simplest means of ascertaining and estimating the quantity of hum us contained in a soil, is to burn it. A certain portion of the soil which we wish to analyze, taken not too near the surface, should be dried in the sun till it pulverizes in the hand, and feels quite dry; the small stones should then be picked out, and the remaining portion accurately weighed, placed in acrucible heated to a perfect state of incandescence, and kept in that state for about ten minutes, (or at least until the black hue has entirely disappeared) and gently moved or stirred with a glass tube all the time. In order to accelerate the total combustion of the hum us, and shorten the. operation, a small portion of nitrate of ammonia may be united with the earth, which completely vol utilizes that substance; the diminution of weight will indicate the quantity of hum us which the soil contained. There is no doubt that the earth, especially if it be of an argillaceous nature, loses s me of that water which was so closely united with it, to be elaborated on y by the process of incandesncce. But this will make a very trifling difference m the weight; and if the earth. was previously well dried, it will not amount to a fraction. But where the soil contains a good deal of Him le, the volatilization of its carbonic acid, as well as of its water of crystalizatiop, will cause a sensible difference in The result of the experiment; it is therefore highly necessary to begin by :getting rid of the lime. The aridity Fumes may be detected by immersing a strip of blue turnoSpl paper .n a, ii quid paste formed of th earth we wish to analyze, and war, Of fili paper turns red, that may be considered as a certain sign of o ,qpaesqe ;an acid. Your or acid h genus also betrays itself by the eliarpodqr, wbicit75] 336 it emits when burned an odor similar to that given out by burnt turf. I hum us, when b turning, smells like burnt feathers, it is a sign that it originates in animal matter, and is consequently richer, and may be more easilydecomposedThere is no doubt that a more definite analysis of hum us might be effected by means of the rheumatic apparatus, and by dry distillation; but an agriculturists has it not always in his power to perform this operation. Arthur Young frequently performed these experiments, and found that the quantity of hydrogen gas which he obtained was always in exact proportion with the fertility of the soil. The experiments conducted by Priestlywere attended with similar results, and serve to confirm this fact. Lay increases the fertility of the land: 1st. By the adhesion which it contracts with water. This adhesion is so great, that, even during a long drought, the clay always preserves that humidity which is indispensable to the nourishment of plants ; and although it may appear to be entirely parched up, it is still capable of communicating to them that moisture, without which they could not exist. 2d. By the solid support which it affords to the roots of plants, as well as by the resistance which it opposes to their too great extension; obliging them to put forth several tufts of short fibrous roots, by means of which each plant seeks its nourishment in the circumscribed spot, and, consequently, does not deprive its neighbors of their fair share. 3d. By preventing the atmospheric air from coming in contact with the roots of the plants, (to which it is almost invariably injurious) and by communicating to them a moderate and equal be degree of warmth ; thus preserving an equality of temperature, notwithstanding the constant changes going on in the atmosphere. When argillaceous land is not too damp, the effects of sudden changes from hot to cold, and vice versa, are consequently less injurious to the crops growing on it, than they are to those which grow on sandy soils. 4th. It attracts oxygen, the substance which is so necessary to the formation of carbonic acid. It probably attracts nitrogen also; and thus favors the reciprocal action of these substances upon each other." In the other hand, an excess of clay is injurious: 1st. Because, in damp weather, it retains the water with which it is impregnated too long neither suffering it to drain nor e vapor ate, but forming with it a tenacious paste. 2d. Because, in dry weather, it becomes too hard, opposes too great a resistance to the roots of the plants, and not un frequently contracts, and becomes like a mass of brick. 3d. Because, both during the summer heat and winter frosts, it cracks into gaps or clefts; by which means the roots of the plants are torn, or brought into immediate contact with the atmospheric air, which is generally injurious to them. 4th. Because it forcibly attracts and incorporates with itself all the nutrition juices contained in the manure bestowed upon it, and cannot be made to part with the mi again so easily as in loose r and lighter soils. In fact, when it has once been thoroughly ameliorated, and in a manner saturated with manure, and brought into good condition, it retains its fertility for a considerable period; but, if once impoverished or exhausted, the first maturings bestowed upon it have little or no effect upon the vegetation. And of this nature, therefore, must be man red very plentifully, or the first crops' derive little or no of from the amelie ration. 5th. Because it renders the task of cultivating the soil extremely difficult. In damp, wet weather, it is almost impossible to pass either plough, harrow, or wagon over it; it 337 [75 sticks to the two former instruments, c logs them, and impedes their action, and with difficulty can be divided while, in dry weather, it contracts, and becomes so hard that it is with the greatest difficulty a plough can divide it even into large clouds; and these, until they have been moistened with rain, can neither be broken by the harrow nor the roller, and, not un frequently, a mallet is obliged to be used for this purpose; and even then, the end in view is but imperfectly attained. The injurious effects of an excess of clay may, in part, be counteracted by the addition of hum us; but, as we have already stated, this will not entirely obviate them. Time is also rather beneficial in this case, as we shall presently see; but nothing is so really beneficial as sand ; and that is the substance which is generally used. The superior layer of the soil always contains some portion of sand; and were not this the case, it would scarcely be possible for any agricultural instrument to act upon it. Consequently, the estimation of most land sought principally to be based upon the proportions in which clay and sand are united in them Previously to pointing out what these proportions are, I must, in the first place, explain precisely what I mean by sand. My intention is to designate, under this term, that coarse grained s iliac which, when any portion of earth is carefully washed, is precipitated to the bottom of the vessel, and there can be collected. Recent experiments have shown us, when clay is boiled in water, a considerable quantity of fine grained s iliac is separated from it; and that, if this operation is prolonged, and carefully performed, the alum in a will at last be deprived of nearly the whole of its s iliac. I t appears that the quantity of this fine s iliac constitutes the principal difference which l exists between rich and poor clay; that clay, properly so called is always combined, at least in an intimate manner, with a fixed and definite quantity of s iliac, although it may be mechanically united with a much larger portion. I cannot as yet affirm that such is the case, but I think it very probable is the end we now have in view is to regulate and determine the value and utility of land according to the proportions of its constituent parts, and to effect this purpose in the simplest possible manner, we shall not pay any attention to this fine s iliac, which cannot be separated except by boiling, but regard clay as pure when it has been carefully washed. I n, by far the greater number of cases, at least fifteen parts more of fine s iliac, might be extracted, by boiling from a hundred parts of clay which has been purified by washing. The proportion of this substance obtained from some particular kinds of land is still greater. The experiments and researches hitherto made do not enable us to determine how far clay, which contains a still greater portion of this substance, is benefited by the addition of sand, and what quantity of that matter is necessary to give it the desired degree of porous ness. When the soil is composed of almost equal parts of pure clay. and of that kind of sand which can be separated from it by washing, we designate it clay land, or potters earth; and we preserve this denomination so long as the soil does not contain more than from 40 to 60 parts in 100 of sand ;and, according as this proportion is increased or diminished in it, loose or stiff and tenacious dr clay land. A soil which contains less than. 40 parts in 100 of sand is called argillaceous land .the smaller the proportion of sand which it contains, the more stiff and tenacious does it be cone, and the more evident a ire the defects of the clay. And containing 75 338 at most, only 20 parts in 100 of sand, is very stiff and crude, and cannotlbetilled without great difficulty, unless its defects are corrected by a considerable admixture of hum us and lime. I to quality, however, depends in a great measure upon the nature of the clay, and the quantity of s iliac which enters into its composition; such a soil is less defective if, while it contains only a small portion of sand, it possesses a large quantity of s iliac. Ghent his argillaceous land does not contain sufficient humans to enable it to bear, wheat without being manured afresh, and consequently cannot be entered in ;the first class, it will be termed wheat land of the second quality, or second rate wheat land; but then it must not be totally destitute of him us. In rising grounds or eminences, we seldom find land, submitted to ordinary cultivation, which contains more than 3 parts in 100 of this compound matter; nevertheless, this land is well adapted for wheat, and that species of cereals succeeds much better, and with less trouble, than rye. Next to wheat, barley thrives best there, if the soil contains from 30 to 40 parts in 100 of sand ; but when it only contains a smaller proportion, and this defect is not remedied by a strong admixture of lime, it is better adapted for oats, Such land is also exceedingly proper for the growth of vegetables, provided that it is sufficiently ameliorated. That which contains most sand is favorable to peas; while a stiffer and more tenacious soil grows beans with greater advantage The value of land diminishes in exact proportion with the decrease in the quantity of the sand contained in it, unless it belongs to the class of mary or calcareous soils, or to those which are strongly impregnated with hum us. Thus, a soil containing 40 parts in 100 of sand is of the greatest blue, while that which contains but 5 -parts in 100 is much less esteemed. A tenacious and argillaceous soil, which is plentifully manured, and situated where an alternately hot and moist temperature not only favors the operations of sloughing and following, but the processes of vegetation, is sometimes very superior, especially for the growth of wheat; but if 'we, come to consider the difficulty there is in cultivating it, and how much more uncertain and casual the crops are there than they would be on a lighter soil, there can no longer be any doubt as to its inferiority in value. I estimate land which contains 2 parts in 100 of natural hum us, 40 of sand, and about 60 of pure clay, at 70; that which only contains 30 parts in 100 of sand, at 60; that which contains but 20 parts, at 50 ; that which contains only 10 parts, at 40. Should it not possess more than 1 in 100 of hum us, its value is decreased at least 20 per cent. Thus, tenacious soil, with little for no mild so ruble hum us, and which is usually termed cold, damp land, is actually one of the most sterile that possibly can be; and may, in poicid127nof value, be assimilated to sandy land. In the other hand, its value is increased in proportion to the quantity of hum us and clay Which it contains and such l land may even be good enough to be entered in the first class, when it can be abundantly manured and properly tilled: And which contains more than 40, or from that to 60 parts in 100 of sand, is usually designated clay or potters earth; but the less the proportion of sand falls below 40 parts in 100, the greater is the value of the land, opposing it to possess an equal quantity of hum us. There the proportion if sand does not exceed 50 parts in 100, the soil is equally adapted for the production of wheat and barley. But when that proportion increases from 0. to i 60 parts .cid127t 1.00, wheat .certainly may be grown i there, :provided the soil is properly cultivated; but the crops are never very fine or very abuncid127339 [a[ 75 ]dan t, and the land is much more impoverished than it would have beendifdropped with rye. Such a soil is, however, peculiarly well adapted for barley, and may be classed arriving the very best of those laid is which are destined to bear this kind of grain." The inherent advantages of a soil of this nature, (viz: of causing the crops to be less casual and uncertain, being more easily worked and tilled, preserving a moderate degree of temperature and humidity, &c) render it so very superior to argillaceous land, that, notwithstanding, its being le it adapted to wheat, it may be assimilated to wheat land in all its gradatioris. In this case, the g radiations are in an exactly inverse direction; 40 parts in 100 of sand appearing to us to be the best proportion. In the former came, the value of the soil decreases when the proportion of sand diminishes; it the latter, on the contrary, the value decreases when the proportion, increased, but not in the same ratio From the observations which we have hitherto been able to make, the value of the soil appears to be almost equal in the following opposite (cid127cid127iportionsSand. Sure clay 50 parts in 100. 50 parts in 100.60 do 100. 40 do 100.35 do 100. 65 do 100.30 do 100. 70 do 100." That is to say, the former are defective on account of their want dfdf6sistence, and the latter on account of their too great tenacity." This kind of land may be vigorously tilled without becomingpulverized ;neither does it hard en into clouds and furrows i It is seldom injured v by a ii excess of moisture, and yet preserves sufficient humidity to enable it to resist the effects of drought for a considerable period; and young plants suffer much less in it than in tenacious soils, because their roots are better able to extend in all directions and penetrate it; and this is the reason that barley succeeds and flourished so much better here. Such land will doubtless only bear fine crops of wheat when it has been thoroughly amelioratedbut when in a less fertile condition, it produces finer crops of rye than are grown on more argillaceous lands. It is also peculiarly adapted for vegetables, as <a name="potatoes569"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and ra dishes; for c lover and other kinds of fodder; and for plants of commerce, as cabbage, linseed, tobacco, &c, the cultivation of which is easy. It seldom offers any opposition to the action of the plough and harrow; and on this account, though it does not yield fine or :large crops of wheat even in favorable years, it ought, in the g radiations point i d out, to be assimilated to wheat land, properly so called' And is injurious when it enters too largely into the composition of the soil: 1st. Because it is not sufficiently rete native of moisture, but it allows the water to e vapor ate or drain away, and carry with it the fe utilizing particles and juices. 2d. Because it does not combine with the sum us, and hardly enters into a physical union with it sufficiently strong to absorb thosefertilizing particles which the atmosphere contains. 3d. Because sandy soils will not bear frequent cultivation, although constant tillage is necessary, in order to destroy the weeds which multiply so rapidly in land of this nature, especially when it contains a lair quantity of hum us ; an d beck i .i these repeated workings deprive it of every particle of coherence, and, instead of amelie rating, tend rather to impoverished it, by bringing to the surface all that hum us which was amassed in the interstices without being 75 ]a] 340 combined with the soil, and thus exposing it to the action of the atmosphere and the wind, which rapidly decomposes and carries it away. 4th. Because sandy soils being good conductors of calorie, they transmit the influences of severe cold or intense heat immediately to' plants, at each sudden change which the temperature of the atmosphere undergoes." A soil which contains more than from 60 to 80 parts in 100 of sand is termed sandy clay. The value of this land diminishes in proportion as the sand increases. If that which contains 60 parts in 100 be valued at 60,land containing 65 parts ought not to be estimated at more than 50; 70 parts decrease the value to 40; 75 parts to 30; and, lastly, that which contains 80 parts to 20. Heat crops cannot be reckoned upon here, with any degree of certainty; and if the land contains 70 parts in 100 of sand, it is not at all adapted to the production of this kind of grain, unless it be submitted to a peculiar enriching course of tillage l but it is well calculated for barley, particularly when the situation is favorable, and the summers are not too dry. It is easily worked or tilled, but is more liable to be overrun and infested with <a name="seeds53"><mark>seeds</mark></a> than argillaceous soils. It has no great degree of adhesive attraction for manure; but, on the contrary, rapidly decomposes that substance, and allows it pass into the plants which ve get ate there. His accounts for it requiring frequent maturings, although these need not be very plentiful. When rich and abundant amelie rations are bestowed upon such land, it will become very rich in hum us, and eventually be rendered exceedingly fertile ; but this fertility rapidly declines, if the soil is submitted to an exhausting rotation f it contains 75 parts in 100 more of 8 and, it is usually designated oath and; nevertheless, if we take the average of several years, we shall see that it is more proper for barley than for oats, provided it be sufficiently manured soil which contains more than 80 parts in 100 of sand is called sandy land; and if the proportion of this substance does not exceed 90, it is distinguished by the term clay by sand. Usually, so long as land does not contain more than 85 parts in 100 of sand, it is comprised in the class of o at lands ; nevertheless, the success of this grain is by no means certain, and it often yields little or no produce. Eye and buckwheat are the only kinds of grain which it bears with any degree of success; and if it has been ameliorated, it is always better to sow successive crops of rye, than to sow oats after rye; because the dryness to which this soil is exposed during the summer is less pre judicial to rye than to oats. Of all the plants or vegetables which are grown for the purposes of feeding cattle, <a name="potatoes570"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been cultivated with the greatest success on this sort of land" But the frequent sloughings which, when this land is in good condition, must be bestowed upon it, in order to cleanse it from weeds, are apt to render it so loose and friable that not any of the cereals can be made to succeed on it. This is the reason that it is advisable to allow it a certain repose, or to lay it down to perennial pasture; and this latter is the means by which the greatest amount of advantage can be derived from it; for when sown with sheepsfescuegrass, (fesfuca ovum) rye grass, (l opium pere one) Dutch cloveririfolium re pens) common burned, (po tedium sanguisorba) &c, it produces a pasturage which is exceedingly well calculated for sheep, although not usually sufficiently wet for cattle." 'after this period of pasturage or repose, the land may be cultivated afresh; and will, if sown with rye, yield very fine crops 341[ 75 ]the value of it decreases in the ratio of 1 for every 100 in which the proportion of sand increases; and this diminution takes place even wheat he land contains from I to 14 part in 100 of hum us; and if, as sometimes happens, it contains a yet smaller proportion, its value is still, less But if the land contains 90 parts in 100 of sand, it then belongs to a still lower class. Unless it is properly manured, nor until after a long period of repose, can it be made to bear a crop of cereals with any degree of advantage; and then this crop impoverished it very much. And which does not contain more than 94 parts in 100 of sand may, if properly managed, and sown with the small varieties of the fistulas and verbal grass, be made to yield herb age enough to feed one sheep per acre during the period of repose. But when the soil contains a yet larger portion of sand, it will only bear gray hair grass, (area cane scene) yellow goatsbeardtragopogon pratensis) and some other plants which contain scarcely anynutritive juices. It then falls into the class of loose, blowing sands, the surface of which it is very dangerous to break, because then the wind moves it, and carries it away in whirlwinds. It may be regarded as an invariable rule, that sandy soil loses at least 1 part in 100 of its value by the augment at ion of a hundredth part in the proportion of sand ; and when it degenerates into loose, blowing sand, it possesses a mere negative value in by far the greater number of cases While lime has produced such astonishing improvements 'in the crops, it must not be forgotten that it is at the expense of the earthy exhaustion of the hum us, so necessary for vegetation; and hence the absolute necessity of maturing the land, in order to restore what is taken away. Without this precaution, barren ness will ensue. Some soils already contain too much lime. In this point, Mr. Hers remarks are worthy of attention." That proportion of lime in land, which is most advantageous to it, is a quantity equal to pure clay. Fall the fifty-three varieties of soils produced by artificial combinations experimented on by Billet, that which appeared to be most favorable to the vegetation of grain was composed of three-eighths of potters clay, four-eighths of shell or fossil mary, and one-eighth of sand The more lime a soil contains, the less sand is required to correct the defects of the clay. But it is highly necessary that some portion of sand should enter into the combination; for, without that substance, mary, when dry, would be too tenacious, and, when moistened, too soft. General experience confirms the fact, that the proportions indicated by Billet certainly are the best." But even when lime is mingled with the superior layer of the soil, in so small a quantity that it scarcely appears to have an influence on its consistence, it increases its fertility probably by means of the chemical action which it enters into with the hum us and manure. From general experiments and observations, (which, nevertheless, cannot be very correct) it appears that 10 parts in 100 of lime raise the value of argillaceous or clayeysoils from 5 to 10 per cent, and even higher, when the land contains a large portion of hum us." In the other hand, lime is injurious when the proportion of it contained in the soil exceeds that of the clay. When the lime is mingled with much sand, it forms a soil too dry and warm, and which, even when plenMiifully manured, cannot be made to yield good crops of any thing but those 3 s42evgeables which cannot e materially injured by drought as maize &cthialJky soils, which are principally composed of lime, are of this ntiUreadsr both from drought and hiduidity; becoming in the latter case, sloughy" W hen speaking of the soils in which hum us forms the chief component part and in i which this substance cannot be easily exhausted, we allude to, to: which contain more than 5 parts of it in 100. Such is only the case, however, in alluvial soils, or those which are formed by the deposit e of rire or of the sea. High grounds and mountainous districts both thosewicih contain a large portion of clay, and those in which sand is the pre pond i rang ingredient rarely possess 5 parts in o 100 of hum us ; indeed, tile y, sad om contain more than 3 parts of mild hum us, especially at thecloeofa rotation, when they almost always require fresh maturing, ino9fyer to enable them to yield profitable crops. The quantity of humusccid127) tapped in a soil diminishes in exact proportion with the number and p l. ti n of the- crops derived from it; allowance, however, being made fr' tie, manure which. it receives. This diminution is not, I however, so. sirablcid127) as it appears, or might be expected to, be: "a, i *a* .a. *a* " The tenacity and degree of co lesion existing between the parts of a soil can be best ascertained by examining it eightandfortyhours after a gentle rain. Those who are accustomed to observation can ascertain all they wish to know upon this point by merely driving a sticking the soil- and sometimes even by simply pressing a foot upon it. Sjlporming an estimate of the value of a soil, an examination of its4iEth , would follow immediately after an examination of its constituent parts. By the depth of a soil, I mean the thickness of a layer of earth which a forms its surface the layer which is usually termed vegetable earth, and w ici is homogeneous, and equally impregnated with hum us throughout its people extent. In most land, it descends very little below the depth oft ha layer which has been recently removed by the plough. When a section! is cut vertically, the line of demarcation between the vegetable earth ad the sub soil is very apparent. Sometimes this layer is not more than three inches deep; but the usual depth is about six inches, and it sometimes extends ten or twelve inches below the surface. It is only in those places where the soil has been amassed and deposited by the action of water or when an extraordinary system of cultivation has been carried on, the .we find the soil equally impregnated with hum us to the depth of one, two, or three feet: six inches may, we think, be regarded as the average of, the soil. We shall therefore consider that, in order to be exempt from defects, and to be equal to the value which an investigation of its constituent parts leads us to give it, a soil must possess this depth or thickness deep soil contains a larger portion of vegetable earth, and of that succulgncy so necessary to the nutrition of vegetables; and even if this excess of vegetable mould should not be useful to all plants, it agrees with some :of them, even when the whole depth of the soil is not turned up. In, besides, this thickness of the superior layer of his land enables a skilful husband man to draw at will upon the riches which it contains, and occasionally, or about once in six or seven years, to turn it all up, and profit by the stores of succulency and nutrition which the under part of it will yield. The roots of all :plants sown in a soil of this nature even those of the tribe of cereasipenetrate in a right line, and seek that nutriment at a. greater depth, which they would otherwise have had to extend themselves laterally in 343 [75 ]ore ri to obtain; and they may therefore be sown much thicker, without causing any detriment to the crop. A deep soil will therefore yield much larger crops than a shallow one, provided its nature is similar, and that it is equal in all other respects The roots of corn are not as some persons assert never more than six inches in length; I have seen them exceed twelve inches, where the soil was deep enough to admit of such an extension. The roots of vegetables and c lover penetrate much deeper in a right line. The same may also be observed with respect to ulcer ne and root crops, And, therefore, in which, the layer of vegetable mould is very thick, is peculiarly favorable to the cultivation of these crops. Besides, such land evidently possesses one very great advantage namely, that of suffering less from humidity than drought. The water which falls upon it has more room to penetrate before it encounters the understratunmaiSoils which have no bottom, or in which the layer of vegetable mould is so thick that it is scarcely possible to reach the -bottom of it, either by sloughing or by digging it up with the spade, present the possibility of preserving the fertility of a soil without the addition of manure; the fertility may be equally kept up either by thoroughly digging and raising the soil, or by excavating successively from place to place, and spreading those: portions of earth' over the surface which& have been derived' from the interior parts. Such soils are, therefore, of an almost incredible value. But in what proportion does the greater or less depth of a soil increase its value ?a? 'he have already supposed six inches to be an average depth which a soil ought to possess in order to be exempt from defects on that point; and we are quite convinced that every inch added to the depth of land increases its value 8 per cent; so that a soil where the vegetable layer is twelve inches thick is worth half as much more as that in which it is only six inches. We are not, however, prepared to say that the value increases in equal proportion when the depth is yet further increased, and becomes so great as to render it scarcely possible to reach it by means of simple sloughings; but, as the vegetable earth, which is beneath the layer turned up with the plough, cannot fail to be beneficial to plants, we shall not hesitate to affirm that every additional inch of depth beyond twelve adds 5 per cent. to the value of the soil in the other hand, we should advise that, in general, the same proportions should be observed in dear easing the value, according as the upper stratum of earth diminishes below six inches, which we consider to be the average. I f, therefore, a soil of 6 inches thick is worth -50 That which is 7 -54cid127cid127- ' : _a_ -58' 10 9 " ' -672 -a] : -a, 7 40 5 .a- -a- 464 4 42 -a" 3 .h -o ' -y There is no doubt that a soil might acquire this increase ;of value ;byS7j5 344 means of the artificial deepen iris or thickening of the layer of vegetable earth. With regard to the expenses with which such an operation would be attended, they vary greatly; at one time exceeding, and at another falling below, the value of the increase of depth and in which the vegetable soil is shallow above the sand, which constitutes the under stratum, can bear little or no sun, and is very much exposed to the effects of drought; although it appears to be, and is, very fertile during a damp temperature or in spring, while it yet retains the moisture which it has imbibed during the winter months" Both the chemical action of lime, and the effect which it produces as a manure, appear to be of two kinds. In one hand, it acts on the hum us byaccelerating its decomposition, and rendering it so ruble, and thus fit to enter the minute fibres of the roots of plants. This is the reason that anamelioration composed of lime is the more efficacious the richer the soil isa hum us, and that its action is the more sensible in proportion as this hum us is of an insoluble nature. Time deprives sour hum us of its aridity, and renders it fe utilizing. But, on the other hand, there is every probability that, by means of its carbonic acid, lime also produces some other effect, and furnishes the plants with some actual nutrition matter. The roots of certain vegetables in particular appear to have the faculty of depriving lime of its carbonic acid, which it immediately re absorbs in equal proportion from the atmosphere with which it comes in contact. It cannot be denied that an amelie ration of lime invariably produces some effect, even on land which contains a very small quantity of hum us, and that a repetition of this amendment is never without its effects; although they are, of course, very far inferior to what they might have been if the soil had contained more hum us, or had been manured with vegetable or. animal matter capable of producing that substance. Besides, every one must be aware that lime communicates a peculiar degree of vigor to some plants, and that the roots of these can even penetrate rough limestone, and in a manner de compose it. This remark is particularly applicable to sainfoin, the tap root of which penetrates from ten to twenty feet deep into calcareous stones, and there puts forth clusters of lateral roots which render the stone loose and friable all around them. The deeper the roots of this plant penetrate, the more vigorously does it shoot, even on calcareous rocks, or stony places which are only covered by a very thin layer of poor soil time which has been calcined, and deprived of its carbonic acid, is much better adapted for the amelie ration of land, and far more efficacious, than carbonate of lime. In its former state, it contributes infinitely more to the decomposition of the substances with which it is united, and acts far more efficaciously on organic matter than it does on the latter. But we r must admit that its increased efficacy arises from another cause. It very soon re absorbs equally as much carbonic acid from the atmosphere as it lost during the process of calcinationespecially when, after having been thus reduced to powder, it is mixed with the superior layer of the soil. But the carbonic acid, which it has thus recently regained, is not, in general, so intimately combined with the lime as not to be easily absorbed by any plant, the roots of which come in contact with it. The lime continues to attract fresh portions of this substance; and thus a permanent communication of carbonic acid is established between the lime, the roots of the plant, and the atmosphere. This may serve to explain the reason that even calcareous soils 345 [a[ 75.]may be remarkably fertilizes by the, addition of lime ; and that a sensible effect is. produced by an addition of this substance, even when the soil already evidently contains a great quantity of it which has been accumulated there by former amendments." In no soils are the effects of lime so beneficial as on those which contain a great quantity of sour hum us pre judicial to vegetation, or on those which have been supplied more or less abundantly with animal manure for a considerable period, without receiving an application of lime, or of some other substance of a similar nature. In the latter case, it is frequently much more efficacious than an amelie ration of stable manure would be; but it soon impoverished the soil so much, that in a few years it becomes indispensable necessary to manure it abundantly with rich animal or vegetable matters. As some portion of hum us (although, in all probability, of an insoluble nature) always remains in arable land, even when it appears to be most exhausted, it of course follows that an application of lime will always be productive of very marked effects, even on the poorest soils; because it will call into action all the nutrition particles which they contain. A second amendment of a similar nature, bestowed shortly after the first, will be productive of some, although, in general, of much less benefit; and the effect of each subsequent amelie ration of this nature will be progressively diminished, unless the soil receives an additional supply of humusThe effects of lime are far more marked on some crops than they are on others. Various observations have given rise to the opinion that it is more efficacious when applied to spring corn than to autumnal crops and that it is peculiarly favorable to vegetables, and also to c lover and grasses. Argillaceous soils are better able to bear repeated ameliorationsof lime, than those of a sandy nature; because, in the first place, the physical action of this substance tends to loose n the texture of the land, and, in the second place, its chemical action lessens the disposition which all clays have to retain hum us. When marshes or bogs have been' drained and are brought into cultivation, they are capable of bearing repeated and abundant amelie rations of lime, because they always contain a variety of substances susceptible of decomposition, and on which the lime can exercise its solvent influence. The effect produced by lime on land of this nature is much more beneficial and dura be than that of any other manure." In the other hand, repeated amelie rations of lime will soon totally exhaust and impoverished poor and sandy soils, and reduce them to absolutesterility, even though each separate application seems to be productive of some good effect. If the lime is unable to find any organic matter on which to act, or does not meet with clay, (an earth with which it has, in all probability, a disposition to combine, and with which it forms mary) it then unites with the sand, and gardens into a kind of, mortar, which cannot be dissolved without difficulty. When such soils have been too frequently and abundantly manured with lime, the action of the plough brings an immense number of pieces of hard mortar to the surface, which are with difficulty divided. Wherever this is the case, the land must receive repeated maturings before it will again be capable of bearing good crops. The truth of this statement has lately been demonstrated on several estates in Silesian, and occurrences of a similar nature have been remarked in those counties of England in which the triennial rotation with a fallow is practised, and where few cattle are kept, and which possess an abundance of lime *a* *a* *a* *a* *a* *a* *a* *oh ]a] 346 any persons who have not rightly comprehended the cause of th effects produced by in me prefer it to manure, and have believed in the possibility of doing entirely without the latter; but the total exhaustion of the soil, which such a course of proceeding: must sooner or later produce, caused it hem to fly to the opposite extreme, and to regard the use of ideas an application in the highest possible degree pre judicial and dangerous. Anendlightened and scientific agriculturists will soon perceive that the use of- lime can never supersede that of dung, but that it renders this kind of manure more energetic in its action. Thus he will profit by the increased fertility which lime bestows on the first crop which succeeds the application of it, and will procure as much I as possible of those substances xvhibhare adapted for the production of dung, in order to restore to the land, in the shape of stable manure, that substance of which it has been deprived by the lime forcing and increasing the vegetation of the crops to. which it was applied. He will likewise know when lime will be beneficial andwtheninjurious; and, if he acts with moderation, will be able to employ lime with much advantage, in cases where many persons would be afraidtojuse its to. 24. Sowi Of Of Grai The inquiry and waste of grain, from the present practice of to thickly sowing. As in the following paper I shall propose to cultivates of my country averycid127) considerable reduction in the quantities of seed which they have beenaupstorred to use, and shall endeavor to show to them that the questionreqtirsjtheir serious attention, not only for the economy of seed, but principally as very materially affecting the after growth of their corn, it may be well to premise that this recommendation does not emanated, from athperetical agriculturists, farming only in his; closet and over his books, orQfUom one who follows agriculture as an amusing occupation ; but, on the contrary, that, besides being largely engaged as a land agent, and in the cultivation of farms for the proprietors, I am a practical and successful farmer n nm own account, of between 700 and 800 acres of highly rented poor land ; and, moreover, that whatever I am about to recommend, I have not only long and successfully practised, and on a large, scale, butt that I have ever been willing and ready to support it, by s ho wing the crops in this way, producedd; and, I am sure that any farmer who witnesses these, willre4aily allow that, with the adoption of the system of thin sowing, I grow very; large crops much beyond the general average and on soils of a very, inferior description, and with less than the ordinary expenditure in labor and r manure." -three are few persons who seriously take into consideration how small a return is commonly realized fro i the seed sown, and how large a proportion of that return is again swallowed up for seed. Met us take wheat for inman ce. The practice throughout England is to sow two and ;a half orthtrei bushels .per acre, and the yield is seldom forty bushels, and, more commonly, only twenty bushels; and: one tenth, at: least, ,of the crop growing is consumed as end, These, facts, and the knowledge 'that a single grain of wheat, planted where it, has room to tile r out t, will readily 347 [a[ 75 produce four hundred fold, and often very much more, has, induced, me, in the course of the last eleven years, to make a variety of experiments; the results of which have shown me that, independent of the waste, a positive and serious injury is done to the crop from sowing so much seed and: in result, is perfectly analogous to attempting to feed ,four animals on a pasture sufficient only for one; and, in consequence, I have gradually reduced y proportion of seed wheat from n three bushels per acre, which was my practice, down to about three pecks; which reduction I have accomplished, to the evident improvement of my growth of corn. And I have at this time (july, 1843) the finest promise of a crop on all my farms, from this after quantity; and this, to, after one sloughing of pea and bean stubbles, and upon soils very low in the scale of natural fertility, and without having had any fallow, or having had applied any mantle for some years. I n order to show that it is not by any artificial aid that I have grown the crops produced on my farms, and in reply to the questions which I, have so often had put to me as to what is .my practice, I go into the following details. By, course of dropping is as follows, viz :first years ye and takes: for green meat, and feeding off with sheep inlApril, May, June, and, July; ;and followed by m angel wurtzel, swedes, cabbages, and turn is, with a liberal dressing of farm yard dog. Second year Oats or barley, with c lover. Third years lover twice mown for hay. Fourth year means or, peas: the beans having, turn is sown: between the rows, and which come into feed in September or October. Fifth years heat. By this rotation of dropping, I never; grow two crops of a kind in succession; and I get three green crops and three corn crops in five years. The produce of corn and cattle food grown by me in this way, I do hot hesitate to say, is very much larger than I could obtain by any other; and at less expense, and far less hazardous. My t practice is to drill every thing closer seed alone excepted) to carefully horse he, hand he, and weed, so that the land may be: kept perfectly free from weeds and the soil: between the rows may be stirred, and receive the .benefitTofpuilverizationandarationadvantages of which ,gardeners are sensible, but by farmers are lost sight of, or not sufficiently attended to. My rye and takes, for green feeding, are sown in rows, at nine inches intervals; all .my white corn at twelve inches; and my) pulse at twenty seven inches. When I r have established this routine, the only dressing given is; for the root crop; and that with manure produced on the farm by the consumption by fitting s took of the swedes, and of hay; and straw and fodder, by other stock in the yard. I fatten a large proportion of sheep- -at least two. and a half in the year for every arable acre. These consume on the land having oil cake, and is i, folds all the turn is and cabbage, and had the rye, takes, and swedes ;the, feeding being so arranged that the folds extend alike over the parts cleared with that fed. My proportions of seed per acre, and times of sowing, areas; follows, viz Of rye, licid127bushel, in August and Septembertares1 ~a~ bushel. in the I sowing sign August, September and Octobermangelw urtzel, 6 pounds, in Apriswaedes, 1 quart, in May. Turnips, 1 quart, in July. Cabbages, 1 every 3 feet, in June. 75 ]a] 348 Oats, 8 pecks, inrFebruary and March. Barley, 7 pecks, in February, March, and Aprilwheat, 3 pecks, in September and October. Seas, 8 pecks, in January and February. Means, 8 pecks, in September and October. Between the crops which are sown at twenty-seven inches intervals, I constantly, in the spring, use the horse hoes, (beginning with times which bring to the surface all root weeds) and pulverize the soil, and alternately with knives, which cut all on the surface. By the free use of these hoes, and by hand hoping the narrows own corn, and by drawing all weeds from out of the rows, and by using Finlaysons harrows after most sloughing, I have brought my land clean, and without following; and I am. sure I grow better swedes and turn is after rye and takes than I used to do after fallow, and am much less attacked by the fly. My sloughings are all as deep as I can afford to give time and strength to them. I occasionally use the sub soil and trench ploughs going fifteen and sixteen inches deep, and bringing all the fresh soil to the surface that I can get up. My farms are naturally very poor. Two are principally gravel; in parts very boggy and spring y, wet in winter, and burst up in summer reclaimed from heath only thirty years; and the other a hill farm, with but few inches of soil above the chalk. These farms have been greatly improved by the free use of the sub soil and trenching ploughs, but are only kept in profitable tillage by the general economy in husbandry, and the large returns I have obtained. In this way, and on these farms, I have frequently produced about five quarters of the best white wheat to the' acre; and have grown above thirteen i quarters of oats, and above eight of barley ; and my c lover and turn in crops are always remarkably good. Having, from this brief detail of my practice, shown the success, on an extensive scale, with thin sowing, I will explain why it is that three necks of seed wheat, per acre, must be much nearer the correct quantity than tenor twelve pecks; and that any surplus of seed beyond a bushel must be very injurious to the latter growth of the crop. The produce of an ear of thick sown wheat yields about forty grains say thick sown, for thin sown yields very much more) and therefore the produce of an acre (or twenty bushels, the ordinary average) must be, no matter how much has been sown, the growth of the ears from onefortieth or two pecks of seed and that, too, is allowing only one ear to grow from each grain, and forty grains from an ear. This being the fact, of what use, I ask or what become of the remaining eight or ten pecksfseed which are commonly sown? But, in allowing one ear only to grow from a grain of seed, and each to contain only forty grains, I am far from taking what in reality should be the produce; for a single grain, having room, will throw up ten or twelve ears, and these ears will each contain from sixty to eighty grains; and hence any provision for the loss of seed from ver min or birds is unnecessary; for, supposing half, or much more, of my small allowance to be taken away or destroyed, the deficiency of plants is immediately met by the larger size of the ear, and by the tiller ing which is made, and the additional ears so produced wherever room admits of the increase. Among the many proofs I have had of the advaa349 [a[ 75 stage from thin sowing, the following is a striking, and, among my people, a well known fact. In the autumn of 1840, I had to sow with wheat afield of eight acres, and I gave out seven bushels for the seed; but, owing to an error of the drill man in setting the drill, when he had sown half of the field he found he had not put on half of the seed; but, that I might not discover by the over plus his error, he altered the drill so as to sow the rest on the remainder of the field; and in this way one half of the field had little more than two pecks to the acre, while the rest had nearly four necks. I did not know of the error, and was surprised and frightened in the winter by finding part of the field so thin, and, had not the rest of the field looked so much better, should have ploughed it up; but, at harvest, the thin nest sown li all proved the best, and I should never have known of the error in the sowing, but for this fact having induced the master to point it out to me. Were the evil of the present practice confined to the waste of seed, the loss to the farmer is considerable, and is frequently equal to the rent he pays for the land. I am also about to prove it is of far too great importance to the nation not to be deserving of investigation, But the loss is not limited to the waste of seed, great as that is; for there are many other ills attendant upon thick sowing, which greatly diminish the return, and are of far more importance. At first, no matter how much seed has bee a sown, nearly every grain vegetables and finds space to grow; and, in the early stages, when air and soil are moist, and the plants small, there is food for all. But, as the plants increase in size, a struggle for room and nourishment commences, which increases with their growth, and finally terminates by the destruction of the weaker by the stronger plants; but not until after a contest lasting up to harvest, which leaves the survivors stunted, and the soil exhausted, by having had to support three plants instead of one, and producing mischief, which is frequently the cause of blight, mildew, and failing of the crop. That this struggle does take place, is shown by my calculation of the number of straws that can rise into ear compared with the grains sown and is plainly betrayed by the yellow sickly color of the thick wheat in the spring, when all other vegetation puts on its greene st tints, and by the uneven crops and the small size of the underly ears at harvest, as compared with the thinner sowing. Nature, in their growth, plainly betrays the evils of thick plantations of every description, by the swindling plants, and by their sickly appearance; and the planter and the gardener are ever ready to take warning by the lessons she thus affords. The planters and forester well know the after ill effect of an overcrowded plantation; and he gardener, by the free use of his he, is careful to give ample room to each plant. It is the farmer only who, guided by his eye, is pleased in the early stages of his crops to see his ground well covered with plants of young corn, without stopping to reason upon the room wanted, and the power of the soil to bring them to maturity. That the sowing of much seed must be injurious in the after growth, appears to me self evident; for in what way can Nature do away with the extra plants so produced, without injury to the remainder ?a? And it is to this, I repeat, I would principally ascribe the mildew and blight and failing of the crop; for, so far, my practice proves it, that, since I have taken to sow only a bushel of wheat per acre, (and I have done so now for some years, and on many hundreds of acres of wheat) I have rarely found any portion affected by any disease and so satisfied i am ll by the result of my practice, as shown by i my crops this year, that, although I last year sowed so little, I this year .in ted to farther reduce the quantity. The importance of the inquiry, even in a national point of view, will be striking to every one who is made acquainted with the fact, that, were my practice of thinner sowing general, the proportion saved each year would amount to much more than the annual average of the quantity of foreign corn imported into this country during the last fourteen years. The total quantities of wheat and flour imported, during the fourteen years ending with 1841, were as followsQuarters1828 -590, 9 29 1829 -1725, 78 1 1830 -1662, 280 1831 -2 309, 6 70 1832 -469, 90 2 1833 -297, 565 1834 -176, 321 1835 -66, 905 1836 -241, 74 3 1837 -559, 94 2 1838 -1371L9571839 -2 875, 605 1840 -343 2, 765 1841 -2, 7839602Total -17, 566270Averaging per annum 1,254;73:The population of England, Scotland, and Tales, which, at the end of the year 1831, amounted to 16,366,011 persons, had increased, in the year 1841, to 18,666,761 persons. For the purpose of calculating the consuaiiption of corn during the fourteen years ending with 1841, I consider the population to have averaged, during that period, 17,000,000 persons. Taking the annual consumption of 17,000,000 persons at the ordinary allowance of a quarter of wheat to each person, it will amount to 17,000,000quarters ; and, de ducting the quantity imported, 1,254,733 quarters, leaves the quantity annually consumed of our own growth to be 15,743,267 quarters- Allowing that the average produce per, acre of wheat grown in the kingdom is equal to 20 bushels, and that of these 174 bushels are appropriated for food, and 24 bushels for seed, it follows that about 17,713,425'quarters must have been annually grown, and that, to produce this quantityy7085370 acres have been sown with wheat. Now, to sow 7,085,370 acres at 2- bushels of seed per acre, (which is the ordinary allowance) there would be required 2,214,178 quarters. Butit6 sow one bushel per acre, only 885,671 quarters would be required; so that the annual saving of seed would be 1,328,507 quarters; that is tocsay73774 quarters more than the average of the annual importations of foreign corn the last fourteen years. And although I merely take n t instance of i wheat, I am, at the same time, proving what may be done with all other corn; for the saving in seed which I practise is in equal proportion with all other kinds of grain, and with equal success. Having thus proved the magnitude of the national saving capable of being made seed in corn; and having shown that if my system of thin sowing were universally adopted, there would be no necessity, even with r present enlarged population and without the advantage of increase in the crop, for /the importation of any foreign corn; and that net one e a actual saving to the farmers of arable land to the extent f half their went may be made hope every practical :far r -will be induced to give h 351 [a[ 75 ]thin tr sowing a fair trial. Met parts of a field be drilled with one busheloftwheait per acre, at a foot apart, taking care to hand he the same in- the spring, and to have all weeds extirpated; and I promise that, att harvest supposing in all other respects the field to be alike) these portions will yield the most and best sample. The expense of seed wheat is generally 7s: or 8s. per bushelycid127andrthedifference between one and three bushels is therefore 14s. or 16 sa saving per acre of consequence; and if I be right that a larger and better crop will be obtained from the lesser quantity, I shall have done a good to the farmer, that will enable him to compete with the foreign grower and lower prices, and, by placing this country independent of any foreign supply, make all corn laws of little consequence ; and, for many years to corneywemay grow all we want, and to s pate. Hewi Of Davi  .3 Frederi  Cks Place, Old Jewry, London, July 15, 1843. No. 251 The Manuri  Of And Steepi Of Of <a name="seeds54"><mark>Seeds</mark></a>. By :james F. Of Johnston, F. R. S. S. L. and E., honor are -number of the Royal :agricultural Society of England. Public attention has lately been drawn in this country to the possibility of so maturing, or otherwise doctoring, the <a name="seeds55"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of our usual grain crops, before they are put into the ground, as to do away with the necessity of maturing the soil itself. It has been long known to practical farmers; that, by sleeping their <a name="seeds56"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in urine, in salt and water, or in other solutions, and sprinkling them while wet with quick lime, their growth is inmantaycases promoted, and the rust, smut, and: similar diseases, in a great degree prevented. It has been observed, also, in regard to <a name="potatoes571"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, that in some soils a dusting of lime makes the cuttings more productive than they would otherwise be; and that, when powdered with gypsy m, they thrive still better. The absolute effect, indeed, of all such applications to the seed corn, or to <a name="potatoes572"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, will, in every case, be modified by the kind of soil i which the seed is sown. 'If the soil abound in common salt, the salting of the seed will be less efficacious ; while if it be rich in lime, or in gypsy m, the dusting of the <a name="potatoes573"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with these substances will produce a less striking effect. Met the above observations of practical men show that it is possible, in certain circumstances, and by the use of certain substances, s to doctor or manure the seed we intend to sow, as to make the growth of our crops more sure, and the return of our harvests more abundant. From this limited conclusion, which is justified by experience, some persons have hastily leaped to the general assertion, that all <a name="seeds57"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may v bpsodoctored as, in all circumstances, to grow more luxuriant tly; ad; ,cid127still father, that they may be so treated as to render i unnecessary anyamanring* of the soil in which they are to be sown 0. It is in Germany that this latter broad assertion has been most confideintymade, and most pertinaciously repeated. I t. has met it h: some credenbe[ 75 ]a] 352 also among ourselves, from persons chiefly, who, like the German father of the statement; know a little more than the general it y of practical men, but who do not know enough to enable them to see the difficulties that beset their own views, nor the limits within which their statements are true. It will, no doubt, interest the British farmer to read the statements of those who bring forward these novel views, and to consider the degree of probability which exists as to their expectations being realized. The great discovered in this new line is Franz Heinrick Riches, of Last el, near Mayence, who has published a pamphlet under the title of an " Account of the Discovery of a Method of Cultivating the Soil without Manure" in which he thus speaksSThe discovery of cultivating the soil without manure has been carefully verified in different countries, and in the most dis similar soils. It is twelve years since the discovery was made, and, it has, during this time, been more and more tested. The experiments have been made, at various seasons of the year; and the same crop has been repeated on the same soil, without regard to the usual rotation of crops." The cost is very trifling a shilling or two an acre; and the supply of the substance used instead of manure is inexhaustible He then expatiates on the importance of his own discovery : "' It is not good' says Plato' to push our investigations too far. The natural sciences find their limits, beyond which the mantle of I s is covers what is mysterious, An any one reveal the nature of force, of life, and of motion' The mantle of I si is now, by this discovery, at length removed t is not the discovery of a mere crude substitute for manure; but the result rests on a knowledge of the nature of plants, by which the vital power is increased in all respects, and their existence elevated and en no bled !were follow some of the results of his new method: " Who can assign limits to the growth of a plant ?a? I possess dried plants of wheat, consisting of fifty-six and fifty-seven s talks; I indian corn, grown in a poor soil, with three or four stems, and eight or nine heads; sunflower s eleven feet high, with flower discs fourteen inches in diameter, and <a name="seeds58"><mark>seeds</mark></a> as large as small coffee beans; <a name="potatoes574"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> above seven feet high, and tubes in proportion. Marin as and Havana tobacco have, for eight, years, preserved the well known flavor of their native country Drift sands have produced crops equal in quality to the neighboringoamsAll parts of the plants, stems, roots, leaves, <a name="seeds59"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and fruits, have been equally improved. The tubes of <a name="potatoes575"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and other roots, are tenderer, and more agreeable to the taste; turn is and fruits more abundant in sugar flowers of brighter hues, and higher perfume Agriculture can now be prosecuted after an" entirely new method. Manured every year almost without cost, plants will develop e themselves almost spontaneously, and yield the largest returns rotation i of crops is a mere beggary from the soil! Very third fourth, or fifth year, the farmer manures a third, a fourth, or a fifth of his whole farm; and in return, he has the pleasure of seeing his fields green, without putting much into his pocket; while now, the most profitable crops may be raised, with a luxuriant e hitherto unknown. The author here calculates the present cost of maturing the soil ; and, supposing the new method to cost only one fifth, shows how many millions the adoption of it would annually save to every nation in Eurcid127pe. He 353 [a[ 75 ]when adds: ' Consider how much land in every country at present yields little or nothing, and yet might be brought into the greatest fertility and how many people might enjoy life upon it, who are at present a burden to the Statelook to England. What fearful want now exists in that country, the resources of which are every year diminishing. Men daily die of hunger, and the most talented statesmen are without hope of mitigatingthe evil. , For several years past, the city of London has been paying24000000 of florids of poors rate, while the whole of Germany pays only60000000. Berlin pays annually 420,000, and 40,000 souls are tax free. All these could find, in the neighborhood, land susceptible of cultivation, on which they could not only live, but from which they could pay taxes to the State" <a name="potatoes576"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> are vegetable bread; I indian corn also is a wholesome nourishment; both grow beautifully on the lightest drift sand; with the former, the whole sea shore might be covered The practical farmer will justly consider that I chess mode of treating his seed <a name="potatoes577"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> must be something wonderful, to make them grow well on the sandy downs that line so much of our coasts. But he proceeds to give testimonials as to the efficacy of his method, and the truth of his statements. These testimonials are from practical men in various parts of Germany, and must be deserving credit to a certain extent. It will be proper, therefore, to hear what they say. The first two are dated Vienna, 182s "and are signed by four persons. They refer to seed sown in the imperial gardens. From the second of them I quote the following( In general, the plants from the prepared <a name="seeds60"><mark>seeds</mark></a> exhibited a very much stronger growth, were of a deeper green, had thicker stems, finer and fresher leaves, larger grain, and the grain was thinner skinned, and therefore contained more meal. In particular" 1st. The hemp was of a much larger size, and had many side shoots bearing seed 2d. The I indian corn had mole heads." 3d. The buckwheat was upwards of three feet high, and full of seed 4th. Heat, rye, barley, and oats, are thicker, and have more numerous stems, larger ears, and more grains in each( 5th. The ulcer ne was beyond all comparison stronger, had more shoots, and its roots were as thick again." 6th. The disks of the sunflower were doubled in diameter, the cabbage had larger heads, the cucumber large fruit, while the un prepared seed yielded nothing quote further, what must be considered as a mere opinion adopted in part, no doubt, from the sanguine Mr. Riches himself: " Since this highly beneficial discovery renders all manure unnecessary, and can be applied to the poorest soils without the necessity of having a previous stock of cattle to produce manure which, from want of fodder, is in many places impracticable ; as the material is of little cost, and as the corn crops will require less seed, its benefit to agriculture must, in many respects, be incalculable, "the next two testimonials are dated from Offenbach, in August, 1830,and are signed by five persons. Three of these had allowed their seed to be prepared by Mr. Riches, and thus speak of the effects when sown, upon their own fields 23[ 75 354 The prepared wheat had from 10 to 15 s talks from each grain of seed, and the ears and grains were larger. The rye had nearly one half more, and larger grains in the row. The two bowed barley had from 8 to 15 s talks from a single seed. Generally, the produce was greater than on the best fields of their farms. The prepared flax was one half heavier in stems and seed capsules, and the latter were double in number ; and when the un prepared had already become yellow, the prepared was still of the deepest green. But the <a name="potatoes578"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> ex celled every thing yet known in the most productive fields. From a single <a name="potato382"><mark>potato</mark></a> there were seldom less than 10, and sometimes 17 strong stems; while ii the best fields there are seldom more than one third of this number All other plants, c lover, beans, turn is, &c, are said to have been equally benefited. One-fourth only of the usual quantity of seed of wheat and rye was sown on a poor un productive clay, and yet the produce was greater than on the newest land of good quality, though aided by manure. Two testimonials follow, dated September, 1831, signed by burgomasters, town counsellors, gardeners, schoolmasters, farmers, and landvaluers17 in number. The following is an extract from the one which relates to experiments made in a garden at Bildingen: "' 1st. Several sunflowers had a height of 10 to 11 feet, the foot of the stems being 81 and 9 inches in thickness. The stems consisted of firm wood, and contained as much combustible material as young fir trees of for 10 years of age." 2d. Men or twelve <a name="potato383"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants gave, on an average, 30 large <a name="potatoes579"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> each, and had stems 7 feet in height." 3d. Fifteen s talks of I indian corn had, on an average, 5 heads each some having as many as 8 or 9 heads to a single plan The next experiments quoted by the author were made at Amsterdam, in 1843: " The buckwheat was 4- to 5 feet high; the flax had from 4 to 5 stems from each seed; the I indian corn was from 9 to 10 feet in height, and had 4 t 5 heads from each seed; the white c lover was as large in the leaves and stems as the red c lover usually is; the red c lover and ulcer ne 3 feethighThese results were obtained from the prepared <a name="seeds61"><mark>seeds</mark></a> alone, without manure, on a depth of six or eight inches of the drift sands of the downs, arranged in beds for the purpose of the experiments Between 1834 and 1839, nothing is recorded regarding the progress of the authors discovery or researches; and he leaves us to infer that in this interval nothing had been done; since, under the date of September, 1839,he inserts only an extract from a Mayence newspaper, containing a statement of some of the results obtained in the former years. To this is sub joined one other testimonials, dated November, 1841, declaring that his <a name="potatoes580"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> sown on un manured soil were superior to any others in the neighborhood of Last el, where M. Riches resides. I think the conclusion which is fairly to be drawn from a careful perusal of this pamphlet is, that, for a few successive years, the author had made experiments upon the preparing of <a name="seeds62"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and, out of a number of less successful, had obtained some very interesting and striking results ; that he had then laid the matter aside for about as many years more ; and again, in 1841,made a solitary experiment or two, which lie has incorporated with his previous results in his pamphlet of 1843 o For twelve years, therefore, he has 355[ 75 1 been more or less occupied with the subject; but, during all that time, he has never published or given any account of his process for preparing the <a name="seeds63"><mark>seeds</mark></a> according to his method. He is one of that class of discoverers who wish to sell their secrets, and, by magnifying their importance, hope to derive a larger profit from di bulging them. With such men, the true friends of agriculture can have no sympathy. I do not think, however, that his pretensions are wholly unfounded, or that by a skilful study of the preparation of <a name="seeds64"><mark>seeds</mark></a> much good may not hereafter be derived by practical agriculture. The reasons for this opinion will appear in the sequel. No. 252STEEPI Of <a name="seeds65"><mark>Seeds</mark></a>. By F. W. Johnson, Esq, c c. Fyccontinued. Another German pamphlet, on this subject, has lately appeared from the pen of a Mr. Diet or, an apothecary at Neidetholm, in Hesse Darmstadtunder the title of " The Maturing of Needs; or a simple and cheap cultivation of the soil by the artificial maturing of <a name="seeds66"><mark>seeds</mark></a>; by which, at the same time, the rust and other diseases of the corn crops are prevented practically tried for five years, and proved on a large scale." By C. L. Diet or. This author describes' his methods, and is, so far, more worthy of the attention of the practical man. Before detailing these methods, however, I shall insert a few of his preliminary observations. As the principle upon which the maturing of the <a name="seeds67"><mark>seeds</mark></a> ought to be preferred to that of the soil, he remarks, that the manure can never be so equally distributed through the soil, that the due proportion of food shall be given to each seed or plant, and that, besides, before the plant com no  es to require it, much of the organic matter of the manure has become decomposes and lost; and that even the in organic matter is liable to assume forms of combination in which it can with difficulty be made available to the nourishment of the growing plan These disadvantages may be avoided by maturing the <a name="seeds68"><mark>seeds</mark></a> themselves, which we it to grow; while, at the same time, the following advantages will -attend the adoption of this method 1. The same crop may be repeated on the same soil, though already exhausted, or even in any way usually un fruitful soil 2. We can manure the <a name="seeds69"><mark>seeds</mark></a> with those special substances only which it is not likely to find in the soil, or of which it l has been exhausted by previous crops. This is an advantage which is possessed by all saline and mineral manures, and is one of those benefits which will appear more clearly and strikingly to the practical man as he becomes more familiar with the natural wants of the crops he wishes to raise, and with the kind of substances which are present in his soils and in the manures such as farm yard manure, which he usually employs in preparing them for the seed 3. As the rotation of crops is rendered necessary chiefly by the abstraction of saline substances from the soil, it may be rendered unnecessary b adding again these substances in such a way as to be within the reach o[ 75 ]a] 356 the <a name="seeds70"><mark>seeds</mark></a> only. Thus, by sleeping the <a name="seeds71"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in sal ammonia c, and drying them with flour, the deficiency of salts may be supplied 4. The rust and other diseases of corn plants are owing either to an excess or to a deficiency of food in the soil. These extremes can be best avoided by maturing the seed itself with the proper materials, and in the proper degree. " Thus" he says, "in a field of wheat, after oats, upon a poor soil, a portion of the seed, which had been prepared with sal ammonia c, gave only a light crop; while another portion, prepared with oil also, gave a crop twice as heavy influenced by these considerations above stated, (some of which may, to a certain extent, be regarded as questionable) Diet or has been induced to try the maturing of the <a name="seeds72"><mark>seeds</mark></a> before they are sown; and, from the success which has attended his results, to recommend it to others. The substances he employs, and his mode of using them, are as follow Substances employed. Blood, in the liquid state, is mixed with oneeightieth of its weight of flaubert salts dissolved in a little water. When thus mixed, it may be kept for a long time, in a cool place, without concealing or undergoing decomposition or clotted blood may be dried, either alone, or mixed with a little earth or powdered clay, and then reduced to powder. 2. Fool, hair, parings of leather, horns, hoofs, and bones, are charred in close vessels until they are capable of being reduced to powder 3. The dung of all animals is dried, and reduced to powder 4. Oats and oils of all kinds are mixed with so much earth, clay, or rye meal, as will enable the whole to be reduced to powder. Oil cakes are also powdered for use. Rode of using theme makes up a semifluid mixture, with which he miles the <a name="seeds73"><mark>seeds</mark></a>; and then he dries up the whole by the addition of the powdered manures already prepared. His semifluid mixture is thus prepared: For a bushel of wheat, or other grain, take 20 to 30 lbs. of clay in fine powder, 14 lb. of wounded sal ammonia c, or 3 lbs. of common salt 3 to 5 quarts of whale, rape, or other cheap oil; 15 to 20 quarts of fresh blood, or blood kept in a fluid state by means of flaubert salts, or, in the absence of blood, as much water; 3 to 5 lbs. of linseed meal, or wounded oil cake. These are mixed together intimately, and water added, if necessary, to make a half fluid mass. The seed is then to be .poured in, and stirred about till every seed' is completely enveloped by the mixture. Layer of one of the following dry mixtures is then spread on the floor, over it the manured seed, and then another layer of the dry powder; the whole is then stirred together, and left to dry. Cry mixturesOf these drying mixtures he describes several, consisting chiefly of powdered clay, mixed with one or other of the dry powders already mentioned. Thus, he recommends mixtures of 1. 75 of powdered clay, 8 of horn shavings, and 17 of bone dust 2. 85 of clay, with 15 of fluid, or five of dried blood 3. 85 of clay, 5 of charred hair, and 10 of oil cake 4. 60 of clay, and 40 of powdered dung 5. 70 of clay, 25 of charred leather, and 5 of bone dust 6. 70 of clay, 10 of fat tallow or oil, and 20 of powdered dung. These are all to be finely powdered, and intimately mixed. The principal alleged use of the clay is, to make the other substances co here together, and to attach them more strongly to the grain 357[ 75 1 When the mixture of grain and manure is dry, it is broken up with the hand, and thrown upon a fine si eve, which allows the loose powder to pass through, and the uncovered grains; and then upon a coarser si eve, through which the dressed <a name="seeds74"><mark>seeds</mark></a> pass, leaving the lumps in which two or three <a name="seeds75"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may be present, and which are to be carefully broken up. He prescribes, further: That much caution is to be used in completing the operation so quickly that the grain may not be permitted to sprout, and thus become liable to injury during the succeeding operations. When it is wished to grow corn after corn, in fields manured in the usual way, Diet or recommends mixing, for each bushel of seed, 2 to 3 pounds of sal ammonia c, or 4 to 6 pounds of common salt, with 10 to 15 of rye meal, adding a little water, stirring the seed well among it, and drying the whole in a stove. Such is the substance of Victors pamphlet and observations. I have stated the in pretty fully, because I think he deserves thus much at the hands of those who are interested in the progress of practical agriculture because he has stated the reasons for his procedure; has described his processes fully, and claims neither great merit nor great reward for alleged great discovery. Besides, there is a show of reason in what he states for though we may very fairly doubt (or, perhaps, entirely disbelieve) that the quantity of manure with which he envelopes his <a name="seeds76"><mark>seeds</mark></a> can be sufficient to supply the wants of the crop that is to spring from them, yet there can scarcely be a more economical way of employing the same quantity of manure-one in which there will be less waste of it, or in which it will be more useful to the growing plant. In every way of applying manure to the soil which has hitherto been adopted, a large portion never reaches the roots of the plants. Even when drilled in along with or near the <a name="seeds77"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, a notable quantity escapes from the roots and is more or less completely lost to the crop it is intended to feed. Such must obviously oe the case, to a very much smaller extent, where it is in actual contact with the seed it is to nourish, and actually envelopes it. Still it is doubtful whether the gain or saving effected by this method will be equal to the cost of time and labor which it involves. Should such a mode of maturing be found easily practicable, more skilful mixture s than those of Vietorsuch as would be more certain to succeed, and such as would be fitted especially to aid the growth of this or that kind of crop could easily be suggested. In illustration of this opinion, I will here briefly state the facts from which I am led to believe that considerable benefit may, in reality, hereafter accrue to practical agriculture from a careful study of the effects of certain known steeps, or prepared mixtures, upon the after growth of the <a name="seeds78"><mark>seeds</mark></a> upon which they have been tried 1st. The quantity of in organic matter contained in the grain of wheat, oats, barley, &c, is comparatively small. In wheat and barley, it varies from I to 2 per cent. of the whole weight; in oats, it is about 3 i per cent but a considerable proportion of this is contained in the dusk with which the o at is usually invested. But, though small in quantity, this in organic matter is absolutely essential to the perfect condition of the seed, and the healthy growth of the plant that springs from it 2d. When <a name="seeds79"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are stepped in water, they swell and increase, in bulk. They absorb a portion of the water, and of any saline Substances it may[ 75 ]a] 358 hold in solution. Now, if the small quantity of saline or in organic matter which exists in <a name="seeds80"><mark>seeds</mark></a> does really promote their growth, may not a larger quantity promote it more ?a? May not the growth be more luxuriant if the need be stepped in water containing saline substances in solution, and be thus made to absorb an additional proportion ?a? It does not appear unreasonable to suppose that ~a~ bushel and a half of seed wheat may be made to absorb a pound of saline matter. This appears, indeed, to be only a very mall quantity; and yet, if absorbed, it would add one half more to that which the seed naturally contains. We cannot pronounce beforehand, with absolute certainty, that, by this absorption, the growth of the seed would be greatly promoted, though both theory and practice concur in rendering it probable. Thus the experiments of Riches, whose mode of preparing <a name="seeds81"><mark>seeds</mark></a> appears to be a simple sleeping in saline solutions, appear decisive in favor of the opinion that such artificial additions to the saline matter of the seed do really (in some cases, at least) greatly promote the growth of the <a name="seeds82"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and increase the luxuriant e and produce of the after crops. The fact that saline manures are beneficial, in many cases, to the growing crop, when merely applied to the soil, is in favor of the same view. The salts, it is true, when applied to the soil, enter the plant by its roots tut, nevertheless, their action is simply to yield saline matter to the plant in larger quantities than it could otherwise readily obtain it from the soil. This additional supply might at once be given it, to a certain extent, by sleeping the seed itself 3d. Further: we know that some <a name="seeds83"><mark>seeds</mark></a> terminate much more rapidly and certainly than others. We know, also, that the proportion of in organic matter, or of ash, they leave when burned, varies in different samples of <a name="seeds84"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the same kind. That contained in wheat, for example, is sometimes -i, sometimes 14, and sometimes nearly 2 per cent. of its weight, An this difference in the growth of seed, and the difference in the proportion of saline matter, have any connexion with each other to some terminate feebly, do others fail entirely, because they contain too small a proportion of the usual saline constituents of the seed ?a? Would they terminate better if more were, by some means, given to the seed ?the same experiments of Riches, upon the effect of sleeping, seem almost to answer these questions in the affirmative. They at least render it very probable that some such relation does exist between the two differences to which I have alluded. The same may also be said of the observations made by Mr. Fleeing, of Barochan, that seed wheat which had been dressed the previous year with certain saline substances grew more luxuriantly, and gave a better crop, than that which, though grown on the same field, had not been so top dressed. It is not very unreasonable to suppose that this better growth of the dressed seed might be owing to it shaving obtained, from the substances applied to the soil, a larger proportion of saline matter than that to which no top dressing had been applied. Still, these circumstances only render probable the opinion to which: I have averted. They point out, however, new series of researches, both in the field and in the laboratory, by which the opinion will be tested, and either refuted or confirmed. In the field, experiments must be made with different <a name="seeds85"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, dressed and undressed. In the laboratory, these seems must be examined, and the proportion of in organic matter they respectively contain determined; and if this in organic matter be equal in qu at 359 [a[ 75 ]city in <a name="seeds86"><mark>seeds</mark></a> exhibiting different powers of germination and growth, the difference in the kind or quality, as well as in the quantity of the ash, must be more or less vigorously ascertained. By these united methods of investigation, we may hope, by and by, to make out what are likely to be the real and constant effects of sleeping upon <a name="seeds87"><mark>seeds</mark></a>; to what kind of <a name="seeds88"><mark>seeds</mark></a> or roots it may be applied most beneficially; under what circumstances this treatment ought to be especially adopted; what kind of saline substances ought to be applied to each species of seed, and in what proportions; and what is the nature of the influence they may be found to exercise in promoting, or otherwise modifying, the growth of the after crop. In the mean time, there are two principles by which our trial of steep sought to be regulated, by which the saline substances we may employ with advantage in our first experiments in the field, and upon different crops, are distinctly pointed out. In a future paper I shall explain these principles, and state the practical suggestions which may be drawn from them, in regard to experiments upon the sleeping of roots and <a name="seeds89"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. Durham, November 20, 1843. No. 253 From the Farmers' Cabinet. Soaki Of <a name="seeds90"><mark>Seeds</mark></a> I N Chemi  Cal Soluti Ons. A great deal has been said and written latterly, both in this country and in Europe, particularly in Germany, respecting concentrated manures. Poudrette and guanothe one made among ourselves, the other imported from a great distance are claiming the close attention of the agricultural community, which, we believe, is ever ready to embrace enterprises which hold out reasonable promises of advantage. In some parts of th'e continent [of Europe] the startling doctrine has been held, and tenaciously insisted upon, that all <a name="seeds91"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may be so treated as to grow most luxuriantly without any maturing of the soil in which they are to be sown. The article given below, in reference to this curious subject, we take from a late number of the " Transactions of the High land and Agricultural Society of Scotland." Believing it to be of great interest to the farmer to be acquainted with every process by which his earners may be filled; and to the political economist, to provide for the daily sustenance, of the millions whose daily wants are without a holy day, we mean to revert to this matter in a future numbered." There was, perhaps, no object in the exhibition of plants in the society show at Dundee, in August, 1843, which attracted such general attention as the remarkably strong and vigorous oats, growing in soil exhibited by Mr. James Campbell, of the educational seminar is of that town. The soil in which they grew possessed no peculiar property, except that it had not been manured for eleven years. The vigor of the plants, according to Mr. Campbell, was entirely to be ascribed to their seed having been subjected to a process by which they were soaked in certain chemical solutions. Mr. Campbell has, since the show, in the most liberal and disinterested manner, placed the particulars of his process in the hands of the[ 75] 360 society, for the benefit of agriculturists generally; and, to further his good intentions, the society has thought it proper to publish his own explanation of the method of conducting the process of preparing the seed, as it is given in letters addressed, at various times to the secretary." The first letter contains an intimation of Mr. Campbells intention to exhibit plants of oats at the societys show at Dundee, on the 8th of August, in a letter dated Seminaries, Dundee, 17th of July, 1843,' which was couched in these terms: Not being a member of the High land and Agricultural Society of Scotland, some apology is necessary for my addressing you. Before proceeding further, therefore, I beg leave to inform you that some years ago I became proprietor of about 140 acres of land, some of which stood much in need of improvement. My attention has accordingly been, for a considerable time past, directed to agricultural improvement in various ways; and I conceive this may be held as an excuse for the liberty which I now take in writing you" Such has of late been said and written on the subject of extraneous and other manures, and a great many no serums have been puffed off, and applied with various success. Any com posts have been formed, whose tendency is to yield abundant crops on certain soils; but it must still be confessed that no manure, or other application of much permanent y of effect, or approaching to any thing like universal aptitude to soil, has yet been produced; and, in all circumstances, the expense of manures is still very great" ' The discovery, therefore, of a process by which the cereal and othergramineous <a name="seeds92"><mark>seeds</mark></a> might be obtained in extraordinary abundance, without the use of manures, is certainly a great desideratum. Now, this desideratum, however strange it may appear, I have good grounds for concluding have attained' It is now a considerable time since I began to imagine that if the ultimate principles, of which the proximal e constituents of most of the gramineous <a name="seeds93"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are composed, could, by any possibility, be made so to enter the substance of the seed, and at the same time not to injure its vitality, as thoroughly to imbued its texture with an excess of these principles, the end would be accomplished; and it is by doing this to a certain extent, that I am convinced I have succeeded' In the spring of last year (1842) I began some experiments with oats, which were going on well, when, towards the end of July, I, left them un protected; and on returning, four or five weeks after, found, to my great regret, that my labor was lost by the depredations of poultry and sparrows. The stems were all trodden down, and not a grain left. I have this season, however, taken proper precautions the whole being so secured that no bird or fowl can get access The soil in which my <a name="seeds94"><mark>seeds</mark></a> were sown has had no manure of any kind, to my certain knowledge, for the last eleven years. I have corn in the natural slave as well as others, that have undergone the process which     use, so that a comparison of the results can easily be instituted. The results of such a comparison will be found altogether surprising. I shall be prepared to exhibit specimens of various grains by different processes, on the 8th of August, in the proper place may only further mention, that the greater number of the stems of the oats are as thick as small canes, and the leaves from 1 inch to 1,.inechin breadth, of a' vigorous dark green color; that the seed was very light 361[ 75 ]not exceeding 37 lbs. per bushel, and consisted of grains set aside for feeding poultry; that the average number of stems from thirty-three <a name="seeds95"><mark>seeds</mark></a> is eleven and a half, or twelve to each seed sown; and the gross apparent produce between five and six hundred fold, both of oats and bear am' &can the 19th of September following, which was only a few weeks after the plants had been exhibited at the societys show, Mr. Campbell resolved to disclose his process to the public, and communicated his intention, in these terms, in another letter to the secretary: "when in Edinburgh, some time ago, I took the liberty of calling at your office in the High land Society S rooms, where I saw Mr. Mcdonald, and stated to him that I intended to make further communications to you respecting my plan of preparing <a name="seeds96"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, so as to produce superior crops of grain' I have, since that time, resolved that my best way was to make a full disclosure of the process to the three great national agricultural institutions of Great Britain and I re land. With this view, I sent a communication, on the 8th inst, to his grace the Duke of Richmond, who, I then imagined, was president of both the British societies; but his grace informs me that he is not now president of the Royal Agricultural Society of England ; and, not being able to attend any of the meetings at Edinburgh, recommends me to apply to you, as secretary of the High land and Agricultural Society. I therefore now take the liberty of making to you the following communication, for the benefit of the agricultural interests of Scotland. I stepped the <a name="seeds97"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the various specimens exhibited, in sulphate, nitrate, and m urate of ammonia; in nitrate of soda and pot ass; and in combinations of these ; and, in all cases, the results were highly favorable. For example : <a name="seeds98"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of wheat, stepped in sulphate of ammonia on the 5th of July, had, by the 10th of August, (the last day of the show) tiller ed into nine, ten, and eleven stems, of nearly equal vigor; while <a name="seeds99"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the same sample, un prepared, and sown at the same time, in the same soil, had not tillered into more than two, three, and four stems' I prepared the various mixtures from the above specified salts, exactly neutralised, and then added from eight to twelve measures of water. The time of sleeping varied from fifty to ninety-four hours, at a temperature of about sixty degrees Fahrenheit. I found, however, that barley does not succeed so well if stepped beyond sixty hours' Eye grass, and other gramineous <a name="seeds100"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, do with sleeping from sixteen to twenty hours; and c lover from eight to ten hours, but not more for, being bilobate, they are apt to swell too much and burst. The very superior specimens of tall oats, averaging 160 grains on each stem, and eight available stems from each seed, were prepared from sulphate of ammonia. The specimens of barley and bear were prepared from nitrate of ammonia; the former had an average of ten available stems, and each stem an average of thirty-four grains in the ear; and the latter an average of also ten available stems, with seventy-two grains in the ear." ' The other specimens of oats, which were next the most prolific, were from m urate of ammonia; and the promiscuous specimens of oats were from nitrate of soda and potash strong, numerous in stems, (some having not less than fifty-two) and not so tall a either the preparations from the sulphate or m urate of ammonia' It was objected by some, that the tall est oats were too rank, and would break down before coming to seed; but I have no fear of that, as they were[ 75 ]362 strong in proportion to their height; and should there even be any ground for the objection, I am confident that a combination of sulphates of ammonia and soda or pot ass would rectify the excess of height, and render the grain equally productive' Have, at present, a series of experiments going on in the country, with <a name="seeds101"><mark>seeds</mark></a> prepared in seven different ways, and sown in pure sand, and in a till y sub soil, taken six feet from under the surface, and in which there is no hum us or organic matter of any kind. Long with the prepared <a name="seeds102"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are also some un prepared; and I expect to be able to form a comparative estimate of their growth, by visiting the place in October' At all events, from the experiments which I have, already tried, I am quite satisfied that, even without the application of common manures, double crops, at least, may thus be raised; and, under the application of the ordinary manures, crops tenfold greater than usual' The various salts were prepared by me from their carbonates' am' &c." The results observed on inspecting the progress of the experiments with prepared and un prepared <a name="seeds103"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, (the intention of inspecting which, in Saber, was intimated in the above letter) are thus described in a subsequent letter to the secretary, dated" Seminaries. Dundee, 16th November, 1843 :a" I should, before this time, have given you, as I believe I some time ago purposed to do, an account of the state in which I found the vegetation of prepared <a name="seeds104"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, which I mentioned I had sown about the middle of last August. I visited the place on the 12th of October, and found, to my great satisfaction, that the plants from prepared <a name="seeds105"><mark>seeds</mark></a> ex celled, in a very marked degree, those from <a name="seeds106"><mark>seeds</mark></a> sown alongside of them, but un prepared. The former had from five to eight stems, while the latter had not more than two or three from each seed; and this in an exposed situation, and among earth which was taken from a considerable depth under the surface, (about eight feet kind of reddish till, rather adhesive, and not in the least pulverized by the influence of the atmosphere ; and situate in Kinrossshire, about four hundred feet above the sea." The season of the year was, of course, not the most favorable, but the contrast was striking. I am' &car. Campbells sanction, obtained by application of the secretary, to give publicity to his process, is given in the following letter, dated ' Dundee, 11th December, 1843' I am favored with your letter of the 9th instant, and am much gratified with the very flattering reception which my communications have met with from the directors of the High land and Agricultural Society have no objection to the publication, in the Transactions, of the whole or any part of these communications; but shall, on the contrary, feel much pleased with it. I only regret that there is not now time for communicating some further particulars; but this may be done afterwards, with, perhaps, greater propriety. S If the publication committee think proper, they may mention the price at which the liquids are to be sold. I am' &c." In compliance with the reasonable request contained in the concluding paragraph of this letter, the following extract is taken from the latter part of a circular addressed by Mr. Campbell to agriculturists, in which he offers to supply them with his solutions (which he names his corn growing liquids) at certain prices. The circular, after noticing the importance of 363 [a[ 75 ]such a process as the preparation of <a name="seeds107"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, goes on to observe, that the discovered of this most important and invaluable process, confident, from the results of numerous experiments, of its complete success, now legs to intimate that he is prepared to supply agriculturists with his corn growing liquids at the following prices, viz: " For wheat, 2s. 6d. per gallon." For barley, 2s. per gallon." For grasses and oats, I s. per gallon' These liquids will keep any length of time; and the <a name="seeds108"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, when dry, will also keep without injury. The liquids are warranted not to injure, in any degree, the vitality of the seed; but, on the contrary, will promote its growth in an extraordinary degree." One third, or even one half, less grain is required for seed than is commonly used; and twelve gallons will impregnated eight bushels of grain for the operation may be repeated in the residual liquid, with additional measures of grain, as not more than one tenth is absorbed in each operation.

We have repeatedly noticed, of late, in our foreign journals, accounts of extraordinary yields of crops, from <a name="seeds110"><mark>seeds</mark></a> which had been subjected to soaking in some chemical solutions. Although not disposed to question the accuracy of the results stated, we must still affirm our want of confidence in the excessive merit claimed by them. These preparations are useful in two ways: First, by sat u rating the <a name="seeds111"><mark>seeds</mark></a> with substances dis wasteful to its enemies insects, g rubs, and worms; and, secondly, by affording to it an element of nutrition for the future plant, it is enabled to push forward vigorously in the first stages of its growth, and send out its roots and leaves rapidly; so as to derive an increased amount of nourishment from the soil and atmosphere, beyond other plants, which lack this early, rapid development of its organs of nutrition; by which means they are not only enabled to reach further for their food in the soil, and open an additional number of mouths, by its leaves and stems, to drink in nourishment from the air; but, as a consequence of this early, rapid development, plants are frequently enabled to attain a growth which secures them against the injurious and sometimes fatal effects of droughts and insect enemies; and, in many cases, to mature their fruits before the approach of frosts. These advantages, and other food yielded directly to the plant, are frequently of great importance to the crop; and may, in some instances, be worth ten or twenty times the cost of time and expense in the preparation, and are at all times worthy the attention of the farmer. But to claim that they yield all the elements of nutrition to the crop, is a perfect absurdity. They afford the same advantage to the plant that early attention to the young of animals does by helping it so far forward in strength and maturity, that it is 75 ]a] 364 enabled afterwards to gather up its own food, if it is to be found within its reach. If soil be deficient for the support of the larger plant, it must as certainly dwindled or die, as will the lamb or calf if, after it is enabled to eat grass, it is not to be had within its reach, We are justified, therefore, in concluding, that a good soil is, in every case, requisite for yielding a large crop, however the <a name="seeds112"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may be prepared. We shall be obliged to, our correspondents for the results in this treatment of <a name="seeds113"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, under any variety of circumstances of solution, kinds of seed, description of soil, and results, each minutely and accurately stated. No. 255 From the Farmers' Cabinet. Manuri  Of <a name="seeds114"><mark>Seeds</mark></a> Of Steepi Of. Well has the editor of the Cabinet called it a " startling doctrine, that all <a name="seeds115"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may be so treated as to grow most luxuriantly, without any maturing of the soil in which they are cultivated ;a' for it seems to overthrow, some of our long accredited notions concerning manures and rich soils. From pure beach sand, or an equally barren sub soil, we are promised a greater crop, without manure, than has usually been obtained from a good soil well dressed !a! and this, on the simple condition that the seed used, should undergo a short and cheap preparation !a! One cannot help' being, curious to know if this magic power, given to the <a name="seeds116"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of annual and other short lived plants, would be alike imparted to those of slower growth to the p each, for instance, of a few years, and to the oak of a hundred ?a? If so, what giants may the forest not be made to produce. Met we are bound to give heed to these claims, for they are confirmed by many witnesses; a ti the of the testimony offered to sustain them would suffice to convict of the highest crime in our courts of justice. Moreover, when we remember that a few elements constitute the food of all vegetables, and that air air water furnish the most of these ; when we see a plant thrive well in a bottle of pure water, and the sturdy oak springing from a naked rock with a few chinks only for the admission of its vagrant roots, we are led to consider whether the food of plants is not more abundant and more accessible than we had supposed; and whether the first condition of vigorous growth be not a good appetite and good digestion, to be derived only from a robust constitution through a vigorous germ or seed. If so, we have some flew to the astonishing results referred to, and some rational ground of faith in the matter. But my object was, by relating a fact having some bearing upon the subject, to encourage others to do the same ; for, doubtless, many such facts are afloat in the community, and it is only by their multiplication and aggregation that any thing like a safe theory can be formed in the premises. Some years ago, the writer was shown, by the proprietor and cultivatorof a small farm, of a light sandy soil, in the eastern part of Massachusetts, seven ears of corn, of the kind called brindled, or red and white; five were large full ears, the other two smaller, but sound and merchantableThey were all, he said, the produce of a single seed !a! This seemed almost incredible to all, especially when he added that no extraordinary care or 365 [a[ 75 dressing had been used in its cultivation; and had not the relate or been a man of undoubted integrity and noted accuracy, his account would, I have no doubt, have been discredited. But perhaps the most singular feature in: the case was to come; he had not even planted the corn it had sprung up from the dung dropped on the spot by a corn fed ox! Thus this prolific seed had passed through the organs, but escaped the process of digestion. This circumstance was viewed at the time as a most singular coincidence; but, strange to say, of the many that' were acquainted with the facts in the case, no one, so far as I know, looked upon them in the light of cause and effect. This case seems to me to go, as far as a single case can, to confirm the novel doctrine of the He man, and to justify the trial of the excrement of cattle made liquid, and of their urine also, and perhaps of the gun no, for fe utilizing seed. In reviewing this subject in the light we now possess, I cannot but consider it as promising important results to agriculture, and as pre eminently worthy the attention of every intelligent husband man. At the hands of the physiology st, too, in connexion with the animal as well as the vegetable kingdom, it seems to me the whole doctrine is worthy of the closest scrutiny; it would not surprise me if in it should be found a flew to the marked dis similarity of offspring of the same parents, occurring under what appeared to be similar circumstances. It is the intention of the writer to try the effect of the new process on the germination of <a name="seeds117"><mark>seeds</mark></a> to some extent; further than this, to test the agricultural value of the new doctrine, his situation is not favorable. I tis favorable, however, to the preparation of the chemical solutions or corn growing liquids" of James Campbell, an account of which is contained in the Cabinet of 7th month last; and it is his present purpose, in order to facilitate the attempts of others to test their value, carefully to make such solutions, and to furnish them to applicants at a barely regenerating price. Paul Swi Of. Phi   Ladelphi   A, 8th month 30, 1844. No. 26. From the I n diana Farmer. Vegetati Of Of <a name="seeds118"><mark>Seeds</mark></a>. Among the important questions which interest the gardener, is that which relates to the proper time for putting his <a name="seeds119"><mark>seeds</mark></a> into the ground. I tis well known that different <a name="seeds120"><mark>seeds</mark></a> require very different temperatures to effect their germination ; and that some plants flourish, where others would speedily perish. While the rein deer moss thrives best on the snow tapped mountains of Norway, other plants are found spreading themselves over the burning surface of the island of Anna. Familiar as these truths are, I believe no experiments have been heretofore made to ascertain the precise temperature most favorable to the germination of different <a name="seeds121"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. To give a starting point to this question, and to enlist others in the investigation, I prof for the sub joined table for publication. It is the result of 75 36 numerous experiments which I made in the years 1839 and 1840. By object was to determine what temperature at po on was most congenial to the vegetation of the different <a name="seeds122"><mark>seeds</mark></a> which 1 subjected to experiment. For this purpose, I planted the <a name="seeds123"><mark>seeds</mark></a> at various periods; noting the state of the thermometer every day until the plants appeared above ground. These experiments being repeated, and in every instance giving very nearly the same average temperature when the period of germination was the same, has led me to assume as correct the following propositions 1. When the temperature at noon is given, (other things being equal the time necessary for the development of a seed may be ascertained 2. If the period of germination be given, the meridian temperature of the country during the period may be determined 3. Some <a name="seeds124"><mark>seeds</mark></a> require a much higher temperature than others to vegetate4. When the seed fructifies in the same year in which it is planted, the proper time for putting it into the ground is when the meridian temperature is such as to produce vegetation in the shortest period 5. An increase of temperature beyond a certain point does not expedite the vegetative process 6. A complete table of the kind proposed would be applicable to all parts of the world. The letter s, in the sub joined table, signifies that the <a name="seeds125"><mark>seeds</mark></a> were soaked in water for ten or twelve hours previous to planting them.

It will serve to inform the young gardener when he may expect his plants to appear above the ground ; he will discover that, in some cases, he must wait a long time. It also shows clearly the advantage of soaking the seed. Some of the soaked peas, for example, came up in eleven days; while those that were not so treated required fourteen days, even with the advantage of six degrees more heat. The difference is still more remarkable in the be et <a name="seeds126"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. A certain writer says, parley <a name="seeds127"><mark>seeds</mark></a> " will seldom ve get ate under five weeks' but he adds: " if soaked twelve hours in water with sulphur, they will come up in less than a fortnight." I have proved by careful experiment that there is no value in the sulphur; simple water answers equally as well as the water with that addition. The Him a bean, lying twenty days in ground of the usual dampness of bring, partially decays and it codieiup, it seldom matures its fruit. Persons therefore, living in a latitude whose highest meridian temperature barely reaches 63 degrees, (see table) should not plant this seed; nor should they do it in any latitude until the nooeDays. , -6129818S -118 1828 135. -2. -21 141- .361 1- -42. -13319342212175 ]a] 368 temperature attains to 70 or 80 degrees. The month that furnishes this degree of heat is therefore the proper one to plant the beans in. Those who plant earlier will not realize a perfect crop; and, indeed, if much earlier, they will scarcely find one mature god. It is obvious that the color and quality of the soil produce a material influence upon the vegetable process. To that if the ground be of a very dark color, or inherently warm, or very moist, or very dry, germination will be more or less rapid, according to the operation of these extraordinary agencies; and, of course, there will be a proportionate deviation from our tabular periods and temperatures. But, in this case, the deviation, I think, would be uniform throughout the catalogue. If any given seed should terminate a few days sooner, in an unusually warm soil, all the other <a name="seeds128"><mark>seeds</mark></a> would be proportioriably earlier in their growth; so that the ratios mentioned in the table would be preserved. I find, by recurring to my meteorological records, that, at Richmond, latitude 39 degrees 51 minutes, the average temperature at noon of the third month is 53 degrees; fourth month, 61 degrees; fifth month 6 68 degrees; sixth month, 75 degrees seventh month, 77 degrees. John T. Plummer. Of  Chmond, I Of. No. 271 From the London Spectator, October (cid1276. I Ncreasi    Of The Ferti Of Of Of Land Of Electri  Of Of. The Bring Agricultural Association held their fourth annual meeting on Friday. Mr. Gordon described a new method of increasing the fertility of the land by electricity. In Forays hire he met with a gentleman who communicated to him many agricultural facts, and informed him that he had recently seen, on the farm of Findrassie, a plat of land which seemed to bear barley and c lover as if they were growing on a dung hill; and that that effect was produced by singular means, but easily to be comprehended by persons versed in science. Perhaps, when he mentioned it, they would call him a wire worm; and perhaps they would be astonished if he told them that the most successful agriculturists might be the teachers. for who would deny that they well knew how to lay down wires ?a? [LaughterHe came among them armed only with a pole or poles eleven feet long, a coil of common wire, and a compass; and with these weapons he trusted lie should, in a few minutes, convince them that he could wield an agricultural power not to be despised. But to proceed. He wrote to the proprietor of the farm at Findrassie, near Again, (or. Forsternot Faustusto open, with a lecture on the subject, a large room which he had built for agricultural purposes in the county of Aberdeen. Dr. Worster, however, was not able to do so; but, with a practical liberality which marked him a true agriculturists, he was kind enough to write an account of the subject, which was the novel and surprising one of the influence of electricity and galvanism on the growth of plants as applicable to agriculture 369 [a[ 75 any years since, Mr. Worster read in the Gardeners Gazette the account of an experiment made by a lady, which mainly consisted in a constant flow or supply of electricity (to be afforded by a common electrical machine to proceed from a summer or garden house, and which was diffused, by wire, to a fixed portion of the surrounding ground; and the effect was, that vegetation did not cease in the winter on the spot under the influence of this wonderful power; and that what snow fell during the continuance of the experiment ri ever remained as it did on the rest of the garden around. This impressed Mr. Worster very much, and induced him to place a small galvanic battery in action on a grass plot; and although the power from it was very small, still the effect produced fully confirmed the lady experiment. This, and other facts which Mr. Worster collected, led him to think that the electricity of the atmosphere (a constant current of which was found to proceed from east to west over over the whole of this earth s surface) might, by some arrangement, be use fully employed in agriculture for, Mr. Rose, of Aunt on, had long since proved that the free electricity of the air might be easily collected by wire suspended on poles of wood, at many feet from the earths surface the direction of the wire being due north and south by the compass; and many very interesting and important facts and experiments had been recorded by Mr. Rose, and many collected from a careful observance of the electricity proceeding from the suspended wire. Mr. Worster next placed two poles four feet high in his front lawn, which had been recently laid down with chevalier barley and grass, after draining and sub sloughing it; and over those poles, which were due north and south of each other, he stretched a common piece of iron wire, fixing the two ends of it to stout wooden pins, driven in close to the earth; and on the edges of the plot of eight English poles, and around the edge, which were straight lines, he sunk, about two or three inches beneath the earth, two wires of equal length, the ends of which were fixed and in contact with the two ends of .the suspended wire, which were meant not to be too tight, for its contraction, in cold nights, would break it in two, or pull away the fixtures, and thus defeat the object. Mr. Worster formed two of these plots for experiment, measuring eight square poles each, and then proceeded to criticise his work :and, to do so accurately, sought the aid of" Roads Popular Lectures on Electricity and Galvanism ;" and almost the first half hours perusal showed him that there was such an error in one part of .his plan as would effectually defeat his intentions. His was, that the point of a blade of grass or young corn plant has the most extraordinary faculty or power of attracting or appropriating to itself all the free electricity present, at four times the distance that the finest point of metal would or could; so that, when the points of the barley plants should reach one ,foot high, all the electricity that the suspended wire might before that have collected, and conveyed through the buried wire to the roots of the plants, would be abstracted by the points of the barley; and thus the suspended wire, getting nothing from the air, could not of course supply any thing by which all the induced electrical influence would cease. Mr. Worster, therefore, next day placed poles eleven feet high above the surface, with wires, &ce, exactly the same, except that the space surrounded by the buried wire was twenty-four poles, English measure. All the results are yet imperfectly known; but these were evident: the lWbr24[ 75 370 let plants on the two smaller plots (of eight poles each) soon became darker in color, and grew faster until they had attained to about a foot in height the darker green color then gradually disappeared ; and, at the end of a fortnight after, there was no perceptible difference but in the height of the young barley plants; and even this ceased to be very apparent as the crop advanced. When the barley of the larger or twenty-four pole plot was six inches high, it assumed the same lively dark green, and grew faster than the surrounding unelectrified barley plant; and this difference it maintained up to the last except that the color, of course, in time became yellow and it was curious that this change occurred later than in .the rest of the crop. The number of stocks or shocks was also greater, and each larger when reaped; the ears from one grain of seed were more numerous and longer; the corn, also, was larger and harder. To make assurance doubly sure, Mr. Worster fixed to the short four feet poles of one of the smaller plots pieces of dry pine wood eight feet high, and suspended two wires to them-one at that elevation, and another a foot lower down and was pleased to find that, after some time, this plot partially resumed its former darker green color. The experiment has also been tried at Liverpool, with great success, on <a name="potatoes582"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; the crops being much larger than on the other parts of the land. It was the opinion of those scientific persons of whom he had inquired, that even Professorliebig was not aware of the application to agriculture of this discovery. It seemed, then, that the meeting was now in possession of valuable details, which were known to very few persons in the whole country. He hoped some gentlemen would try the experiments, and write upon the subject; for he had written to the Royal Agricultural Society to offer 30 for the best prize essay on galvanism and electricity, as applicable to agriculture. No. 272GALVANI C Experi  Ments Of Vegetatfon. Of let Lli Of Ross. Of    R: At your request, I send a concise account of the few experiments have made on the application of electricity to vegetables. ,they have been but few in number, although at present they may be more interesting, from the fact that very recent discoveries have rendered the use of this subtle, mysterious agent, more or less advantageous in many of the arts. My attention was first called to the subject by reading in some periodicals believe one of the earlier volumes of the Gardeners Magazine) of ant experiment said to have been performed at a dinner given by the Marquis of Angle sea, of the following nature: The statement was to the effect that the <a name="seeds129"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of dress (lap ilium sat ovum) were sown in a glass vessel at the time the guests sat down to dinner, and that the crop from these <a name="seeds130"><mark>seeds</mark></a> was served to them in the salad. The seed was sown in a soil formed of clean sand, mixed with some black oxide of manganese and table salt: the whole was moistened with dilute sulphuric acid, and electricity applied. The manner in which this agent was generated, or used, was not stated ;but even without it, we all know that dress seed so treated will terminate 371 [75 in about three hours, though the seed leaves will not be fully developed in less than five hours after sowing. Dress, when used as salad, is always taken in the seed leaf; and unless we believe that the dinner was prolonged on purpose, the application of electricity must have accelerated the growth in a very rapid manner. Any observing farmers will, no doubt, have noticed that vegetation proceeds more rapidly after a thunder storm than after one which shows no electrical phenomena; and we find, on examining the various formations of the parts of plants, that they are well adapted for the passage of electricity through them, either from the earth or the atmosphere. Witness the points and serratings, as well as the hairs and down on the leaves all good conductors, and calculated for affording it a silent and easy passage. That this is the case, any one may satisfy himself by a very simple experiment. Charge a Key den jar either by mechanical or chemical electricity for both are the same, though excited in a different manner) then stick a wire in the ground near a plant, having the upper end pointed; hold the knob of the jar near, but not to touch the edge of one of the upper leaves, and let the outer coat of the jar be within an inch of the upper point of the wire in the ground. In a few seconds the whole of the charge of the jar will be silently drawn off through the plant, and the outside coating will have received its compensation through the pointed wire from the ground, the equilibrium of the jar being restored without a spark or any other perceptible effort. Were the knob of the jar to touch the leaf, and the outer coating brought within what electric dans call the 'striking distance" a spark would pass, which, were the plant of a very juice nature, as thecucurbita tribe, the shock would burst the vesicles, and the plant would die. A ligne out plant, however, will bear very strong shocks, apparently with impunity; yet a repetition would, sooner or later, rapture its vessels also. My first experiment was on some melon plants, in 1842. Only a few plants escaped the fly; through them I passed a shock from a jar containing a coated surface of fifty inches, (in short, a pint jar) and the result was, they were all killed the same day. In the afternoon of the same day, I planted some cucumbers, mixed some salt and manganese in the hill, which was moistened with very dilute sulphuric acid, and a shock passed through each hill. In the following afternoon, three out of the four hills were up, and on the next morning the whole were up, with most of the s seed leaves spread open; by the 11th day, the plants had two rough leaves; and as the day was very warm and dry, I soaked the hills with water very slightly acid elated with sulphuric acid about one quarter of an ounce to a gallon. I the fn gave some plants in each hill a shock, leaving only two in each; and to these I gave a silent charge. Those which received the shock, all died; while the others continued as thrifty as before, till the 24th day, when I moistened tie hills with pure water, as they were then beginning to open their blossoms, passed a silent charge through two hills, and left the others. The first few blossoms were all males; no fruit blossoms appeared (or rather opened) until the 28th day, when the four hills were moistened with acid elated water, and a silent shock passed through one. hill only, the others having none. I was at this time from home a few days, and on my return I found two cucumbers on the hill which received the last charge, ab of: five inches long and one and a half in diameter, which were cut and eaten. This was on a the 37th day after 75 j] 372 planting, and the flavor could not be said to be any thing different from that of the same variety (white spine) grown in the usual manner. I found that during my absence my boys had taken the other hills under their charge, and, in the course of their quick and energetic treatment, they were all killed before I returned. I may remark, that the cucumbers did not run much to vine, no runner having extended so far as two and a half feet which is rather a strong contrast to the result of the same treatment ofpumpkins in the following season. I planted five <a name="seeds131"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of a new variety of pump king among some <a name="potatoes583"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in 1843, giving then precisely the same treatment as the cucumbers had the year before, but only gave them two charges-one at sowing, and one when they had two rough leaves; they were then left to themselves, when, I have reason to believe, one of the plants died; leaving only four, which, from their luxuriant growth, entirely covered the square in the garden (57 feet long, and 30 feet wide) in which they were planted; besides, every day or two, some runners crossing the walks had to be cut off With all this luxuriant e, not a blossom was seen on them the whole season; and I may also remark, that, under their shelter, the g rubs had destroyed the <a name="potatoes584"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which were not worth digging, as nothing but thin shells of the outside were left. I also last season (1843) made some experiments with d alias; but, before the silent charge would pass freely through them, it was found necessary to water the plant all over, if the day had been very dry and hot. I will mention one in particular. In the 10th of September, I took off a cutting about a foot long, planted and shaded it till it struck; on the evening of the 15th it received a silent charge, and on the 2 3d was nearly three feet high. In that evening it received another charge, and was on the 1st of October almost, six feet high, when it received another charge. I to growth was now rapid owing, perhaps, to several thunder shower s between that and the last week of the fair of the American I institute, when it was taken to Rib los. I to height, including the root which was dug with it, was 11 feet 8 inches, while its diameter at the ground was under five-eighths of an inch. There were then two blossoms upon it, with several blossom buds; the blossoms were small not quite two thirds the size of those on the plant from which it was taken. As I have explained at length these several experiments, and also the mode of giving the shock, I shall now only mention one other experiment of last year i on the egg plant, (sol anus melon jena) In the evening of the 3d of June, I sowed some <a name="seeds132"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of egg plant in a glass cup, with these mixture as used before in the cucumber hills, and passed two smart shocks through it. In the morning most of the <a name="seeds133"><mark>seeds</mark></a> had terminated, and were in the afternoon put in the open ground. During their growth, they received three charges, and the fruit was presented at the late fair. As to their size, they were not the largest there, but they were larger than any I saw in my own neighborhood, and also larger than any I had ever before raised from plants forwarded in a :of bed with much trouble aid care in the spring. This season, my only experiment, as yet, has been with <a name="potatoes585"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and the electricity used is generated by different means from the others, which, until the discovery of Mr. Pain, was not adapted for the practical farmer, Now it is at once the most economical, efficient, and simple to apply, as may be seen by the following experiment. I had <a name="potatoes586"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted on the 373 [a[ 75cid12716th of May, and, as a first experiment with Mr. Pains discovery, I procured a sheet of sheathing copper, which is about five feet long, and fourteen inches wide, and cut a piece of sheet zinc the same size as the sheet of copper. W . Surface of ground. C, in the above diagram, represents the sheet of copper buried in the ground at one end of the rows, and z the sheet of zinc buried at the other end of the rows, and w is a copper wire, which is attached to both the copper and zinc. The result of this arrangement is, that the two metals form a galvanic battery, being in metallic connexion by means of the wire wand the moisture of the soil completing the galvanic circuit; which last is necessary, before any chemical action takes place. The <a name="potatoes587"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted in drills; but, as the copper was only five feet long, only three rows could be influenced by it. The <a name="potatoes588"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were only once hold, and, from circumstances, never earthed up. In the 15th of June, some <a name="potatoes589"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were taken by the fingers from these rows, varying from one inch. to one and a quarter in diameter; and those exhibited at the New York Farmersclub, July 2d, were about two and a half inches in diameter, and were dug from the same three rows.

These experiments can only be taken as isolated facts; no more general conclusion can be drawn from them, than that electricity accelerates the growth of plants. This has been observed by many of atmospheric al electricity ; but it has yet to be determined how, artificially excited, electricity can be made as available to the farmer as it now is to the electrometallurgist in reducing metals from their ores, or in gliding and plating, or even copying the most delicate engravings. In a future occasion I may show how a battery may be put in action by the farmer, without any other expense than that for the materials; all which, except the zinc, will last for an indefinite period, as there is no action whatever on the copper while a current is passing New Yorkifarmerand Mechanics. No. 28. From the Agriculturists Manual. Loli Of I Tali Cum, Of I Tali Of Rye Grass. Specific characters power pale se terminated by an an, or head, which constitutes the most marked distinction between this and l opium pere one, the varieties of the latter being all beardless. Botanists, however, agree in concluding that the presence or absence of an an in gram in ex does not constitute a sufficiently permanent character, from its being often caused merely by the effects of climate, soil, &c. Hence, it has been concluded 75 ]a] 374 that the I italian rye grass is only a variety of l opium pere one. The I italian rye grass, however, possesses other distinctive characters, which, although they may seem of little consequence in the estimation of the botanist, are, nevertheless, (some of them, at least) of considerable importance to the agriculturists. Compared with any of the varieties of common rye grass, the l opium it ali cum affords a stronger beard; arrives sooner at maturity has a greater abundance of foliage, which is broader and of a lighter or more lively green color; grows considerably taller; is more upright, or less inclined to spread on the ground ; its spikes are longer; spike lets more thinly set ; and, upon the whole, producing a less bulk of seed, which is smaller, has an, above mentioned, adhering to it, and is generally little more than half the weight per bushel of that of common perennial rye grass, when grown under similar circumstances. Another of its distinguishing characters is, that it is preferred by cattle to any of the common sorts a fact which has been proved by numerous experiments in various parts of the country; as a confirmation of which, the following instances may bead duced: " Part of a grass park at It four Castle, Are of Bowie, sown down insprlpg, (1833) was found to be so much preferred by cattle to the rest, which was sown by common rye grass, that, while the latter produced a number of s talks which flowered and perfected <a name="seeds134"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, the former was kept quite bare, and scarcely allowed to produce a single stalk during the whole season; and the cattle, which were kept in a house at night, on being let out in the morning, were observed to go regularly across the whole park, without stopping to feed until they came to that portion occupied by the I italian rye grass." (communicated by Mr. James Young, land surveyor andvaluator, Berth, formerly land steward to It four Castle n the spring of 1833, an extensive park was laid down at Dalkeithpalace, part of which was sown with common rye grass, part with the most approved mixtures for permanent pasture, and part with I italian rye grass alone. The whole was de pastured with sheep and cattle, and during the dry weather in July and August, 1835, the s talks or calms of the common rye grass (which were produced in great abundance) flowered and ripened into seed, and assumed a dry, withered like appearance, until the wet weather set in, in September. The mixture produced a much less quantity of calms, and retained all along a much greener appearance than the last mentioned portion; and the I italian rye grass produced scarcely any, from their being closely eaten down ; while it retained its verdure much better than any of the others, not only during the warm dry weather, but also during the whole of the previous winter. However, from the upright habit of growth which it possesses, the I italian rye grass has rather a bare rooted appearance, and seems better adapted for forming a part of a mixture, than for sowing alone as a pasture grass." (communicated by Mr. Black, land steward at Pal keith park" This plant is said to be distinguished from the common rye grasslolium pere one) by its larger leaves, by its being of a deeper green, andy the greater height to which it grows. It is usually sown in autumn, as is the general practice with grass <a name="seeds135"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in the south of Europe. After the field is harrowed, it is sown at the rate of from 16 to 18 lbs. per acre, and the seed rolled in. In the following autumn the turf is covered like an old meadow, and the crop of the following year is more than double. It maybe also sown in the spring. If it be sown with c lover or ulcer ne, its growth 375 [a[ 75 ]is so rapid that it will quickly choke them. It is eaten greedily by cattle, whether green or dry, and yields 50 per cent. of hayes there is no account of any trial having been made of this grass in Britain, it was an object of some importance to obtain a few <a name="seeds136"><mark>seeds</mark></a> or plants of it, for the purpose of observing its character and mode of growth in this country." Mr. Thomson, of Anchor y, having produced a few <a name="seeds137"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of it at the agricultural exhibition at Munich, had the goodness to communicate them to me. About the same time I obtained a small quantity of what was called a new kind of rye grass from Hamburg. These two were sown last spring and at the same time, for the purpose of comparison, was sown along with them a small quantity of Stickneys rye grass, which is held to be one of the most valuable varieties of perennial rye grass under cultivation. The progress of these plants was carefully observed. There was no difference in the period of their germination, or in appearing above ground; but, in a short period afterwards, the <a name="seeds138"><mark>seeds</mark></a> obtained from I talk and from Hamburg both exhibited a decided superiority in their growth over that of Stickneysrye grass; and this superiority was afterwards maintained during the whole of the season The general appearance of these two foreign grasses was the same, they being broader in the leaf, and much more luxuriant in growth thanStickneys rye grass; and, when examined after they came into flower, they were both found to be the same variety of rye grass. It is not known whether this I italian rye grass is a native of I talk or of Germany; neither is it known in which of these countries it was first cultivated. The whole character of this plant, so far as it has been observed, accords precisely with the account in the Bulletin des Sciences .fgricoles; and although the small scale upon which the experiment was here made did, not afford an opportunity of ascertaining how it was relished by past during animals, the account obtained from Hamburg precisely confirms that above stated, for it is represented as being softer, more juice, of a richer foliage, and morefelished by cattle than the common rye grass Though the I italian rye grass will be valuable as an early grass, it also retains its powers of growth to a late period in the season. A patch of it which had flowered and ripened its <a name="seeds139"><mark>seeds</mark></a> was cut over in the first week in November; and notwithstanding the frosts that we have since had, (occasionally pretty severe for the season of the year, at which period vegetation in plants is nearly dormant) these plants have put forth new leaves, which at present (24th December) have attained the length of above a foot, showing a superiority to any other grass producing winter herb age." This grass, too, is found to be more hardy than the common rye grass for, in the vicinity of Hamburg i the common rye grass will not stand the winters when very severe; whereas the I italian rye grass with stands these verifies of winter, even when sown in September; and, consequently, the plants are young and tender when the frost prevails That it is a perennial grass, too, has been ascertained by the cultivation of it at Hamburg. A few plants in their second year have been sent here from that place; which, though completely checked in their growth by the effects of the sea voyage, were planted about the middle of November, and have now put forth a number of fresh leaves 7] 376 From the right honorable the Karl of Lauderdalecommunicated by Mr. Thomas Hair Woodheadsa Ample of the hay of I italian rye grass, sown without a crop on the 17th of May, 1834, and cut on the 9th of August following, when the seed was found to be perfectly ripe. The field from whence this specimen was taken produced nothing previously, except rushes and other plants indicative of a cold, marshy, moor is soil. In the month of January, 1833, it was drenched and drained, and had about twelve single cartloads of lime given it per acre, with no other manure whatever; and although the produce was not weighed, yet it was reckoned by judges to be superior in bulk to what might have been expected from common rye grass grown on the same extent of superior corn land. Horses were found to eat the hay with, great aridity, and in preference to that of the common rye grass and c lover.

The first of these specimens from Mr. Mcdowall tends to show the perennial nature of the I italian rye grass, combined with its tendency to arrive early at maturity.

Also, a sample cut from the same field on the 2 8th of September, 1834; at which period the fourth crop of seed was almost ripe. In order to ascertain the permanent y of its duration, the italian rye grass was allowed to stand for another season, but was found to yield a very small return, (in 1835,) owing to the exhausting effects which the previous ripe king of four crops of seed must have had, both on the, soil and plants377No. 29IGUANO And Compost Manures. Extract from a letter of Dr. C. T. Back con. Pua no was first introduced into Europe and brought to the United States from certain islands near the western coast of South America. It had been extensively employed as a manure by the Peruvian I indians, and was known to them anterior to the conquest by the Spaniards t has within a few years become an important article of commerce, and is sought for on the most remote islands of the Pacific ocean and along the coast of Africa. Thousands of ships are now engaged in transporting it to Europe, where it is extensively used as a manure, and for various chemical and manufacturing purposes. Any have expressed a belief that it would ere long become scarce; if, indeed, it is not destined to be entirely exhausted; for no new supply can be expected when the sea birds which deposit it are destroyed or driven from their customary resting places. If it should become scarce, so as to considerably increase its cost, it might become an object of importance to manufacture an artificial substitute for it, even if the artificial should cost a little more than the natural gun no 'no wells for in the market. I am satisfied that it is an easy matter to manufacture an artificial gun no, possessing all the fe utilizing properties of that now brought from the gun no islands; and, if it should be required in large quantities, it might be made and sold at as low a price. Perhaps some variations in its composition may serve a useful purpose, by adapting it to peculiar kinds of soils or to the different crops. For instance: if more organic matter is introduced, it may operate better on soils that are deficient in vegetable substances; and it will also better suit a dry climate, if mixed with swamp much, or pe at, which has the property of retaining moisture. Some soils may already have a sufficiency of certain of the salts that are contained ing u ano; and then they might be omitted, and others which are required maybe introduced in their place. Chemical analysis will determine the ingredients in any soil, and indicate the kind of amendment, or manure, that is required. By analysis of the various crops which are usually raised, it will be easy to discover what ingredients these crops remove from the soil, and, if it has become barren, what will be required to restore it to fertility. Met us take, for instance, an' example calculated by my friend, Mr. Owertmason, of Providence; R. I., who estime ces the saline contents of the crops raised by Mr. Dam Anthony, of Providence, R. I i, from a field cultivated eight years. The quantity of salts in these crops he states to be as follows wounds. Potash .a. -i42492Soda -13192Lime -53288Magnesia -64o0SAlumina -596Silica -39040Sulphuric acid -a. -11388Phosphoric acid -10812Chlorine -5864183080[ 75] 378" It is doubtful" says Mr. Mason, "if the cultivate or ever suspected that he carried to his barn two cases of potash, one case of soda, two cases of lime, a car boy of oil of vitriol, a large dem i john of phosphorus acid, and a variety of other matters contained in his fourteen tons of fodder, which were as certainly st owed away in his rows as if they had been conveyed thither in cases and car boys." This statement will perhaps serve to give some idea of the enormous quantities of saline matters that are removed from the soil by the crops ordinarily raised. When the crops are eaten on the farm, and the manure produced therefrom is returned to the soil, there is established a continued circulation of those ingredients which would be lost if the crops were removed and sold; or, if animals are raised on the farm and sold, they carry off a part of the farm in the form of phosphates of lime composing their bones, and in the salts which enter into the composition of their various solids and fluids. Tobacco, being an article generally sent abroad, is said to exhaust a soil. Now, if this is the case, (as I understand it is) by knowing what the plant carried away from the soil, and restoring it again, we should reclaim it from barren ness. The same remark will apply to other crops that are removed and sold. Met us see, now, what ingredients are found to exist in natural guanofrom the coast of Peru, and see how far they will go towards restoring the saline matters to the soil. The following is an exact analysis of Peruvianguano, by Vaelcke.

They proved to be the c relic, apocrenic, and humid acids, and extract ofhumussubstances which enter the roots of plants by absorption, and are doubtless assimilated by their peculiar action. The salts in gun no undergo changes in the soil; the urate of ammonia soon being converted into the carbonate of that all ali; therefore, we may replace the urate in an artificial 35 9[ 75 ]gun no by carbonate of ammonia, or, still better, by the hum ate or apocreriate of ammonia, both of which are permanent, and are so ruble in water. I observed that the European chemists who had given formulas for making artificial gun no had admitted the vegetable organic matters, and that the artificial compound rarely proved equal, in fe utilizing properties, to the natural. With a view to test the questions as to the influence of the vegetable organic acid compounds, I made various kinds of artificial guanoand that which proved to be the best contained a considerable proportion of them.

I have tried this artificial gun no on posted plants, and have found it to be superior to the natural gun no of Peru. It is requisite, in the use of either kind, to employ but a little at a time, and it should be well mixed with earth, and the plants should be watered soon after it is applied. It operates best on poor sandy soil, or yellow sub soil. I have grown healthy plants in pulverized quart z, using only thisguano and water, while the plants would not thrive when I tried them in the pure quart z with water alone. If have grown c lover, wheat, oats, rye, barley, I indian corn, beans, peas, and many other plants, in a weak solution of the organic salts, like those introduced in this gun no, and they were of a dark rich green; while those grown in clear water were pale and sickly, and soon died. It was noticed, as has been remarked by He Peur , that the color of the solution in which the plants were grown gradually diminished, proving its absorption by the plants. Those who carry on farming in a large way cannot have time for nice chemical experiments; and if artificial gun no is manufactured, it must be made in large chemical establishments near cities, where the ammonia cal matters of the gas works and from urine may be employed* The operator may use nitrate of potash (saltpeter) instead of nitrate 'of soda, with equal effectHumate of potash is made by melting sawdust, or any vegetable fibre, with a very strong solution of caustic potash in an iron pot. Apocrenate of ammonia, for this mixture, may be made by sat u rating pe at, or swamp much, with a solution of carbonate of ammonia; when the whole may be mixed with the other ingredients[ 75 380 The farmer may, however, gain much by attending to the advice of chemists, for they can teach him to save much that is now too often wasted. He may by knowing that a mixture of 100 pounds of pe at or swamp much and 20 pounds of ground gypsy m, or plaster of Paris, will absorb an enormous amount of urine, without being in the slightest degree offensive and by this operation he may not only consolidate a valuable manure, but at the same time do a public service by removing a nuisance. He has only to place his cases in certain places, and he will soon have them charged with ammonia cal salts, which will prove highly fe utilizing to the soil. The same mixture will remove all unpleasant odors that are given out by vaults, and will consolidate their ammonia cal matters in the states of hum ate, apocrenate, and sulphate of ammonia; while the lime, formerly a sulphate, will be converted into a carbonate of lime, and will serve as a useful manure. A hundredweight of this mixture of pe at and ground plaster will consolidate, in an inodorous form, all the urine from four persons for a year at least; and this com post contains, besides the above mentioned ammonia cal salts, all the phosphates, sulphates, and hydrochlorates which are contained in urine. The liquid manures of the s talks may be economized in the same way. The farmer who happens to live where fish can be obtained abundantly need not purchase gun no; for he can obtain it before it has passed the intestines of birds, and, by a little management, may consolidate and preserve all the ammonia cal fumes, which the slovenly farmer allows to escape, so as to contaminated the pure sweet summer breeze with an abominable stench. Met him then mix his fish with swamp much, pe at, wood scurf, or any de composed vegetable matter, sprinkling in a little groundgypsum, to take up the gases after putrefaction has begun. He may hasten the process by mixing in recently soaked lime ; and, quickly covering the heap with pe at and gypsy m, he may keep in the ammonia c, and have an almost inodorous heap of valuable com post. If to this he adds a little notre or ni trade of soda, and a little sea salt, he will have a very good substitute for gun no, without the aid of sea birds of tropical c limes. In the interior, the farmer should make all his dead animals, and the refuse of the slaughter house and tenn in, into a, similar com post. He may supply the place of fish bones by mixing in ground or burnt horn paths and bones of animals. These hard substances are best converted into powder by following a method suggested by Mr. Levi Bartlett, of Warren, N. H., who breaks the bones and horn paths into prices with an axe, and then boils them in the refuse liquors of potash works until they fall to powder; after which, the whole bony matter and the liquid are thrown into the com post heap. A mixture of sulphate of potash and caustic potash lye will effect the entire decomposition of bone, phosphates of potash and sulphate of lime resulting; besides which, a quantity of soap is formed, and the oily and gelatinous matter of the bones is a good manure. These are all good articles for the com post heap; and if farmers generally paid more attention to the principles of chemistry, they might manufacture all the manures they require, and waste but little of those things which are required to fertilizes the soil. Very respectfully, your obedient servant and friend, Charles T. Jackson. On. Henry L. Ellsworth, "washington, . D. C381no. 292 )RULES For Appli Cati Of Of Guano1. If intended for drill husbandry, or to be used in the hill, it should be mixed in the proportion of 1 part gun no to 4 or 5 parts of wood y earth, or mould, or any other fertile earth, or thoroughly de composed manure or o part gun no, 1 part ashes, and 3 parts rich mould or well rotted manure 2. It is best, for the above purposes, not to let the mixture come in immediate contact with the seed 3. For broadcast application, it may be sown as plaster is, after it shall have been reduced into powder, either by itself, or in com post, as prescribed in rule No. 1. Whether used alone or in com post, it should be sown and harrowed in after the crop may have been sown and ploughed in 4. It may be sown in com post after a crop may have come up 5. It is a good and highly fe utilizing nature for all descriptions of crops, whether grain, 'grass, or roots; and, if properly used, will not only increase the quantity of the product, but improve the quality also 6. For root crops, 200 pounds used in com post, as named in rule No. 1,is sufficient for an acre of ground; and the same would be sufficient for an acre of corn, if used in the drill or hill 7. For wheat, rye, oats, barley, tobacco, or any of the grass crops, from 200 to 300 pounds, according to the quality of the land, will be found sufficient for an acre. 68. It should, if possible, always be applied in wet weather, and covered lightly with either plough or harrow. There neither of these modes maybe practicable after sowing gun no, the roller should be applied 9. In applying it to old meadows, or meadows which may have been set for some time, it should be harrowed in and then rolled 10. If convenient, plaster may be very advantageously used with it, in the proportion of I bushel of plaster to 100 pounds of guano11. In applying it to grass lands and meadows, the month of April would be the most suitable period, as a great object is to dissolve it, in order that its virtues may promptly come in contact with the roots of the plants. I t may, however, be used at any wet season 12. Any com post made of gun no should remain a few days before being used 13. There liquid applications of gun no may be desirable, as on tobacco beds, or in gardens, 1 pound of gun no dissolved in 4 gallons of water will comprise a most enriching manure. 'l he sediment remaining, if any, may very advantageously be used with an equal quantity of water as at first used 14. There plaster cannot be obtained to incorporate with the gun no, a most excellent substitute may be found in pulverized charcoal, to be used in the same proportion as plaster. No. 293VOGEL Of Ogano. Ameri  Can I Nsti Tute, July 29, 1844. I Ear Of    R: Guatno has become an interesting subject, and i it isaneaessaryfir us to gain all possible information about it, that we may so' far help our noble interest that of agriculture[ 75 382 find in the He vue Scientifique a recent experiment made with gun no, by the distinguished chemist Iogel; and I send the following translation of it: " M. Iogel grew two plants of the such isa fig lens in separate vases due manured with gun no, the other ordinary culture. That with guanogrew with extraordinary rapidity. It had already leaves and flowers, while the other had not a bud." He analyzed these plants; 'and 100 parts of the gun no plant, when dried at 100 degrees of Fahrenheit, weighed 13.04, while that without the gun no, weighed 19. The first contained, then, 86.06 of water, arid the other 81. The gun no then gained for the plant 5.06 of water more than the other. This explains its rapid growth. One hundred parts of the gun no plant gave, after combustion, 6.02 of ashes, while 100 parts of the other gave 7.05 ofashesThe ashes of the plant manured with the gun no contained (all other things being equal) 41.05 of matter so ruble in water, and that withoutguano 22 per cent. These matters consisted principally of alkaline carbonates mixed with the chloride of sodium and sulphate of potash. The presence of these so ruble salts contributes to explain the rapid and almost sickly growth of the plant manured with guanoThe quantity of phosphates in the two plants shows a difference of only 0 02 of 1 per cent; but as to the lime and magnetic, the difference is remarkable. The ashes of the plant' without gun no contained 40.02 per cent of the carbonate of lime, and 23.07 per cent. of the carbonate of .magnesiawhile the ashes of the other plant, manured with gun no, contained 25.04per cent. of the carbonate of lime, and 27.01 per cent. of; the carbonate ofmagnesia. This difference is explained by the considerable quantity of ammonia cal magnesium salt which is contained in gun no." In conclusion, gun no, which is rich in so ruble salts, especially alkaline carbonate, causes the plant to absorb a considerable quantity of water, and diminishes almost one third its absorption of lime to far M. Iogel. It does appear to me, from all I have yet been able to learn, that gun no will be found to be the greatest fe utilizing power on the very poorest land. I to stimulus will prove far less useful on soils already of some fertility. However, our business is to try all things, and hold fast by that which is good. I am, dear sir, yours, truly, H. Mei Of, Secretary of the Farmers' Club. Thaddeus B. Wakeman, Esq, For. Dec. No. 30. Of  Of    Nfecti Of Of Fecal Mati Eri Of Cheap Ani D I Mmedi  Ate Conversi    Of I Nto Manure. Agriculturists are acquainted with the powerful properties of poudrettemanure, The expense of its preparation and transport has hitherto limited its use to gardens and farms in the neighborhood of its manufactory g 383 [75 ]from the facts contained in the following letter, laid by M. Sum as before the French I institute in July, and which we commend to the serious attention of our readers, we learn that this potent axillary of production maybe made quickly, and at a trifling cost, on every farm. The disinfecting agent used is the sulphate of iron, or the copper as of the shops, which can be purchased tt             $1.37- the hundred pounds. Should the practice of using it for this purpose become general, it is evident a great addition will be made to the resources of agriculture, particularly in the neighborhood of towns and villages. There is one application of the solution of copper as, not alluded to in the letter, which we would suggest to those who shall make a trial of it: we mean its application to the ordinary dung hill. If each new layer added to a manure heap were sprinkled with copper as water, much, if not all, that most valuable element, the ammonia, (which is now lost by its vol ability) would be converted into a fixed salt, and thus saved. We suppose, of course, that the double decomposition which ensues on the addition of sulphate of iron to human excrement, would take place equally in the farm yard, a fact easily determined by experiment. Translated from the Moniteur I industrial of July 11, for the Cultivatorsi    R: In experimenting upon the simplest and most economical practical means of sat u rating the carbonate of ammonia of fe cal substances, I have ascertained that sulphate of iron is to be preferred. This salt, in small crystals, and of the commonest quality, may be had for 8 or 10 francs the quiet al met ri que, [220- pounds avoirdupois; in Albany, copper as is sold at from             $1.37- to             $1.75 per 100 pounds] and is more easily transported and managed than acids; which may occasion accidents in un practised hands. But sulphate of iron offers another remarkable advantage, which must secure for it a preference' The noxious and disagreeable effluvium exhaled by fe cal substances proceeds chiefly from the volatilization of carbonate of ammonia and sulphur et ted hydrogen gas, which has often been fatal toscavengers. If we pour a solution of 0 sulphate of iron into fe cal matters, a double decomposition immediately takes place; the sulphuric acid of the sulphate combines with the ammonia, converting it into a fixed salt, and the iron forms, with the sulphur, sulphur et of iron. The excavations of ammonia cal vapor and sulphur et ted hydrogen immediately disappear, and the fe cal substances lose all but a slight smell peculiar to them, combined with the odor of the little vegetable matter they contain, and are not at all offensive. When these substances are sufficiently liquid, the solid excrement share dissolved in great part; what remains precipitating as a blackish slime. I obtained this result by treating in the above manner the contents of my house or ivy. The liquid I used at two degrees of strength, for watering my garden; and the blackish deposit e, of trifling volume, which had subsided, was spread upon the beds without occasioning the least inconvenience. He cal matters saturated with a solution of sulphate of iron may be transported by day as easily as common manure, without incommoding any body. As they form a very rich manure, they can be carried to greater distances than ordinary dung, and be readily diluted to two degrees, to be used in the liquid form. (by two degrees are meant two degrees of Beaumes hydrometer, which is graduated to. 7- degrees generally ; the first degree corresponding with water taken as unity, the last representing a liquid of twice 75] 384 the density of water, so that two degrees indicates a liquid of a density 11.72greater than water. He cal substances, without previous sat duration, lose their carbonate of ammonia, which vol utilizes, and are thus deprived of their most energeticfertilizing element. The greater part of human excrements is lost at the present day, because they are not collected with care, or properly treated, on account of the repugnance they inspire. Met they are of immense importance to agriculture. The solid and liquid excrements of a man, may be estimated at 165 pound per t lay, or 618 pounds per annum, containing 3 per cent, of nitrogen, or 18 pounds a sufficient quantity, according to Boussingault, to produce 8 80 pounds of wheat, rye, or oats. S Some portions of a meadow which I watered last year with a solution of ammonia cal salts at one degree, of two quarts to the square yard, still continue to. exhibit superior vigor of vegetation, and will yield double the quantity of hay that the un watered part will give. The result exceeds my expectations; for I did not think that the action of a small quantity of ammonia would continue for several years. I no longer doubt that it will be felt for three years, at least. Ammonia cal salts may thus be easily made to supply the wants of soils where dung enough is not produced; for, if we admit that 8 80 pounds of these salts, at 5 cents and 3 mills, or about .   $47.,are required to manure two and a half acres for three years, the annual expense would hardly be               $16, (about     $6.40 per acre) which would be more than compensated by the increased production. I am, &c. Schattenmann, Director of the Lines of Roux villier, No. 31. Norwi 1, (CoNN) Run 29, 1844,. I : I have been much interested in the examination of your able and very valuable report for 1843, the first that has fallen into my hands. By its perusal, I am the more convinced of the importance of close observation, investigation, and comparison of facts, in all the occupations of life. I see you have given much attention to natures; and although my business isle aching and finishing cotton goods, and more immediately connected with manufacturing, yet I have always felt a deep interest in agriculture aridhorticulture; and, like thousands of others engaged in other pursuits, am looking forward to the time to retire from other business, and engage in it. Hoping that' my present business may render some service to the tiller of the soil, I call your attention to the following facts. In be aching cotton goods, we boil them in lime about one case to three tons of goods; this we do to extract or kill the vegetable and other oils got into them in the process of manufacturing; after boiling from twelve to to fifteen hours to remove the excess of chlorine and sulphuric acid, they are again boiled in one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty pounds crude soda (or soda ash, as it is called in market) to the three tons of goods, for ten or twelve hours; then the spent lye is drawn off, as before. Now, the most, if not all bleacheds, make little or no use of this spent lye. Supposing that a liquid so highly i 385 E 5 ]charged with all ali, vegetable and other matter, from the cotton goods, would be worth something for nature, I have had a pit dug of about eight hundred square feet, and three to four feet deep; filled it about half full of soil, into which I have run all the spent lye from both ash and lime boil i until it has become fully impregnated ; so that, in digging it over, it smells very much like how manure. I have had no time or opportunity to try its effect on different kinds of soil; neither have I found any person engaged in agriculture, who was willing to make a fair trial of it. The only trial I have ever seen, of any kind, was on a small lot, three quarters of an acre, elevated gravely land, and somewhat arid soil. The lot was divided between three tenants for a garden, equally. The first manured his portion with common barn yard manure; the second, who had the middle garden, +used the soil impregnated with spent lye; the third used little or no man tire of any kind. The season was very dry; the gardens of the first and third suffered severely so much so, as hardly to pay for cultivating. A corn field, on the same kind of soil, near by, was very much injured ; while the garden manured with the impregnated soil did not suffer any. Vegetation did not progress as rapidly as on the other lot, yet the growth was healthy. Sweet corn, which mostly covered the second lot, was of a deep green; the leaf did not roll, and showed no sign of being affected by the drought; it furnished a fair return of green sweet corn, until cut off by the frost in October. What would be the effect on different soil, or in different modes of applying it, I have no means of judging; but should take pleasure in furnishing any person who would make a fair trial of it, without charge. If it has value as a manure, it is important to be known, as a large quantity ca abe furnished in New England at small expense. I have made an estimate, from my knowledge of the be aching business in New England, and am confident that I am safe in saying that there are more than six thousand five hundred cases of lime used yearly in be aching cotton goods alone, and a much larger quantity is used by the paper makers in be aching rags that the bleacheds of cotton goods in New England use more than one million two hundred and fifty thousand pounds of crude soda, or soda ash, yearly ; the spent lye of which I think almost all is wasted. One word about soda ash. It has very generally taken the place of pot ashes. I think it was introduced among bleacheds in this country in 1835, by James See, Esq, of New Work; since which time, it has also been largely introduced into use among glass makers and soap makers. As it is an imported article, I should think it worth the effort to learn the mode and cost of production.

If a person, ten years ago, had said any thing about fattening animals scientific ally, he would have been much ridiculed. Still, there is such a thing as applying science to making pork or beef. It has long been known that certain kinds of food would make an animal fatten very fast, while others would only keep them thrifty. The analysis of the various grains and articles of food used shows the reason, and demonstrates fully the importance of a knowledge of the elements it contains. To enable the readers of the Farmer to judge for themselves, I have prepared a table, compiled from various books and papers, showing the feshformiing principle and the fat forming principle in some of the leading articles used for animal foodSContents of 100 pounds.

Means, for instance, contain the most of the flesh forming principle, corn nearly the least; while, on the other hand, corn possesses the largest amount of fat forming principle of any grain grown. Worn contains about 9 per cent. of oil. The analysis of the chemist agrees with the experience of the farmer. For we all know that any animal will grow rapidly on peas, oats, and barley; but that they will fatten much faster on corn. By mixing the food, cooking, and fermenting, so that it will be in the best possible state to assimilate itself in the stomach, the farmer can apply his feed to the best advantage. If he wish to promote the growth, feed less of corn and <a name="potatoes592"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; if he wish to fatten fast, give a greater proportion of corn. But we learn another important fact, viz: the fitting principle, is in proportion to the oil contained in the article fed. This we know also by experience; for hogs which feed on nuts, especially beech nuts, become very fat, and the nuts contain a large proportion of oil. Hence it is in the power of the farmer, by raising and feeding with <a name="seeds140"><mark>seeds</mark></a> that contain a large quantity of oil, to fatten his animals much faster than by the old process. Sunflower <a name="seeds141"><mark>seeds</mark></a> contain, it is said, 40 per cent. of oil. By mixing and grinding a small quantity of these <a name="seeds142"><mark>seeds</mark></a> with other food, it would materially hasten the fattening process. All food should be cooked, if possible, and fermented. From my owirexperience, I am satisfied that full one quarter is saved by that means. D. L., in the last number, says that the water in which <a name="potatoes593"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are cooked should be thrown away, lest some of the deleterious properties of the <a name="potato384"><mark>potato</mark></a> should injure the animals. This is theory against fact; and shows how long a popular error may go un contradicted, when the evidence is daily before us. I have fed hundreds of bushels of boiled <a name="potatoes594"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to dogs, and always ma shed them up in the water in which I cooked them and never yet saw any bad effects. Finally, observe the following rules 1st. Deep your animals warm and quiet 2d. Prepare the food, so that it will easily digest 3d, Six the food, and remember that the more oil in the food, the faster the animal will fatten though too much might make the meat soft; and much time and money will be saved.

The English farmers prize these articles highly, and great quantities are imported and used in the British islands. Oil cake is even carried from this country to fatten English beef. One great advantage which the English farmer thinks he derives from the use of it, is the improved quantity of the ma anne ;a. and this is considered of such con see quench, as to balance a large portion of the expense of the cake. Alas 75 ll 388 seed or linseed oil has likewise been sometimes used, mixed with brave, for fattening animals; and the effect has been a very rapid gain.

We e collect the practice of on em nan, in particular, who, moore than twenty years ago, was considered to ha e great success in fattening cattle. He boiled a quantity of ground flax seed, or, instead of that, pulverized oil cake, with <a name="potatoes595"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and scolded in meal, (either from barley or corn) in such qu an it y, that, when the mixture was cold, it could be cut in pieces, and in that shape was given to the cattle while they were in their stalls n the third volume of the America" Ai a' er is an' artilecid127) by I Nathanlandon, of Litebfield, Contlbn the subject of feeding cattle with cut straw, oil cake, and flax seed. I He says he fattened an ox and a three year oldheifer, with less expense even than that of common keeping, by the following process. He says' I' boiled about two quarts of flax seed, and sprinkled on to cut straw, (which had been previously sealed and seasoned with salt) together with some oil cake and o at meal, working them together in a tub with a short pitchfork, til the whole became an .oily must. Fattened the he ifer first; she was of ordinary size, and in good i oder to winter I gave her about three pecks, (of the mixture) which she ate voraciously; and in the course of four days, when the seed was gone, she was visibly altered. I fed her regularly in that way about two months, in which time she had eaten about one bushel of boiled flax seed, with the other ingredients in proportion. When she was butchered, she weighed 584 pounds, 84 pounds of which was tallow. The would not have sold before fattening, for more than               $16. I sold two quartes ofcid127rcid127r beef for 18 13.'j The cost me not more than                 $10, exclusive of the hay and straw she ate, which was chiefly scalded as above. In the 1st of February Began with the ox. I fed him about three, months, but not altogether so well as I did the he ifer. He digested about one pint of boiled flax seed a day, prepared as above, which, I suppose, formed half .the fat in these two cattle. The ox was short, measured (g i thed) seven feet two inches and, when killed, weighed 1,082 pounds, and had 182 pounds of tallow lie cost me, while fattening, twenty-five cents a day. he had previously most me thirty-five cents . My net t gain in fattening these two cattle was more than all I have cleared before in fattening oxen and cows in i fifteen years. This is owing, I think, chiefly to the use of flax seed. I never fattened cattle that appeared so calm, so hearty, and digested all their food with so much natural ease and regularity as these. I kept my cows in the same way in the month of March for one third the expense of hay. I t makes excellent milk and butter he have lately seen frequent recommendations of an article used in England for fattening cattle, called " Harness compound." Air Charlesburrell, in a letter published in the Farmers Journal, gives an account of the mode of making this celebrated compound, from which we gather the following. It is said to be a very economical and efficacious food :1st. Met a quantity of linseed be reduced to fine meal; that is to say, t every seed be thoroughly broken. 2d. But about 156 pounds of water into a copper and let it boil. 3d. Stir into the water, quickly, 2 pounds of the linseed meal, and let it boil for about five minutes. 4th. Met 63 pounds 389 [a[ 75 Of barley or bean meal be sprinkled upon the boiling mucin age by the hand of one person, while another as rapidly as possible stirs and works it in The whole will now have assumed the form of a thick mess of pudding. The fire should be put out, and in a short time the food may be given to the cattle. When cold, the compound should be perfectly stiff. Any farmers put it into moulds, like those used for bricks, while hot. The compound is generally given in small quantities at first, and increased at pleasure. For the first week, 5 pounds or 7 pounds per day when, according to the size of the animal, and quality of other food given, the quantity may be increased to 14 pounds, 21 pounds, or 28 pounds red day, To make cattle compound with <a name="potatoes596"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> or white carrots, nothing n fore is required than, after having been properly steamed or boiled, to move them from the vessels, as hot as possible, into a trough; then sprinkle some linseed meal upon them, and one ad the whole into a mass with the hammer. The compound may be put hot into the moulds, and made into cakes, or used from the trough. Less labor will be required, if the roots are removed from the cooking vessels in small quantities, and incorporated with the meal. The proportions n must be left to circumstances, and to the cost at which cattle are intended to be fed. The effect of giving only one pound of linseed meal per day to a but lock, when incorporated with <a name="potatoes597"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> or carrots, will soon become visible ; but, if a pound or two more were added, the animal would fatten at a rate which those alone who watched the proceedings could believe. No. 333 From the Cultivator. Nature Of Food, And The Relati Of Value Of Vegetables Of Foodi It seems to be generally conceded, at the present time, that the principal value of any food, for the purpose of nutrition, is dependent on the azoteor nitrogen it contains. Professor Lie big, Mr. Sadden, Professor Johnston and others, in the main, agree on this point, as do Boussingault and Bechsteim. Professor Lie big says : " The substances of which the food of man his composed may be divided into two classesnitrogenized and n6nnitrogenized. The former are capable of conversion into blood; the latter incapable of this transformation. The former may be called the elements of nutrition; the latter, elements of respiration." Parts of the former are derived from vegetables, and are as follows: vegetable fibrin e, vegetable albumen, and vegetable ca seine ; to these are to be added animal flesh and animal blood . Parts of the latter, or the elements of- respiration, are derived from both animals and vegetables, and are as follows: fat, starchcid127gum, cane sugar, grape sugar, sugar of milk, and some few other products. Lie big has demonstrated that the nitrogen sized constituents of vegetable food have a composition identical with that of the constituents of the blood ;and that no nitrogen sized compound (the composition of which is different firm fibrin e, albumen, and ca seine) can support the vital process of animals. As a matter of practical utility to every farmer who keeps animals, we[ 75] 390 give from Boussingailt the following table, exhibiting the relative value of different kinds of foods, calculated on the amount of nitrogen they contain ; or, in other words, on the quantity of vegetable fibrin e, albumen, and ca seine, they will furnish to the circulation Articles.

Thus, 60 pounds of good hay from red c lover in flower, is equal in nutriment to 100 pounds of common hay, 281 of <a name="potatoes599"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, or 20 of wheat or barley straw. The leg luminous plants such as the beans, ve aches, lent is, and peas afford the most nitrogen, and every farmer knows they rank deservedly high in the scale of nutrition; still, as they are destitute, or nearly so' of the phosphates required for the formation of bone; experience proves they are the most useful, when fed in connexion with some of the cereal in or grains. We believe that most farmers will find that their experience in feeding animals agrees very well with the estimates of the table. Thus, in soiling 208 pounds of green c lover, or 347 of green ulcer ne, will be found equal to 100 pounds of hay a result which few will doubt who have made experiments in this mode of feeding.

The following is l portion of the remarks of Mr. Path bury an extensive farmer, at a late meeting of one of the English farmers' c debs.

The experiments which had been tried seemed to prove that no advantage at6tdded it in the case of grain or roots; and though it was adiittedtht the steaming of do   by fodder enabled cattle to extract a largerporiQof nutriment from a given quantity, yet it was doubted whether the cost bathe process did not outweigh the advantage gazed. He was f opinion, that where the cost could be reduced to so insignificant a sum as by his method, the advantage as great, "the effect of steaming was not to alter the nature of the food; it d idiot covert the poor: food into rich ; its simple effect was t to render more of the nutritions part of the food digest able.

Variety of food seems to have a beneficial effect an opinion corroborated by the observations of Lie big and others. Those on boiled food, whether turniporotherwise, showed a healthy, glossy coat. Their perspiration did not seem more abundant than usual, with the exception, perhaps, of those fed on boiled turn is. Those on boiled turn is consumed more straw ; they scarcely ever tasted water. They are also said to have had a quicker step, and performed more labor. In regard to cost, he says the results are in favor of boiled turn is, with one feed of bruised grain. No. 336 Nfluence Of Heat I N Fatteni Of Ani Mals. The degree of warmth in which the animal is kept, or the temperature of the atmosphere in which it lives, affects the quantity of food which the animal requires to eat. The heat of the animal is inseparably connected with its respiration. The more frequently it breathes, the warmer it becomes, and the more carbon it throws off from its lungs. It is believed, indeed, by many, that the main purpose of respiration is to keep up the heat of the body, and that this heat is produced very much in the same way as in a common fire, by a slow combustion of that carbon which escapes in the form of carbonic acid from the lungs. Place a man in a cold situation, and he will either starve, or he will adopt some means of warming himself. He will probably take exercise, and by this means cause himself to breathe quicker. But to do this for a length of time, he must be supplied with more food; for not only does he give off more carbon from his lungs, but the exercise he takes causes a .greater natural waste also of the substance of his: body 393[ 75 ]to it is with all animals. The greater the difference between the temperature of the body and that of the atmosphere in which they live, the more food they require to "feed the lamp of life to keep them warm, that is, and to supply the natural waste. Hence the importance of plantations as a shelter from cold winds to grazing stock; of open sheds, to protect fattening stock from the nightly dews and colds; and even of closer covering to quiet and gentle breeds of cattle or sheep, which 'need without restlessness, and quickly fatten. A proper attention to the warmth of his cattle or sheep, therefore, is of great practical consequence to the fee der of stock. By keeping them warm, he diminishes the quantity of food which is necessary to sustain them, and leaves a larger proportion for the production of beef or mutton. Various experiments have been lately published, which confirm the opinions above deduced from theoretical considerations. Of these I shall only mention one by Mr. Holders, in which 20 sheep were folded in the open field, and 20 of nearly equal weight were placed under a shed in a yard. Both lots were fed for three months (january, February, and March) upon turn is, as many as they chose to eat, half a pound of linseed cake, and half a pint of barley, each sheep, per day, with .a little hay and salt. The sheep in the field consumed the same quantity of food all the barley and oil cake, and about 19 pounds of turn is per day, from the first to last, and increased, on the whole, 36 stone 8 pounds. Those under the shed consumed, at first, as much food as the others; but, after the third week, they ate 2 pounds of turn is each less in the day; and in the ninth week, again, 2 pounds less, or only 15 pounds a day. Of the linseed cake, they also ate about one third less than the other lot, and yet they increased in weight 56 stone 6 pounds, or 20 stone no re than the others. Thus the cold and exercise in the field caused the one lot to convert more of their food into dung; the other, more of it into mutton. The absence of light has also a material influence upon the effects of food in increasing the size of animals. Whatever excites attention in an animal, a wakens, disturbs, or makes it restless, appears to increase the natural waste, and to diminish the effect of food in rapidly enlarging the body. The rapidity with which fowls are fattened in the dark, is well known to readers of poultry. In I india, the habit prevails of sewing up the eyelids of the wild how deer, the spotted deer, and other wild animals, when net ted in the jungles, with the view of taking and speedily fattening them. The absence of light, indeed, however produced, seems to soothe and quiet all animals, to dispose them to rest, to make less food necessary, and to induce them to store up more of what they eat in the form of fat and muscle. An experiment made by Mr. Norton, on the feeding of sheep, shows the effect at once of shelter, of quiet, and of the absence of light; upon the quantity of food eaten, and of mutton produced from it. Give sheep of nearly equal weight were fed each with a pound of oats a day, and as much turn is as they chose to eat. One was fed in the open air; two in an open she done of them being confined in a crib; two more were fed in a close shed in the dark, and one of these also was confined in a crib, so as to lesser as much as possible the quantity of exercise it should take.

Battle also are being steamed up at the West to advantage; and where pasturage is cheap, and cattle are plenty, it is doubtless a sure mode of disposing of stock to some profit. The importance of this subject deserves a more minute statement of the disposition of the whole car cases, upon which the gain depends. The hide is salted with fine salt on the flesh side, and subsequently sprinkled with coarse salt, and rolled up for the English market; into which it is admitted at the low duty of about six cents per cut. The hide shrinks about 18 per cent; nests from 4 to 5 cents per pound. And here would remark, that this foreign market is much better than the domestic market at the West. The hoofs are soaked in warm water, (not boiled and then the flesh is taken out for oil, while the horn part is sent to Europe as a substitute for shell in making combs. From the thigh and shoulders there is taken from 75 to 100 pounds of lean meat, suitable for drying. If the British market, or the market at the Last, is good, 100 pounds of beef of the very best cuts are also reserved for the barrel. The liver is rubbed over with saltpeter, and then dry salted for about two or three weeks, and hung up to dry. This makes a most excellent relish during the summer, if fried in butter. The great object is, however, to extract from the car cases all the oil or grease, both from the flesh and bones. For this purpose, the car cases is cut into pieces and thrown into an iron cylinder capable of holding from 10,000 to 15,000 pounds of beef. After the top is fastened down, steam is let in to the extent of 70 pounds to the square inch, which is equal to 306 legs. War. After boiling 12 to 14 hours, and the oil or grease has risen to the top, it may be drawn into barrels for the European market. If this pressure of steam is continued upon the bones for a few hours more, they become soft. The rich soup in the kettle affords a most excellent nourishment for swine, e socially if shorts or meal is added. It is estimated that 40 be eve skilled per day, and tried up in the manner stated, will feed 600 to 1,000hogs.i The pork, it is true, will not be equal to the corn fed, but will try up t advantage for land, leaving also a further supply of soup. If we consider the low price of cattle in the West, (viz:    $8 to                 $10 for a large steer) the cheapness of pasture, and the quantity of fat which is acquired by one summers feed, we cannot doubt that this plan will give a certain market, which is far better than :none. The time will soon come when more attention will be paid to the selection, of cattle for their hides. Some hides are actually worth twice as much, as others for their wear after being manned. The hides of the Durham cattle, for instance, are more open and porous than the hides of the native cattle, andd hence their suffering from cold ; and far less so than of the Scottish cattle upon the mountains. Very little has hitherto been said upon this point. I have written for information, which may arrive too late for this report. The question arises, how much tallow will a fat steer afford ?a? The follow no statement I received from a large packer at Cincinnati: If the ox weighs 700 pounds, de duct 25 pounds for kidney tallow; for rough gut tallow, 50 pounds; allow 100 pounds for hide, and 100 pounds for the learn 397 7 1 meat for drying; this i ill leave 425 pounds to be tried up. If the hide only is taken out, leaving 600 pounds. This, it is supposed, will give (if the steer is fat) from 25 to 30 per cent. of tallow or grease, and will be increased 6 or 10 per cent. The estimate given me is ,this side, 100 lbs, at 4 cents -a.   $4.00Beef for smoking, 100 lbs, at 3 cents -3 00 allow, 150 lbs, at 6 cents -9 00 16 00 to account is made in this c amputation of oil from the feet, or the grease and soup from the off al. I have directed some new experiments to be made with 6 but locks, to determine more definitely and satisfactorily the facts, as communicated above. I hope to receive the results before this report is closed. Several patents have been lately taken out to increase the facility of trying up cattle, sheep, and hogs. While on this subject, it may not be amiss to add the experience of some excellent braziers as respects salting the cattle as a preventive to the murray in, as well as hastening the accumulation of fat. Whoever has noticed the salting of stock, must have been struck with the eagerness with which they rush for this luxury. The strong ones get a double portion, while many get none at all. The successful ones, however, in their strife, seize much more than is good for them, since a p excess occasions excessive thirst' A remedy is found by sat u rating salt with water, and then adding clay or ashes to absorb the liquid ; the residue m, after standing still a little while, becomes a hard mass, susceptible of form. This is then conveyed, say in the form of a pyramid, to a convenient place (which should always be a dry place) for the stock to assemble at, and there protected by some covering from the rains. To this pyramid, give the cattle free access. Sheep will usually lick the salt cake two or three times a day. One of the stock will take more than they want, and all will get enough. The experiment has been attended with the most favorable results. In addition to the advantage of giving all the cattle such a supply of salt, it has been found that large herds have been saved entirely from themurrain. I would therefore recommend a trial, which can be easily made. If successful, the plan will save much labor and some danger. The following proportion will usually answer part salt dissolved in 2 parts water; 3- parts dry clay; 3 parts of wood ashes. The ashes and clay will help to keep the Stomach and bowels in good order. This is the great preventive of the murray in, which is a highly excited inflammation, of the intestines. The supposition that this disease arises from drinking in leeches, which subsequently find their way to the liver, is often Believed t, but is not tenable. The leech (if so it may be called) found on the liver appears, upon microscopic investigation indeed, also, to the naked eye to be a very different thing from the water le eh ; besides if the leech proceeded ft om the stomach to the liver, such a breach would be made as to cause the speedy death of the animal; nor could the leech very pleasantly find its way through the gall duets. He all this as it may ,the experiment of salting in the anode prescribed is confidently recomruendedoS75 ]a] 398. 352BA1TI Morenov1embner 5,M844. Of    R: According to my promise to you when in Washington a few days ago, I have inquired of Mr. Dawson (the gentleman who had the experiment in rendering up the beef made) the result of that experiment; and he informs me that, in consequence of some mismanagement in mixing the grease with some other, they did not get the exact result; but he was satisfied that it would not answer. He says that, to render out such a mass, requires a great quantity of fuel; and that the tallow is of very inferior quality, in consequence of the quantity of blood and fibrous matter that became mixed up with it. In his opinion, from an experiment made at the same time, it is better to cut all the fat off, and render it up by itself The steer that he tried produced about 50 is. of rough fat and 251 is. of set and they cut out of the rest of the steer about 50 lbs. more of fat making in all 125 lbs, which, according to the general calculation, would produce 75 per cent. of first quality rendered tallow. Henry H. Williams, Esq, who is interested in the operation in Texas, informs me that they procure from seven head of cattle (weighing when dressed 500 to 600 lbs) about 1,100 lbs. of rendered tallow ; but, as before mentioned, it is of inferior quality; and I have been informed that, in the English market, it sells at 35s. per 112 lbs; when best quality tallow is selling at 42s. They are now killing about forty head per day; they pay 1- cent per pound for the cattle, dead weight. They feed hogs on theresiduary meat; but he says the bones do not become pulp y and fit for hogs, as mentioned by you. They take out the bones, and they are valuable' for shipment to Europe; they are as sorted, and, after taking out those that are suitable for knife handles and buttons, or other purposes of art, the remainder are used for manure. I shall be pleased if the foregoing should be of any use to you; and, if I can be of any further service, you can command me. At the same time, I regret that the present is not more' full.

We with pleasure furnish you with such information as is in our power to give you, respecting the sheep slaughtered by us the past year. The number slaughtered by us was not large. A part of the sheep we purchased to slaughter we sold, upon ascertaining that (probably owing to a very wet spring, which had the effect to sour the grass) the yield of tallow was less than we expected, being somewhat short of the yield last season. We slaughtered 5,100 sheep, which yielded an average of about nine pounds of tallow each. The whole car cases was boiled up, except the hams. The tallow would have sold for (say) six cents per pound here, but is for shipment to Eastern markets. The pelts were shipped on a contract, (some of them previous to their being entirely dry) and we did not ascertain their weight. They were mostly from large wet hers; and good judges estimated that they would yield three and a half pounds of wool each pelt. Mr. Charles Vol lister slaughtered at Maroon, in this county, about 3,800 sheep, averaging about seven and a half pounds of tallow each. Messrs. N. M. Stand art, S. C. Hurt on, and Barber, of Cleveland, Ohio, are slaughtering a large number of sheep, and would no doubt furnish you with information respecting the business.

No. 361 )from the British Cultivator. The Alpacai we naturalization in the British isles considered as a national benefit, a das an object of immediate utility to the farmer and manufacturer : bySWilliam Alton. For most of our cultivated plants, and indeed for many of our domestic animals also, we are indebted to other countries. With regard to the former, the history of their introduction is, in many cases, well established in detail but it is so long since the latest of them the <a name="potato385"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the turn in, or them n angel wurtzel, or carrot, for instance was first cultivated in our country, that farmers have fairly settled down into the belief that they must make the best of the subjects they have on hand, for that Nature has nothing furthercid127in her stores, suited, in our climate, for the wants of man or beast. And with regard to the latter, the introduction of the very latest dates so much further back, that we o must estimate the prejudice as stronger still, which scouts at the idea of any further addition n being made to our 401 [a[ 15 ]stock of domestic animals from the lists of other countries. Of course, in speaking of this universal prejudice, we allude simply to the general it y of those who at present occupy and cultivate our soil, and who form their opinion, probably, without very well knowing the grounds upon which it rests. There is every probability, notwithstanding the general notion to the contrary, that a useful addition will shortly be made to our stock of domestic animals. The al papa, from the experience of it which has been compiled from various quarters in this country by Mr. Alton, really seems likely hereafter to play an important part in the stock farming of the hilly districts of the kingdom. This animal is indigenous in the mountainous regions of Peru, where two domestic a ted species of it occur. The one, receiving the name of ll a ma, is used as a beast of burden; the other, the al papa, to which we at present allude, is a wool bearing animal, and of it large f locks were formerly possessed by the I n was, sovereigns in former days of that country, and by other wealthy inhabitants of it. The climate of the districts in which this animal flourished is described by Mr. Alton as follows: "the woolly natives possess a hardness of constitution, and a peculiarity of structure, admirably well adapted to the nature of their birthplace. There, during half the year, snow and hail fall incessantly; whilst in the higher regions, as before noticed, nearly every night the thermometer falls below the freezing point, and the peaks, consequently, are constantly covered with an accumulation of ice. The wet season succeeds" &c. In the applicability of the al papa to our soil and circumstances, we quote the following remarks: "the hardy nature and contented disposition of the al papa cause it to adapt itself to almost any soil or situation, provided the heat is not oppressive, and the air is pure. The best proof of its hardness is its power to endure cold, damp, hunger, and thirst vicissitudes to which it is constantly exposed on its native mountains; while its gentle and doc i le qualities are evinced in its general habits of affection towards its keeper. To animal in the creation is less affected by the changes of climate and food, nor is there any one to be found more easily dorniciliated than this. It fares well while feeding below the snowy mantle which envelopes the summits and for several months in the year clothes the sides of the Andes. It ascends the rugged and rarely trodden mountain path with perfect safety; sometimes climbing the slippery c rag in search of food, and at others instinctively seeking it on the heath, or in rocky cells shattered by the wintry storm at the same time that, when descending, it habit rates itself to the wet arid dreary ranges on the low lands, so long as it is not exposed to the intense rays of the sun any of our northern hills would try the constitution of any sheep, and yet there the weather is never so in clement or so variable as on the Cordilleras of Peru. With so many advantages, why, then, shall not the alpacahave an opportunity of competing with the black faced sheep, the only breed that can exist in those wild and in hospitable lands. Of the two, the stranger would fare best on scanty and scattered food; at the same time affording to the owner a far better remunerationThe al papa wool is at present used largely in British manufactures. Mr. Alton estimates the quantity hitherto consumed, since its introduction is 1832, at 12,000,000 lbs. The price of it varies from is. old. to 2s. D. per 2 675 ]a] 402 pound: and the average weight of the flee ce maybe put? at 10 pounds. Were the animal fairly naturalized on some of our bleak est hill districts such land would soon increase in value from the increased worth of its annual produce in al papa wool. And it appears, from the experience of several gentlemen who have small flocks, that, when its habits shall be thoroughly understood, little difficulty will be experienced in doing so. The following is a statement by Mr. Stirling, of Craigbarnet place, Lenox town, Glasgow, a gentleman better qualified to speak on the subject than anyone we could name: "I can have no doubt that, when the subject is better understood, the animal itself better known, and a more expeditions method contrived to bring them to Britain, we shall have thousands of them. When known, their nobility, their temperate habits, their hardness, and, I may add, their easy keep, will, ere long, bring them into general notice. I can answer, without the fear of being contradicted, that they will thrive and breed in Scotland equal, if not superior, to our native black faced sheep To those who would laugh at the idea of bringing over here, and domestic ating on our hills, a Peruvian camel or sheep, (for the al papa has properties in common with both) we would point to Australia, a country which not many years ago possessed no quadruped but the kangaroo; and yet notwithstanding its many peculiarities of climate, is now thickly peopled with our sheep and oxen. But the question must not be left to generalities of this kind. The experience of a few short years, on the larger scale which, expected importations will enable, will determine it satisfactorily; and if, as in all probability will be the case, the al papa should become one of our domestic animals, the best thanks of the country will be due to Mr. Alton, for the persevering energy with which he has pressed the subject on public attention. His book is an exceedingly interesting and neatly got up little volume, and will, we doubt not, prove a useful publication. No. 362 From the American Farmer. The Alpaca, Of Sheep Of The Andes. There is a great effort now being made in England, I re land, and Scotland, to introduce into these countries the fine wooled sheep of a portion, of South America, called al paces, or the sheep of the i andes. As far as experiments have gone, it appears not only practicable to naturalized or as climate them to the climates of these respective countries, but the gratifying facts have been demonstrated, that they arrive earlier, by two years, at that state when the powers of pro creation are developed; that the wool is finer and softer than that imported from their native country, having much more york imparted to it by the superior pasturage found in Great Britain, to that found on their natal mountains, and that the flee ce is also increased in weight f roth 50 to 70 per cent, as well as in length of staple. These factsiebrace considerations of great moment in an agricultural point of view was they tend very much to enhance the value of their wool, both to the manufacturer and farmer he al paces are represented as hardy, doc i le animals, affected neither by net nor cold ; existing best on the coarse herb age of mountain pastures 403 [a[ 75 ]on such herb age as scarcely any other animals could subsist upon. ,to farms the experiments in Great Britain go to establish facts connected wit their habits, it would seem, that the greatest difficulty to be apprehended in that country arises from the too great luxuriant e of the :pastures in the cultivated portions of these countries, producing sure its incid127) he good, which produce cutaneous affections resembling the it ch in the: human family. :tt as this is a physical difficulty, which may be overcome by depasturing the min the mountain regions, it is not of serious moment, because it may be avoided. The supposed average weight of clip in the range of Peruvianmountains, the Andes, is 10 pounds; whereas in England .they have risen to 17 pounds. This fact shows that translation from South America. to Great Britain has exerted a fortunate influence: upon that part of their production which imparts to them their greatest value; for aMhouigh their car cases, when they are killed young, is available for ed able purposes, weighing 180 pounds, still their wool must be looked upon as the most lucrative part of them ; that being fine and silk y, most happily adapted to all the nicer qualities of woollen fabrics, and commanding high prices and ready sales. The al paces live for twelve years without experiencing any material deter i oration in their yield of flee ce, and in this respect may be said to possess an advantage over common sheep, or, indeed, over either the the rings or Saxony me rings; their wool being finer, longer, more silk y and preferred in the manufacture of most of the goods of the more delicate texture ; and the fact that the flee ce of one al papa is equal in weight to upwards of five or six me rings or Saxons, is a consideration of preponderating force. A very intelligent British author, whose work we have just read, in speaking of the scab, the disease to which they are disposed to be subject seems to think that, in their native land, it is a scribble to sudden atmosphericid127c changes operating upon the p respiratory organs with deleterious effect; but suggests that, by timely and judicious treatment in its incipientstate -the disease may be promptly arrested bathing, and cooling ape rents, being the only treatment necessary to restore a health full action upon the skin, and relieve the animal. The appearance of the disease among the animals which have been imported into England, I re land, and Scotland he a scribes to a combination of causes, all of which are within control, and which we will here attempt to briefly notice; though, before we do so, we must be candid, and say that although we admit there is great force in his remarks, in our opinion the importations into Great Britain have not been sufficiently numerous, as yet, to establish, by the premises thereby furnished, such a series of well defined deductions as would amount to any thing like unerring rules. The al paces, in. their home pastures, are permitted to traverse their native mountains, where, 4,000 feet above the level of the sea, they have an almost illimitable range, breathe a pure air, and have appointed places for bathing luxury which they delight in, and which tends to eradicate dirt from their skins, and to keep the pores open. When brought to the coast for shipment, they are pent up in close enclosures, or sheds, and subject to the discomfort of foetid air. Their food, too, is changed from n the stinted and coarse herb age of the mountains to c lover and grain. In board ship they are confined in small corps, exposed to the foul air of bile water, and the equally offensive excavations of gun no, and are again fed also epic lover and grain a diet by no means adapted to animals which have been always previously used to a most stinted and abstemious diet2andS75 ]a] 404 particularly so, as, from their deprivation of exercise, their systems are no prepared for so sudden a change as from thin rotations to luxurious fare. Again: upon their arrival in Great Britain, through a mistaken kindness, instead of being at once sent to high land and mountain pastures, they are put upon the forcing system, to gormandize themselves into a sure it; and thus, through riotous living, (if we may use the term) to en gender disease. The cost, of the al papa, including the purchase and transportation to the shipping port from the mountains, is trifling not exceeding  $5 a head and we should presume that the freight to America would not exceed from               $15 to           $20 a head; so that the cost here, per capital, could not, in any event, exceed         $25. But, as it would be advisable to have them accompanied by a native shepherd, the cost of his passage and wages should be taken into the bill of expenses; and hence, if importations were made into this country, it would be well for several gentlemen farmers to join, in order that the shepherds expenses might be divided among them. We have brought this subject to the notice of our readers, because we are most sensibly impressed with the belief that there is an obvious necessity for a change in the system of husbandry of this country ; that other products than those now raised will have to be grown, to maintain such prices as will prove remunerative of the labor bestowed and capital invested. We have long foreseen that there was abroad a spirit of concentration upon particular crops, and an expansion of the quantity grown, that would operate to decrease their moneyed value. Among these, we will, for the present, enumerate three great staples of the planting and farming interests. The cotton, tobacco, and wheat culture, within the last few years, have been so extended, as that it may now be said to have reached a point of production beyond the demand, and to indicate, with unerring certainty, that a portion of the force now engaged in growing these productions must be diverted to other and new pursuits. We have arrived at this conclusion after long, impartial, and serious reflection; and we should consider our self faithless to the trust reposed in us, as the editor of this journal, did we not, in all frankness, so express our self. We speak now of the cotton, tobacco, and wheat, grown within the limits of our own happy Union; but when we reflect upon the experiments already made in Texas in the culture of these products, and consider the adaptation of her soil and climate to such purposes, we are the more strongly impressed with the necessity which exists for diversitying our own agricultural labors. I m pressed as we have been with these sentiments for a considerable time, it is now two years since that we suggested the introduction into our agricultural pursuits of the culture of m adder; and many months since we endeavored to claim the attention of our readers in behalf of an extension of sheep culture. And now we have deemed it our duty to present to their consideration the propriety of importing al paces, with the view of their engaging in the most profitable branch of wool growing. The English farmers and noblemen have 'already tested the important truths, that the al papa does not deteriorate by being translated to the high lands of England, Scotland, and I re land; but, on the contrary, that the animal undergoes a most striking improvement in his capacities for earlier breeding, as well as in the quality and quantity of his flee ce; and with these facts, thus satisfactorily established to our hands, we do think it should be a sufficient inducement with farmers and planters to go at once into the experiment of testing the question whether our country is not equally 405 well adapted to the introduction of the al paces as either England, I re land, or Scotland. In our vast territory, there are millions of acres of mountain lands which are now not producing a dollar a year to their proprietors, that might be converted into al papa pastures, and thus be rendered sources of great profit. In Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, there are mountains and high lands enough, if converted into walks for the sheep of the Andes, as would, in a very few years, add a million to the annual income of those States. When, we ask, why should the intelligent planters and farmers of those States hesitate to engage in an enterprise that could not fail to be productive of the most striking pecuniary advantages to themselves and their common country ?cloaca wool More than two million pounds of wool of this beautiful animal were imported into Great Britain, in the year 1843, from western South America. This fact alone shows the great importance of the animal, and the propriety of efforts to ac climate it in this country. Enlightened and patriotic individuals in England have expended considerable sums for this purpose, with the brightest prospects of success. In Los. 8 and 9 of the Farmer and Mechanics is a re print of an English work, containing a full history of the attempts to introduce the al papa into Great Britain. The work has two engravings, and is afforded for 20 cents, although the English copy cost             $1.37J. No. 37. Poultry. Poultry may justly be classed among the most profitable as well as convenient appendages of the farmers stock. This affords daily nourishment, and furnishes the means of manufacturing the luxuries of life. If we were for a time deprived of poultry, our loss would be severely felt; the products of this branch of supplies are so intimately interwoven with the various dishes for the table. To capital is more profitable than that which is invested in the business of raising poultry. It would not be an over estimate, we believe, to place the value of the poultry in the United States at                $12,000,000. I to importance deserves more attention. The public are greatly indebted to Mr. Cement, for his excellent publication on this subject, styled the " American Poulterers Companion." We have made, from this work, a few short extracts, designed to teach some important things in respect to the bearing of the subject on the agricultural and other interests of our country: " But though most farmers keep fowls, and raise their own eggs, there are many who have not learned the difference there is in the richness and flavor of eggs produced by fat and well fed hens, and those from birds that have been half starved through our winters. There will be some difference in size, but far more in the quality. The yell of the one would be large, fine colored, and of good consistence, and the albumen, or white, clear and pure; while the contents of the other will be watery and meager, as though there were not vitality or substance enough in the parent fowl to properly carry out and complete the work that nature had sketched. I n 75 ]a] 406 order, therefore, to have good eggs, the fowls should be well fed, and also provided, during the months they are unable to come to the ground, withal box. containing an abundance of fine gravel, that they may be able to grind aid prepare a their food for digestion. Of eggs, those from the domrnetiyhen are decidedly the best; but those of ducks and geese may be used for some of the purposes of domestic cookeryPage 10."I nhlwellfed fowls, the difference will be see no not only in the size andfleshiof the. fowls, but; in -the weight: and goodness of the eggs; two of which gal further in domestic uses than three from hens poorly fed or half star ved. ?age (cid127t4" To: promote fee unity and great laying in the; hens, it is necessary that they be well fed on grain, boiled <a name="potatoes602"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, (given to them warm) and, o asiWonally, animalcid127food.

C. M.' in regard to the profits from, number of eggs obtained, and amount of food consumed by a given number of fowls per year." Now, sir, in the first place, I would recommend to your correspondent to try the experiment himself, even if it be on a small scale say from twelve to twenty fowls. Deep an accurate account with them; charge the cost of the fowls, the food they consume, and all expenses attending them. Deep an accurate account of all the eggs :obtained, and all the chickens raised and, at the end of the year, credit the eggs and the stock on hand, and thequeriesowilbbe answered.  But, as he probably wishes to avail himself of the experience of others, and jump into the business at once, I will endeavor to gratify him by giving the result of some of my experience When 1 first moved on to my farm, I kept about one hundred fowls, which were allowed to run and root where they pleased, annoying me in the garden, destroying my grain, and soiling my implements, and from which we did not obtain over one thousand eggs and about sixty chickens during the year. I then built me a poultry house, and enclosed about one-fourth i of an acre of ground with a picket fence between six and seven feet high, placed the fowls i in it, arid commenced keeping debit and credit with them. In six months and seven days we obtained from sixty :hens two thousand six hundred and fifty-five eggs. The year following, from the same number of hens, we obtained over four thousand eggs" Tens that are well fed and attended to will average about ninety eggs each per year; and they will consume about thirty-eight quarts of grain, in proportion as follows, per head, in the same timeSThe amount consumed within the year, of the different kinds of grain, wa 91 bushels of wheat screenings, at 21 cents -19 116 " rye 62 " -3 75.11 " mille t 62 " -a- -6 87 2 " co in 56 " -1 1240 7 [a[ 75 3 bushels of barley, at 50 cents -52 " .a: I indian meal, at 100 " -00 115 -34 36,Amount of eggs and poultry sold was -56 79Leavinga a balance of only -22 43" We were more fortunate last year, as will be seen from the following.

They were plentifully supplied with lime, gravel, and water. Some allowance. However, must be made in regard to the amount of sales, as many of the fowls were of fancy breeds He adds i in i his volume: "by referring to the agricultural statistics of the United States, as furnished by the last census, taken in 1839 and published in 1840, it would appear the value of poultry in the State of New York amounted to     $3,373,029;.and that of the various States and Territories of the Union amounted to the sum of 21cid127, .76 170" Thaei annual. consumption of poultry and small game in the city of Parisusuallyamounts to 22,000,000. The quantity of eggs used annually in France exceeds 7,250,000,000; of which enormous number Paris uses about. 120, 000000. The importation of eggs from I re land, in 1837, to Liverpool and :pistol alone, amounted in value to 250,000. The importation from France the same year was probably greater t appears, from the custom house returns of the year 1838, that eggs were imported into England (though loaded with heavy duties) from the continent, to the value of more than a million of dollars. Eighteen tons of poultry, it is said, left Syracuse, New Work, in one day, for the Boston market. It is supposed that there may be consumed in the United States 1,400,000,000 of eggs; and, averaging the value at 6 cents per dozen, this would amount to    $8,000,000. If we allow an average of 5[ 75] 408 chickens, or other kinds of fowls, a year to each person, at a cost of 12 cents average, including turkeys, geese, ducks, &c, this will amount to more than 97,500,000-equal in value to more than D12000000 annually; making the aggregate value of the consumption of poultry, to say nothing of the amount which might be added for the feathers. It is said to have been ascertained, that half a million of eggs are consumed every month in the city of New Work. One woman in Fulton market sold 175,000 eggs in 10 weeks, supplying the Astor House each day with 1,000 for 5 days, and on Saturday 2,500. No. 38. Stati Sti Of Of Wheat I N Ohi   O. The following extract from the report of the committee appointed by the Agricultural Society of Hamilton county, Ohio, will be read with deep interest. A similar examination in other sections of the United States is strongly recommended. There is no doubt of a direct connexion between the constitution of a soil and the timber it produces; and from this we may deduce a connexion between timber and crops. The heaviest crop of wheat is found on land having sugar tree and oak as the principal timber, as will appear from the following classification Sugar and oak -10 cases, average crop 18.40 bushels. Sugar and beech -19 do do 17.52 do. Leech and oak -7 do do 17.14 do. Sugar, oak, and hickory -5 do do 16.66 do. Oak -21 do do 16.00 do. Hickory -10 do do 14.50 do. Leech -12 do do 14.33 do. Miscellaneous -30 do do 15.50 do. General average of -127 do 16.50 do. The mixture of sugar and oak appears to give the best yield ;sugar and beech, next; and beech and oak, the next. If an analysis of these soils, and of the wood most congenial to them, were carefully made, we should probably discover not only a resemblance between them and their timber, but between the timber produced and the grain and straw of wheat. The statement of an average yield of wheat enables us to ascertain the number of acres cultivated in wheat in 1839, when the official return gives213815 bushels for the product of that year. If that year gave an average crop, the quantity of ground then in cultivation in wheat was 13,029 acres. The crop, since 1840, has been more uncertain in its yield, price lower, and demand less; from which we conclude that there has not been an increase in the production of the country since that time. Misfortunes to which the crop is liable The record we have given of the remarks made upon wheat shows that there are three principal evils to which it is subject, viz: rust, fly, and freezing out. The average loss of the crop, by these and other causes, is once in four years a total failure 409 [a[ 75 ]evils and seed The farmers differ in regard to which of these is the greatest enemy to wheat; six of those speaking upon the subject regard rust as the difficulty most to be avoided; nine consider freezing out the most injurious; and nine suppose the fly to be the worst enemy. Respecting the quantity of seed, the farmers of Hamilton vary from three to five pecks. Mr. Smethhart considers three pecks to be better calculated to insure a full crop than more. In Glanders, two Winchester bushels are sown to the English acre, which is nearly eight pecks of our measure in England, two and a half to three and a half bushels. The richness and depth of the soil has so much to do with the quantityofseqd, that it is difficult to establish a rule upon the subject. In England, however, where the doubling process has been tried, and the seed planted in regular squares of six inches on a side, and a seed in the middle of two sides, the quantity is reduced to about one and a half bushels to the acre, and the yield increased many fold. Time of sowingpricesAmong the farmers who gave answers to our inquiries about the time of sowing, four put in their wheat in August, four in October, nine in September, and one in November. Of those who prefer September, six sov during the first ten days, one by the first day, and two in the latter part of the month. Those who cover the seed in the first week expect to harvest between the 25th and 30th of June. The following table exhibits the price of wheat at Cincinnati, every six months, for four years past 1840, July 1 -0 56 per bushel 1841, January 1 -58 "a" July 1 -73 a 1842, January 1 -1 0 6 'a" July 1 -55 "1843, January 1 -50 "a" July 1 -85 "1844, January -75 "july -60 "average price per bushel, 67 4 cents. Average in January of each year, 72.22 cents. Average in July of each year, 65.80 cents. The method of tilling is very various. In new ground, for the first crop, the seed is generally scattered over the fresh surface, and harrowed 'n without sloughing. The root y condition of the ground frequently prevents the use of the plough. In old ground, the practice most in vogue among farmers is to summer fallow, and harrow in upon the sod. In fields that are clear of stumps and stones, (and very few farms in Hamilton county are troubled with stone the plough lies over the s ward very uniform and flat. It is thought that ground made too mellow and fine is more liable to winter kill the wheat than such as is in the state of clouds, provided they are dead and rotating. Some cases will be observed in our abstract, where c lover has been turned in, and wheat sown upon fir row immediately, and also where turf land has been broken up a few weeks before seeing. In land where sloughing can be done so perfectly as to turn over all the soil, and is not inclined to send up grass and weeds, this practice of sowing[ 75 ]a] 410 soon after breaking up is undoubtedly advantageous. It allows the growing plant a chance to absorb more of the volatile portions of the decomposing swardfUpo the whole, this region cannot be said to be well adapted to the culture of wheat. Ujcertaintyof crops crop which is liable to be cut off once in four years is too u nice train to be raised with profit for sale, although every good farmer would continue, even under this disadvantage, to sow enough of or his family use. It is much less sure, and also less abundant in yield, than formerly, when the country was new. His seems to indicate a change of climate, as well as a change in the condition of the soil. The effect of cleared land, and of cultivation, is to cause a greater number of thawings and freezings, which are each of themnihjuridus to the root; and when land becomes heavy by constant use, the effect of frost in that way is different and more destructive. The country is filled with the fly, and there seen ms to be an increased disposition to rust. Very early sown wheat generally escapes the rust; butappearcid127) t be more exposed to the fly. Sthalabana wheat has hitherto escaped both, and produces a fine yield of go id wheat. It has, however, not been tried long enough to pronounce upon its ultimate success. We should expect a grain from the South to ma tire earlier, and consequently do better, provided the winters did not injure it. Varieties and composition kind of wheat, called Virginia wheat, has been tried with that view, as we are told, and gave a good crop; but we ha v. personal knowledge concerning it. Mr. Frost, of Gros by, has tried Saxon wheat, and considers both it and the " blue s ten" as before our common kinds, and even before Alabama. The fact noted by Mr. Grown, that the fly which infested the timothy part of his fallow did not the c lover, is worthy of remembrance. In England there are 42 varieties of cultivated wheat winter, spring, and summer, but, as yet, they are not well classified in botany cal order. The i Romans of the days of our Saviour sowed the common red and the white wheat in i general, but in moist situations they made use of the bearded.

Time of harvesting Having given the principalcid127details, of our obseorbsvations among te, cultivates of the soil at hon me, we add some considerations from the experience of farmers in other countries, particularly in relation to the' state of wheat when it is cut. In 1840, Mr. John Kann am, of North Eight on, in Yorkshire, England made several experiments upon the relative values of wheat cut at varioauscid127stages of ripe ness. It should be borne in mind that the harvests of England occur from four to six weeks later than in southern Ohio. Specimen No. 1, cut green, August 4. Specimen No. 2, cut raw, August 18. Specimen No. 3, c it ripe, September 1. The green specimen had not begun to turn yellow; the chaff adhered to the fertile, which was green, soft, and full of milk, although perfectly formed. No. 2, or the raw, was quite yellow, from the roots about one foot upwards; and the whole stalk, though apparently green, was seen to be, on close examination, of a yellowish tint. The ears were open, the chaff yellowcid127) and green, and the grain still soft and pulp y, with some fluid matter in the berne l The specimen No. 3 was ripe, without being dead ripe or brittle, but in what is called harvesting order. The ripe gave -30 bushels of 60 pounds, and 2,688:pounds( of straw. The raw gave 30.1307; bushels of 60 pounds, i and 2,352 pounds of straw. Farmers' Encyclopedia, article Heat, page 112. Farmers' Encyclopedia, article Heat, page 1,1,24:[75] 412 The green gave 26.1356 bushels of 60 pounds, and 2,737 pounds of straw. The straw of the green parcel was, as we see, about 385 pounds heavier than the raw, and 49 pounds heavier than the ripe.

Of course, the br an and shorts of No. 3 were least, and the br an was found to be thin and soft; while No. 5 was coarse and harsh. The average yield per acre, of these experiments, was 28 bushels; and the weight of flour in equal measures of wheat was 15 per cent. in favor of the raw over the ripe; the gain in straw, 14 per cent. There was a gain in value, of 163 pounds of wheat per quarter; and in the acre, yielding 28 bushels, again of 583 pounds. No. 39. For the Southwestern Farmer. Manufacture Of Cotton Baggi Of, &c. Natchez, January 13, 1845. Dear Of    R: I noticed in your paper, the other day, an estimate, made by or. Phillips, of the amount of cotton which might be consumed by the slaveholding States (ten) in mat tresses, comforts, blankets, &c. To this estimate, I think it might do some good to add the probable quantity that could be consumed in cotton cotton bagging, rope, t wine, and negro clothing. For instance To cover 5,000,000 bales cotton, it would require an average of 5 yards per bale, of 45 inches wide, and weighing l 1 lb to the yard; the quantity of raw material would be 2 lbs. per yard, or 20,000,000 lbs. -20 000, 000 413 [a[ 75 To tie the same, 4 lbs. cotton rope per bale, or 5 I is. raw material -10000000To sew the same, !lb. cotton t wine per bale, say -600000To clothe 2,147,000 negroes, 2 suits, average 5 yards, 44 domestic, to weigh j lb, equal to 1 lb. raw material per yard -10735000Pounds of cotton thus used -413 35, 000 400 lbs. to a bale thus using bales -103338Add to this the estimate by Dr. Phillips, for mat tresses, comforts, &c. -146515Total bales -249853To consume such a quantity of the raw material at home would most certainly have a favorable bearing on prices of this article in domestic and foreign markets. And this is not all that might be consumed at home, by a great deal, if the white male inhabitants of the Southern States would agree, as their sires did in old times, to wear the old fashioned cottonadefor pantaloons and jackets, and cotton knit socks. I hope you will excuse this scrawl, as I write it from my sick chamber. Hours, truly, Saml. T. Mcali Ster. N. G. North, Esq.

The foregoing estimate, it will be seen, is made very large as to the cost of manufacturing at the Watched establishment; for we have put down the cost of cotton at 3 cents per lb, whereas most of' the fabrics, or at leastimanyof them, can' be made of trash or refuse cotton. The sac king made for Mr. I sac Run bar, for instance, of which we made mention last week, and of which a sample can be seen at Mr. Gibbss store, was manufactured, as stated, out of "un merchant able cotton." The cost of manufacturing bagging, too, is 10 cents at the Watched factory; but we have put it down at 12 cents, so as to be doubly sure of demonstrating to our friends that, by going to Watched instead of Kentucky, Lowell, &c, they will save 30 cents on every dollar expended.

Capi Tol Hill, Wasi    I Ngton Of Of, January, 1845. Of    9 : The merchants of Liverpool, I observe, complain that the beef and pork sent from this country to that port is hard, coarse grained, and of a dark color. Now, is not the dark color occasioned, in some degree, by the blood not being well drawn from the animal when slaughtered ?a practice too frequently used by butchers, with the view, as they term it, to make the animal " weigh well" but does it not prevent the beef from keeping, and spoil its flavor ?a? And another cause of our meat being inferior to the English is the horrid practice of. neglecting to alter the animal when he is only a few weeks old, which occasions the meat to be coarse grained, dark colored, bad favored, hard, and full of grist le; and cattle, in particular, to have large heads, large coarse horns, huge necks and sharnksleanank backs, inferior hides, and deteriorates the whole animal, making him ravish and ill natured; and in sheep, occasions the mutton to taste of .the wool, as it is absurdly termed. The following particulars of the weight of aHeitfordshire ox, belong g tour. West car, may perhaps throw some light on. thissubjectThe four quarters, skirts, and kidneys, 1,838 lbs; loose fat, 190 lbSohide and horns, 119 lbs; head, brains, and tongue, 56 lbs; feet, 33 lb s 415 [a' 75 heart, lights, sweet bread, and bladder, 56 lbs; t ripe, seek, reed, liver, gall, and i it, 62 lbs: total, 2,54 lbs. And a he ifer, fed by Mr. Rise by my crack bull, weighed as follows: four quarters 1,376 lbs; fat 173 lbs; i de 99. is; and cut full seven inches solid fat along the chin e, o in, aid tm p. And another he ifer, by the' same bull, shown in Smith field by Air Oh Sinclair, was so fat and heavy, that when it lay down it could not get In its feet again without help; the frame being so loaded with flesh. The best kinds of these cattle, when fat, generally yield full three fifths of their live weight in beef, namely: a four year old ox of mine weighed, when alive, and before he was fasted, 2,100 I is; and his four quarters weighed 1,260 I is. The climate of England is, no doubt, highly favorable to the raising of fine live stock; but is it not, in a great measure, the skill of her braziers, in selecting their breeding animals, that occasion is them to fatten so readily, and to yield so great a proportion of superior meat oh the finest parts of the animal in proportion to its weight? And perhaps the following observations on Herefordshire cattle, (which, some years since, I addressed to a distinguished Kentucky brazier, who had imported several of that breed) may give some information on the usual mode of handlicid127igand selecting cattle by braziers. The best blood of the Herefords have the face, feet, belly, and end of the fail white, with a small piece of white on the top of the shoulder, but by no means a white back, and the rest of the animal a dark mahogany red hide rather thick, soft, and feels between the fingers like rich fat, covered with fine soft thick set hair, which occasions the skin to feel like a piece of fine rich silk velvet; lips thin; nostrils wide; eyes bold, and dark colored; eye sockets prominent and wide apart; ears and face rather short; the tongue roots rather full ; no loose dew lap; bosom not prominent, but wide; belly or paunch s ma, and drawn upwards; horns yellow white, turning upwards, rather long, very smooth and bright, free from wrinkles, and fine not resting on, but growing out of the sides of the head; neck thin and fine; chin e, when lean, thin, well and neatly joined to the loin; but when fat, very broad and particularly full at the sides the shoulders fitting it equally as nice as in a blood horse, without any projection of the elbows ribs long, very wide, not hanging from, but rising out from the back bone and when the animal is fat, the flesh ought to be so much high e than the back bone as to form a hollow along the same, like a gutter; and I have seen such a hollow so deep, that when a stick was laid across the animals back in various places, and resting on the flesh on each side, a ruler three inches long has passed along the back bone, under the stick, without to thing it. The short ribs at the sides of the loin very projecting, long, elevating, and thick at the ends with fat, and deeply covered with firm solid flesh; for on this deep fat firm flesh depends the fine ness of the" sir loin" arid on the firmness of the flesh depends the fine ness of the grain and sweetness of the animal. And here many people err in supposing that softness of flew is a token of fine meat, but rather, say of coarse grained meat of a loose text re.

Twist, or where the hind legs unite, very low and full; the outside of the thigh rather flat 75 ]416 and free from flesh, which occasions the round to be nearly free from coarse and dark colored meat, but still large and fine; flank full, and driving forward when the animal is walking. The peculiarities of these cattle are lightness of off al; length, fulness, and size of the rum p; size and fat ness of the hips, and every part that gentlemen usually eat remarkably full of fine fat beef, with but a small proportion of coarse meat. As milders, the Herefords are perhaps equal to any other distinguishedfeeders; but here a distinction must be made, as none of the famed beef cattle are good milders, or rarely so. I need, we ought not to expect it; it is too much like blowing hot and blowing cold with the same breath. In speaking well of the Herefords, I by no means intend to undervalued the improved Durham cattle; and the distinguished Kentucky gentleman above alluded to lately told me, in our Capitol, that he thought he had produced a better animal than either of these breeds, by crossing them together. But I am inclined to think that some of the Scotch cattle are better calculated for our country here, than any of the very large English breeds, and particularly the best pulled or Galloway cattle. They, like their countrymen, are hardy, and thrive almost every where; and these cattle are large enough for all purposes and pastures. If the above observations are of any use, I shall have pleasure in having communicated them to you. And remain, most respectfully, your obedient servant, Stephenson Scott. To no H. L. Ellsworth. No. 411 From the American Agriculturists. Packi Of Provi  Of    Ons For The Engli Of Market. We think we cannot do our readers a greater service than copying the following article, addressed to Messrs. Pitch cock, Livingston, & To, from an American gentleman, now in England, who has paid much attention to the subject. If properly cured and packed, Great Britain and her Last and West I india colonies would take nearly all our surplus provisions. It is of great importance to us, then, to adopt their most approved methods of packing; and, if necessary, even to sacrifice a little to their whims and prejudices. But the English method is undoubtedly far superior to our own and it is certain that we shall not command the market there, until we adopt it. The sooner, therefore, it is done, the better it will be for the interests of all parties concerned. Porkthis is cut' into four or six pound pieces, according to the size of the how. There the car cases weighs two hundred and fifty and under, it is cut into four pound pieces; large hogs are cut into six pound pieces. Thehog is first slit through the back bone in half, then passed to the trimming block, where the half head and legs are cut off, the leaf and tender loin taken out, a roi the whole side split length wise through both the shoulder and ham, and as near the centre as is consistent with the proper shape and size 417 7. 5 of the different pieces. From the block the strips pass to the scales, where the weight is ascertained and called to the man at the cutting block, who divides each strip into the requisite sized pieces. Both the splitting and piercing require skill and judgment, as arch depends upon having the pieces well and six ably cut. 'from thence it goes to the rubbing table, where each piece is thoroughly rubbed in salt, in the same manner as in curing bacon. After the salt has been well rubbed in, it is put into picking tubs holding from three to five hundred pounds, well covered with salt, but no water or bring added. Were they remain i from eight to ten days. It is taken to the washing trough or vat, where each piece is thoroughly washed ii clean bring, trimmed, and tormented, (as the process of trying is called The lormeator is an instrument of god or metal, the size of a small dish, and is thrust into the lean parts of each piece, to ascertain that it is properly cured and free from taint. It is then missed an d weighed, so that the requisite number of pieces shall weigh exactly the number of pounds for the barrel or tierce. It is then put up in the proper packages, and freely halted while packing, and saltpeter added at the rate of a common wineglass full to the .hundred pounds. The last layer is wounded in by a heavy iron weight, and tapped with coarse salt. It is then passed to the cooper, who puts in the head, and puts on to the barrel one, and on the tierce at least three iron hoops at each end. 'the package is then filled with clean strong bring, banged tight, branded, and is then ready fir market. The great utility of this method of c ring consists in the certainty of the meat keeping in good condition for years in any climate. The blood gets all drained out of the meat before it is barre led, and hence one great cause of injury is avoided. I saw pork and beef which had been two years in the barrel, which was as sweet as when first put up, and the brinewvas perfectly clear. A friend in London unpacked several packages of wish and Hamburg cured provisions by the side of American. The contrast was any thing but flattering to our taste or skill. I could very readily see why our be :f and pork bore so bad a name in the market, and was so much of a drug. The meat was not inferior, but it was badly missed, worse cut and c red, and the bring nearly as red as blood; and presenting, by the side of the other not a very pal a table appearance. The large hogs, or heavy pork, which is iicid127iformrly cut into six pound pieces, is packed in tier ces, and is then Called I lydia or navy pork. The for pound pieces are put in barrelsd barrel of prime pork should contain from 25 to .30 pieces, cut from the ribs, loins, chines, and belly pieces, all lying between the ham and shoulder, forming what is called the broad side or middle' Three ham sand two hind leg pieces, or three, lined leg pieces and two hams, and fifteen or twenty pieces from other parts of the how, except no part of the head.

It may be useful to yourself, or to your neighbors, to see the mode of cutting up the car cases of an ox in London. 'the provisions exported from that metropolis rule the trade in the West I india islands and in other distant places abroad. It is very proper, therefore, that American packer s should understand the English method. The annexed cut will show the London modeFxiCutting up an ox in London. Mind quarter, More quarter.

In a good ox, of the I durham breed, it is a great point, and it gives very choice pieces for packing I india beef, as they are good meat, and perfectly free from bone. The relative value of these different cuts of an ox may be stated at their current value, viz: when the rum p, loins, and fore ribs, of a fine ox will fetch eight pence a pound, the thick flank, buttock, and middle rib, will fetch six pence; the pitch or ad ze bone, thin flank, chuck rib, brisk et, andlegofmutton piece, five pence; the cold and sticking, and neck, three pence; and the legs and ships, two pence a pound. Such is the difference in value of the different cuts of an ox in the meat markets of London. It is well to observe, that the greatest attention should be paid to the making bring or pick le, whether for beef or pork. Sure water should be used in its manufacture; for the sediment from that which is impure will settle down upon the meat, and give it a bad color and a slim y feel. There river or rain water is used, (and soft water should always be preferred) it would be exceedingly desirable to filter it through sand, or at least to strain it. A great deal of beef and pork is utterly unfit for exportation, by the use of un filtered water in making the bring. In packing provisions, the tierces, barrels, &c, should be made with great care and neatness. Clean, handsome ash states are preferred, and of such other hard close grained wood as will not stain the meat. Pierces should have four iron hoops, or three-one at the bile and one at each chime. Barrels with an iron hoop at- each chime. The fuller hooped the barrel or tierce is, the better. We noticed, recently, that the first year after the modification of the British tariff, up to 3 1st August, 1842, 3,367 barrels only of American beef were imported into Liverpool. The past year, up to 3 1st August, there were imported into the same place 9,812 barrels, and 10,789 tierces of beef. If we would only pack our beef neatly by the above directions, the importations in 1846 might double those of, 1844; and a great increase likewise will be made in the importation of pork 9 75 I500coor The. t )0o424B z000CU0443obq 4 c o o a Or 42 a Ll 0 a a q a re 0 0 00 o Or *a* 03 4 it a a - 4; 4 I I I I I- _a_ 11 1 -I 4 41 24 I l- Cci O act 000 0' "a: 0 00 For- 4 4 2 -r- -4< To o -o 101 , , |a| (a( 4( I 4 4 4 t <4 I' 4 I 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 444 4 4 4 Y i 1 I 4 i I ' I ~a~ C ' 1 I 4` 4 4.

The result of the trade with America, during the past year, in provisions, and other articles of modern import, warrants us in speaking with still more confidence of its growing importance; for, while f lie aggregate imports show a considerable excess over those of the previous year, the real advance which the trade has made has been much greater, and more encouraging in other respects, than the mere increase in imports would evidence. In the previous years, large shipments of various articles were made in complete ignorance of the qualities suited to the English markets, and which resulted, generally, in loss to the shippers; help as the operations of the past year, being regulated by the known wants of our market, and the guidance of past experience, have not only been attended with profit to those concerned, but have served also to place the trade on a more safe and permanent footing. The position of our market, too, in regard to stock, presents a favorable contrast to the preceding year; there being no accumulation of old and inferior parcels to interfere with the imports of the new season. Thus the stock of the following articles on the 3 1st of December, 1844, was only of beef equal to 3,427 tierces, pork 3,000 barrels, land 100 tons, and cheese 160 tons, against 6,080 tierces beef, 86 3 barrels pork, 6 96 tons land, and 285 tons cheese, on the same date in 1843; so that future arrivals will be met at once by the current demand as they come on the market. Under these circumstances, the prospects for a good and extending trade are more favorable than they have been at any former period since it opened. In the past month, the arrivals of all produce to our port have been unusually small, owing to the uninterrupted continuance of easterly winds for the last few weeks. Stocks are, in consequence, very low, which, joined to the usual disposition evinced by buyers to avoid purchases as much as possible at the close of the year, has led to a restricted business in most of the articles which we quote. In beef, the transactions have been few, from want of stock to operation the whole quantity in stock reported above consisting of inferior and unsuitable parcels. New is, consequently, much wanted; the few parcels that have arrived, so far, having met with immediate sale from the quay at 72 6d. for " prime mess" while 80s. was obtained for a small shipment of" family" beef. Equal rates will be secured for all the early arrivals of prime quality; and though some reduction will take place as supplies increase, yet there is a prospect of a higher range of prices being maintained throughout the whole season than were current last year, while the absence of I wish from the market will secure a more steady and continuous, as well as a more extensive demand. Of he quotations above are still given for old. We have no change to notice in the value of old pork, which goes off slowly within the range of our quotations, while I wish continues to realize equally high rates as at the date of our last advice. A few parcels of new American have arrived, all of prime quality, and showing a decided improvement on any former imports on re of them being superior to the usual brands of I rishcid127) prime mess and which was sold from the quay of 6. A higher rate will be obtained for parcels of similar quality arriving in the course of this month, arid a continued supply of such quality would soon place American on and equal level with I wish in regard to price. 'the result of these late shipments proves the correctness of the opinion we have already expressed, that American cures possess advantages, both as regards tlcid127h quality of 75] 424 their pork and its cheapness of price, which, if rightly improved, will enable them to furnish the principal portion of the pork required by the English i markets, as they already are likely to do with respect to beef. Therebeimng a considerable export demand for pork in this market, which can be much .increased by continuous supplies of prime qualities at moderate rates we would strongly recommend the trade to the notice of all parties who are interested in its extension. Cheese has not had quite so free a sale during the month, the advanced prices asked being unwillingly paid by buyers. The prospects of the market, however, are still favorable a, further advance in price being much, more likely than any decline from present rates. To decline in the value of cheese can in fact take place while our markets for other provisions remain in their present position; and as the late advices from America bring higher quotations from thence, with lessening shipments, the small stock held here is likely to be brought within still smaller compass before the end of the present month. Our market offers, therefore, every inducement for continued shipments, with the certainty of giving paying returns. With regard to butter, we have only to confirm our previous advices, that shipments of middling and inferior qualities would result well ; the duty being no obstacle in the present scarcity of I wish butter, which has again advanced from 49. to is. per cut. during the month. Grease butter would also have a free sale. Hard has continued, to meet a ready sale at our quotations, which do not vary from those of last month, except for the purest leaf in kegs, on which an advance of 2s. per cut. has been obtained. In the early part of the month there was some advance made on the finest qualities in barrels also, but which was again lost as supplies increased. The demand for such will, however, continue good; the high value of butter having thrown consumption more upon land, and the supply of I wish being unequal to meet the increasing demand. A process of be aching American, and preparing it forculinary purposes, has been discovered, which is likely to lead to its extensive substitution for I wish. The middling and inferior sorts, suitable for manufacturing purposes, are already at their extreme value relatively with tallow, and are not likely, therefore, to alter materially' from present rates. The stock, it will be observed, is light, as compared with the commencement of last year. The market for tallow has been dull throughout the month, and has declined 6d. to 9d. per cut; and as the home supply is found to be considerably in excess of that of former years, it is not probable that any advance will now take place on present rates, especially: as the demand usually slackens after Christmas. To further decline is looked fo. the market being now steady. Ashes have further declined in price, several parcels of pot having changed hands at 22s. 9d, and extensive sales taking place at 23s, which is now the current price, though some holders do not offer under 23s. 6d. 25s is the f nominal value for pearls. Sides have had a dull sale, and North American wet salted must bet quoted +d. per pound lower, 3d. being now the highest quotation. The total stock of hides on 3 1st December last was 20.9,985 against 296,137 aon31st December, 1843: the former includes 1,921 North American. Therehavebeen no transactions in American hemp to record. Sees wax has not sold freely and is lower 7 15s. being now an extreme quotation. Flax seed has been arriving freely, and sales to some extent have been 42[ 5 made at 66s. and 67s, which is its present current value; but, in consequence e of the great deficiency this year From the usual quantity exported from Fig a to I re land, there will be a large demand upon American, and which will lead to higher prices as the season advances. The season is still too early for any transactions of consequence in c lover seed, the value of which at present is quite nominal. The prospects for the article are good, and high prices will be obtained for prime parcels. The sale for linseed cake has improved, and higher prices are now paid for the best parcels, with the prospect of a continued good demand during the winter. Our corn market has kept very quiet throughout the month, (which, however, is usually the case in December) all parties being in disposed to increase their engagements at the end of the year, if they can avoid it. Heat and flour remain at low prices; but an opinion is generally held, that some movement upwards will take place after the turn of the year. The sale for Canadian flour is not brisk, the supplies of English and I wish being large, and the quality giving great satisfaction to the bakers. Tales of United States in bond, to the extent of 1,200 barrels, have been made at 17s. 6d; which is some advance on previous rates. We are yours, respectfully, J. & C.

Of Verpool, January 3, 1845.oDEAR Of    R: I have much pleasure to note, at the commencement of another year, the favorable position of the American provision trade. The advances evident in the few samples of the new cure of beef and pork that have arrived, and the marked improvement and liberal supplies of cheese, give Strong assurances of a permanent business in those articles; while a profitable trade in land and tallow has only been limited by a want of supplies. The following extract from the circular of an extensive cattle dealing firm contains important corroboration of our anticipations of the growing success of the provision trade; and is the more valuable as it is written for the home market only, without any reference to American circulation, and certainly without any partiality shown to the trade 4 With respect to salted provisions, we shall have a permanently established business from America for beef and pork; hitherto it has been in efficiently conducted, through ignorance on the part of the Americans as to what would suit the English market, and sales here having had to be effected at considerable sacrifice, and a clearance of nearly all the injudicious selections and old and bad lots having been made, and experience regulating the basis upon which the shipments on the road, and which are preparing for this country [must be made] will be the means of placing this trade in future in a methodical channel. From what has transpired, it is evident the I wish cures can have no chance of competing with the American importers in point of beef; but, with respect to pork, I wish maintains and is likely to maintain the pre eminence, although some corn fed pork of excellent quality was sold here last week at 61s. per barrel; which shows that, if America will really send the article required, price is a secondary object. Pierce middles, or bacon, of which there were a few arrivals in the early stage of this business, are not now looked for or thought of. Hard has been the stead i est article imported since the opening of this trade. The description, however, has been of various quality, very little amongst it suitable for c urinary purposes though, in consequence of the high price of I wish, it is inquired for now for that purpose; but it has become a staple article of commerce amongst the candles and land presses. Unitedstates or Canadian butter has bee in a small import during the year ; and considering the high price of I wish, andd rapid communication l between this port and America, its not coming forward leadd to a confirmation of the accounts that the Cacid127indialns he     a v i not turned their at tent t ion to it as an article of export; and that the duty from the States, added to the price there, would not mtakteit a profitable slhilpent, even if the pre see t high i price of I wish could be obtained fo it: The import of geese from n Merit A: has 75 ]a] 428 been heavy ; and although a large quantity has been of inferior quality, there have been some very prime parcels amongst it; and this, article, like all the American, provisions intended for this market, will, as the knowledge of the, trade becomes extended, find a proper level. Of the continuance and permanent e of our business with America for this articles here cal be no doubt, as they can send it good in quality, and moderate in prices have understood it would be acceptable to many parties to re publish, at this time, the directions for packing some of the leading articles of import, although they have been already widely circulated, and do not possess the same interest they had two years since. They will be found annexed. The threatened scarcity of money has not been realized. The rate in London is about 2, per cent, This, with the continued employment of the manufacturing districts, and the entire absence of mercantile speculation, gives good promise for the results of the new year just commenced. The, prevailing easterly winds have limited arrivals during the month of December, but transactions to a fair extent have taken place for which, see remarks under the usual head. With compliments of the season, I am, very respectfully, James Mchenry. Review of the market for December. Beefthe small imports of new have been taken readily, on arrivalatiextreme quotations. There is no doubt this market will be entirely dependent on America for supplies of beef. Porkabout 150 barrels new have arrived, so well handled as to realize: at once prices nearly equal to I wish; showing that the low prices heretofore obtained were attribute able to careless curing and packing, and not t quality of meat. Utter continues scarce and prices advance. With an import from I re land equal to 1,000 fir king per day, the stock is less than same time lastyearChaeseA large business has been done, but dealers have submitted reluctantly to the advanced prices. The quality continues to give satisfaction. Hamssales of really fine s mal hams could be made at highest quotations, but there are none here. Beeswaxsales at 7 12s. 6d. per: cut; but it is questionable whetherthis8price could be had for n more, as the supplies are more than ample for the demand. This article does not enter as largely into manufacturing purposes as formerly. Cloverseedthe stock is undoubtedly light, but holders ask higher rates than buyers will submit to, Should increased supplies from the continent not arrive, a considerable advance on present quotations must be looked for ;bunt there have been .no sales this season of new American. Flaxseedthere have been considerable arrivals from New Work; but holders :prefer storing to accepting: less than 70s. per tierce. The imports from Fig a into I re land being 16,4 36 barrels against 53,789 last year, leaves 429 a large balance of clean sowing seed to be made up by purchases elsewhere, and must cause prices to rule high during the season. Fploursales of 1,200 barrels in bond have been made at 17s. 6d which shows a gradual advance. I indian corn has gone largely into consumption, and is used as a substitute for cattle feeding articles, the price being relatively lower. Lard45s. have been had during the n moth for fine leaf in kegs. His was an extreme price for a favorite parcel. 40s. to 42s. could be had for a fair article. I wish land has advanced 8s. per cut. during the month. Hard in barrels has also been selling freely at e extreme quotations, but is now less in demand. The stock is only 100 tons, against 700 tons last year. The consumption in 1844 has been equally great as in 1843, with ai advance in price equal to is. per cut. during the last three months. Tallowthe large supplies from Australia, added to those from Southamerica, have more than, made up the small deficiency from Russia, and press down prices of North American, which, however, have advanced greatly in reputation. 40s. 6d. may now be given as the highest quotation for best quality, without any tendency to advance. Linseed cake continues to advance, but there is no stock here from the United States. Quercitron bark tales :to a considerable extent have been made at 7s. 6d. to 8s.

Cottonseed Of L, &c The following account of cotton seed oil, &c, from J. Hamilton Cooper, Esq, of Georgia, will be read with interest, as it shows the use which may yet be made of an article produced in large quantities, and before comparatively useless. A gentleman at the North is already making inquiries on this subject, which may lead to his em barking in this enterprise. It is not improbable, therefore, that cotton planters may rejoice to find an article of so little value hitherto may be converted into an important article of domestic and foreign use. It was received too late for reference in thereportThe seed of the Tea I s land or long staple cotton weighs about 40 lbs. to the bushel. As it is less coated with. fibre, the yield of oil to the bushel will be considerably greater than that of the upland; but I am unable to say what it is. As the two kinds are only varieties of the same plant, it is presumed that there is no difference in the oil from the two. Practically, considered, the Tea I s land cotton seed may be put out of the question, from its limited production, and the value set on it by planters as a manure. From the experiments made on a large scale at Watched, the oil from upland cotton seed was found, when well refined, to burn as well as spermaceti; it made also an excellent paint oil. Of ere was, however, much difficulty in refining it, and so much waste in accomplishing it as to render the manufacture unprofitable. The processes employed were such as were then used in the Netherlands, France, and in America; but none of them were satisfactory. There is every reason to expect that the great improvements and discoveries now making in organic chemistry will soon supply a satistisfactory process of refinement. As there :are 30 bushels of seed to every bale of cotton, each bale will yield at least 15 gallons of crude oil, and 360 lbs. of oil cake. If the of can be made to be worth 50 cents per gallon, and the cake be sold only for 75 ]a] 432 1 cent, an increase of                 $10 at least per bale, will be given, which in 2,000,000of bales will be           $20,000,000. Through tie greater part of the Western country, the seed is absolutely thrown away, as the lands are too rich to be manured. The oil cake from cotton seed has been extensively used by me as feed for horses, cattle, and sheep, and was found to be excellent. It may be used with equal advantage with rape cake for food or manure. Upland or Tea I s land cotton seed may be obtained from any of the factorsinCharleston or Savannah. To difficulty exists in pulling, tempering, or expressing the oil, Thehuller of Molle t & . Smith of Petersburg, Virginia, accomplished the first very effectually, at the rate of a bushel of berne l in four or five minutes and the machinery employed in French Glanders for rape seed, &c, answers perfectly for cotton seed. The present low prices of cotton will present a sufficient inducement to planters to save and sell the seed at reasonable prices; and it is believed that, if a cheap and effective mode of refining the oil can be discovered, this branch of manufacture will become one of very high value to the country.

The following letters from Messrs. Smelter and North were received too late to be noticed in the report; but, as they contain information on subjects which will interest many of the agriculturists of our country, it is believed that their insertion here will be gratifying to a portion of the readers of this document; and they are therefore inserted in this place, although somewhat out of their regular orderFREDERI  Of County, M1dbloomfield Arms, February 6, 1845. Of    R : Through the medium of the post office, I received your communication dated 3 1st January. It affords me pleasure to give you the required information in reference to the introduction of the China wheat into this country, and also the Oregon corn; together with such other information as may be necessary to promote the interest of the agriculturists. In reference to the China (or, as it is very often called, hardware) wheat, its introduction into America is of a novel character. Nevertheless, it is true; having obtained my information from a source well authentic a ted, therefore worthy of credit. The history is this: A few years since, there was some China ware imported from the north of China, and, on opening a crate of the ware, there were a few heads of wheat found in it; the head being so very large and compact, and the grain being so far superior 28 :75 ]a] 434 to our American wheat, the discovered was induced to plant those few grains, to make the experiment. I have been experimenting for several years; and last year sowed 10 bushels of said wheat, which yielded 292 bushels, or about 42, bushels to the acre. This wheat branches and grows very much like rye, and has never been injured by smut, mildew, or fly. It ri pens from 6 to 8 days earlier than any of the common species of wheat. I have obtained, through a gentleman from the Territory of Oregon, a kind which he stated was the native wheat of that country, and said to have grown there spontaneously for a great number of years. I sowed a small quantity of the Oregon wheat last fall; and, from present appearance, I think it well adapted to our soil and climate. I will now direct your attention to the growth and nature of the Oregon corn, of which I obtained a small quantity from General William Henryharrison, in 1839. He stated that it yielded more abundantly than any other corn he ever raised. I planted it, and can say its yield is more abundant than any species of corn within my knowledge. I raised from 4 acres, at one end of the field, 121. bushels to the acre. It shelled 7 bushels to the barrel. It is well worth the agriculturists attention; for my experience reaches me that its yield is at least 20 per cent. over our common species of corn. The Oregon corn should be planted from the 10th to the 25th of April. I planted mine last spring about the last of April; ploughed my ground in the spring, and planted it 34 feet one way by 2 feet the other way 2 s talks in a hill. In my opinion, it is much better (when it can be done) to plough the ground in the fall. The best mode I have ever tried to improve corn is to gather your liquid manure by sinking hogs heads, or something like manners vats, in or near your barn yard, so that you can conduct the water into them. Place a large case or hogs head on two wheels; fill your case or hogs head, and, with a pair of horses or cattle, draw it out on your corn field when the corn is for 3 inches high cover it over your rows of corn, with the s pilot right over your row of corn; put a small si eve under your s pilot, so as to sprinkle it over the corn. One hogs head of this liquid manure, applied in this way, is worth two loads cf barn yard manure applied in the usual way. I will now give you my opinion on the growth of wheat, as regards the ravages of the fly. I have often wondered, why it was that some wheat is more injured than others by this insect. I have come to the conclusion, by close observation, that wheat where the blade or leaf stands erect in the fall and early in the spring, is more subject to fly than the wheat where the blade or leaf keeps close to the ground ; from the fact that the fly in all cases deposites its eggs in the groove or hollow part of the blade, which is a conductor, when the rain or dews fall on them, to carry them to the stalk; whereas, in wheat that lies close to the ground, the rain w ashes most of them off, and consequently they must perish. A very good plan to prevent the fly from injuring the wheat is to take a log or roller, and roll or run it over your wheat in the fall and early in the spring, so as to keep it as close to the ground as possible ; it is also a very good preventive of the frost from injuring the wheat by pressing or throwing it out. Hours, %very respectfully, , , .a. H. R. Smeltze. L. I .sworn, Esq, Commissioner of Patents 435 [a[ 75 ]of  Ddletown, (CONN) February 6, 1845. My Dear Of    R: Your letter of the 25th multi mo, enclosing to me a quantity of <a name="seeds155"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, has been received; for which I feel very grateful to you. Agreeably to your request, I now enclose to you, by mail, about 700squash <a name="seeds156"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, with directions how to cultivate them, which are all that I have been able to procure as yet; but am in hopes of procuring a few more for you soon, and will send you all I can get. I know of no s qu ashes of the kind ever raised in this part of the country but by myself, excepting a few raised by my neighbors from seed that I gave them. In the receipt of your letter, I applied to them for some of the seed, but they had disposed of most of them before I received your letter. Last spring I planted four or five <a name="seeds157"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in my garden, and from them obtained about 700 weight of s qu ashes; and from one seed I had twos qu ashes, each of them weighing more than 120 pounds, besides two or three smaller ones. One of them I sent to the institute, or fair, in the city of New Work; for which I obtained the first premium in that institute for s qu ashes, by the person that took charge of it, if he informed me right. The other I sent to the fair in this place, which was judged to be the best presented there. The s qu ashes, when ripe, are of a beautiful yellow color, of a fine grain, and good for pies. The <a name="seeds158"><mark>seeds</mark></a> must be planted as early in the spring as the season will admit, without injury to the plant by frost; and the vine will grow until destroyed by the frost in the fall. In preparing the land before planting the <a name="seeds159"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, I take from my barn yard some well rotted manure, mix with it wood ashes, soaked lime and a little sprinkling of fine salt; mix it well with the manure, which will prevent the cut worm from destroying the plants, and will give a vigorous growth to the s qu ashes. But about one shovel full of it into each hill, mix it well with the soil; then plant the seed, by sticking the chit orsharpiend of the seed downwards in the hill. I put only one seed in a hill ; and in the dry season of the summer I occasionally water the plants with soaps6dds. And from four or five <a name="seeds160"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, cultivated as above stated, I can raise from 800 to 1,000 weight of s qu ashes. I am, sir, with much respect, your friend and obedient servant, Of    Meon North. Henry L. Ellsworth, Esqcommissioner of Patents, Washington, D. C. No. 44. From the Ohio Cultivatorthe Rust Of Bli Ght I N Wheat. What I S I The rust (or, as it is sometimes called, the blight) is the great enemy of the wheat crop in this country, and especially in the Western States. Millions of bushels of wheat are annually lost to the farmers of Ohio alone, by this malady; hence any thing tending to throw light upon this subject is of vast importance to the community. Hitherto, very little of practical value has been known about this disease at least by the majority of farmers. Each one has his own theory as to its nature, and the causes that produce it; and the theory of almost every one differs materially from that of hieS75 ]a] 436 neighbor, except that nearly all have settled down in the belief that, whatever may be its nature, the causes are beyond their control; and hence the evil n must be submitted to, as one of the dispensations of Providencesome, however, are not willing to settle down upon such conclusions and, as one of that number, it will be our aim to demonstrate, if possible, by facts ant arguments, that the evil can be, in a great degree, if not entirely avoided, when farmers will properly investigate the operationsofNature, and rightly interpret and reduce to practice the lessons which she reaches. Met us, then, kind readers, take up this subject in a reasonable and philosophical way; lay aside all our old theories, and go to work and examine facts; for the great error with most men in regard to such matters is, they begin by forming in their minds a theory, and then look for factsnierely to support their theory. The consequence is, they fail to observe facts of an opposite character, and of course seldom in arrive at the truth. First, then, let us examineWhai is the nature of the disease, or rust ?he find that farmers are no more agreed on this point, than in regard to its cause, or the .means of its prevention. A multitude of theories have been advanced, and some of them ingeniously argued; though, as we shall presently show, not sustained by facts. It would be useless for us to devote the space that would be necessary to examine or define these different theories; so we will only mention one that seems to be most common namely, that, owing to the state of the weather, or some other causes, the roots of the wheat absorb a greater amount of sap than can be properly elaborated or disposed of by the plant, and consequently the straw bursts or splits, and the sap exudes ;that the rust which is seen on the straw is merely the dried sap, or, as some hold, a species of fungus that takes root in the exuded sap; in either case, regarding it (the rust) as the effect or attendant of the disease, and not the disease itself. Some have carried this theory further, and believed that the disease was owing to the oxide of iron being absorbed from the oil by the roots, and poisoning the plant, causing the stem to burst, arid giving the appearance of rust to the exuded sap. But the fallacy of this supposition was soon shown by careful analysis of the rust itself, proving that it does not contain a particle of iron. But what, then, are the facts respecting the nature of the disease ?a? The annexed engraving, with a few explanatory remarks, will furnish an answer to this question, that we think must be plain and conclusive to every mind. Fig. 1. Section of diseased wheat straw, getly magnified, showing stripes of rust, hung i, and the bursting of the epidermis. Fig. 2. The hung i, or rust plants, greatly magnified, full grown, with the seedsscapingm two of them. Fig. 3. Small bunch of hung i, more maggied, showing their attachment to the creviceslit in the straw437The examination of diseased wheat straw, by the aid of a good compound microscope, demonstrates most conclusively that the rust consists entirely of minutefungiperfectplants, resembling small mushrooms, ortoadstools, and propagation g their species by proper <a name="seeds161"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. This is beautifully illustrated by the accompanying engravings, where fig. i is a section of wheat straw, with dark g ranula ted stripes representing the rust ; and on the sides can be seen the swelling up and bursting of the epidermis, or skin, of the straw. It is shown, by the microscope, that the fun gibe gin to grow inside of the straw, beneath this epidermis; and immediately on its bursting or splitting, it protrudes outside, and rapidly grows to its full size and perfection. The small figure (3) shows a cluster of thesefungi, (magnified taken off the straw, and exhibiting their manner of attachment, by their roots, to the are vice or slit in the straw. The central figure (2) is a representation of a very small cluster of the hung i, full grown, and greatlyanagnified, showing their uniform shape, (though this varies somewhat) and two of them scattering seed from their tops. The quantity of seed they contain is very great, the large head or ball being filled with it. It is this that forms the fine red dust which floats in the air like vapor, in badly rushed fields of wheat. It resembles the smoke, or more properly the seed, of that well known fungus, the off ball; and in ay be carried by the winds from one farm to another, over vast districts f country, spreading the contagion 'to every field that is from amy pus rendered in a fit condition for receiving the disease. Abundance 6 of testimony could be a deduced to prove the contagious nature of the disease ;and also that it does not attack all fields alike, but is greatly influenced by soil and cultivation. But it will be asked, if the rust or hung i are propagated by seed in this way, how is it that they commence growing inside of the wheat ten, as above stated ?a? The answer is, such are found to be the face and its with these we have mainly to do at present; the how and the why will be after consideration. Suffice it to say, however, that these <a name="seeds162"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are so exceedingly small, that they can, and we suppose do, pass into the plant tririughihe s tomato or air vessels of the leaves, and are carried with the designing sap intothe stem. But this is only theory, deductible from the fact se have stated; for we have no actual demonstration on this point. Another explanation, (and to our mind a plausible one, though we have never seen it suggested by any other writer) is, that the <a name="seeds163"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of thefungi, on falling to the ground in the fields to which they are transported, are washed into the soil, by rain, and taken up by the open mouths of the spongioles, or rooptletsandhus carried into the circulation with the food of the plant. Thisiagainsuggests the probability that these <a name="seeds164"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may remain in the asooiI ,o e applied with straw and manure, so as to in this way infect the succeed g e op, if circumstances should be favorable to the development of the ]a. ice. But it is easy to see that more minute and careful observations ar necessary to decide these and many other points connected with this t subject. We hope the foregoing will be, sufficient to settle the question, What is rust ?a? and serve as a basis for subsequent investigations. We are aware that these statements will suggest many queried and speculations in the minds of our wheat growing readers. We desire they should ; and when they had he had time to ponder over this chapter, we will give them another on the same subject[ 75] 438. Synopsi    S Of Fees, &c, For Patents I N Forei Of Countri  Of. The British dominions. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and I re land is divided into three countries, for each of which separate patents must be obtained by any inventor who wishes to protect his invention throughout the whole of the British dominions: one for England and Tales, in which may be included the British colonies and possessions, by the petitioner signifying his intention to that effect; one for Scotland; and one for I re land. The average ordinary cost, if unopposed, and passed in the usual manner, without extra fees, will be, agents commission included, as follows For England, Tales, and colonies, &c, about -a-  $5.50For Scotland -3 90 For I re land -6 5 Three specifications -2 00 Total -17 65. The inventor or applicant for patents is not required to give a detailed description of his invention. He has only to sign a declaration before a master in chancery to the title of his invention, and he receives, after due proceedings are had, a grant of letters patent; after which, he has a certain time to specify usually 6 months. Applications for patents are sent from this country to England to an agent, who takes out the patent in his own name, and then sells or transfers the right, as the inventor directs. A patent of this kind is taken out as a communication from a foreigner abroad. Patents are granted for 14 years. France. Patents are granted in this country for 5, 10, or 15 years, at the option of the patentee. The application must be accompanied with a perfect description, written in the French language, and two sets of drawings. The term of a patent cannot, after it is granted, be extended. Very invention must be worked within 2 years after the date of the patent; otherwise, it may be can celled. The cost will generally amount to about 8300, and agents fees. If a patent is taken out in on y other country subsequent to the date of the patent in France, the patent in France is void. Belgium.

The magnet o electric machine was originally contrived by Mr. Tax ton, soon after the commencement of the interesting discovery of Vara day, that magnet ism was capable of exciting electricity. The conditions necessary for obtaining electricity in this way were, chiefly, the disturbance of magnetic forces in a bar of soft iron surrounded by coils of wire. A number of mechanical contrivances were resorted to, in order to effect this disturbance, by causing the bar of iron, thus surrounded, to approach to and recede from the poles of powerful magnets; but the ingenuity of Mr. Tax ton far exceeded them all, by giving to the coils and enclosed bar a rotary movement about the poles of a Form magnet. This instrument afforded bright sparks and strong shocks; but the currents of electricity thus obtained could not be converted to any useful purpose, as, in each half revolution of the coils, the currents were in opposite directions. I n 1838 Professor Age published in Sillimans Journal an account of an improved form of the machine, doing away with many existing objections, and furthermore rendering it at once a useful instrument, by a contrivance for conducting these opposing currents into one channel or direction, which part of the contrivance was called the unitess. The current produced in this way was capable of performing the work, to a certain extent, of the power developed by the galvanic battery; and the machine was found adequate to the furnishing of shocks for medical purposes, for exhibiting the decomposition of water, furnishing the elements oxygen Said hydrogen at their respective poles, and producing definite electro chemical results. These two last results could not' be obtained without the aid of the unitess. But, with this improvement, the instrument was still wanting in one property of the galvanic battery, viz: that property which chemists call quantity, or that power upon which depends its abilitytd6 magnet i ze, and also to heat platino m wires. This last property has been given to the machine by the recent contrivance of Professor Age. The machine, in its novel construction under his improvement, developed what is called, by way of distinction, the current of intensity, but had a very feeble magneticing power. By a peculiar contrivance of the coils not to be made public until his rights are in some way secured) the current of quantity is obtained in its maximum, while, at the same time, the intensity is so much diminished that it gives scarcely any shock, and decomposes feebly. It has been successfully tried with the magnetic telegraph of Professor Horse, and operates equally well with the battery. I t affords, by simply turning a crank attached to the machine, a constant current of galvanic electricity ; and as there is no consumption of material necessary to obtain this power, it will doubtless supersede the use of the galvanic battery, which, in the event of constant employment, would be very expensive, from the waste of zinc, platino m, acids, mercury' and other materials used in its construction' It particularly recommends itself for magneticing purposes, as it requires no knowledge of chemistry to insure the result, being merely mechanical in its action, and is always ready for action without previous preparation; the turning of a crank being the only requisite when the machine is in order. It is not liable to 441 i 75 let out of order; does not diminish perceptibly in power when in constant use, and ,actually gains power when standing at rest. I t will be particularly gratifying to the man of science, as it enables him to have always at hand a constant power for the investigation of its properties, without any labor of preparation. We notice among the beautiful results of this machine, that it charges an electro magnet so as to sustain a weight of 1,000 pounds, and it i unites to a white heat large platino m wires, and, say be used successfully for blasting at a distance ; and should Government ever adopt any such system of defence as to need the galvanic power, it must supersede the battery in that case. Professor Age demonstrates, by mathematical reasoning, that the new contrivance of the coils affords the very maximum of quantity to be obtained by magneticexcitation. E75442i. Morses Electromagneti C Telegraph. The electro magnet is the basis upon which this whole invention rests in its present construction; without it, it would entirely fail. The electro magnet is produced by coiling around a bar of soft iron, made in the form of a horse shoe, (fig. 1,) copper wire previously covered, similar to bonnet wire, and varnished to prevent metallic contact with each other and the iron fig. 2.) The two terminations of the wire, thus surrounding the iron in a spiral form, are brought out at each end of the curved bar, and are connected, one with the zinc pole of a galvanic battery, the other with the platino m; the 443[ 75 battery being prepared in the usual manner with its cor riding acid, produces galvanic electricity, which starts off from one pole of the battery, follows the wire around the soft iron, and returns to the other pole of the battery by the other wire thus forming a complete circuit. The galvanic fluid is now passing the whole length of the wire, and, while thus passing, the curved iron becomes a strong magnet. By connecting the two ends of the bent iron with a bar of similar soft iron, it will support many pounds weight. I f, while in this condition, one of the wires is removed from the battery, the cross bar falls, and with it its weights. The curved iron returns instantly to its original state. It is unmagnetized. Complete the circuit, as at first, and in an instant it is again a magnet. Break the circuit, and it ceases to be a magnet. If the battery is placed 100, or 1,000, or 10000 feet from the magnet, yet, when the one is connected with the other by intervening wires, the effect upon the magnet is the same making it a magnet when the circuit is complete, and vice versa when it is broken of n this way, power is produced at a point of considerable distance from the gene rating agent, and wholly at the command of the operator at the battery to make or destroy the power produced, with the utmost possible rapidity. Of  , 3 The above figure represents the most simple form of the electro magnet, with its appropriate machinery for telegraph in purposes. A represents aside view of the bent iron bar, surrounded with its coils of copper wire, standing upon a platform D. V being an upright arm secured to D, to which the magnet or soft iron, is permanently fastened by means of the bolt B B B passing between the wrongs of the curved iron, and through the board V, and adjusting screw C. E is th projecting wrong of the iron after it has passed through the coils-one only being seen. The other wrong is directly behind E. G represents the end of the iron bar, or keeper, extending back so far as to cover both the projecting ends of thehorseshoeformed magnet. This iron bar, or keeper, is fastened to the levers H, which is delicately adjusted so as to is e and fall by a pilot at I. Represents a steel spring over the lever 11 H, and passes through a loophole L, formed from a brass wire; the lower part of the brass wire being secured to the lever H H by means of a screw at M. 0 is a hardened steel[ 75 ]a] 444 point, similar to those used by manifold letter writers, and is also connected with the lever H H, and directly over the centre of the metallic roller T, in which a slight groove is made, to correspond with the point of 0. R represents the standard in which the axis of the roller T freely revolves, and is a part of D. The line S represents the paper, in form of a rib and, passing from its coil between the roller and the point of 0. N and P are the two extremities of the wire upon the magnet A. Very part is now described and, from what has preceded the description, bearing in mind the effect of the battery when in action upon the soft iron, by forming a complete circuit with the wires N and P, the mode of writing by the instrument may be easily comprehended by what follows. Complete the circuit, and instantly the cross bar G approaches the ends of the magnet E, until they meet in the direction of arrow W. Break the circuit, and G is carried up in the direction of arrow X, by means of the spring K. If to the roller T clock work is attached, to give it a uniform movement upon its axis, the paper Will move with the same uniform motion under the point 0; then, by completing the circuit, the point O is brought down upon the paper, which is invented to such a degree as to make it perfectly apparent, and continues to mark it in that manner so long as the circuit is closed; but, upon breaking the circuit, the marking ceases, and the point O flies from the paper, which continues passing on. If the circuit is closed and broken with the utmost rapidity, then a succession of dots and spaces upon the paper appears. If the circuit is successively closed and broken with less rapidity, short lines and intervening short spaces are made. If closed for 'a longer time and broken in succession, then the marks become longer; so that dots, short lines, long lines, and short or long spaces, are made, according to the time the circuit is closed, and the rapidity with which the paper moves under the pen. An arbitrary arrangement of these dots, short and long spaces and lines, constitute the telegraph in alphabet; by means of which, intelligence to any extent is communicated. Thus one dot may represent, two dots B, three dots C, one dot and a line D, &c. The paper to be imprinted is fixed upon a revolving cylinder, and records des patches day and night; and this without ink, as the impressions are easily read, even by the blind. The records of the night continue entered on the morning. The alphabet is easily learned. Extracts from a letter addressed by Professor Horse to the Secretary of the Treasury, relative to the magnetic telegraph. That which seemed to many chimerical at the time, is, now completely realized. The most skeptics l are convinced; and the daily and ,hour ly operations of the telegraph, in tcid127ansmitting information of any kind, are so publicly known, and the 4,blic feeling in regard to' it so universally expressed, that I need here only give a few instances of its action, further to illustrate its character. The facts in relation to the transmission of the proceedings of the Democratic Convention at Baltimore, in May last, are well known, and are alluded to in my report to the department, June 3, 1844. (house a, 28th Long, 1st sess) Since the adjournment of Congress iniJune last, and during the summer and autumn, the telegraph has been in 445 [a[ 75 constant readiness for operation, and there has been time to test many points in relation to it, which needed experience to settle. For more, now, than eight months, the conductors for the telegraph, carried on elevated posts for forty miles, have remained undisturbed from the wantonness or evil disposition of any one. Not a single instance of the kind has occurred. In several instances, indeed, the communication has been interrupted by accidents, but then only for a very brief period. One of these was by the great fire in Or att street, Baltimore, which destroyed one of the posts, and consequently temporarily stopped the communication; but in two or three hours the damage was repaired, and the first notice of the accident, and all the particulars, were transmitted to Washington by the telegraph itself. Another instance of interruption was occasioned by the felling of a tree, which accidentally fell across the wires, and at the same time across the railroad track stopping the cars for a short time, and the telegraph in communication for two hours. Excepting the time excluded by these, and two or three other similar accidental interruptions, and which, during seven months of its effective existence between the two cities, does not altogether amount to more than twenty-four hours, the telegraph has been either in operation, or prepared for operation, at any hour of the day or night, irrespective of the state of the weather. It has transmitted intelligence of the greatest importance. During the troubles in Philadelphia the last summer, sealed des patches were sent by express from the mayor of Philadelphia to the President of the Unitedstates. In the arrival of the express at Baltimore, the purport of the des patches transpired; and while the express train was in preparation for Washington, the intelligence was sent to Washington by telegraph, accompanied by an order from the president of the railroad company to prevent the Washington burden train from leaving until the express should arrive. The order was given and complied with. The express had a clear track and the President and the cabinet, being in council, had notice both of the fact that an express was on its way with important des patches to them, and also of the nature of those des patches; so that, when the express arrived, the answer was in readiness for the messenger. In October, a deserter from the United States ship Pennsylvania, lying at Norfolk, who had also defrauded the purse r of the ship of some      $600 or    $700, was supposed to have gone to Baltimore. The purse r called at the telegraph office in Washington, slated his case, and wished to give notice in Baltimore, a 'the same time offering a reward for the apprehension of the culprit. The name, and description of the offender person, with the offer of the reward, were sent to Baltimore, and in ten minutes the -warrant was in the hands of the officers of justice for his arrest; and, in half an hour from the time that the purse r preferred his request at Washington, it was announced from Baltimore by the telegraph, " The deserter is arrested; he is in jail. What shall be done with him ?to show the variety of the operations of the telegraph, a game of drafts and several games of chess have been played between the cities of Baltimore and Washington, with the same ease as if the players were seated at the same table. To illustrate the independence of the telegraph of the weather and time of day, I would state that, during the severe storm of the 75 ]a] 4465th of December, when the night was intensely dark, the rain descending in torrents, and the wind blowing a gale, it seemed more than ordinarily mysterious to see a company around a table in a warm retired chamber on such a night in Washington, playing a game of chess with another company similarly situated in Baltimore the darkness, the rain, and the wind, being no impediment to instantaneous communication. In regard to the quantity of intelligence which may be sent in a given time, it is perfectly safe to say that thirty characters can be transmitted in a minute by a single instrument and, as these characters are conventional signs, they may mean either numbers, letters, words, or sentences. As an illustration of this point, I will state that nearly a whole column more than seven-eighths) in the Baltimore Patriot was transmitted in thirty minutes faster than the reporter in Baltimore could transcribe. This fact bears upon the ability of producing a revenue from the telegraph; and I would suggest the propriety of permission being granted by Congress to the department to adjust a tariff of charges on intelligence sent by telegraph, at such a rate of postage as shall at least return to the treasury the interest of the capital expended in the first construction and the after maintenance of the telegraph* *a* *a* *a* ,a' *a* *a* *a* *I n the absence of experience, the expense necessary to construct and to maintain a system of electro magnetic telegraphs was thought to be so great as to present a formidable, if not an insurmountably, obstacle to its adoption. But the experiment already made for forty miles has shown that the electro magnetic telegraph is far from being expensive either in its first construction or after maintenance, especially when its vast superiority over the old system is taken into consideration. To make this more clear, I give an abstract both of the expenses and capacities of the ordinary visual telegraphs in some of the European countries. In England, the semi shore telegraph established between London and Portsmouth (a distance of seventy-two miles) is maintained by the British Government at an average expense of 3,405, or               $15,118 per annum. From a return vol. 30, 1843, accounts and papers of House of Commons of the number of days during which the telegraph was not available on account of the weather during a period of three years, it appears that there were in that time 323 days in which it was useless, or nearly one year out of three !a! But by a return made to the admiralty of the number of hours in the day appointed for working the telegraph, it appears that the hours appointed for the year are from the 1st of October to the 8th of February, from 10 o clock a. m, to 3 p. my hours; from the 1st of March to the 30th of September, from 10 o clock a. m, to 5 p. my hours. Average number of hours per day in the most favorable weather, 6 hours !reducing one year from the three for un available days, the average time per day for the three years would be but 4 hours. To that for the use of their telegraph for seventy-two miles, and for only 4 hours in the day, the British Government expend               $15,118 per annum. The French system of telegraphs is more extensive and perfect than, that of any other nation. It consists at present of five great lines extending from the capital to the extreme cities of the kingdom, to wit The Mala is line, from Paris to Mala is -152 miles. The Strasbourg line, from Paris to Strasbourg -255 "the Rest line, from Paris to Rest -325 "447 [a[ 75 ]the Toulon line, from Paris to Toulon 1 -7 miles. The Bayonne line, from Paris to Bayonne -425 "making a total of 1,474 miles of telegraph in intercourse. These telegraphs are maintained by the French Governtnent at an annual expense of over 1,000,000 of francs, or           $202,000. The whole extent, then, of the French lines of telegraph, is 1,474 miles, with 519 stations; and (if the estimate for six stations, at an average cost of 4,400 francs, is a criterion for the rest) erected at a cost of at least     $880 each making a total of    $456,720. The electro magnetic telegraph, at the rate proposed in the bill, (to wit,   $461 per mile, and which it should be remembered will construct not one line only, but six) could be constructed the same distance for     $619,514--not one third more than the cost of the French telegraphs. Even supposing each line to be only as efficient as the French telegraphs, still there would be six times the facilities for not one third more cost. But when it is considered that the French telegraph, like the English, is un available the greater part of the time, the advantages in favor of the magnetic telegraph become more obvious. An important difference between the two systems is, that the foreign telegraphs are all a burden upon the treasury of their respective countries while the magnetic telegraph proposes, and is alone capable of sustaining itself and producing a revenue. Another difference in the two systems is, that the stations in the foreigntelegraphsamust be within sight of each other: a fact which bears essentially on the cost of maintenance. The French telegraph requires, for the distance of 1,474 miles, no less than 519 stations averaging one for about every three miles. The number of stations of the magnetic telegraph, on the contrary, is optional, The two stations (one only at Baltimore and one at Washington) show that they may be at least 40 miles apart; and there is no reason to doubt, from experiments I have made, that 100 miles, or even 500 miles, would give the same results. In the maintenance, therefore, of stations, the magnetic telegraph would require but 15 stations, (assuming that 100 miles is th' utmost limit of transmission between two stations, which is not probable) while the French requires 519 for the same distance. When to this are added the facts, that the magnetic telegraph is at all times available, at every hour of the day or night, irrespective of weather that, in comparison with the visual telegraphs, it communicates more than a hundred fold the quantity of intelligence in the same time; that it is originally constructed at a less cost, (all things considered) that it is maintained for less; and that it is capable, by a rate of charges for transmitting intelligence, not only of defraying all its expenses, but, if desired, of producing a revenue may be permitted to hope that, when these great advantages are fully understood, my system will receive that attention from the Government which its intrinsic public importance demands* *a* *a* *a* *a* *a* *a* . In the autumn of 1842, at the request of the American I institute, I undertook to give to the public in New York a demonstration of the practice ability of my telegraph, by connecting Governors island with Castle Garden a distance of a mile; and for this purpose, I laid my wires properly insulated beneath the water. I had scarcely begun to operate, and had received but two or three characters, when my intentions were frustrated by the accidental destruction of a part of my conductors by a vessel while, 75 J 448 drew them up on her anchor and cut them off. In the moments of mortification, in a sleepless night, I devised a plan for avoiding such in accident in future, by so arranging my wires along the banks of the river as to cause the water itself to conduct, the electricity across. The experiment, however, was deferred till I arrived at Washington and on December 16th, 1842, I tested my arrangement across the canal, and with success. The simple fact was then ascertained, that electricity could be made to cross a river without other conductors than the water itself; but it was not until the last autumn that I had the leisure to make a series of experiments to' ascertain the law of its passage. The following diagram will serve to explain the experiment :A -a- -4 3 2 1 h g 4 3 2 1, 000000000000jw P Of, B, C, D, are the banks of the river; N, P, are the matter ; E is the electro magnet; w, w, are the wires along the banks, connecting with copper plates, f, g, h, i, which are placed in the water. When this arrangement is complete, the electricity generated by the battery passes from the positive pole P to the plate h, across the river, through the water, to plate i, and thence, around the coil of the magnet E, to plate f; across the river again to plate g, and thence to the other pole of the battery, N. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, indicate the distance along the bank measured by the number of times of the distance across the river, The distance across the canal is 80 feet; on August 24th, the following were the results of the experiment to. of the ex- No. of cups inSperiment. battery 1 142 143 144 75 76 7 Length of conductors, w, w, 400400400400800200Degrees of motion of galvanometer 32 & 24 132 & 431 & 124 & 1 329 & 212 11 & 1512Size of the copper plates, f, g, h, in by 2- feet 16 by 13 inch 6 by 5 inch 5 by 2 i feet 5 by 23 feet 5 by 2, feet. Showing that electricity crosses the river, and in quantity in proportion to the size of the plates in the water. The distance of the plates on the same side of the river from each other also affects the result. Having ascertained the general fact, I was desirous of discovering the best practical distance at which to place my copper plates; and, not having the leisure- ~a- -a- -a~ 'a- ;a- :a: -a- -a- -449 [a[ 75 ]myself, I requested my friend, Professor Pale, to make the experiments for me. *a* *a* *a* *is the result of these experiments, it would seem that there may be situations in which the arrangements I have made for passing electricity across the rivers may be useful, although experience alone can determine whether lofty scars, on which the wires may be suspended, erected in the rivers, may not be deemed the most practical. The experiments made were but for a short distance; in which, however, the principle was fully proved to be correct. It has been applied, under the direction of my able assistants, Messrs. Nail and Rogers, across the Susquehanna h river, at Havredegrace, with complete success a distance of nearly a mile. I have as yet said nothing on the telegraph as a mighty aid to national defence.  I to importance in this respect is so obvious, that I need not dilate. The importance generally, to the Government and to the country, of a perfect telegraph in system, can scarcely be estimated by the short distance already established between Baltimore and Washington; but when all that transpired of public interest at New Orleans, at It. Louis, at Pittsburgh, at Cincinnati, at Buffalo, at Tic a, at Albany, at Sort land, at Portsmouth, at Boston, at New Work, at Philadelphia, at Baltimore, at Washington, at Norfolk, at Richmond, at Charleston, at Savannah, and at all desired intermediate points, shall be simultaneously known in each and all these places together when all the agents of the Government in every part of the country are in instantaneous communication with headquarters s when the several departments can at once learn the actual existing condition of their remotest agencies, and transmit at the moment their necessary orders to meet any exigencythen will some estimate be formed both of the powers and advantages of the magnetic telegraph 75 :3 450. During the past season, I have erected three tenements of unburnt brick in Washington city, and also one on Grand prairie, in the State of n diana. The settlers on the prairies have expressed great satisfaction at this new experiment there. The house is cheap and convenient; a plan of which is annexed Fig. 1. Fig? 3. Fig. 2. S',/ " -t 7 .4gm1Fig. 4..4451 75 Fig 5. Fig. 1. Round plan; the dotted line shows in which direction the building should be extended. Fig. 2. Cross section. Fig. 3. Side view. Fig. 4. Perspective view. Fig. 5. Shows the manner of laying the unburnt bricks and the foundation. It is twenty-eight feet by eighteen, making a room of sixteen feet square, and two bed rooms eight feet square on the first floor. One chimney only is required; and the whole is so arranged that an additional room can be built without another blue. The house has but a single door; and this is so located that it will lead into the additional room, should one be built; a stairway is made into the upper story (see fig. 2) by extending the outer walls three or four feet above the joints, which rest on the brick. The upper room will admit of a division, making a lodging room over the bedrooms; or what may be better, and is adopted in my house, making a tier of berths resembling those in steamboats, on both side slighted and ventilated by a window in the end of the building. This upper room will accommodate very conveniently twenty lodgers, with separate beds. ,kicks of osnaburgs, one and a quarter yard wide, filled with corn husks, well hack led after the butt end is cut off laid on narrow ash or other supple boards, with a " comfortable" made of cotton, will secure easy and economical beds, and afford sufficient warmth for ordinary weather. The window frames are made of plank, of the thickness of the walls; the panes being 8 by 10 inches; cost from three to five cents per light. Give windows are needed for the whole house. Any persons have been deterred from erecting unburnt brick houses, fearing the clay was not suitable. In this point, I would remark that almost all kinds of clay will answer; and if a cellar is needed, this must be built of stone. The following directions will enable any one to complete a building Plan of cheap cottage Select a suitable spot of ground, as near the place of building as practicable, and let a circle ten feet or more be described. Met the loam be removed, and the clay dug up one foot thick or, if clay is not found on the spot, let it be carted in to that depth. Any ordinary clay will answer. Read this clay with cattle, and add some straw cut six or eight inches long using two common bundles to one hundred brick. After the clay is tempered by working it, the material is duly[ 75 1 452 prepared for the brick. A mould is then formed of plank, of the size of the brick desired. In England they are usually made eighteen inches long, one foot wide, and nine inches thick. I have found the most convenient size to be one foot long, six inches wide, and six inches thick. The mould should have a bottom, not air tight, since mortar will not fall when a vacuum is produced. The clay is then spread in the moulds in the same manner that brick moulds are ordinarily filled. A wire or piece of iron hoop will answer very well for striking off the top. One man will mould about as fast as another can carry away-two moulds being used by him. The bricks are placed upon the level ground, where they are suffered to dry for two days, turning them edge wise the second day ; and then packed in a pile, protected from the rain, and left ten or twelve days to dry; during which time the foundation of the building can be prepared. If a cellar is desired, this must be formed of stone or brick, two feet above the surface of the ground. For cheap buildings on the prairies, where stones are scarce, wooden s ills, twelve or fourteen inches wide, may be laid on piles or stone. His will form a good super structure. In all cases, however, before coil menacing the walls for the first story, it is very desirable, as in ,walls of brick, to lay a single course of slate; this will intercept the dampness so often arising in the walls of brick houses. The wall is laid by placing the brick in length wise ; thus making the wall one foot thick. Ordinary clay, such as is used for clay mortar, will suffice for laying up the brick ; though a weak mortar of sand and line, where these articles are cheap, is recommended, as affording more adhesive material for the plaster. A mortar composed of three parts clay, two parts ashes, and one part sand, is very good ; and this, when lime is not plenty, answers for plastering the inside. For ceiling, however, where there is walking overhead, lime plaster should be used. The walls may safely be carried up one, two, or three stories; the division walls may be six inches thick, just the width of the brick. The door and window frames being inserted as the wall proceeds, the building is soon raised. The roof may be singles or thatch. In either case, it should project over the sides of the house, and also over the ends, at least two o feet, to guard the wall from vertical rains. The exterior All is plastered with good lime mortar, mixed with cattle s hair or hogs bristled, (short ones) and then, with a second coat, pebble dashed. The inside is plastered without dashing. The floors may be laid with oak boards, slit, five or six inches wide, and laid down without jointing or planing, if ,they are rubbed over with a rough stone after the rooms are finished. Doors of a cheap, and neat appearance may be made by taking two boards of the length or width of the doors ; placing them vertically, they will fill the space. But a wide bat ten on the bottom, and a narrow one on the top, with strips on the sides and a strip in the middle. This door will be a bat ten door, presenting two long panels on one side, and a smooth surface on the other. If a porch or veranda h is wanted, it may be made with cedar posts placed in the ground, with single or thatched roof. Houses built in this way are dry and warm in winter, and cool in summer, and furnish no retreat for ver min. They can be made by common laborers in a very short time, (a little carpenters work excepted) and with a small out lay for materials, exclusive of floors, windows, doors, and roof. ,453 The question will naturally arise, will the walls stand against the rain and frost ?a? I answer, they have stood well in Europe, South America, and Canada. Whoever has noticed the rapid absorption of water by a brick that has been burned will not wonder why brick walls are damp. Turning them makes the brick porous, while the unburnt brick is less absorbent but it is not proposed to present the unburnt brick to the weather. Whoever has erected a building with merchant able brick will at once perceive the large number of soft and yellow brick partially burned that it contains, brick that would soon yield to the mould bring influence of frost and storm. Such brick are however placed within, beyond the reach of rain, and always kept dry. A good cabin is made by a single room twenty feet square. A better one may be erected eighteen feet wide and twenty-six feet long, cutting off eight feet on one end, for two small rooms eight feet square. Now easy could a settler erect such a cabin on the Western prairies, where clay is usually found about fifteen inches below the surface, and where stone and lime are often both very cheap. The article of brick fr chimneys is found to be quite an item of expense in wood houses. In these mud houses no bricks are needed, except for the tops of the chimneys, the oven, and casting for the fireplace; though this last might be will dispensed with, and a cement to put round the chimneys, or to fill any other cracks, is easily made, as before mentioned, by a mixture of one part of sand, two of ashes, and three of clay. This soon gardens, and will resist the weather. Boiled linseed oil may be added, to make the composition harder. There have been numerous attempts to improve the appearance of buildings by w ashes; the great objection is the liability of these applications to wash off. The following recipes are given with much confidence-one for wood, and the other for brick or stone work. The superiority of this wash depends upon white vitriol, sometimes called sulphate of zinc, which is a powerful morrant to hard en and fix the paint. For brick or stone one barrel of stone lime, (fresh burnt the best s lake it, and then add two barrels of hydraulic cement or water lime, stir them together until about the thickness of paint suitable to be laid on with a brush; then add twelve pounds of white vitriol, (sulphate of zinc) stir the same for an hour, or until thoroughly mixed ; let it remain twenty-four or thirty hours, and it is then fit for use. When you commence using it, take for every four gallons one quart of fine dry sand, and stir them together put it on the wall with a large paint brush; if too thick, add a little water. This mixture produces a pale yellow; after which, (when dry) to produce a pure white, go over the same with white wash, as follows :1 bushel of lime, with 1 pound of sulphate of zinc. For wood work 1 bushel of lime 1 pound of white vitriol, (sulphate of zinc 1 quart of salt 1 peck of white sand. I do not suppose the sand important for wood work. Sulphate of zinc can be formed by taking one part sulphuric acid, four parts water, and adding as much zinc as it will take up. Another recipe is used in Washington, which looks remarkably well, viz : For a barrel of wash, s lake six quarts of stone lime, add four bushels of hydraulic lime, and one pint and a half of salt. It dries quick, so that[ 75 454youinmay soon add another coat; two coats look very well. This substance adheres to the stone. There is one great advantage in these w ashes, besides preserving thebipkiand wood the hydraulic cement does much to exclude moisture o one will regret the trifling expense, when he sees the improvements in His buildings and fences by these applications. The following plan of a chimney cap for injuring a draught, and preventing the wind from blowing down the s tack, is well worth public attention. It is represented in the accompanying drawing. Figure 1 being a perspective view of a part of the s tack, with the cap thereon and figure 2 a top view, and consists of four planes, c c c c, placed at the top of the s tack b, and one on each side of the blue a, and inclining downwards therefrom, at an angle of about 45 degrees; the junctions of the planes c being provided with wings d did d. A current of wind imp singing on one or two of the planes c, is deflected in ,an upward direction by the inclination of the plane or planes, and its velocity gradually increased in- passing from the base to the top of the plane, by means of the wings, which narrow the space through which thercurrept has to pass. This gives great force to the current in passing over the top of the blue in an upward direction, and carries with it downward currents, which otherwise might blow down the s tack. Fig. 1. Fig. 2,t455E75 ]L. I improvements made on the plan suggested in a former report for enclosing farms, especially the prairies, induces me to comply with the request of umerouscorrespondents, to add something on the subject in the present report. The United States have a deep interest in this matter, since they down so many millions of acres of fine soil, well adapted to field culture, if it could be fenced. Fig. 1. Fig. 4. Fig. 2. Fig. 3.

God banks or earth banks, if laid with too acute angles, will assuredly be affected in northern climates by the frost and storms, while a gradual slope with a good broad base will turf over and stand welLThose who are skeptics l may find how flourishing the grass is on the declivity of hills sufficiently steep for the sides of a ditch. Experience leaves no doubt in my own mind on this subject. I am happy, however, to be confirmed in my opinion by a letter from Mr. Samuel Men kin, an intelligent farmer, who lives on the Thaw nee prairie, in the State of I n diana, and who has made several miles of fence by ditching as now proposed. He says "there can be no doubt about the matter; the ditches do not wash down, but remain firm These ditches are made by simply uniting two planks at an angle of 21 or 22 degrees, as exhibited in figure 5. One improvement consists in having the land side (which goes in the furrow) project in front about 2 feet, in order to keep the ditcher steady. The mould board must be leveled the level being on the inner side) if the plank is shod with iron, it will do better; also, if a strip of boiler iron is placed upon the outside of the mould board, extending below it I or 2 inches, it will work it to more advantage. The ditches can be made of such materials as are at hand two planks will answer. In the land side might be a stick of timber 3 by 8 or 10 inches. The angle being given, the ditches may be made to suit the purpose of the farmer. If a wide or high embankment is needed, the whole frame must be longer; the c amputation is easily made. Considering the ditch a triangle, the base will give the width of the bank, measuring from top to bottom in other words, the side. If a mould board of 12 feet will make a slope of the ditch 5 feet, an extension or diminution will change the power of the machine accordingly. If this ditches is wanted for casting the dirt from the water course on the sides of a turn pike into the centre of the road, the mould board must be extended; consequently, the land side, which should always be a little the longest, is run to brace the mould board; otherwise, the pressure of dirt against the end of the board would have a tendency to throw out the point in front. It will be recollected that a common plough precedes the ditcher, andloosens the dirt, the whole of which is cast up. The operation needs no demonstration, since the land side runs in the furrow, which confines it and the dirt, then taken by the ditcher in front, will be shoved up on to the embankment, in all cases where the angle is not so out use as to push the dirt directly ahead, which, in such a case, makes an entire failure. There are several advantages in this mode of ditching. It is very cheap. Two teams will do the work of 50 men. If the ditch is only 18 inches deep, and the dirt taken out and laid upon the side, it will make, with the embankment, 3 feet; this, with 3 or 4 rails, is a good protection against cattle. For a fence, the saving is very great, as must be obvious. Your panels of Virginia fence, of 8 rails, when stakes and riders are used, will equal 10 rails to the panel; and 4 panels of this kind of fence are equal in distance to 3 panels of posts and rails such is the sinuosity of the former. The rails for the posts need not be more than half the thickThepostandrail fence will require for Panel S (4 rails to a panel) 12 rails, the Virginia fence 40; but since the rails for posts are thinner by one half, although a little wider, it might be estimated that 9 rails are, with the in 457 [a[ 75 proved ditcher, equal to 40 as commonly laid in a Virginia fence. This is certainly a great saving where timber is scarce or cart age expensive. There is another advantage in the embankment it saves digging post holes. If a plough is run on the line of fence in the beginning of the work, to make an excavation of 8 inches, the posts can be put into this, and, by placing a little dirt around it, it will remain firm.  The dirt is then cast against it on both sides, (see fig. 2;) and when the embankment is completed, the post is imbedded in the earth 2 feet 2 inches. When posts are apt to rise by fresh its, a transverse anchor may be driven through the post, which, being also imbedded, will retain the post more firmly indeed, hold it fast, unless the bank gives way. Fig. 4 shows how the posts are bored with an anger. This can be done by hand or by horse power. If the anger is 21 inches, two holes will give a mort is e of 5 by 2 inches' Two men with an anger moved by horse power will bore enough in two days for one mile of fence, which requires 150 posts. The rails can also be sharpened with a circular saw, with great rapidity, at any angle required. The ditch will drain wet land, or serve as a conductor for water to be confined in an artificial pond, when springs or brooks are not convenient. One other recommendation is given, viz : to plant trees on the embankment near each post, to serve as shade, but more especially living posts, by the time the first posts decay. This is easily accomplished, by cutting limbs of cotton wood or sca more (sometimes called button wood) into pieces about 2 feet long. These forced into the ground (a hole being first made by an iron, when necessary) 14 inches, will sprout up at once, and grow surprisingly. The wood of the past years growth is preferable and as cattle do not brows e on sca more wood, that is first recommended. By these means, what is now called prairie is soon surrounded by a most beautiful border, alike ornamental and useful. While speaking on this subject, it may not be amiss to mention a preservation of timber inserted in the ground. The correspondence sub joined is respectfully commended to the perusal of those who feel interested in making enclosures against stock. The Makers have practised halting their posts for many years. The experiment costs but little, and is confidently recommended. Offi Of Of The Syracuse And Uti Of R. R. Cosyracuse, January 2, 1845. Mr. Rogers, the postmaster here, handed me your letter of the 17th ulm, inquiring as to the use of salt in preserving timber from decay. I enclose you a copy of an article from the Cultivator, and also a copy of the writers answer to my letter. I am fully convinced that salt may be put into green timber, and so plugged up as to exclude moisture, and that it will preserve it for a long time. I think the length of time depends very much upon the care with which it is done. The small posts or stakes driven under the salt vats a reconsidered as practically indestructible. Those that have been driven twenty years are s ou nd. The whole business proceeds upon the assfimptioa[ 75 ]a] 458 that they will not decay. For aught we can see, they will endure for fifty years, or as long as they are thus used. Hours, very respectfully, John Of Lki Nson. On. H. L. Ellsworth, Commissioner of Patents. To preserve fence posts. Poland, Herki Mer County, N. January 10, 1838. Dear Of    R: If you think the following is worth a notice in your valuable paper, you will be at liberty to publish it. The subscribe r believes it may be useful to many of your readers. In the spring of 1822, I set some s awed hem lock fence postsonehalfof them I salted, bowing a hole with an anger, commencing a little above the surface of the ground, boring downward, and nearly through the post then nearly filled the hole with salt, and plugged the whole to exclude the air and water. In the spring of 1830 the posts not salted were all rotted off; on removing them, there was not found a particle of sound wood below the surface of the ground. The salted posts are all now standing; and, to appearance, may stand years longer. Abel Sti Llman. Mr. 'J. Buel. Poland, June 30, 1843. Dear Of    R: Those salted fence posts you inquire about have delayed, arid are removed. The first one replaced was in 1841, and the last in 1843. It might be proper to say that those posts were not more than four inches square. The salting was after they were set in the ground, and with only a single application of dry salt and that, too, near the surface. It is, best to apply the salt with water, whilst the posts are in a horizontal position; and keep them supplied some time before setting, as it is more convenient, and the salt penetrates the wood both ways the better. Since the publication of my article in the Cultivator, I have heard of many instances where salt has been successfully used in preserving timber. Your obedient servant, Abel Sti Llman. Mr. J. I. Lki Nsonwe sub join here, also, some remarks on the canal pa tree, which we take from an agricultural journalTHE Catalpa- Of Mber For Posts. I never see a cat a pa tree, that it does not immediately recall to my min ca fact stated by the late Men. W. H. Harrison, in an address before the Am 459[ 7 hilton County Agricultural Society of Ohio, in 1831 that the canal pa is more lasting than either the locus t or mulberry for fence and gate posts. Any portions of our country, new as it is, owing to the heedless waste and profligate use of every kind of timber, together with the utter neglect everywhere of any measures for reproduction, are already nearly without the necessary supply for common fencing. I need, there are some places where fence timber cannot be obtained, except by importation from distant places. As long ago as in 1820, the writer of this travelled through, several counties in the Middle States, where nothing but boundary fences were thought of, and the public roads were crossed on the line between every two farms, by gates, which the traveller was obliged to open and close in passing. These gates were permitted by law, owing to the deficiency of timber for fencing the fields bordering on the roads. It is believed the same state of things still exists in that part of the country. Now, in a country like this, such a want of timber ought not to exist. Very owner of land on which there is a scarcity of timber should plant the several kinds of <a name="seeds165"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and take care of the young plants till they can take care of themselves, or permit spontaneous growths to grow, and thus secure the necessary supply of timber. But to the canal pa. In the address above mentioned, Generalharrison said: " The wood of the canal pa affords, perhaps, a more lasting, material than either that of the locus t or mulberry; is of a very quick growth, and easily cultivated. I to ability to resist decay has been sufficiently tested in the neighborhood of Vincennes, both under ground and in contact with it. Over the little stream of the Mesh a, five miles from Vincennes, one of these trees had fallen before any emigration had taken place from any of the States to that place. It was certainly lying there in the year 1785, when a colony of Virginians from the south branch of the Potomac emigrated to that place, and for many years served as a foot bridge over the stream. I was informed by a gentleman of undoubted vera city that it v was only partially delayed a few weeks since, (that is, in the spring of 1831.) The same gentleman (or. Hiram Dickson) informed me that a bar post which was made by his father, and put in the ground at a littlestockade work, which was erected in the year 1770, and which has been taken up and removed to his own farm, by his brother in law, Major Andrew Lowell, is still sound, and answers the purposes for which it was originally intended." The late Colonel Philip Cab b, of Gloucester county, Virginia, one of the best farmers in that State, also long used the catalpafor gate posts, and considered them certainly as lasting for that purpose as any timber he had ever tried. Now, the canal pa can be grown from seed as easily as I indian corn; the seed can be obtained in great abundance, and   know of no tree that grows so rapidly; I have frequently seen plants come up from the seed in the spring, and attain a height of four or five feet the same season, and in three seasons they often grow twelve to fifteen feet in height. In good rich ground, I have no doubt they would grow six feet each season. If planted three or four feet apart for the first three years, they will grow' as straight as reed poles. The fourth season they may be set out at proper distances for the formation of timber. Throughout the Middle, Western, and Southern States, the canal pa is perfectly hardy; I presume it is not so in the Northern and Eastern States. But there is a sufficient inducement in the former for the cultivation of it. In the prairies of the West it would be an invaluable acquisition, the soil and climate being well adapted to its rapid growth; and I am sure there are[ 75 160 few subjects to which the attention of oar Western friends can r be called, "of more importance than this, It is well known that the destructive bore his rapidly destroying all the locus t timber of our country, and a timely and equally valuable substitute may be found in the canal pa, in the extensive region indicated. To far as my observation extends, no insect whatever attacks it, either in the wood or the leaf. It is also pretty well known that chestnut requires a peculiar soil, and does not generally thrive well except on "chestnut ridges." It cannot be expected that the growth of this tree will be much extended. The white and red mulberry, it is true, thrive well every where; but they are nothing like the canal pa for facility and rapidity of growth; nor are they as lasting, if the opinion of Generalharrison be correct. The writer of this is acquainted with one fact in is elation to the white mulberry, that shows its qualities as ship timber. The frame timbers of the oldest steamboat now in the Chesapeake bay (the Maryland) are of white mulberry. There was a large plantation of whitemulberry trees near Annapolis, planted, it is said, by the French refugees. The owner of the plantation, many years ago, cut down most of the trees, and they were used in building the steamboat Maryland. This boat, I should suppose, is twenty-five years old, and I understand her timbers are still sound. G. B. Smi  Th461m. Letter of I. W. P. Lewis, Esq, civil engineer, upon i wooden railroads. Boston, December 29, 1844. Dear Of    R: I have received your communication of the 17th instant, and with' great pleasure reply to your request for information on the subject of wooden railroads. Very one, at the present day, can see for himself the great advantage this country has derived from its system of railroads; and   can conceive that such structures as you propose, even though built in the rough est manner, would prove highly useful in many localities of the South and West, where the construction of roads of iron must long be deferred, for want of the necessary funds to carry out such undertakings. The wooden railroads used in England are, so far as I know, of very limited extent, and only applied as expedients, to save labor in the construction of large masses of buildings, in timber and dock yards, and other places where material of bulk and weight is to be moved over limited distances. These roads are commonly laid down with longitudinal sills of three inch plank, kept parallel to each other by tie rods of light round iron passing through the substance of the plank. In the sills are bolted rib and rails of hard oak, three inches square; and, as there is no fastening between each pair of sills, the sections of road thus formed can be taken up and shifted from one part of the premises to another. The carriages used upon these wooden rails have wheels with wooden tires, and running upon the end of the grain instead of the surface thereof, as do common cart wheels with iron tires. I have sketched what appears to me the most simple form in which a wooden track could be laid down, and append the same here to, with a modification of the wheel I saw in England. In the prairies, no practical objections to the construction of these temporary railroads would seem to exist, where timber is abundant, and the surface of the country nearly level; but, on very uneven ground, cut up by water courses and ravines, abrupt elevations, &c, no form of railroad but the best can be used with either economy or advantage, even by a wealthy community. For the kind of road you desire, I should recommend the following : To lay down sleepers of 12 inches, round and rough timber, 7 feet long notched 6 inches deep to receive the rails, and laid parallel, 5 feet apart from centres. Nails may be made of the best oak trees, whose trunks are as nearly straight as may be, and having slabs taken off, leaving two plane surfaces at right angles; and being notched and halted on to the sleepers, and then tree failed to the same, 5 feet apart. The tree rails could be splicedtogether with a joint, similar to the one shown in the annexed sketch. The road way, or horse path, could be filled in with soil to a level with the tops of the sleepers such would be the rough super structure. Yourgrading would be a matter to judge on the spot; but the level of the rails, with regard to each other, should be as perfect as possible; and the angles of the tree rails should be rounded off, to save wear of the wheels. Pulleys and ravines would be easier crossed by rough trestle bridges than by any attempt at filling up with either timber or soil 5^ ]a] 462 Fig. !eating. 2. Fig. 1. Edge view of a pair of wheels. Fig. 2. Side elevation of rail. Fig. 3. Outside elevation of a wheel. Fig. 4. Section of a wheel, showing arrangement of spokes and tire pieces. The wheels shown in the sketch are entirely of wood, excepting the iron bolts which retain the several parts in their places. The inner surface and f large is formed of 2 inch plank the outer surface of the same. The tire or fellows are of 4 inch oak, seasoned; wedge shape, with their outer ends forming the periphery of the wheel. A screw bolt of half inch iron must pass through each of these pieces, and the outer and inner faces also. When all the parts are arranged, (the spokes and hut being the same as those of a common cart wheel) the screw bolts are firmly set, and the wheel is finished. I think, if the bearing surface of the tree rail were slightly leveled inwards, and the periphery of the wheels made to correspond, the carriage would more readily keep in the direct line of the, road. I fear the few hasty remarks here thrown together, in answer to your inquiries, will prove of but little value; but they may possibly afford a hint to those better able to discuss the subject. I remain, dear sir, with great consideration and respect, your obedient servant, I. W. P. Lewi S. On. H. L. Ellsworth, Sc6mmissioner of Patents. Sgci463 [a[ 5 The following account of the conversion of wood into iron is interesting in connexion with this subject of railroads. We take it from the Newyork Farmer and Mechanicconversion of wood into iron The conversion of wood into iron and stone, for railroad purposes, is exciting much interest in England. If the experiment bears the test of thorough trial, it will add immensely to the facility of constructing railroads. We hope the engineers, and those concerned in the building of railroads, will not delay in testing the value of this new discovery. The following extract of a letter of Professor Right, dated London, June 18, 1844, and published in the Boston Chronicle of July 10, will show how the matter is regarded by intelligent men in England : " A good deal is said, lately, about wood; and a patent has been taken out for converting it into iron should rather say into stone, by means of iron. This realized (or rather fossil sized) wood has been used in constructing the terminus of the Over railway, and it really seems to have both the properties of stone and iron. Nails of it laid down at Aux hall, for experiment, endured a travel equal to that of a year on the most thronged railway, without any perceptible wear; not even the saw marks of the timber being removed. It is supposed that timber thus prepared will not be subject to rot or decay of any kind' This, time will test. If this proves true, the invention will be of immense importance to the United States, where timber is yet plan tier, and iron scarce r, than here. The process of preparing timber is simply this The pieces, after having been fitted by the carpenter or joined for their places, are introduced into an immense iron cylinder, which is then exhausted by an air pump. A solution of the sulphate of iron is then injected, which immediately enters into the exhausted pores of the wood. The wood is then withdrawn, and again placed in a similar vacuum, in a solution of m urate of lime, which, coming into contact with the sulphate of iron within the wood, decomposes it, and forms an insoluble sulphate of lime, or gypsy m, within the wood; and the m urate of iron, the other new compound, goes about its business. To the wood becomes thoroughly impregnated with stone as hard as a rock, and is yet as tough as it was before. The expense of preparing 2,000 sleepers, enough for a mile of railway, is said not to exceed     $400. Some of the greatest engineers have expressed their confidence in the invention, and the processs employed on many of the Government works. What an invention for our Mississippi valley Railways built of light porous wood the more porous the better, probably may, for less than a thousand dollars per mile, be converted into roads nearly, if not quite, as dura be as iron p[ 75] 464. Report of C. M. Seller, Examiner, 1 c. ,PATENT Offi Of, January 25, 1845. Of     : In conformity with your wishes, I have the honor to submit the following report on the progress of inventions during the past year. The classes of inventions intrusted to my charge, as examiner, are 1st. Metallurgy, and manufacture of metals 2d. Manufacture of fibrous and textile substances 3d. Steam and gas engines 4th. Navigation and marine implements 5th, Civil engineering and architecture 6th. And conveyance 7th. All kinds of mills for grinding grain, &c 8th. Machinery for working lumber 9th. Fire arms and implements of war 10th. Miscellaneous. In the report which I had the honor of submitting to your consideration last year, I gave a hasty sketch of the progress of inventions in the above classes up to that time, commencing with the infancy of the mechanics arts in the United States; and, although very hasty, it was sufficient to show the rapid strides with which we have reached an early and distinguished maturity. In this report, as in the preceding, I shall not strictly confine myself to the inventions of the United States, but introduce such of the inventions of Europe, which have come to my notice, as I may deem worthy of public attention, either in their immediate applicability to our industry, or as containing the germs of future usefulness; for it often occurs that ideas which, in themselves, possess no practical usefulness, suggest and lead to the most important and useful inventions1METALLURGY, And Manufacture Of Metals. At the time the gold mines of the South were first worked, ingenuity was stimulated to improve the processes and apparatus employed in the separation of the metal from the accompanying impure ties, and many patents were obtained about that period. But the want of success in the working of many of these mines checked this stimulus; and within the past year not one invention made in this country, and but one introduced from abroad, has been patented; and as this appears to be important, I deem it advisable to point out its main features. Heretofore, in separating gold from the impure ties, by the process of washing, it has been subjected to only one current of water, either vertical or horizontal the object being to carry away the impure ties that are of less specific gravity than the metal, and leave it behind; but the process in question subjects it to the combined action of two currents of water-one vertical, and the other horizontal; the former carrying the impuritiesabove the level of the metallic particles, and the latter washing them away, by which the process is greatly expedited. The apparatus for applying this process consists of a series of sieges separated by partitions, and surrounded by a causing with a valve opening upwards, and placed atone end of the series. The materials to be washed and separated are dropped into the first si eve of the series from the hop per above, adapted to46f5S75 i the delivery in given quantities, and the sieges then receivecid127) a vertical reciprocaling movement in a water tank. In. the descent of the sieges, the water pass is through the meshes of the sieges and the valve ; the former producing the vertical crtreint, loosening the lighter and impure particles, and carrying them above the partitions; and the later, by its volume, the horizontal -current, washing all that has been carried above the partitions to the next si eve, and so on to the end of the series, to catch the particles of gold that may have been carried up with the impure ties. Nothing of importance has passed under my notice during the past year, originating either in Europe or in this country, connected with that branch of metallurgy devoted to the obtaining of metals, except i iron; the working of which becomes of more importance every day, from the great wants of society, and the rival ship of capital, industry, and ingenuity, invested and devoted to this highly important branch of the arts. In my last report I alluded to the important results brought about by the use of the gases escaping from smelting and other furnaces, as a fuel, by the admixture of these with atmospheric air. A modification of this important invention was patented in he. latter part of the year 1842; and as it has since been t reduced to successful practice, I deem it important to the iron interests to all public attention to it. The improvement is applicable to all Eeverberaory furnaces, and is intended to remove defects which have been known to exist ever since te rational e of the process was understood. When a fresh charge of coal. is put on the grate, a large portion of the heat becomes latent, in gase lying the coal, preparatory to itsignition; which gases, thus evolved, are mostly combustible, and, not being supplied t with oxygen, escape from the chimney in ,an unconsumedstatethuis wasting &re at quantities of fuel; and when the gases have been distilled, and the coal is in an in can descent state on the bars, the blast supplies too much oxygen, which, coming in contact with the iron, oxidizes and wastes it. To remove these difficulties, the fire chamber of reVerberatory fit races is made of such depth as to have a very thick stratum of coal upon the grate, which fuel is converted into combustible gases by a blast, or current of air, forced into a closed ash pit under the grate; and, in combining with this gas gene rating chamber and furnace and arrange intent of blow pipes, or other convenient apparatus, through which heatedatilospheric air is to be forced, by means of any ordinary blowing machine, into the said gases, for the purpose of effecting 'their combustion in passing to the chamber of the furnace containing the iron a where the heat is to be applied. In this. way, all the gases, instead of escaping as heretofore re e consumed in the immediate neighborhood of the iron where the heat is required, and the oxygen of the atmospheric air is not permitted to act injuriously upon the iron whilst heating it. The following extract from the Transautious of the Society. of Arts maybe worthy of the attention of our iron masters: "I prove men I s in the manufacture of iron -talented by Thomas. Hooker, Esq, of' Delhi Grflt, ne a. Cardiffthe method usually, now and heretofore, adopted in the manufacture of bar iron, (where the dangerous, and, as the author thinks, repreheeiiiblepractice of pudding the crude or raw pig iron, without the intervention of the refixing g process, is not adopted) is as follows: The pig iron i 180[ 75 ]a] 466 thrown upon what is called the filling finer y, or run into the finer y in a fluid state from the smelting or blast furnace; and, after undergoing the process of refilling, it is run out into cakes or moulds, and suffered to get cold; it is then broken up into lumps of a convenient size, and thrown into the pudding reverberatory furnace, which is usually constructed with one door, and at which only one man can work at a time. The authors improved method is detailed in his specification, plan, and model, and the effect is this : a saving of fifty per cent. in fuel, and nearly 50 per cent. in metal, an immense saving of labor, and a greatly increased product of work in the pudding furnace: the usual product of a pudding furnace being from fourteen to eighteen tons in a week, while the authors will as easily produce from forty to fifty tons in a week. The author thus combines the process of refining with pudding; and, to show the importance of preserving, and the hazard of dispersing with the refining process, he sub joins the results of an analysis by M. Berthier, of three samples of cinder or scotia, in one of which the remarkable fact of the presence of phosphoricScid shows how important this operation is to the purification of the iron. Iliac.

The object of Mr. Cookers invention is to simplify and accelerate the conversion of cast iron from its crude state into mall table or wrought iron for which purpose, the refine by furnace is adapted to the various qualities or descriptions of cast or pig iron which it may be necessary to use, by surrounding or enclosing the earth with blocks of cast iron, into and through which water is allowed to flow out, or not, as may be expedient and, as is well understood in making refine by furnaces, the blast of air being introduced through one, two, or more apertures or tu teres, as usual The refining is connected with the reverberatory or pudding furnace, which is constructed of the requisite form and dimensions. The bottom of the body of the furnace, and the grate bars, and binding plates and bars, are formed of iron; the other parts of the furnace are constructed with fire bricks, sandstone, or fire clay, as is well understood. In the neck, or near the f lie of: the reverberatory furnace, is an aperture through which the iron, when it has become decarburetted or refined in .the refine by, is introduced, or run in a fluid state, direct from the refining hearth into the pudding or reverberatory furnace. In each side of which reverberatoryfurnace a door is constructed: the door in the one side being immediately opposite to the door in the other; through which two doors the workmen perform the process of pudding, in the ordinary way in which pudding is done when working only with one door, which is the general practice." as respects the refining Having thrown up the fuel, and having, by the application of fire and blast, produced the necessary heat, a charge of 9 cut v, r whereabouts, of pig or cast iron, of the description generally used for forge purposes, is t down on and melted down, and decarburettedor refined in the ordinary way; and when the refixing process iscompititd, t lie :whole charge of metalcid127) in run off in a fluid' state: did e into the idle t l ra or y in muddling fiuutt pe. preioisypirepared: to receive. it, by[ 'a: .i: " : tt ' (did 127) ; : , .t !a! 2: .did 127) .did 127) ,a. . ,a: .z (did 127) " " (did 127) ' .467 [a[ 75 having been already heated to a proper degree of temperature, and by the bottom, sides bridge, and i opening to the blue, being protected in the ordinary way, by the workmen having previously thrown in a sufficient quantity of limestone and iron cinder. The metal having been introduced into the reverberatory, or pudding furnace in a fluid state, the workmen raise, apply, and regulate, and vary the, heat in the ordinary way, by feeding aid moving the fire in the grate, and raising or lowering the damper on the top of the s tack or blue, as circumstances require, and as is well understood; they at the same time stir and agitated the iron with bars and puddles, while the escape of the oxide of carbon, in a gaseous shape, takes place, and until the whole mass of iron agglutinates. The workmen then divide it into lumps or balls of a convenient size, and draw the charge from the furnace, passing the lumps to the squeeze r, ha miner, or rolling cylinders, or such other contrivance or machinery as is used for forging or compressing the iron During the process of refining the iron, by the application of heat and blast, in the open refining hearth, a considerable quantity of scotia or cinder is produced, which is tapped and run off as heretofore, as circumstances require. But it is to be observed that, during the process which the iron undergoes in the reverberatory or pudding furnace, the author does not find that any cinder need be generated or produced; and cinder sand limestones are thrown in, as already described for the protection of the various parts of the furnace exposed to the action or agitation of the fluid metal, but no cinder need be tapped or drawn off. M" Mr. likes opitionThe principal novelty in Mr. Cookers invention consists in placing the refine by and pudding furnace so near each other, l hat the refined iron: m be run in a liquid state into the pudding furnace, instead of allowing it was is usual) to cool and become solid when let out of the refine by, previous to its being transferred to the pudding furnace. The heat lost by the iron is thus saved, as well as the time required to bring the solid refined iron to a state of fusion. Both the refining and pudding are to be performed, according to Mr. hooker, in the usual way; it was therefore incumbent on him to show how it happens that, while the. common process of pudding produces flag, his does not or. Cookers statement, that by his process a saving of full 50 per cent in fuel, and nearly 50 per cent, in metal, is effected, appears to be an enormous exaggeration; the saving in the former being only (as far as appears) the fuel required to melt the refined iron. In making iron of the best quality, 31.74 cut. of pig iron give 26.45 refined, which is reduced to 23 in the pudding process; 8.74, therefore, is the loss which 3 174 pig suffers in becoming huddled iron . Half this loss (namely, 4.37)will represent 50 per cent. of saving; and this, added to 23, makes 27.37,which is 0.92 more than the entire quantity of refined iron." Berthiers analysis of two samples of s co rim from South Tales, and one from Staffordshire, showing the presence of phosphorus acid in the former and none in the latter, has no bearing on Mr. Cookers statement that, in the process of refixing, the phosphorus acid is separated from t lie iron f the quality of the iron produced by Or Pokers process is not worse than that of iron refined and huddled in the usual method, Mr. Is process deserves the approbation of the society. But I would recommend that Air J. Guest, or son me other practical iron master, should be consulted 75 ]a] 468' In answer to a communication from the secretary, :or. Hooker writes, I account for the production of flag in the common pudding furnace, and its non production in mine, as follows: The common n p muddling furnace is so constructed, that the iron: operated upon in it is exposed to a very rapid draught or .current, of air, which rushes in at the grate atlthback of the furnace, and- passes off through the body, and into the blue and s tack at: the head thereof. This draught is so great as tooxidize the iron, .and transform a great portion of it into flag or scotia, during the process of pudding; which process, moreover, is effected so slowly, that the charge of iron, consisting of from 3 cent. to 44 cut. is exposed to the heat and draughts in the pudding furnace during the space of full an hour and a half. M' By. pudding furnace is so constructed, that the draught or current of air admitted at the grate is broken, and its oxidising effects upon the surface of the iron while fluid, and upon the fibrous particles as ;they co here, after the oxide of carbon has been expelled, are entirely neutralised. That portion, therefore, of the charge which, in the common pudding furncid127ace, is converted into flag or hinder, in mine is not wasted or oxidized, but remain is and is converted into pure mall table iron. The saving of fuel. is thus accounted for: In the common, pudding furnace, not more than 44 cut. is admitted at one time, and this in a solid cold state. In mine, double the quantity, is admitted, and that in melted and fluid state. It is obvious that the time, fuel, and labor necessary for melting the iron are saved, and that double the quantity of iron is converted from a cast into a mall table .state within half the space of time' 'a- r ' ah manufacture of mall table iron direct. from the ore continues, and will continue, to attract the attention of the irontcid127aster, until 'al the difficulties to its economical application shall have been .surmounted, andSseience a art shall be able to claim this. as another triumph. Within th' past year, a patent was granted having this important object in view .and t. to satisfy the iron interests, I here insert the description of :the process given by the patentee, without meaning to be understood as approving or disapproving the suggestions of the inventor' which, as I have not hard of the practical test, night prejudice the inventor or the public. The patentee proposes to carry on his process in pudding furnaces so modified in for nm, by elevating the roof towards the chimney, as to avoid the reverberatory character, and thus prevent the flame, from limping il, on the ore, which (says the patentee) converts the larger- part of, j into flag, instead of reducing it into mall table iron. The ores, instead of being mixed with fltLxes, in the usual l manner, which: has a ways been considered indispensable, are to be employed alone, by -mixing together, in due proportion, such ores as by their chemical composition .arecaleilated to react upon each other when duly heated, and to bring the metal contained in each- of -them into the mall table state such as oxide said car bursts of iron ; he oxygen of the former uniting with the carbon of the latter, will, in the judgment of the patentee, liberate the particles of iron, which, when brought to the proper degree of heat, are to be called in he a usual md after of pudding . Ssiue are the views of the inventor, as given in his specification; and, i- introducing them, I do not wish to be understood as appoint g or disapproving them 469 [a[ 75 3. :a. Another patent was granted ,to :the 'same person, for an improvement inreverberatory furnaces, to be used in the process above stated, or for pudding ; which consists in placing ;the fire grate below- the furnace hearth or floor, that the heat may be applied below and above. I have made strict inquiries, and have not been able to ascertain whether it has been put to the test of practical experiment, and shall therefore make no comments. . 'of modification of the s tack of smelting furnaces has been suggested andpaentted, which consists in dividing the s tack into two, three, or more compartments, by means of partitions extending from the top to a point a little above the entrance of the blast.  I n to one of these divisions the coal only is put, and the usual charge of ore, coal, &c, in the others; and that part of the. hearth which is below the coal division is elevated a above the other portion, that the coal may be kept up to the blast, and permit the melted metal to. descend below it. The patentee sums up the operations and the advantages in the following words, viz: " The greatest part of the charge being put in the compartment next to the head stone, the metal will i rest on the ho shes, and will not come down faster than it is melted by the blast, the principal part of which comes in through the body of coal in the chamber, from the blow pipe; the combustion being thereby rendered perfect before the blast reaches the metal, a great saving of fuel is effected, and a. better quality of iron is produced. The damper over the coil chamber is kept down during the operation, and the gases are allowed to escape through the chambers on the opposite side of the partition. The fuel in the chamber rests on the hearth, and cannot fall much below the blast. Small blast can also be thrown in on the opposite side of the furnace to the main blast, which is regulated at pleasure variety of simple and compound substances have heretofore been mixed with iron in the melted state, with the view of more effectually separating the impure ties, and producing a more. highly refined metal i As a modification of these processes, a patent has lately been granted for mixing with the melted iron, in ;the process of pudding, a compound of sulphur and a nitrate with for ax, soda i or potash and alum, broken r in small lumps, and introduced: below the surface of the melted iron ; the proportions to be varied, if the iron is intended for the manufacture of steel. We have, within a few years past, been astounded at the development of science, and the new phases put upon many branches of the arts by the development of electrical science, and the application of this mysterious andpoivwerfiul agent; and such have been the developments, that, when he result of some. new application of it are made known, belief is staggered for while, until- evidence comes so quick and strong, that incredulity no longer finds a resting place, and wonder follows close upon its steps. Such are the thoughts suggested by the examination of a patent granted for the application of currents of electricity to iron and. other metals when soliditying in the mould and .t when smelting in the cupola. As this invent i on has excited much inquiry, and its usefulness is so easily tested i His ve deemed it itpportat to insert the description of the process in the language of the patentee, which is as follows, viz: " The nature of my invention consists in the use and agency of electricity in the manufacture of iron, steel, and copper, and other metals the object thereof being to facilitate the mall e ability and :purity of the[ 75 470 metals under the. process of manufacture, i as hereafter particularly described. And, in order to enable others' skilled in the manufacetureofthsaid: metals to: practise my invention, I -shall proceed to describe the process to .be pursued; and, first, with reference to the manufacture of' By: said invention consists in subjecting the iron whilst in a fluid state and also whilst in the act of concealing or soliditying, to a current of electricity, which I cause to traverse as completely as possible throughout the entire metallic mass. In casting a bar or similar mass, I cause the current to traverse from end to end by conductors, properly placed for the purpose, and -so arranged that, when. the metal runs into the mould, it may be made to complete the circuit of the electric current; or I previously make s than arrangement, by means of a wire or wires, of iron or other metal, stretched in, or passing from end to end of the mould, so that the electric current ma y be, in the first. instance, made to traverse :the wire .around or over which the fused iron is afterwards allowed to flow. There are ohermethrods of performing this operation, and of making such arrangements as, may admit of the melted iron, or the iron during its solidification, beingftraveised by or subjected to the influence of the electrical current. The following are instances of the mode in which Effect this in particacid127lr, cases. If the castings are horizontal, I place at each end of the bold which I suppose is to be t made of sand, clay, or some similar bad conductor or: non conductor of electricity) a piece of clear wrought iron, or other proper conducting metal, which is called the pole or conductor; and I :then t connect each of these poles or conductors, by means of a copper oriotherwire, with the extremities of a galvanic apparatus, or vol tail pile, or electro magnetic or other battery, of sufficient power for the purpose. I have found that eight pairs of plates, of about four by six inches, consisting of alter nations of platino m and zinc, arranged in separate, cells of nitric acid, j arid tilsit e sulphuric acid, so as to construct what is usually denominatedGroves vol tail battery or apparatus, to be convenient ,for my purpose, and sufficient for a ton of metal, though any of the other forms of the oltaicapparatus or battery, or any other source of an adequate electrical current particularly that commonly known as ' Mees' and 'consisting: of from 20 to 30 pairs of plates of the above size may be employed with advantage. Having it hen connected the extremities of the battery with the respective poles or conductors, in such a way that when the; melted iron is allowed to run into the mould, it may so complete the electrical circuit as to admit of the castings being traversed from end to end by the electrical current, I allow the cast metal to cool and set while in that condition. and, as soon a sit has entirely set or solidified throughout, the connexions with the battery :may be broken .through. I think it is advantageous, particularly in casting ordnance, to continue the electric current for some time after the ,metal has entirely solidified. When the castings are vertical, a similar arrangement is made for the passage of the electric current through the metal and this I effect by placing at the bottom, or sole of the mould, a plate or rod of iron, or other conducting substance, while a similar conductor is inserted into the. upper end of the mould, in such a way that the electric circuit may be e completed the moment that the mould is filled with the liquid metal- a. -"I n applying electricity to iron in a smelting furnace, or cupola, I insert 471 [a' 75 orel rod of wrought iron in or alongside of the top hole, until it comes into, contact with the smelting metal ; and another rod into the upper and posterior part of the hearth, or in at one of the tu were holes or apertures, until it comes into contact with the surface of the metal the outer ends of these two rods being placed, respectively, in connexion with the opposite poles, of the electric battery, so as to complete the circuit; care being taken not to continue it so long as entirely to decarburate the iron, and bring it into a mall table state. In applying electricity to the iron in the pudding or balling furnace, I insert one rod, similar to the above, into one part of the, fused metal; and I attach to one end of another iron rod an insulating handle of force lain pottery, or other substance not conduct i ve of electricity and then fix to the end of that iron rod, close to the handle, the conducting wire from one pole of the vol tail battery; and the other fixed iron rod being connected with the other pole of the battery, I seize the ilsulatiigrod by the handle, and make its extremity traverse in contact with various points of the iron in its melted state, or during its transition into the solid state; thus making the electrical current pass through the metal in 'every possible direction The part of my invention applicable to the manufacture of steel is as follows: The bars of wrought or other iron fit for the manufacture of steel are placed in the usual boxes and furnace; and, so far, I employ the sarimemeans and apparatus commonly called a converting furnace, and in common use. But, instead of embedding the bars of iron for conversion in common charcoal, or in the carbonaceous substances in common use, I employ a mixture of charcoal, with the carbonaceous and other matters used by the sugar refine is, and through which their sir ups have been filtered these residues consisting chiefly of animal charcoal, derived from the combustion of bone and other animal or organic substances, and containing phosphates of lime. And I further add to this mixture a certain quantity of resin, amounting to about one part of resin to ten of the mixture. And I further imbued their carbonaceous substances, mixed and prepared as I have described, with a saturated solution of white arsenic in water." Having thus prepared the carbonaceous bed in which the bars of iron intended for conversion into steel are laid and enclosed, as in the modes usually adopted, I next make arrangements for transmitting a current of electricity through the bars, after they have been duly converted into blisteredisteel, and whilst they are still red hot; my object being to transmit such electrical current through each of the bars, together or successively, whilst cooling down in the furnace. This I effect by attaching an iron, copper, or other proper wire, to the ends of the bars, and bringing its extremities out of the furnace, so that, at the proper time, a connexion maybe made between these wires and those forming the poles or conductors of a vol tail apparatus or pile; and in this way the electrical circuit is so completed, that the current of electricity may be made, as aforesaid, to traverse the bars for a longer or shorter time. I prefer commencing the transmit, si on of the electricity when the bars have become blistered steel, and are red hot in the furnace, and continuing the transmission till they have so far cooled down as to be capable of retaining magnet ism. Now, although I prefer, as a source of electricity, that form of galvanic or vol tail battery, or apparatus, known under the name of Proves battery, any other adequate, our ce of electricity may be resorted to And, although I have alluded to blistered steel only, and described[ 75 ]my process as applicable to it, I further claim its application to cast steeloAnd when r thus applied to cast steel, the details of ~the process I prefer are, similar to those which I have specified in l regard to the transmission of electricity' through cast iron ; my object being the same in regard to the cast steel as to the cast iron namely, to subject it t t the influence of an electric current whilst in fusion, and in the act of setting, and, to a greaterOrless extent, during the period of its cooling down to common or atmospheric temperatures regards the manufacture of copper and other metals, the electric current is to be applied under the process of manufacture in the manner hereinbefore particularly described with reference to the manufacture of iron n the manufacture of steel, which has thus far made very little progress or this side the Atlantic, but little has been done by our countrymen; and   fear that the prevalent idea, current in England a swell as this country that the best qualities of steel can only be made from Swedish iron tend sin a great measure to retard enterprise, and consequently improvements in this branch of metallurgy. It is difficult to comprehend iv lay a notion, un sustained by sound reason, should have attained so much prevalence as this. Science clearly indicates, that to obtain the best quality of steel requires iron in its purest state ; and to obtain this latter, requires skill and experience these being the only impediments to the manufacture of good steel; and possessed, as we are, of nearly every variety of iron, no good reason can be assigned why .we should not successfully overcome this prejudice. But one patent has been granted during the past year. connected with the manufacture of steel ;and I here insert the leading portion of the specification, that the views of the inventor may be combated, if founded in error, and lead to better suggestions; and, if good, that it may lead to a practical test of its merits n the ordinary mode of constructing the converting furnace, the bars of iron, after being piled in the c offer or oven, in combination with the carbonaceous matter, to the proper height, are covered with a stratum of fine clay and sand, or some analogous substance, which has to be removed every time the oven is charged. My improvement in the structure consists in the using of a permanent roof of fire stone or fire brick, in place of the temporary covering heretofore employed. I also use a sliding shutter, which is placed in front of the furnace, so that it may be brought down i as required fcid127r a purpose to be presently made known. By improvement in the manufacturing of the steel, after the process ofcementation has been completed, consists in the taking of the bars first from the upper part of the converrory whilst they are at the highest temperature to which they are to be brought, and subjecting them i immediately to the action of thing, or of rolling, without the necessity of re heating. To do this, a part of the upper layer of bricks which enclose the converting oven is first removed, so as to enable me to draw out the upper bars; and as the bars are successively operated upon, the bricks are further removed, until the whole contents of the convert or y have been tilted or rolled. As this process goes on, the sliding shutter is brought down, so as to enclose the part from which the bricks have bee i removed. By this procedure, several advantages are attained in the process of naanuficturing473[ 3 steel under that hitherto followed, the whole .charge has bee i allowed to cool down before removing the steel from the convert or y, and this necessarily resulted in great loss of tibiae; the bars, after being removed, had to be repeated, in, order to their being tilted or rolled. By this repeating time was consumed, and the steel actually injured ; it being a wvelestablislled fact, that every time steel is highly heated, it is deteriorated. The steel manufactured by my improved process has proved to be very superior to that made from the same iron in. the ordinary way; it has, in, this particular, uniformly exceeded the anticipated benefits the properties of mineral coals employed in the making of iron are known to exercise important, and often very injurious, effects on the products of the i france and forge, the report of Professor Alter R. Johnson of Philadelphia, of his experiments on the coals of the United Trees, made to the I Secretary of the Navy, and published by order of Congress at the last session, will be a valuable contribution to the iron master v who, being acquainted with the ingredients of the fuel employed, can, by proper attention to chemical science, avoid or prevent many injurious consequences, which otherwise le would not only be unable to guard against, but. be wholly at a loss to comprehend; for, in all operations in which, chemicalaffinities and actions take part, the results of scientific investigations can a lope be relied on. It is to be regretted that the same means have not been furnished by the Government for investigations in other branches equally important, and which require experiments and researches on a scale of magnitude wholly beyond the reach of individual enterprise; for, however important and beneficial the results of such inquiries may be to the whole country, there is no way in which the individual experimentercansecure to himself a sufficient portion of the results of his labors to obtain a reward for the time and expense; and therefore the Governmentalane can be looked to. Manufactures of metals, and machinery connected therewith n the working of blacksmiths' forges, the accumulation of cinder is a matter of much inconvenience, particularly where large masses of iron are worked, The accumulation of cinder has frequently to be removed, .which not onlyonsumes much time, but disturbs the fire. To avoid this inconvenience, an improvement has been patented, which consists simply in making the hearth of the forge to slide in and down in a sink or well, so that atetveryfresh charge of coal the hearth descends a short distance with the cinder on it; and when the hearth reaches the bottom of the sink or well, the whole of the cinder is removed through a hole in the bottom, and: the hearth is forced up to the top to recommence. The steam forge hammer, to which attention was called in my last report, as applicable to the forging of large masses of iron, particularly in .the conversion of cast into mall table iron, is said to be subject to an inconvenience in practice. The piston rod of the engine, to which the hammer is attached, and 1 by which it is operated, by the repeated blows is said to upset; that is, in less technical language, becomes shorter aid thicker an effect well known to all workers in iron and other metals. This difficulty has led to some suggestions with the view to remedy the evil; and a patent has just been granted for working the hammer by means of two rollers, that receive motion from a steam engine, or other motive force, one of which has its bearings in permanent, and the other in movable boxes connected with a togglejoint or other lever, so arranged as to force this roller( 75 ]a] 474 towards the other, and grip e a square rod i on the hammer to lift, and then separate the r ni to li be r ate it the to gale joint :lever being connected with the roller by n means of a powerful spring; and the mechanism that opertaStthe to gale so arranged as to enable the attendant to regulate the playofthehaimmerat his discretion, to strike a light or heavy blow, as the condition of the iron may require. The forging of blacksmiths' a nails is an operation attended, as may well be imagined, with some difficulty, not only from their size, but principally from the peculiarity of the form. Piti ha view to facilitate and cheap entire; operation, an arrangement of dies and s wages has be et patented, which is: ingenious, and appears to possess merit. Attempts have often been made to give the desired forms to a nails by s waging; but, in giving the form he when- the top and the stand, the face was always destroyed; and in restoring te ce; the reverse effect was produced. To avoid this difficulty, the die which receives the horn, and gives one of the cries, extends up to form a Rest, against which the face of the and il rests, and which preserves it w hen; the s wage is brought down to give the required form. There are other mirror improvements in" the arrangements of the parts of the machinery, t icilfitte the presentation of the and il to the various s wages andharhtmers employed in the series of operations For the riveting of boiler and other plates of iron which require hermeticjointsthe employment of a d machine operating in the manner of a punching i machine, with the dies adapted to beading has been resorted to in England extensively, and partially in this country, as I have taken occasion to state to you on a former occasion ; and I perceive that this has beentimtpr~ bid by' wo king the punch or swinging die by means of a togglejointleverthepiston rod of a stag m engine being jointed directly to h toe great the :point of junction of the two arms, instead of a tap pet wheel or a ms, as heretofore; by which the connecting parts are greatly simplifies, and much friction saved. The attendant can, as in the steam hammer, control the bone ratio: f: 'the machine at discretion, by means of a lever that operates the valves n the mtanufatiure of built hinges, of cast or wrought iron, some improvements have been patented within the put year, which are worthy ofni6ficecid127in view of the fact that this article. although apparently insignificant, is ivy extensively 4mattifac turned' in this country. The improvements in making cast iron 'butts relate. entirely to the arrangement of theridulds to 'facilitate the moulding, and insure: the accuracy of the workoAnd in the making of wiotigltiron butts, the improvements relate to that part of the machinery employed in preparing the plates of metal for the machine that bends -the 'l knuckles, arid 'for trimming the parts after being formed .iManufaclure of jinSThe machine for sticking pins in papers, o which your attention was called (cid127ast year, although an important improvement in i this branch of manufacturing industry, was very imperfect, from the circumstance that the operatives had to arrange the pins with the heads all in the same direction- the most troublesome part of the operation, from to :excessive tedioiusnI  ss. But this difficulty has since been removed ; and now, by a simple contrivance, he pins, from a mass put into the hop per, run down two inclined planed, placed at such a distance apart as to receive their thank, but not the head; and in this way, with the point do wntheyare delivered in the machine, which sticks them in the' papers for market 47 575 ]his is the only improvement, connected with: this brain ch of manufactures, which has co he to: my notice in a manner that can be made: public, although there are various improvements in progress. In the space of a few years, by the efforts of a few ingenious men, an article for which we were wholly dependent upon England is i now entirely, or nearly so, produced at home. Connected with the manufacture of wood screw so and nails, no improve, meets of a distinctive: character have been: pate end during the past year except one for i making wrought nails, the invention of and A tier i can citizen residing in England, and another i for feeding or presenting the rods to nailzcuttiringmachines; and :these have not, to my knowledge, been reduced to practice. The former changes entirely the mode of operation *which is pursued in machinery for this purpose, now, and 'for sormetyears pastcid127insuccessful practice. I instead of forming the nail from n a rod in the direetiorinof itsdlengtha, s now practised, a plate is introduced, from which, ateachroperation, a pieces is cut off, griped, and held against the face of the bed c utter, until a roller passes over it to give the required form to the nail which is afterwards pointed :and headed. The machine is more conqlexthain those in operation; but may possess superior advantages, which I have not, however, been able to appreciate.

And the improvement in patches has reference to the simplification of the moving parts, to render them cheaper and less liable to be deranged. Tools- Several patents have been granted for a ;variety of: instrutientsor machines generally known under the: appellation of .tool. Several of them are for boring and drilling iron, and for filing saws by the turn ing of a crank. A bench vice has been. made the subject of a patent, which presents air important and distinctive feature, and a pp ears worthytheattentifoiof artisans who ,use such tools or instruments. I t. consists in- connecting a th!e75 476.movable ja w with the permanent one, by means of a universal joint; so that the, movable jaw, instead of being always parallel with the permanent one, can take any angle, and thus adapt itself to the form of the article to be griped. Leadpipesdi n the q manufacture of lead pipes, it is alleged that, in b forming the pipe from lead in the fluid state, it will adhere to the core which forms the inner part of the pipe; and as the making of pipes from lead in the heated, but solid or set state, has been patented, various efforts have been made to dispense with this, and to improve it. A patent has been granted, lately for passing a current of steam, or other fluid, through the core, to keep its temperature below that of in melted lead, and his prevent it from adhering. This branch of manufactures is now extensively carried on, and will continue to increase, from the circumstance that lead pipes present so many facilities in manufacturing and' domestic economy; and, therefore, every improvement or suggestion connected with it must come and interest. The great variety of purposes to which iron is applied, and the advantages which its use presents, every day enlarge the demand for it, and not a day passes without its being applied to some new- purpose; but the greatgfliuity which it has for oxygen, and therefore its tendency to cor rode, retards very much its application to many important purposes, such as the construction of ships; and as the protection of it against the action of oxygen would remove this difficulty, science and ingenuity are making bold efforts to discover or devise means of coating the surface in 'such manner as to prevent galvanic action; and several patents have, within the past year, been granted, in this country and in Our pe, for processes for coating iron in such manner, and with such substances, as to' prevent corrosion2MANUFACTURE Of Of Brous And Texti Of Substances. Are para ti on of fbresCotton ;gin Patents have been granted for alleged improvements in cotton gins; one for a modification of the roller ,gin for long staple, which consists in so, arranging three rollers, (one large and smooth, and the others small and fluted) that the cotton passes in between the two small ones, and then between the upper small and the large one by which the inventor alleges that the fibres are more effectually separated from .the <a name="seeds166"><mark>seeds</mark></a> and foreign matters, and delivered in a more perfect manner than by the other modes. And the others are for arrangements of extraribsgon the saw gin, to retain the fibres more effectually whilst the brushes act upon them and straight ten them; and for new arrangements of brushes c, to insure a better action on the fibres, and a more perfect delivery of them. -I t is by a series of apparently unimportant improvements like these, that this beat ii full invention of Li Whitney has been rendered one of the most perfect pieces of me ch, an ism know t to the arts. Vol combing The machines for combing wool, admitted to be one of the most difficult operations connected with the preparation of fibres, continue to command the attention, of the ingenious minds of our mamtnfacturersv, who are ever on the alert to improve the processes and mechanics n connected with their pursuits, with the view of obtaining better or cheaper results. In one of the machines lately patented for this purpose 477 [a[ 75 ]combs are arranged on radial bars attached to tie face of a disk wheel i such mat iner as to be parallel with the face of the disk, and at right angles with the radial bars from which they project ; and these, in combing, act it cor junction will i teeth or combs, radiating from the rim of another wheel, and also carry the fibres around, to receive the action of rotating brushes. And in another machine, t teeth of the main or carrying wheel project from the rim of a wheel in lines parallel with the shaft. as in :machines previously known land used ; and the teeth of the combs that act in connexion with these are made coarse at one end, arid gradually finer towards the other, and the fine end is placed nearer to the carrying teeth on the wheel than the other; and the working combs have, in addition to (cid127their rotary, a mnoventent towards and from the carrying teeth ; and the wool is applied to the carrying teeth by means of feed rollers that las liar ,lay .it on have not been able to ascertain: whether these alleged improvements have been reduced to practice; the former is an American and the latter an English invention, patent end in this country of n addition r to these, a patent has 'been granted for an arrange me it of toothed cylinders, &c, for the purpose of subjecting the 'fibres of wool to the act ion of teeth, fo r let purpose of loosening the fibres, and removing m oats and burrs, and to currents of wind, for carrying off a il impure ties. S Hard tin .SuvCh was the itcid127pid progress made a few years since a in machinery for card iii cotton and wool, that we now see but few attempts at improvement. One patent h as, however been grant ted, for a mode of cleaning the cards, which consists of a roller covered with long wire teeth, and so located .as to 'act on the cards beyond the strip per, and which, entering between the teeth of the cards, cleanses out all that may remain between them. This cleaner is applicable to the strip per, as well as to the main card. Another improvement has been proposed, and patented in England, which. "consists in_ a- peculiar adaptation of endless bands of wire cards to a carding engine, by means of which equal quantities of fibrous materials are taken from the mr ain drums or cylinder of the carding engine, in a great number of distinct bands or strands of continuous clubbings borrowings. In effecting it his object. no material alterations are made in the construction of the carding engines from those usually employed for carding fibrous materials, but only so far as regards the p clear adaptation and arrangement of endless cord bands' For a full description and drawings, see London Journal of Arts and Sciences, volume 24, conjoined series, page 253. In the same journal, volume 25 of the same series, page- 124, will be found a description of a mode of making the backs of all kinds of cards, which, as a r matter of economy, is worthy the attention of manufacturers I t "consists in forming the back of wire cards of those' descriptions of leather called sheepskin, basil, and roan basil, cemented to woven l fabricsPreparm. the fibres of hemp The impulse which has :lately been given to t the city re of this plant in the Western portion i, of your country has led to manly attempts at imrprovii g- machinery for breaking the wood part, ad -separating the fibres therefrom; but, in fortunately, most: of those who have applied: their t minds to this: subject had not in i their possession the means of ascertaining what has been de ontihfis subject (cid1273before, both in Europe and this country ; and the consequences have been[ 75 J 478jlaor, lost and hopes blasted; for by far the greater part of the applications for patents have been :rejected for want of novelty, and those i that have been granted are limited to mere improvements of principles long known. In view of this great waste :of time, labor, and money, would it not be important to furnish that region of country with full information on this subject ?a? The Patent Office, where all this information centres, by the contributions of inventors, and the foreign journals devoted to inventions, it appears to me would be the best place from which such a work shoulder a name. Sincid127ingi n ,this branch of manufactures, but ;three patents have been granted during the past year-one of them for a modification of thewellklnown ring groove sinner, by which the, cost of construction isMnuch reduced, and the carrier or flying hook is removed from the ring with great facility. Another is for a modification of the mode of giving the necessary motion to the bob bin for winding on, by placing the bob bin which runs on a dead spindle on .a washer provided with arms .that extend to the wings of the flyer, by which it is carried around ; the friction between the washer and bob bin being sufficient to give to the bob bin the desired motion for winding. This improvement is considered by the patentee especially applicable to the making of moving, and all operations in the spinitiinig department admitting of but a gentle pull. And the last is for an improvement well worth the consideration of manufacturers. I t consists, in the words of the patentee, "in giving to the bob bind, f layers, and spindles, the required rotary and traversing :motion, by causing thebobbins -to rest on the peripheryes of wheels, arranged on a horizontal traversing shaft or shafts." Cry means of this arrangement, bands are entirely dispensed with. I: appears, from the foreign journals, that several patents have been granted in Europe for alleged improvements in the various kinds of machinery for acting on fibrous substances after these leave the carding engine. Most of them are limited to modifications of the spindle, and its immediate connexion with the bob bin, and do not present characteristics sat iifiently marked to require notice here. But one of the patents is for an apparatus placed over the mouth of the can, such as is used for the reception of shivers; which apparatus receives the s liver of cotton, or other fibrous materials, in the state it leaves the carding engine, a drawing frame. or a clubbing frame, and disposes it in a can, in coils; so that when such coiled s liver reaches from the bottom of the can to the apparatus, that part of the s liver which is subsequently passed out of the apparatus presses upon, and, by the aid of the apparatus, r condensed the other coiled part in the can. By this invention, a s liver of cotton or otherfibsronsmaterial may: be disposed of in a can, or other suitable recent able, in tis -o and condensed to any degree required, without ielongating, c limping, "or otherwise :damaging it. for the subsequent operations connected with o spinning.

It frequently happens, in reeling silk 479 [a[ 75 an pot her fine fibres, that: too much tension is, given ;a, and in removing the skein from the he l, the fibres a liable to break. To avoid these inconveniences, one arm of the re el is connected 'with the shaft by means of a spring slide, so as to yield under an undue tension of the fibres, and by means of which the arm can be forced in by the attendant, to. fee the skein preparatory to removing it. Leaving loomsThis complicated and beautiful branch of mechanics continues to receive contributions from the ingenious manufacturer here and abroad; and although the chronicler of the progress of inventions cannot, year after year, note down .striking improvements, such as were developed by the master minds of Jacquard and others, who gave to posterity the great and leading principles on which the art of weaving does still and most likely will continue to depend, yet this piece of: mechanism continues to be improved, simplifies, and adapted to, the weaving of fabrics by automatic machinery, which it was supposed a; few years since could only be effected by the delicate operations of the human hand. The patents which have been granted are for modifieatiorls ,of those parts of the machinery by which the yarn is given out, and the cloth wound up as fast as the weaving is effected, and by which these operations are adapted to the constantly varying thickness of the filling yarn, or. we ft, and for arresting the loom when the scuttle fails to carry the we ft through he -warp operations requiring a delicacy of mechanical sensibility (if I may be permitted to use the expression in reference to inert matter) which was but a few years back pronounced beyond the reach of possibility. Other improvements have also been patented for modes of shifting the scuttles in weaving fabrics, requiring changes of colors in the filling at given periods such as plaid cloths, which, having of i ate become very t fashionable, have stitimuated the inventor to exertions in. this line; for, after all, with inventors, as with other men, gain is the greatest of all incentives to action. The instruments employed in looms for keeping the cloths distended width wise, and called " temples' in technical language, have also received some contributions during the past year. Knitting or slockenell looms t is only within a fe. ,years that attempts to make knitting looms to operate by power have been successful and even at this tim, the question of success, as one of manufocturligeconomy, has not yet been settled; and notwithstanding so many failures, many minds are still laboring at the problem. Two patents have been granted for this purpose-one for a fn arrangement of the singers or looking jacks and needles, with the' view of bringing the operative parts employed, in the :formation of the loops rumor directly within the reach of the attendants eyes and hands, together iwthninor. arrangements of the other parts; and the other for an entirely newarragenient of the ,mechanism around -a central shaft, .so that the r machinery weaves :or knit san entire circle ,without -se am. The thread is carried; continuously arouaiipd. the stitches or :loops are formed oiaiferanother, in succession, around the entire circle.

Most of the articles formed by 75] 480 knitting require to be shaped by w ening and narrow in; as in knitting stockings by hand an operation now, performed by hand in t a ll i machines for this purpose; or, (a sit has bee at practised in t Europe) he fabric is woven in the piece, and then cut of the required form, and sewed together; but, when of fade in this way, the ~articles sell at a very lo. price in the markets, because of their inferiority to those shaped in the to om. If this operation of shaping- be, performed by the hand, there will necessarily be very little saving 'in working the machinery by power, for the attendant must be there to shape, the fabric :and, therefore, until this operation, which is by far *the most difficult, be performed by automatic hands, power machinery will have very little the' advantage of hand klittitngloomshe following is the description of: a process patented in England for rendering cotton fabrics repellent to water, &c, viz: " This invention is intended to be applied chiefly :to russian cloths, called ' beaver tens' although it is also applicable to other cotton fabrics. It consists in rendering the fabrics repellent to water and mildew, and preventing any i. unpleasant smell, by sleeping them in, or: passing them through, the solutions hereafter described." As the' general practice of doers is to mix their solutions with reference to the weight of the cloth or other material to' be immersed therein, and without regard to its length or width, the patentee describes his process upon this plan ; the quantities mentioned being calculated for fabric of .which a piece sixty yards long, and twenty-seven i niches wide, will weigh forty pountdsoTo prepare a solution in which the fabrics are to be immersed, the patentee proceeds in the following manner: Twenty pot ends of calcined irish gum are mixed with eight gallons of cold water, in' a suitable vessel or vat, until fine and pasty; then ten pounds of palm or white soap are dissolved in eight gallons of boiling water, in another vessel; and this solution is added to the former, together with one pint of log wood liquor, and the whole is boiled up together; three pounds of rock alum, dissolved in one gallon of water, are then added; and the mixture, after boiling for a few moments, is ready for use. The cloth or fabric (having been previously prepared and dyed in the ordinary way) is stepped in, or passed through, the above mixture or solution, in the usual manner of stiffen inland drying cotton fabric Sometimes the patentee uses two solutions in succession-one of which is formed by boiling six pounds of sulphate of zinc in nine gallons of water, and, when: cold, drawing off the clear solution; the other is, made by dissolving twenty pounds of calcined \british gum in eight g allons of cold water, and ten pounds of palm or white soap in eight gallons of boiling water; then mixing these two solutions, and, after adding a quarter of an ounce of pear lash, bringing n them up to a boiling .heat The cloth or fabric is first stepped in, or passed through, the zinc solution and is i immediately afterwards stepped in, or passed through, the other solution." .for the benefit of those who are engaged in making ornamental fabrics, I here insert the essential parts of the specification of a patent granted in gland for coating cloths, leather, and other fabrics, with a metal, by "electricity, viz: .a." The first part of this in ve nation consists in coaling with ;metal, by 481, [a[ 7 5 ]electricity, various felted and other fabrics, such as cloth, linen, leather, paper, glass, earthen ware, and similar non conducting substances, by bringing the fabrics into contact with conducting surfaces. The patentee illustrates his invention by describing the nrthodswhich he adopts for coating metals with copper, but any other metal maybe used. A plate of copper (which the patentee terms a die or matrix is coated on one side with varnish, or other suitable non conducting material, and the other side is rubbed over with plumb ago, to prevent the adhesion of the metallic deposit e. Upon that side of the plate which is covered over with plumb ago, the cloth to be coated with metal is placed, and secured by cementing or otherwise; and the matrix is then immersed in a solution of sulphate of copper, and connected with the zinc pole of a galvanic battery; another plate of copper being then immersed in the solution, and connected with the copper pole of the battery, the deposition of metal upon the matrix commences. When the surface of the matrix is covered with a thin film of copper, the depositing begins to penetrate the interstices of the cloth, and, if the operation is continued sufficiently long, will appear in small g lobules at the opposite side. As soon as the required thickness of metal has been deposited, the matrix is removed from the solution, and the cloth separated therefrom. The surface of metallic coating will be either plain or ornamented, according as the surface of the matrix is prepared, wh( the r plain, or ornamented with a' raised or sunk pattern; and the metallic deposit e may be afterwards gilt, placed, or otherwise improved in appearance instead of using the copper plate alone, as above mentioned, the patentee sometimes employs, as a matrix, a plate of copper together with a plate formed of an allow of. six parts lead to one of anti many; or, in lieu of this compound matrix, the copper plate may be used in connexion with gold, silver, or lead, in the state of foil Those who feel an interest in this process, and who may desire to make a test of it, will find a full description of the apparatus in the London Journal of Arts and Sciences for September, 1844, page 96. Hatsseveral patents have been granted during the year for macneryemployed in pressing hats and bonnets, and in forming leather hats. But as these are mere modifications of, or improvements on, methods known and in operation, and as .these could not be made clear to the reader without drawings, I am under the necessity of passing them over, with the bare mr ention of the objects. It is no doubt known to you that fur hats are generally made with common fur alone, or mixed with wool, for the body ; and after the body has been formed, the finer quality of fur is put on the outside, and felted or worked in. As a substitute for this, it has been suggested (and the process patented) to make two separate and distinct hats-one of common r fur or wool, or both mixed, to which the stiffening is applied; and the other very thin, and of fine fur, to be slipped on the other. I have seen a hat thus made, which had a very good appearance n closing this class, permit me to call your attention to a machine lately patented for making Us can br aid; which, for ingenuity and beauty of mechanical arraDgenient, is worthy of the highest commendation. I regret that, from the necessary complexity of the mechanical arrangements, ai description without drawings could not be made sufficiently clear.

Steam boilers, or genera torn and furnaces therefore he management of the furnace is a subject which has only been understood within a few years past; and, in fact, can scarcely be said to be fully understood evennOW, although science has shed much light upon it. True, much attention has been paid to this subject for a long time. Rules had been adopted for regulating the size of the fire, and grate furnaces, -and the apertures between the     e grate bars i with the view of obtaining the best results ; but, as the rational e of the process of combustion was not fully understood by those who formed and adopted those rules, it must be evident that many of them were founded in error, and therefore either good or bad, as chance might be pleased to order it. We may go back several years, and find suggestions on this subject, which indicate that correct views were entertained by some, who pointed out the proper remedies ; but, unfortunately, they were not possessed of that bold energy and enthusiasm, approximating to a monomaniac, which alone will carry the inventor through the labyrinth of difficulties that seem to be placed in his pathway, to test, as it were, th sincerity of his belief in the truth of his creation ; and hence these suggestions slumbered until practical men were led to a proper appreciation of the value and importance of science, and scientific men to look with more respect upon the real value of the experience of the practical man. His mutual recognition has led to the most important results in every branch of artistic industry, and in none with more success than the branch under consideration. Without a full and clear understanding of the constituents of the fuel to be used, and of atmospheric air, and the various conditions under which these bodies are de composed, and their constituent gases evolved and combined, to give out the greatest amount of heat, together with the circumstances under which they generate the greatest amount of steam, no essential progress can be made; but, with a clear understanding of these, the inventor and engineer can contrive the apparatus to meet the demands by a process of ind active reasoning, leading to accurate results; and he can pronounce upon the merits of the contrivance, without the necessity of a resort to lengthy and expensive experiments. The patents lately granted in this branch indicate the spread of science for we find that the contrivances are made with a view to meet the demands pointed out by philosophic investigations; they are for modes of regulating the admission of atmospheric air, to com mingle and combine with the gases evolved from the coals on the grate, and to evolve the greatest amount of calorie in such parts of the flies as will heat the largest surface; for regulating the admission of the air to the coals on the grate bars, and to regulate the quantity to be supplied to the demands of the coals ; fo either more or less than the exact sum is injurious. In one of these, the air to be supplied to the gases evolved from the coals is introduced through a regulating register at the end of the return blue, and in aline with it, with (cid127cid127) ~a~ view of com mingling thoroughly, (an important requisite) and of aiding the draught at. the same time. In another, (pat i 483 [a[ 75 ]enter in England) the atmospheric -air is introduced through the meshes of wire gauze in the door of the furnace, and above the fuel, and at the bridge, so as to introduce it in the smallest imagine able Gets the greatest subdivision being considered an important consideration. The introduction of the air above the fuel is injurious, as it forms a current which prevents the flame from imp singing on the boiler. By another plan, patentee here, it is proposed to close up the fire chamber all round, except an aperture in front and below the fire grate, and to force in a blast of air above and below the fire grate, and thus force out the products of combustion by the pressure of the blast; and, to insure a still greater pressure within' the fire chamber, and also with the view to prevent the escape of smoke and sparks, the end of the upper blue dips in water, so that the products of combustion have to pass through the water. His branch of the arts has received a valuable contribution in the report of Professor Alter R. Johnson of his experiments on the coal of the United States, which is rep let with valuable information to the engineer for, by a reference to the data, the engineer will be enabled to adapt the condition of his furnace to the kind of coal which he is obliged to use ; or, if free to select the quality, he can adapt the kind of coal to the furnace, so as to obtain the most economical results. Strict attention to his work cannot be too strongly urged upon those who have the management of furnaces; they will find in it data for what has heretofore rested upon mere conjecture. The improvements in boilers and genera torn during the last year have been very limited. One of them is for an arrangement of small horizontal cylinders on the same plane, and opening into a cylinder of larger capacity, into which the supply of water is forced, and to which the steam pipe, safety valve, &c, are attached. For the purpose of regulating the heat, there is a piston, working in a small cylinder open to the steam chamber, which, when the elastic force of the steam passes a certain range, is forced up, and, by an appropriate connexion, closes the damper in the chimney. To far, this arrangement is old ; but it is combined with an apparatus which re sets it after the elastic force has descended below the proper range. His apparatus consists of a valved cup, attached to a lever and a reservoir; so that, on the rise of the lever, a valve in the reservoir is opened, and water flows into the valved cup, which gives to the lever the preponderance, andover comes the friction of the piston, and forces it down again ;a, the water, in like manner, being discharged from the cup when it reaches the bottom. A patent has also been granted for an arrangement of concentric tubes, forming three concentric departments. The waste steam, passing through the middle one, heats the supply water on its passage through another of these departments to the boiler, and also the air for the blast, which passes through the third, on its way to the grate. As the height and condition of water in steam boilers are of the first importance as a question of safety, any reasonable suggestion on this subject must be interesting to the public at large, and particularly so to those who construct and manage steam engines. The employment of a separate orauxiliary engine to work the feed pumps, and so connected with a float within the boiler as to start this engine when the water reaches the low water line, was patented some years since; and within the past year improvements have been made on this plan, and patented, which consist iso arranging the valves as to insure the starting of the engine when steam, *a* *a* r[ 75 ]a] 484 is admitted by the sinking 'of the float, without reference to the positionofcid127e piston in the cylinder; and also for the arrangement of balancevMves in connexion with the float, so that the pressure of the steam shalliotiatt to prevent the float from descending with the level of the water. Another method of regulating the height of water consists of a float placed in a vessel communicating with the boiler, above and below the water line, and also with the supply pipe. A valve, fitting a valve seat in the supply pipe, is attached to the lower stem of the float; so that, by this arrangement, the water forced .into this vessel by every stroke of the pump runs out with the return stroke of the pump when the water is sufficiently high to keep the float up, and therefore the valve open; but, when the water is not high enough to sustain the float and valve, the water forced in (the valve opening upwards, for that purpose) cannot run out; for, on the return stroke of the pump, the valve closes, and prevents the water from running out; and, to prevent the water forced into the vessel containing the float at every stroke of the pump from abstracting heat from the water in the boiler, there is another valve on the stem of the float, which when the float is sufficiently high, closes the pipe leading from this vessel to the lower part of the boiler; so that the supply water only enters the boiler when the supply is required. A very simple device has been introduced in England for indicating the density of bring in the boilers of marine steam engines, which I deem worthy of attention. This device is the invention of, and has been reduced to practice by, Mr. J. Scott Russell, an engineer of distinction in England. The following is ah extract of the description given of it by the inventor :a. l have lately employed, in some large ships destined for trans atlantic voyages, a species of bring gauge, or index of sat duration, which is found to possess every advantage, and which I therefore desire to communicate to the public through this society. The drawings sent are such as may enable any engineer to construct them for himself. The details of the arrangement of the apparatus were made under the direction of Mr. James Marie, formerly one of my assistants; and he also has obliged me by writing out the annexed description of the operation of using the index. "the principle I have used is the well known law, that the heights of equiponderant fluids vary inversely as the d enmities of those fluids f I take open glass tubes, bent in the form of the letter U, and pour one fluid into one of the sides, and another fluid into the opposite side taking care to use the heavier liquid before the other) the one being i mercury, and the other water, they will stand at the height of 1 in. and 13 in, respectively. If I use alcohol arid water, they will stand at the height of 10 in, and 8 in, respectively; the height of the one fluid being always greater than the height of the other, in the proportion in which its weight, density, or specific gravity, is less. In like manner, fresh water and salt water will stand at heights of 40 in. and 41 in, showing a difference of 1 in The use which I make of this principle is as follows: I reckon the best scale of salt ness of a boiler to be that which takes the common saw ater as a standard. Tea water contains Y- of saline matter. When the water has been elaborated, so as to leave only half the quantity of dis 485 75 tilled water to the same quantity of saline matter, I call that two degrees of salt, or bring of the strength of two; and such bring would show (in fig. 3) the columns 40 and 42, or double the salt ness of sea water, indicated by a difference of two inches. A further sat duration would be indicated by a difference of 3, 4, 5, and 6 in. between the columns, and so indicate 5, 4, 5, 6, and any further degrees of salt ness range which may be made to any degree of minuteness by the subdivision of the scale of inches. This scale is that which appears to me most simply applicable here ; and it is that which I adopt for marine boilers." The mechanical apparatus which I have employed to give this indication is perfectly simple, and has the advantage of being such as the engineer already perfectly understands. To the marine boiler I apply two water gauges of glass, instead of one, as at present used : they both serve the purpose of the present glass gauges; and the pair would be valuable for this, if for no other reason that there would always be a duplicate when one is broken an accident not un frequent. To these gauge si simply attach small copper pipes, so that one of them may be placed in communication only with the salt bring in the lower part of the boiler; the one then holds a column of bring, and the other of pure sea water, and each inch of difference shows the degree of sat duration. Sieamr engines The fundamental principle of the steam engine having been so well established, we are not to look for any marked improvement connected with it, but merely for modifications and simplifications of the arrangement of parts. Arrangements have been patented lately, for the purpose of applying the condenser to the high pressure ensue. The familiar distinction between what are known under the general appellation of high and low pressure engines is, as you well know, that in the form heir after the steam has acted against the piston, it is discharged into the atmosphere, and the steam introduced on the other side has to act against the pressure of the atmosphere; whilst, in the latter, it is discharged into the condenser' and there condensed, leaving a vacuum; so that the steam admitted on the other side of the piston does not meet with the resistance of the atmosphere. But, in the non condensing engines, the steam is employed at a much higher pressure than in the condensing engines, and the sitnpleapplication of the condenser makes them all of the same class ; leaving, simply, the difference of pressure of the steam employed. But the objections to the employment of a condenser are numerous, and, in some localities, insurmountably; although, in a majority of cases, the great capacity of the condenser, and the large quantity of water necessary to con dense steam of a very high pressure, are the leading objections ; and it is to meet these, that the improvements in question have been devised. The condenser is so arranged as to permit the steam to pass through it, and to escape through a valve into the atmosphere, carrying with it the air 4 and water previously contained in it; and when so much has escaped as to reduce the pressure to that of the atmosphere, the condensing jet is introduced, the remaining steam condensed, and the escape valve closed by the pressure of the atmosphere ; thus leaving a vacuum for the remaining portion of the stroke. Another patent has been granted for an arrangement of parts of a pendulous engine, which is hung at one end of the cylinder, instead of the middle; the cylinder being provided with a semi cylindrical face, adapted[ 75 ]a] 486 to a corresponding cavity in the frame work, and these parts provided with the necessary apertures to admit and shut off the steam by the vibration of the cylinder, and with a cock and other appendages for reversing the action of the engine. The introduction of that class of pro pellets known under the various appellations of screw, spiral, and inclined pro pellets, which are generally applied one on each side of the stern post, and by means of two parallel shafts, has led to a great variety of arrangements of the connecting parts of steam engines, with the view to avoid the use of cog get hearing or straps, that are always objectionable in heavy machinery. Most of these arrangements are not the legitimate subjects of patents, and have not therefore been secured ; but one has lately been patented, which is very ingenious and simple, and, if not liable to practical objections, (into which I have not had time to examine) will present many advantages. It consists of a vibrating cylinder suspended on journals midway between the two shafts, and the piston rods (there being two) pass out through both ends of the cylinder, and are connected with the shafts to one of them by an immovable connexion, and to the other by a joint link, to admit of sufficient, play to pass the dead points. By this simple arrangement, the shafts a returned in opposite directions. An improvement on the old balance valve has been patented, which consists in connecting the balance piston with the valve by means of a hollow stem, through which the steam passes to act on the face of the piston, instead of employing an outside passage for it. With the view to prevent the admission of too much steam at the time the crank is passing the dead points, and to prevent too much slamming, a patent has been obtained for providing the conical valve with a ring or french, which nearly fits the aperture of the valve seat, so that very little steam can pass until the valve has been so far raised as to carry this ring or french above the valve seat. Patents have also been granted for regulating the periods of opening the valves, to cut off the steam, and permit it to expand in the cylinder, and thus economized fuel. In one of these arrangements, there is an arm on the stem of the steam valve, which acts against adjustable stops on the stem of the cut off valve; so that the position of these stops may be changed at pleasure, and thus regulate the extent of motion of the cut off valves these two valves working on different seats, one above the other. Another arrangement of valves consists in so regulating the period of the movements of the valves as to leave the piston free to complete each stroke in equilibrium, which is effected by opening the lower exhaust valve before the end of the upward stroke of the piston, and before the upper exhaust valve is closed, and opening the upper exhaust valve before the end of the downward stroke of the piston, and before the lower exhaust valve is closed ; the steam valve being open without a lead, and after the exhaust valve on the corresponding end of the cylinder has, be enclosed. With reference to locomotive steam engines, but one patent has been granted during the past year, and that is for an entirely new arrangement of the engines. The two cylinders, instead of being arranged on each side of the carriage, are placed in the middle of the width, and one for each truck ; the carriage being composed of two truck s-one for the boiler, and the other for the lender. The piston rods are connected each with 487 [a[ 75 piti appropriate set of wheels, by means of a sliding cross bead nd connecting rods, so arranged as to admit of the vibration of the trucks in passing over curves, without affecting the action of the engines which are attached to the frame of the carriage. The two engines are connected together by connecting rods, which extend fr in m the ends of the cross beads to cranks on eccentric cog wheels, for the purpose of equal iting the power and action of the two engines. There are other arrangements, of a minor character, which could not be made clear without drawings. Without expressing any opinion upon the practical value of these improve merits, I may be permitted to express my admiration of the ingenuity which the mechanical arrangements exhibit4NAVI  Gati Of And Mari  Of I Mplements. The only improvement which I have to notice, connected with shipbuilding, is a mode of cal king the seams of ships by means of a series of w edges, which are made width wise, alternately wider at the point than at the butt, arid vice versa; so that when they are driven into the seams, they wedge length wise of the se am as well as width wise. This is equally applicable to the floors of cellars, and other wooden structures. Nails -in improvement has been proposed and patented for a new mode of cutting and rigging the sails of square rigged vessels, by making them in two parts, each half extending from the mast to the end of the yards. They are hung to the upper yards by rings that slide on a rod called a "jack yard" attached to the middle and end of the yard, and are set and fur led by means of out and in haulers. By this arrangement it is alleged that a vessel can be worked with greater ease, and will sail nearer the wind, than by the mode now practised. Ship blocks The mode of strapping blocks, by carrying the iron strap outside of the block, is deemed to be objectionable, from the circumstance that the pin of the s heave is supported by the strap at foo great a distance from the s heave, the thickness of the shell intervening. To remedy this evil, an improvement has been patented, which consists in attaching the iron strap to the inside of the cheeks; thus bringing the straps directly against the s heave. Repelling boats and vessels Several patents have been granted for modifications of screw or spiral pro pellets, and modes of applying them to vessels. In one of these, the paddles are simply placed at an angle of about 45 with the line of the shaft, instead of being curved or twisted ;and they are so connected with the shaft as to extend the surface or face of the paddle, at the middle of its width, to the centre of the shaft, or nearly so; the hut being formed between the middle and the edges the inclining of the planes of the paddle with the axis of the shaft admitting of this form; for a straight line at the base of the paddle intersects the shaft at- te middle of the paddles width, at a point much nearer the centre than it does at the edges of the paddle. In this way, the necessary strength is given, and the face of the paddle extended nearer to the centre of the shaft than by any other known mode. Another consists in giving to the plane of the spiral or twisted paddle an inclination from a radial line projected from the centre of the shaft. Was these various modifications have their advocates, and a strong con 075] , 488 test for superiority is going on, I deem it advisable to withhold the expression of my opinion upon their relative merits. I ingenuity seems to be on the utmost stretch to devise some mode ofpropelling vessels by means of apparatus placed below the water line, and therefore beyond the reach of the action of waves and shot ;arid as many entertain the opinion that the class of pro pellets above referred to are wasteful of power, various methods have been resorted to with a view of obtaining better results by other means. Several have lately been patented, the characters of which I will here point out, without approving or disapproving them. One of them consists of two rotating plates arranged at tie bottom of the vessel, one forward of the other, in the line usually occupied by the feel, and provided with hinged flaps or paddles, kept close, or folded up even with the surface of the rotating plates, to which they are hinged, by the resistance of the water during a portion of their circuit, and thrown out by a can or inclined plane during that portion of their circuit in which they. are required to act on the water to proper the vessel The came that throw out the paddles are so arranged that their positions an be shifted at pleasure, and throw them out in any part of their circuit relatively to the line of the feel; and thus proper forward, backward, sideways, quartering in short, in any desired direction. Another is composed of a wheel with vanes, like a rotary fan lower, working horizontally in a case within the vessel, so arranged as to admit water to the centre of the wheel; which, by centrifugal action, is discharged at the periphery through tangental pipes extending in different directions to the stern, bow, and sides of the vessel, and provided with gates or valves, so as to discharge the water from any of them at pleasure, and thus proper the vessel in the direction desired. The idea of propellingvessels by means of currents of water admitted to the centre of the wheel, and discharged in t agents at the periphery, is old a patent having been granted for it before; but the addition of the t agent pipes, for the discharge of the water in different directions, constitutes the essential feature of novelty under the present patent. A modification of the duck foot paddle' has also been patented; the main object of which is to adapt it to the shifting of the paddle, with the view of pro telling backward; together with an arrangement" to insure the proper presentation of the paddles in the pro telling and returning action. The common paddle wheel has long since been arranged with the paddles morning an angle with the line of the shaft the two halves inclining in opposite directions, and forming an angle in the middle; and a patent has lately been granted for modifying this arrangement, by overlapping the two halves of the paddle in the middle, and placing one forward of the other, so as to leave a space. between them for the discharge of water. The great rival ship between railroads and canals, and the necessity of reducing the cost of transportation on the latter, have led to numerous experiments in various parts of the country to apply steam as a mode of p repulsion. The side wheels are known to be objectionable for many reasons, but particularly on account of increasing the width of the boat. It was long since proposed to remove this difficulty, by placing the paddle wheels at the bow or at the stern; both of which were soon abandoned. Of the numerous plans lately devised for this purpose, but one was patented dura of the past year, which consists in placing the paddle wheels on each 489[ 75 1 side of the bow, with the plane of the paddles at right angles with the general plane of the bow; and effecting this by either making the paddle is 'parallel with the shaft, and placing the plane of the wheel parallel with the general plane of the bow, or by placing the shaft at right angles with the feel, and the paddles at an inclination with the shaft. I ce breakers For the purpose of keeping harbors clear of ice, various modes have been suggested of adapting saws and hammers to the bow of a boat proper led by steam, by means of which the ice was to be cut into strips, and then broken into small blocks, and these blocks pushed to each side of the boat by guards placed at the bow, and back of the breakers. A patent has been granted for so modifying the form and arrangement of these guards as to depress the blocks of ice below the surface, and push them under the surrounding ice, and thus leave the channel clear, by a combination of inclined planes. Lifepreserversthe danger of leakage in that class of life preserver s which consist of inflated bags, by forcing air into them, led to the substitution of a he local spring, made of metal or other substance, or rings placed within a bag, the heads of which are to be provided with valves, to admit air in, drawing it out, and with hooks, to secure the belt around the body. And as it is desirable to make' these in the form of an ellipse is, in their transverse section, a single spring or set of rings, it is supposed by some, might be collapsed by the pressure of the water; and, to avoid this difficulty, it has been improved by composing it of two wire he lines attached together, side by side. Harpoonsvarious devices have been resorted to, to improve the harpoon used by whale is; and, amongst others, it was proposed, some years ago, to enclose within the harpoon a vessel containing prussia acid, which, on striking, would be diffused, and. thus kill the whale. As an improvement' on this, a patent has been granted for putting a bottle of explosive mixture within the f luke of the harpoon, which is jointed to the stem or handle, so that the pull of the whale will open the f luke and explode themixture5CI Of  L Engi Neeri  Of And Archi   Tecture. Civil engineering The number of improvements developed and patented during the past year, under the depressed state of civil engineering, occasioned by the temporary prostration of our works of internal improvement, would be matter of surprise to one 'unacquainted with the energy and vigor of the American character, which has always exhibited its most brilliant qualities in adversity; and hence we find that invention is resorted to as a means of release from difficulties. The number of patents granted for improvements in this branch of the arts should by no means be considered a fair exhibit of the improvements made in the country, for many of them are never secured by letters patent. For can they be gathered, as in England and France, from the journals devoted to science, and the transactions of associations of engineers; for there this class of publications and such societies are very numerous, and the narrow limits of the territory bring all this kind of information within a small compass 7 whilst in this country it is the very reverse; publications of this kind are very limited, and the vast extent of our territory renders it difficult 'to[ 75 ]a] -490 bring together, for consultation and interchange of ideas, engineers scattered over various portions of the country. I improvement of natural wiatercoursesOf the improvements made in the United States in this branch of engineering within the past year, very few have come under my notice in an authentic shape; but as I have met with some in the foreign journals, which contain important suggestions, I will notice their chief characteristics. One of them is for making floating platforms, to be used for the formation of break waters, floating bridges, beacons, the protection of pier heads, embankments, and all similar purposes. It consists in the construction and adaptation of sloping platforms, mounted upon, connected to, or supported by, floating hollow vessels or caissons; by which the platforms are always maintained in sloping or oblique positions, and are enabled to rise and fall with the tide. The lower edge of these platforms, or the parts extending under water, are moored to the bottom by anchors or other known means, and the whole presents an inclined surface to the action of the wind and waves. The rapid decay of all wooden structures exposed to the alternate action of water and air, has led to various propositions for the substitution of iron. Among others, the plan proposed in England by Mr. John stone for the construction of break waters and similar structures, appears to possess some merit. The plan is as follows, viz : " A series of distinct and separate caissons, each presenting in external form one half of the pier of a bridge, with its cut water presented to the sea, is to be formed in four to six fathoms water, according to localities. Each caisson to consist of cast iron plates of large size, and one inch in thickness, (prepared with coal tar, so as to resist co erosion) bolted together by means of four inch changes; the whole to be filled with, concrete, granite, or other suitable material. The lower part of each caisson, to the height of thirty-two feet, having a foundation platform of wood, to be completed on shore, and, when prepared, to be launched, and to wed out to its position and then lowered; the whole to be secured to the bed of the sea by means of cast iron piles, driven through tubes of the same material. As the upper part of the caisson is put together, so is the interior to be filled up with the solid materials, and to be coped with clamped masonry. The weight of each caisson complete would be 4,500tons; and the cost of a break water on this principle, extending to nearly a mile in length, is estimated at 297,800,"'The following is another mode of attaining similar ends, viz> This invention is divided into four parts, and consists last. In the application of hollow piles of iron in the construction of piers, embankments, break waters, &c; which piles may be of a circular or other convenient form, and are sunk by withdrawing from their interior the sand and other matter occupying the space upon which they stand. 2dly. I n the application of skeleton frames or cases in connexion with hollow pile sadly. In forming or injecting by hydraulic pressure, around the feet of the piles, such chemical solutions as will solidity or consolidate the sand or other matter upon which they stand ; and 4thly. In the application of cement in a state of dry powder ; which cements are intended to solidifyuhder water, and form an artificial rock The mode of driving hollow piles, as related in the first part of the specification, is as follows: A hollow. pile is provided, open at both ends 491 t [a[ 75 ]resuming the p see in which it is to be driven be of a sandy nature, and covered with water, the pile is placed on one end in its, destined place, such end being open; the upper end being closed by an air tight lid or cover, and connected by means of a pipe with a receiver. Another pipe also branches off from the receiver, and is connected with a threebarreledair pump, which, on being set to work, exhausts the air from the hollow pile, and raises the sand and water from the bottom thereof, and causes it to sink to the depth required; the sand and water passing through the pipe, which is connected to the top of the pier or pile, and into the receiver, which can be emptied as occasion may require." In some descriptions of soil, the inventor states that it will be found necessary to loose n the soil, which may be done by passing an instrument down the pile adopted for the purpose; and, should it be required, water maybe applied in the same manner. When the piles meet with a hard substance, the inventor proceeds to sink them by boring down the tube, in the manner of boring Artesian wells. When the piles to be driven are of large diameter, the same mode of driving may be adopted, by the application of a movable tube, which the inventor calls an ' elephant or operating trunk' the sand and water being raised through the operating trunk, which is connected at its outer extremity, by means of a flexible tube, to a receiver, from which the air is exhausted by the air pumps; the operating trunk being guided by a man, who, for the sake of security against the bursting up of the loose sand, stands in a tub or " cobb le" where he is enabled to move the operating trunk round the foot of the pile n order to secure the piles, which may be driven at any convenient distance from each other, the inventor employs what he terms 'skeleton frames' These frames are cast with holes to receive the ends of the piles; so that, when applied, they embrace and bind the whole together. After the piles have been sunk, they may be wholly or partly filled up with ruble stones or concrete; but, before doing so, should the soil be of a yielding nature, it will be necessary to consolidate it, which the inventor does by forcing or pouring down the hollow pipes such chemical solutions as the nature of the soil may require, which may be ascertained by analyzing a small portion of it; and, according as si vicious or calcareous matters predominate, it will be ascertained what chemical substances will be best calculated to consolidate and solidity the same. The cements to be used in a dry state are those known as hydraulic cements; and may be used alone, or mixed with stones, sand, or single and may be delivered at the foot of the pile, or other structure, by means of a hop per, having a tube leading from it to the structure intended to be cemented ; at which place the current miles with the water, and consolidates the whole mass The great amount of surface which light houses present to the action of the waves, together with the difficulty of finding a bed suitable for a solid foundation where such structures are required, induced the British Government to test the plan of building them of iron on iron piles ; placing the house above the reach of the waves, and therefore presenting only the small surface of the piles to their action. The experiment has been fully successful, and will be generally adopted there. It appears to me to deserve the serious attention of our Government. The construction of these light houses was very much facilitated ty an improvement patented in England several years ago, the value of which has only very lately been appreciated: it is called the screw mooring, and was invented chiefly for the purpose of mooring a floating dry dock, invented and patented in England in the year 1832. It is applicable to piles as well as to mooring chains, by attaching it to the lower end of the pile, or that part which is to be inserted in the ground, or bed of a river c. The following description of it is taken from the Civil Engineer and Architects' Journal, an English publication, viz: "his sort of mooring is constructed, as its name implies, on the principle of the s, crew, but differing essentially in form from th:at well known instrument; for, while the spiral thread makes little more than one turn round its shaft, it is, at the same time, extended to a very broad french; the hold which it takes of the ground being proportional with its breadth of diskSWhen it is necessary to provide against a heavy strain, Mr. Mitcheilhas too rings oft 3 feet 6 inches diameter; and the principle is capable of still further extension." A mooring of the above diameter presents a resisting surface equal to about 10 square feet, whereas the palm of the largest anchor in the British navy does not exceed half the see and some estimate of its holding powers may be formed, when it is shown that this broad surface can be screwed to a depth many times greater than that to which the palm of an anchor can ever descend The method t of laying down the mooring is briefly this: A strong mooring chain being so attached to it as to allow the screw to turn freely without carrying the chain around with it, a powerful iron shaft is then fixed firmly in the upper part of the mooring, (which is formed square for that purpose) setting in the same manner as a key to a harp or piano fort ein, winding up; it is then lowered by the mooring chain, joint after joint being added to the shaft; till the mooring has reached the ground; light levers, of 12 feet in length, are then applied to the shaft, in the manner of acapstan, when the operation of screwing the mooring into the groundcommencesTwo boats, or barges, having been moored firmly, head and stern, close alongside each other, and the upright shaft rising between them, about mid ships, the men place themselves at the bars, and move round fr on one boat to the other; the two giving them a safe and convenient platform. By a simple contrivance, the levers are occasionally shipped upwards as the screw and shaft sink into the ground* When the number of men employed can no longer force the screw round, the levers are removed, and the shaft drawn out of the ground, leaving the mooring firmly imbedded, with the chain attached to it; a boy being s hack led to the other end of the chain; the work is completed; the time required for the whole operation seldom exceeding a few hours Although this improvement has slumbered unnoticed for so many years, it is now deemed so valuable, that the proprietor has just obtained letters patent for it in this country, for the remaining portion of the 14 years from the date of the letters patent granted in England. There is probably no branch, of civil engineering which presents so many difficulties as that of improving the navigation of shallow streams and, as there are many such in various parts of our country, and the flood gates now used are known to be very imperfect, I deer h it of importance 49 275 ]403 -75 ]to ~call, attention to a system of flood gates with movable wires, reduced to practice in France. The following is a copy of a report made on thisipyention, vizSReport made to the Society for the Encouragement of National I nl s try, by M. Vanvilliers, in the name of the committee of mechanical arts, on a. system of flood gates for water courses, with movable wires, invented by M. Heard, principal engineer of bridges and highways and executed on the river I s le, department of the Dordogne and the I ronde" for which the society, on the 6th of September, 1843, awarded. Heard its gold medal Throughout the report are retained the French technical terms bar rage, mobile (a movable wie r) and has use, (flood gate, or sluiceNavigation, irrigation, and industry, require that, in almost every situation, the running waters should be raised up, in, the beds that hold them, at those times when they are least abundant. In seasons of superabundance, it is also of paramount importance that waters should be promptly and freely permitted to flow on in their natural courses. For small water courses, these conditions have been amply fulfilled by the construction of slices, flood gates, and wires, the varied compositions and effects of which are well known. In the case of great waters, the problem is more difficult to solve; in consequence of ice and broken pieces of floating bodies being drawn in by the current, they require that all obstacles opposed to the free passage of the waters should be instantly removed; to this effect has the ingenuity of man been directed, for the purpose of applying them for the uses of navigation, irrigation, &c. Heard, engineer in chief since 1828 of the canal operations on the river I s le, which stood greatly in need of carrying out 'the foregoing conditions, has been occupied unceasingly in search of, and experimenting upon, the means of arriving at this result having so far succeeded in combining and executing such dispositions, that he can sustain the waters of the river I s le at 7 feet 4 inches above the level of the bed; procure a convenient draught of water to get boats up during dry weather maintain them at this level sufficiently long, so that the free flowing of the river is incapable of drawing them away; and, having arrived at this point, restore the waters to their natural course, in order not to expose the valleys to subversions pre judicial to establishments which have for their objects the keeping back of water and navigation. The first report addressed to the administration of bridges and his  h ways, on the trials made by M. Heard, is dated in 1831; it announced the good opinion formed by them by the inspector of the division. I n 1839, so as to verify it, another commission composed of inspectors general and division al of bridges and highways, was appointed by the Government. M. Heard, having perfected with skill and success a happy idea of a provisional flood gate, suggested to him by the division al inspector, (M. Teenager) during the inspection of the navigation of the I s le, was enabled to render his system of bar rage more complete and applicable to many other rivers. The commission concluded, at one visit, that experiments should be made and executed by the commission, assisted by 1. Heard, the inspector of the division, and many engineers from the neighboring localities. In the 4th of July, 1841, ,the commission concluded their ex peri cents, and reported thereon. .a[ 75 -494 Up to this time, M. Heard had not had occasion to apply his system, except to fixed existing bar rages, and to elevate the water to 2 feet 6 inches or more above the crest. The central government manifested a desire that he should elevate the water from 3 feet to 4 feet. Confiding in the i certainty of his system, M. Heard obtained authority to make a trial, the important results of which are the object of his communication to the society and of the present report; in which the retained body of water above the lower level was raised to a height of nearly 9 feet." The convictions to which these trials and observations have successively led M. Heard are as follows: " The trap doors or slice e that M. Heard calls has uses are attached to the hinges on the upper horizontal surface of the stationary portion or apron of the bar rage, and in number sufficient to equal its length; the slices are in length, horizontally, about 4 feet, and in height 5 feet 6 inches. In the lower face there appears an iron prop, similar to the prop s which are adapted to certain dressing glasses and reading desks, and which a but against a stop fixed in the apron in the dock When the has uses are raised and propped up, they form a partition or bar rage, which stops the water and raises it up the river, even to exceed its natural level; if the has uses are let down, the water flows and resumes once again its natural course. To produce this effect, there is placed along the entire length of the bar rage, and above the apron, a flat iron bar, which runs across the river, and along the foot of the props. This bar has at one of its extremities a rack, which works in a opinion fixed at the bottom of a vertical axis, that can be made to turn from above by a cast an. This rack is made to move backwards or forwards as many inches as it has has uses that require manceuvring. The bar has on its lower edge a tooth or clear on the side of each prop, and which are sub divided in such a manner, that, by the removal of the bar, the foot of each prop (the hinge of which permits a slight circular motion) is successively drawn away from its bed or berth, when r the has uses are left (cid127without support, to turn on their hinges, and lower themselves one by one, at pleasure, from up the river to its downward fall, on the apron of the bar rage; the props at the same time stretching themselves down the stream When the overflow of water is stopped, and it is required to raise up the has uses, the current is opposed to bringing them back again from the lower to the upper part of the river. To accomplish it, use is made of a system of contrehausses of the same length as the has uses, but of a height less by seven inches, and being capable also of being turned down towards the upstream; during all the time that the has uses are either raised up or lowered down, the contrehausses remain lying on the apron, where a spring latch retains each of them against the action of the current, which has a tendency to lift them up. There is an interval of about a foot between the range of has uses and of contlrehaitssesA flat bar of iron, of the kind already described, with the shifting movement, regulates the opening and closing the contre has uses. At each progression 'of an inch, a staple presses and releases the each; and the corresponding contrehausse, submitting to the effort of the current, turns round con its hinges, and raises itself to a vertical position. A bridle chair clamped on the solid part of the apron prevents it from going too far, By495this method, which produces an immediate effect, is formed a second bag rage above that which existed be lure the letting down of the has uses; the current remains suspended ; the upper edge opposes the flow of water, and allows the lock keeper to raise the has uses." To facilitate this operation, M. Heard has placed on the upper part of each contrehausse an iron man rope, which supports an iron gangway suspended at nearly the same level to which it is intended the retained body of water should rise The lock keeper stands on the gangway, furnished with a little portable windlass, which he rests on the I man rope; he rolls this rope on the cylinder of the windlass, and draws towards him the has use, and with it the prop or stay that supports it against the slipper, and at the same time, he hooks it on the contrehausse. He proceeds thus through all the haussesin succession. When all are hooked, he hastens the filling up of the space between the has uses and contrehausses, by drawing with his hand the vent plugs fixed in the contrehausses. This done, the latter are balanced by a volume of still water; the lock keeper then un hooks in succession each contrehausse, and abandons it to its own weight, (which exceeds that of the volume of water hvbich it occupies) to fall down on to the stone work of the bar rage; it then patches itself there anew, and the body of water is once again held in perfect retention by the has uses." These manoeuvres are performed with precision and quickness. The report of July, 1841, states, that at the bar rage of Holy, which is 57 feet 6 inches long, with the has uses 2 feet 8 inches high, two men, in 8 minutes, lowered the has uses, raised the contrehausses, then righted the has uses, and re laid the contrehausses. In this space of time, 16 seconds were sufficient to lower the has use, and make the bar rage disappear; and 20 seconds only were occupied in raising the contrehausses, and restoring the mass of water in retention The report of the commissioners of the Academy of Science, Belleslettres, and Arts, at Bordeaux, of the 10th of January, 1843, states, that at the bar rage of It. Anthony, which is 27 feet long, formed by 7 haussesof4 feet long each, and 5 feet 6 inches high, and by 7 contrehausses, the bar rage manoeuvre was performed twice in 30 minutes i. e. in one minute per linear yard of has uses and contrehausses. M. Heard flatters himself that the height of 5 feet 6 inches is not a limit for the application of his system; he has been obliged to confine himself to this height at the bar rage dam at It. Anthony, owing to local circumstances; he thinks the could carry it to the height of 10 or 13 feet the has use." Already, by practical experience, he has solved a beautiful problem in hydraulics, which has frequently occupied the attention of engineers, and of which there exists but one other solution, totally different: it is the work of M. Soiree, division al inspector of bridges and highways. Heard has combined in his construction many capabilities which facilitate the working of floating bodies, and prevent the inconvenennceswhich these, and matters deposited by the current, might occasion; the consequences of which would be to perplex the operations of the haussesand the contrehausses. He has fixed vent holes in the partitions of thehausses, to drive away down the river such bodies as may have been stopped or deposited on the apron. The teeth or clefts of the iron bars i move n the whirlpools; the entrance to which is closed by grooved traps, which render the deposites less 'abundant than might be supposed. He can re 75 ]a] 496 'move those which have already formed themselves, by a pressure and a current produced by turning water through the upper opening of the pipe in which turns the axis of the opinion. To avoid the loss of water which must ensue from openings or interstices of about an inch (which cannot be avoided) between two consecutive has uses, or between the has ses and the side walls, there is placed a. little board, which covers the joint, and hinders the flow." Experience has proved that the letting down is unattended with hurt full, jolting, because it is done under a sheet of water which is flowing with the greatest rapidity, and which instantly leadens all shocks." The contrehausses, under the trench of water which covers them over, seem to hesitate a moment in raising themselves up under the impulse of the current; they do not i attain any great degree of velocity until, in the last portion of their movement, the accelerate on is greatly modified by the mass of water the contrehausses, already raised up, sent back laterally against the others. Up to the present time, there has not been any serious difficulty experienced in performing the manoeuvres; branches, weed gravel, and sand, which might interfere with them, are easily dragged away or removed." It is easy to conceive that, within certain limits, has uses and contrehausses of a greater height than 5 feet 6 inches can be employed and worked. It is the work of experience and time to pronounce upon the preservation, keeping in repair, and replacing the movable parts, under and out of the water, of which the apparatus of M. Thenards bar rage is composed. It is under the proof of ice formed underneath, raised to the surface, and carried away by the current against the has uses, that we can judge definitely of the power of resistance in the actual constructions, and the modifications that may be applied to them. We can rely, with confidence, upon the skilful perseverance of M. Heard to ward off any inconveniences that have not as yet presented themselves. In the meantime, the bar rages mobiles, such as are executed at It. Anthony, reflect honor on the inventive talent of M. Heard. They appear to be susceptible of numerous and important applications, and to justify the approbation that the committee of mechanical arts deem themselves empowered to give, and recommend the council of administration to award them the committee propose, besides, to insert in the records of the society the present report, as well l as the drawings and descriptions which accompany M. Thenards memorandumSSaws have long since been combined with a boat or scow for the purpose of cutting def piles under water; but this operation has always been accompanied with a serious difficulty, viz: the motion of the scow occasioned by the swell or waves in harbors. To avoid this difficulty, the saw is now combined with the scow, by means of a sliding frame, balanced in the sliding cheeks by a counter weight, so that the rise and fall of the boat by the swell does not seriously affect the operations of the saw. This device has been reduced to practice in Boston harbor. In England, the common pile driver has been modified by attaching the ram directly to the end of the piston rod of a vertical steam engine placed above it, or with a horizontal engine, by means of a rope or chain passing over and under two pulleys, so' as to dense with the monkey, and thereby increase the velocity of the action d of the ram. The same 497 75 ]method it will be seen, by reference to class I st, has long since been applied to forge hammersanalsA patent has lately been granted for an arrangement adapted to the support of canal lock gates from above, instead of having them run on a plate at the bottom, by means of a stirrup extending from the outer edge of the gate to a post so inclined as to bring its upper end just over the axis of the gate hinges; the post being sustained by log chains, and the stirrup provided with a s wives screw for adjustment. There is connected with this an arrangement of cords and windlass for opening and closing the gate from the side opposite to that on which the gate is hung. The improvements in pro telling canal boats were noticed under the class of navigation; but I there omitted to state that it has been proposed in Europe to proper boats on canals by means of a pipe at the bottom of the canal, from which water is to be exhausted, that the boat may be impelled by the pressure of the water on a piston in the pipe, and connected with the boat on the principle of the atmospheric railroads, simply substitutinghydrostatic for rheumatic force; and, of course, subject to practical objections of a more serious nature than those urged with so much force against the atmospheric system of railroads. Railroadsthe serious accidents that have occurred on railroads, by the use of switches to guide the cars from one track to another, has, from the commencement, occupied the serious attention of engineers and others, without any decided beneficial result. All the plans heretofore suggested were either impracticable, or would not prevent accidents if not properly shifted by the attendant. But it is now my pleasure to notice the grant of letters patent for an improvement which presents decided advantages, and which has been fully tested on the Leading railroad. It consists in the employment of two parallel bars attached to, and moving with, the switch; so that, when the switch has been shifted, and put in connexion with the turn out rails, they are in line with the rails of the main track and, in the event of neglect on the part of the attendant to replace the switch, a car from the main track will run on to these parallel bars, which are, at their fixed end, connected with the main track by means of inclined planes and guides, so arranged as to elevate the french of the wheels which are outside the track) over the rail, and guide the whole of them to the line of the track, and thus prevent the cars from running off. Any accidents result, also, from the manner of uniting the rails at the junction of the sections ; for, if they separate side wise or vertically, forming what are called 1 snake heads" either the french or tread of the wheels is caught, and the car thrown off the track; and hence many devices have been resorted to, to prevent such serious results. The general mode practised is the insertion of the ends of two contiguous sections within a block of iron called a " chair and secured therein by screw bolts or wedges; but the tremulous motion communicated to the rails by the locomotive and train of cars in a short time loose is the screws or w edges, and therefore it becomes necessary to employ men along the whole line, to examine these fastenings carefully. To remedy this evil, it has been proposed to make the key or wedge with a spring catch on the end ; which, when fully inserted, catches on the outside of the chair, and prevents it from being thrown out. Another mode has been suggested in England, "which consists in making the key or wedge hollow, and therefore elastic. As a substitute for these chairs, and screw or wedge fastenings, it 32[ 75 ]a] 498 has been proposed to cast the sections of the rails with webbed blanche son the sides and towards the ends; the blanches on one section projecting beyond the end of the rail, to embrace the contiguous section, theflanches of which do not extend to the end. And, to prevent the rails from breaking by violent concussions, they are cast on wrought iron rods. As a means of preventing accidents from " snake heads" or the ends of rails thrown up out of the proper line, a patent has been granted for attaching curved and inclined guides to the car in front of the wheels, and between the front and back wheels, which strike the "snake heads" and force them down to their proper position until the wheels pass over them. The breaking of cast iron car wheels, in consequence of the strain which the metal undergoes whilst shrinking and cooling in the mould, has been a source of great expense to railroad companies; and therefore many expedients have been resorted to, to discover some plan of preventing this evil. The hut has been connected with the chilled rim by means of a wished disk; but this was deemed objectionable. And lately a patent has been granted for making the disk in such form that a: plane bisecting the wheel in its axis shall present a waved line, or one having aconvexity and con cavity on each face. Any such wheels have been made in the city of Boston, which are spoken of in terms of commendation. Several patents have also been granted for arranging the tracks of railroad ears with the view to obtain a greater amount of strength with a less weight; to adapt the trucks to the turning of curves on roads, by having each wheel in a separate frame, so that the axles can be thrown in the radio of the circle. For a mode of coup long cars, so that one car deviating from the line of the succeeding one, to a greater extent than is required to follow the curving of the road, forces open a spring clasp on the coup long, which liberates the couplingpin, and thus permits the forward car to run off, without carrying with it the whole train; and for improvements in previously patented oil boxes for the journals of railroad cars, contrived with the view of preventing the introduction of dust, &c, and the escape of oil. The fact that iron deteriorates in strength by vibration s established by carefully conducted experiments, has led to a variety of contrivances for preventing the vibration of railroad car axles; but I have not met with a suggestion worthy of serious consideration. It was proposed, a few years since, to make these axles tubular, instead of solid, to render them less liable to break by torsion; but it has been ascertained in England, by carefully conducted experiments, that the solid axles resist this action much better than the tubular axles. And I find that, since these experiments, it has been proposed to make them in two parts, by inserting a solid bar within a tube ; but upon what reasoning this proposition is based, I cannot find. The "atmospheric railway" as it is his called, continues to attract much attention; and although, in my humble opinion, it can never supersede the locomotive system, (for reasons which would require too much space for such a report) I nevertheless deem it proper to point out the improvements in this system, which have been suggested during the year. One of these is the invention of M. Cameron; and the following is a description of it, extracted from the Civil Engineer and Architects' Your sal, for November, 1844, page 389 499 ' ]he places between the two ways a conductor, or pipe, formed of iron plates and bit men, submitted to a high pressure. This conductor, which is of a diameter proportional to the impulsive force that is required, is buried in the soil. Throughout its length, and at certain distances, a reestablished branches, which come and terminate at the centre of each line: these branches are composed of a cylindrical tube, to which is attached a cock, the key of which carries a c opinion. In this cock is fixed vertically a pipe, in the form of a hollow cone, flattened, and divided internally by a transverse partition. This cone is surmounted by a cylindrical respiratory tube, placed horizontally and parallel to the line. The diameter of this tube is one half less than that of the conductor. I tis divided into two equal parts by a transverse partition, which closes hermetically ; its length is about a metre. At each of its extremites there is an external gear, and a hollow cone pierced by a certain quantity of holes. In one of the sides of the branch a groove is placed, in which slides a vertical rod ; the superior extremity of this rod is furnished with a plate, and the inferior extremity with a hook, which cogs with the opinion fixed to the cock. The inventor causes to travel on these branches an articulated tube, which he attaches under the wagons by means of springs and chains. The length of this tube is that of the train; its diameter is equal to that of the conductor; it presents a longitudinal opening, shut by a valve, with two parallel and juxtaposed partitions. Each extremity of this tube is widened, and armed with a valve and lever. Under the first and last wagon are fixed two movable supports, placed obliquely, and parallel to the wagons." Description of its operation Stationary hydraulic or steam engines, established at a distance of 10,000 metres (about 6- miles) from each other throughout the extent of the line to be worked ; these engines serve to work rheumatic machines, which are put in communication with the conductor, or pipe, placed between the two lines. When there is necessity to set a train in motion, there is attached beneath the wagons a to wing line; one of the valves placed at the extremities of this tube is opened, whilst the other remains shut; and that part of the to wing tube which has the valve open must be previously fixed in an respiratory tube ; this process being adopted, and after having effected a vacuum in the conductor, the cock of the branch in which the to wing tube is engaged is then opened by hand. The communication is immediately established between the conductor and this to wing tube by the interior of the branch, and by theaspiratory tube. The atmospheric pressure is immediately exercised in the fixed transverse l partition of the respiratory tube forming the basis it exerts itself, at the same time, throughout the external surface of the valve formed of the to wing tube, which forms the point of resistance. This pressure determines the movement of the to wing tube, which slide sin the gear, adapted to the respiratory tube. At the same time, the longitudinal valve of the to wing tube opens for its passing on to the branch, to shut itself immediately afterwards. As soon as the posterior extremity of the train arrives at this branch, a support shuts off the cock ; and, at the same time, another support, fixed at the head of the first wagon, causes the cock of the second branch to open, by pressing the hook ; at this moment, the vacuum ceases to be communicated to the to wing tube by the first branch, whilst it is produced by the second, The shut off val v e o[ 76] 500 the to wit u be then opens, to slide over on to the first respiratory tube this valve shuts instantly, by its own weight. The atmospheric pressure acting again, the towingdtube draws the train to which it is attached. To suspend the progress of the train, they avoid opening the cocks, by raising the supports ; to stop or neutralise the speed, they employ breaks; to retro grade, they open the valve of the to wing tube which was shut, and shut the other valve which was open And the other is the invention of a Mr. John I ken, patented in England last year. The following is a description of the leading characteristics" In the construction of atmospheric railways, the air from the traction pipe (as is well known) is removed by means of air pumps; and some difficulty has been experienced in getting out the air, so as to obtain a good vacuum, in consequence of the air at each succeeding stroke of the pumps getting more and more rarefied. Now, the object of this invention is, in the first place, to obtain the required vacuum, by causing the traction pipes to be filled with water, and then allowing the same to escape through the eduction pipes, from 32 to 33 feet long; by which means a better vacuum can be obtained in the traction pipes than by the aid of air pumps. The object of the second part of this invention is to obtain a more perfect air tight covering for the longitudinal valve of the traction pipe, by covering such valve, and also the pipe, with water, for the purpose of retaining the vacuum obtained thereinBridgesBut one patent has been granted for improvements in bridges, which consists in a modification of one of the known modes of camberingthe truss frames. Heretofore this has been effected, in some bridges, by tension rods extending from the foot of one post to the top of the next, inclining in opposite directions from the middle of the bridge towards each end ; the rods being provided with screw nuts. And the modification consists in the addition of another set of tension rods crossing the first set, by means of which the inventor alleges that he can more effectually chamber any part of the truss than by the single set of rods, as previously used. I implements used in excavating earth, 8 c Several patents have been granted for machines or instruments for removing sand bars or s heals in rivers, &c; for excavating and removing earth, and for making ditches for irrigation and other similar purposes; but as they do not present any marked characteristics which can be made clear without drawings, I am under the necessity of omitting any description of them. Architecturemetal roofs For several years back, much attention has been directed to the construction of metal roofs, or metal coverings for wooden roofs; and during the past year two patents have been granted here, for improvements in the mode of applying metal coverings; and one in England, for making metal roofs. The first of these consists in attaching to the top surface of the rafters, from the eaves to the tip of the roof, a strip of sheet metal with the two edges turned up, and embraced by clefts failed to the sides of the rafters, so that these strips form gutters from the tip to the eaves of the roof. The edges of the sheets of metal, which constitute the covering of the roof, are secured by being tapped over the turned up edges of the strips ; and then the two are bent or tapped over, the one embracing the other, which effectually prevents all leakage. The second consists in securing to the wooden sheathing triangular seats of wood, in 501: 75 1 pairs parallel to each other, and extending from the eaves to the tip of the i roof; the space between each pair being equal to the width of a sheet of metal, and the two seats forming a pair being so far apart as to admit three or four thicknesses of metal. One or two strips of metal are secured to the wooden sheathing between the two seats of a pair, the sheet of metal on each side is bent over, the turn edge being inserted between the sat and the strip of metal, the upper edge of which is then bent or tapped over the sheet. In this way, each pair of seats, and strip or strips of metal, between and tapped over the sheets, forms a ridge from the eaves to the till of the roof. And the mode of making iron roofs consists simply in having the iron rafters extending from the eaves to the tip of the roof grooved, to receive he edges of the sheets of metal, which are bent and properly secured therein. I reproof ceilings patent has been granted for making fire proof ceilings, by means of iron baths, which consist of strips of sheet iron, with the edges turned in towards the middle, to form a dove tail drove attached to iron rafters placed diagonal y across the. room, to prevent (as the inventor states) the expansion and contraction from cracking the ll staring; the mortar, or plaster, is held between the turned edges of the baths. Under some circumstances, and with the view of giving additional strength, another set of baths, similarly formed, are secured   i e dfihirstset, and crossing them, to receive another layer of plaster or motor on top, which, uniting with te layer below, adds strength to the whole. Doorsan improved mode of hanging large double doors, called sliding doors, has lately been patented and introduced in Philadelphia. It consists in hanging them, by means of stirrups and rollers, to an iron bar in the partition above the door, so as to avoid the use of a ra i on the floor, and prevent all injury to the carpeting6LAND Conveyance. In the construction of carriages, several patents have been granted for the following devices: A mode of connecting the front axle trade with the body, by a modification of what is sometimes called the 'fifth l wheel, "which consists of a horizontal circular plate attached to the upper surface of the axle tree, in the form of a cross, the outer ends of it wo :f if its arms being so formed as to embrace the rim of the wheel, to aid the king bolt in forming the connexion; and the other two arms, which rest on and are bolted to the axle tree, being bent down, that the axle tree, may rock to a certain extent before these arms come in contact with the under face of the wheel: For a mode of connecting and b racing the elliptical springs on the front and back axle trees, by means of two semiellipticsprings, jointed to the two sets of springs, and connected together by stirrups and a s wives screw, to regulate the tension of the connecting and b tracing springs: For an improvement in spring perches; and for a modification of the well known mode of forming the connexion between the body and the running gear, by means of levers jointed to the body, the springs being attached to the body instead of the frame. Under the v present. arrangement, the springs being within the seat, and the connexion formed between the levers and the frame being by means of er asked axles, one of which is permitted to rock, and both made reversible so as to place thecid127cranks up or down, and thus elevate or depress the body[ 75 1502Patents have also been granted for minor improvements in the boxes of carriage hubs; in the manner of connecting the hut with the rim, by so forming the spokes Is' to embrace the hut, instead of being inserted in it; and for methods of detaching the horses from carriages, by liberating the connexion between the traces and the swingletrees7MI Lls, And Machi   Nery Connected Therewi Of. Grinding mills The patents granted during the past year for mills are not very numerous, but exhibit some decided features of novelty; on which I will not undertake to express any opinion, leaving it to those engaged in filling to decide upon the merits of the alleged improvements ; for in this branch of mechanics practical experience is highly important to a proper judgment. Under one of these patents, it is proposed to have a dead spindle pass up through the bed stone, with a counter sink in its upper end to receive a point projecting from the under part of a " chuck" which is grooved out around the point, to receive the rim on the end of the dead spindle formed by the counter sink. The under side of the bale, which is attached to the eye of the runner, has also a point which rests in a counter sink in the upper surface of the chuck, to balance the runner; and the upper part of this bale is adapted to receive the spindle. Another is for a mode of dressing the stones, in which about one half the surface of the bed stone, from the periphery inwards, is smooth, with the exception of a radial groove, to act as a spot for the discharge of the flour; that part of the face of the runner corresponding with this being provided with lands, about eight in number, and inclined the reverse of those on the other portions of the face. It is also proposed, under another patent, to dress the stones in curved lines, instead of straight; and to make the eye of the runner conical; and to connect the bridge tree (on which the runner rests) and the mouth of the hop per with a centrifugal governor so that when the velocity of the runner is increased beyond a certain range, the feeding is reduced, and the runner elevated, to reduce the pressure on the grain. One among the objections which have been advanced against that class of grinding mills in which the grinding surface is cylindrical, is the difficulty of setting the grinding surfaces for grinding coarse or fine ; for one of the surfaces being a semi cylindrical concave, as this is drawn from the cylinder, the separation is much greater in the middle of the concave than at the top and bottom. To avoid this difficulty, a patent has been granted for setting or regulating the grinding surfaces by rotating the concave about an imaginary centre, eccentric to the axis of the grinding cylinder; by means of which, the whole of the concave is equally separated from the cylinder. Two patents have been granted for improvements in mills for grinding corn with the cobs, by an arrangement of cutters to cut the cobs into slices preparatory to the action of the teeth. In one of these there is a knife attached to, and moving with the spindle, and four attached to the bed stone, and projecting within the eye, at equal distances apart, and arranged tangentally to a circle smaller than the eye of the mills tone; the mill running horizontally. And in the other, which runs vertically, the corn and cob s 503 [a[ 73 are fed in through a hole in the fixed grinder, about midway between the centre and the periphery, which is provided with a bed c utter; there being two corresponding cutters on the runner, and the faces of both grinder s being provided with teeth, to divide the slices formed by the cutters preparatory to the grinding. These patents are limited to modifications of a mill previously patented for cutting and grinding. It is a matter of great importance to have the runner of a mill work very true; for, without this, good flour cannot be obtained ; and, therefore, much attention has been given to the construction of the bush of the bed stone through which the spindle passes, so as to insure this end, and prevent the wear by keeping it properly oiled, without the necessity of removing the runner, and, when worn, to tighten the bush and retain the central position of the spindle. Within the last year, two patents have been added to the large number before granted. One of them is for adjusting the bush The bush is made in wedge formed segments, with a rod extending down from each segment, and passing through and being secured to a plate below, by means of nuts above and below, for the purpose of adjusting each segment separately; and, for the adjustment of the whole together, this plate is suspended, by means of seven rods and nuts, from the box of the bush And the other is for adjusting and oiling. At the bottom of the bush case there are two thick leather washers, which are kept tight around the spindle by means of a large screw nut, through which it passes, and the oil is supplied from a reservoir within the nut. Jolting flour t is proved by experience that the flour sometimes adheres to the rotating bolter; and to prevent this, long b eaters are jointed to the arms, which, in vibrating from one set of arms to the other, jar the bolter, and prevent the flour from adhering. Dark mills With the view to increase the grinding surface of these mills, and to insure a better action, a patent has been granted for forming the mill of several concentric rings, connected together by means of radial bar sat the top, for the fixed or bed grinder; and at the bottom, for the runner. The concentric rings of the runner work between those of the fixed or bed grinder; the teeth being formed on the inner and outerperipheries of the rings, and the upper edges armed with cutters, to cut the bark into large pieces before the grinders begin to act. Governors for regulating the velocity of machinery Under a a tent lately granted, it is proposed to substitute for the governors now generally employed, inclined or spiral vanes on a vertical shaft, working within a vessel containing water or other fluid. This shaft is capable of sliding up and down in its bearings, and is connected with any piece of machinery to be regulated in the usual manner. From this arrangement, it must be evident that an increased velocity of the shaft will cause the vanes to meet with an increased resistance in passing through the water, and by their inclination to rise, and thus reduce the velocity of the moving parts, and vice versa. Horse powers for driving machinery Several patents have been granted for modifications of the moving parts of these machines, with the view of condensing the whole into a smaller compass, to prevent the cogwheels and other parts from breaking and from other accidents, and to reduce the cost of constructing them ; all of which are important, when we: 75 ]504 consider how extensively these machines are used in every part of thee country, and particularly amongst the farmers, with whom first cost and durability are essential considerations8MACHI   Nery For Manufacturi  Of And Worki Of Lumber. Saw mills is a means of dispersing with the weight of the saw gate in saw miss, which is considered objectionable, the saw has been attached to a sliding block at top and bottom, and therefore depending upon its stiffness, instead of the tension given to it by screws when applied in agate. To combine the advantages of both methods, a patent has been granted for a straining" the saw, (as it is termed in technical language without the use of a gate, by attaching a piston to each slide; the two pistols working in appropriate cylinders connected together by a steam pipe, so as to use the elastic force of steam to strain the saw. The elastic force of the steam does not impede the motion, as it is equal on both pistons, and therefore balanced. The difficulty of making circular saws of sufficient diameter to cut through large logs was attempted to be remedied some years ago, by using two saws, one above the other, each cutting half way through the log. As an alleged improvement on this, a patent has been granted for using several saws, above and below; each succeeding one being of greater diameter, so as to make the entire cut by a series of cuts, instead of a single or double one. Several patents have been granted for various modes of arranging the head and tail blocks of saw mills, to render them self setting. The great variety of devices for this purpose, which have been patentee and are in public use, is matter of astonishment, and is evidence of the great resources of mechanical ingenuity. Some of those patented during the past year are for so connecting the slides of the head and tail blocks, on which the log rests, as to move both ends of the log by the same operation, and yet enable the two blocks to be moved nearer to or farther from each other, for logs of different lengths ; others, for arrangements of parts for lifting the log vertically, that the slides, on which it rests during nearly the whole operation, may be moved the required distance on a set of inclined planes so located and arranged that, when the log is again permitted to rest on them, its weight will cause the whole to slide the required distance for the thickness of a plank. And, again, others are for modes of setting the tail end of the log by a slow gradual motion, (the length of the log admitting of this) and the head end by liberating a weight connected with a lever and axillary parts, by which the desired effect is produced the moment the saw runs out of the log. These are the general characteristics; but the other arrangements, covered by other patents, could not be made clear without drawings. Taking singles and clapboardsI improvements in this class of machines have also been patented during the past year. One of them is for arrangements of the parts of the machinery for moving the carriage to present the block to the action of a circular saw, and to shift the position of the block at the end of each operation, and preparatory to a new cut this arrangement being simply a modification of the method heretofore employed for these purposes. Two others are for improvements applied to that class of machines in which the singles are cut by means of a ree05ciprocating c utter attached to and moving with a sliding gate; aid are for modifications of the mode of feeding or presenting the block to the action of the c utter in such manner as to cut the butt alternately from opposite ends of the blocks. And in another, the cutters are attached to the periphery of a hollow cylinder, connected with the shaft by means of arms. The throat of the c utter, through which the single, when cut, passes, is made in the cylinder; so that the single is discharged inside of the cylinder, there being a curved guide to carry it out at the end of the cylinder, between the arms. Taking states, and of her parts of barrels, 4cSeveral patents have been granted for improvements in this branch of industry. In one of these n machines, the stavesaarecut, by means of reciprocaling cutters, foamyblocksof wood previously steamed to prevent cracking, in manner varying , but very little from machines previously known, but by which: the operation will be facilitated ; and the heads are formed with both be ve seat the same time, by means of sections ;of saws attached to the he periphery and face ofamandrel, the heading being presented to this instrument in an i inclined position, and turned by the i hand of the attendant, so, as to present every part of the circumference in succession. In another, the states, after being prepared in the usual way, are bent and held together at the ends by two. circular :plates and two ;man drops, and turned off by means of a c utter, which moves from end to end in a curve corresponding with the bile of the barrel after being thus turned it is put i into a hollow chuck, and the those and how el turned. Two machines have also been .patented for ,splitting and shaving hoop poles, which are presented to the edge of the splitting and shaving knives by means of rollers so arranged and connected asitoenablethe pole to yield in any direction, and present the knife to follow the grain of the wood. Lathes for during wood, *c patent have been: granted for afiodification of Blanchards well known machine ;for turning irregular i forms, in which the pattern and the piece of wood to be turned are put i upon :opposite sides of a rocking frame, and the pattern and re utter I when. on ri carriage that has but one motion f from end to end. -in the :oueltterearriagethere is a rocking shaft, with a pattern wheel on one end, and a burr: eutteronthe other, to smooth or finish the work. Another patent hast also been granted for another imadfication of this machine of Blanchards, to adapt it to the turning of oars and similar work. The pattern in this machine is made in two parts the handle and the blade; the former, which is round, being permanent, and the other turning; and to the carriage, which carries the pattern and c utter wheel, there is attached, by a movable catch, another that carries a rest or support for the oar, which, on account of its great length, cannot be :turned without and as this rest or support cannot be carried along the. blade or irregular part of the oar at the proper time, the two carriages are disconnected, and the c utter carriage moves on to the end, whilst the rest remains at the end of the handle or round part. A very ingenious machine has been patented for turning or forming scythe s baths. The cutters are connected with the inner periphery of a wheel, in such manner as to be moved towards and from the centre as the piece of wood, previously bent to the proper curve, is introduced and carried through, and its direction changed to correspond with the curvature. Patents have also been granted for modifications of machines, before 75] 506 known, for turning spools, whip handles, and other articles. By an arrangement of rotating cutters and circular saws, lately patented, it is proposed to make boxes for matches. Other patents have also been granted for minor improvements in machines for cutting match splints, mortisingand boring wood, and other operations connected with the working of lumber, which, not possessing any distinctive character, cannot be noticed here9FI Of Arms And I Mplements Of War. But three patents have been granted in this class: two of them for modifications of previously known modes of loading small arms at the breech, by making the rear part or breech of the barrel separate. In one of them, this separate section turns on a pin parallel with the axis of the bore, and at the side; so that, by turning on this pin, the section can be lifted up, charged, and let down again. And in the other, that end of the movable section which unites with the main portion of the barrel lifts up, as in Walls rifle ; the patent being granted for an arrangement of parts to throw it up and down, and to insure its retention in line with the bore when down. The third patent is for an alleged improvement in the mode of making large wrought iron guns, by means of a series of rings or hoops, screwed into each other, to form the inner periphery or bore, over which another series of rings are screwed, breaking joints with the first; and, in this manner, adding a third, fourth, or any other number, to increase the thickness. Several applications for patents were made, during the past year, for making this class of guns, by means of states and hoops, or rings, which were rejected for the want of novelty; this mode having been the first adopted when cannons were first made, and finally abandoned as worthless. It is to be regretted that those who have applied their minds and means to make improvements in the construction of large guns of wrought iron have not first acquainted themselves with the properties of iron, and the various changes which it undergoes whilst under the action of the fire and hammer; for there is probably no branch of the arts that requires more experience and judgment, aided by science, than the working of iron, particularly when applied to ordnance; and yet persons wholly unacquainted with the subject undertake to dictate to men of experience and science 10- Of  Scellaneous. The sweeping of streets by machinery has, for a few years past, attracted much attention by its importance as a sa native question ; and several machines for this purpose have been patented and reduced to practice in this country and in Europe. During the past year, another patent was granted for one which appears to have much merit. It consists of a set of curved brooms, that are moved around a shaft horizontally, and care the dirt to one side of the street, and then rise up to deposit e it in wind rows. The mechanism of the moving parts is ingenious and simple, and not liable to be der a need. I have seen a full size operative machine, and have no doubt that it will succeed to the satisfaction of the ingenious inventor. Several o their patents have been granted for miscellaneous articles, such 507 as traps for the catching of animals, modes of curling and un curling a wings for shielding dwellings from the action of the sun, and arrangements of nets for catching fish. I have thus presented to your consideration a rapid sketch of the chief characteristics of the inventions made, or rather brought to maturity, during the past year. This mass of ingenuity, presented to the world in the short space of twelve months, would, to the student of antiquity, appear marvellous nay, fabulous; but not so to the student of modern progress, whose mind has been schooled to the rapid progress of the useful under the ind active system. It is a matter of surprise th'at society at large, which has been and must continue to be so much benefited by inventions and the progress of the useful arts, should pay so little attention to this subject. The fruits of the labors of inventors are enjoyed and recognised by the world at large, but the authors of all these benefits pass through the world unnoticed, and inmost cases un rewarded. It is to be regretted that literary men do not turn their attention to the progress of the useful, and, with the pen of fancy, add ornament and beauty to the solid edifice. The preceding sketch presents a striking fact worthy of consideration. The branches of the arts which have been in a prosperous condition during the past two years (as, for instance, cotton manufactures) have received a smaller number of contributions from inventors than those which have been in a depressed state, (as civil engineering) This state of things corresponds with a striking fact which I have long since observed. The master spirits, looking through the present to the future, have made their great leading inventions in all countries, and in all ages, especially with a view to force a change in the condition of society; while secondary minds have adapted their labors to the demands of the existing state of things the one leading, the other following. But the American character seems to be an exception to this general rule; and whether this be the effect of our institutions, of our vast extent of territory, or of both, is difficult to decide; but that such is the fact, must be evident to all. I improvements in the other countries keep pace with the general state of things they rise with prosperity, and sink with adversity; whilst; here, it is the converse of the proposition. There, they seem to be the effects of prosperity; and here, the causes. To closely has this been observed, that, without any other source of information, the condition of the various branches of industry could be ascertained from the archives of the Patentoffice. All of which is respectfully submitted. Charles M. Keller, Examiner of Patents. On. H. L. Ellsworth, Commissioner of Patentsc75508g. Report of Charles G. Age, Examiner, ce. Patent Offi Of, January, 1845. Of    R : In conformity with your requisitions, I have the honor, here with, to submit a brief review of the progress of the arts and sciences as far as they are embraced under the subjects allotted to me for examination, during the past year. Since the commencement of the year 1844, I have reported to you the results of my examinations upon 64 4 applications for patents; 309 of this number i have been patented in whole or in part, and the remaining 335 1 rejected. There are 22 classes or divisions of applications for patents; .each class0omprehending subdivisions, an grunting, in many of the classes, to upwards 0.

Agri  Culture69 Patents Granted. The large number of patents granted for applications pertaining to this class may be taken, as fair ground for the deduction that the subject is still one of great growing interest, and is at present engrossing a very large share of the inventive talent of our country. In the short space of one year, it could hardly be expected that any important revolution, any signal discovery, or many really useful inventions, should be made in a pursuit claiming, above all others, the right of primogeniture. Advances, nevertheless, are constantly being made in this branch of indus509try. Very year it is acquiring fresh laurels and a higher reputation for itself. The i sweat of the brow" is not now the mainspring of itsoperatifori the grand key to its success; nor the open field the sole theatre of experiment. The closet, the laboratory of the chemist, are its nurses. The most exalted intellects are becoming farmers, as it were, i the retire cy of their studies. Science, both chemical and physical, have become the pal radium of agriculture. Since the publication of Liebigs valuable work on the chemistry of agriculture, we must date a new era in this science. It has, at least, received a fresh impulse from his labors; and its publication in this country, in newspaper form, for the low price of 25 cents, (when the ordinary book store price has been -1 50,) will aid greatly in disseniinatihng knowledge, s6essentialto farming interests. The use of guai no* as a manure has long been known in remote parts of the world, and this substance has been employed for many years to fertilizes the barren soils on the coast of Peru; but it does not seem to have elicited attention, other than as a matter of curiosity, from the most enlightened agricultural portions of the world, until after the appearance of Liebigs work. The announcement that it was only necessary to add a small quantity of gun no to a soil which consists of nothing but sand and clay, to procure the richest crop of maize, was sufficient to awaken an interest in the farmer, and excite the cupidity of the merchant. To writer has dwelt so much on the importance of nitrogen as a manure, as Lie big; and it is this feature, in part, which constitutes the grand novelty and value of his work. In the above quoted assertion, where gun no is added to clay and sand, we suppose not a trace of organic matter in the soil; and yet, by the addition of a manure, consisting chiefly of urate, phosphates, carbonate, andoxalate of ammonia salts, all containing nitrogen, we have the richest crops of maize. The husbanding of substances containing nitrogen, and attention to the proper methods for its fixation, will soon become objects of paramount importance with the farmer. Ploughsseveral important improvements have been made in this instrument during the past year; but they are chiefly for modes of fastening and so fitting the points and shares, that, in case of wear or injury, they can be easily replaced by the farmer himself. It is a question, perhaps, yet to be decided, whether cast iron ploughs are more economical to the farmer than the ploughs with cast iron mould boards and wrought shares and points. In the later, the mould board is liable to be broken, and, if so, can hardly be replaced; but, as the share and point are the parts most liable to injury, if these are wrought iron, and fastened in a simple and firm manner, the farmer who is in the neighborhood of an ordinary blacksmith, or may have one upon his establishment, can easily repair the damage, which, in the case of the cast iron plough, he could not do without sending to the manufacturer or the foundry for a new casting. His* Pua no is the putrid excrement of sea birds, and is obtained in large quantities from islands in the Pacific ocean, which are visited by immense flocks of these birds during their breeding season. The islands are covered to the depth of several feet with this material, and are now visited by large numbers of ships from various parts of the world; and, within a -few :months, several large cargoes have been brought into our principal ports, and met with a ready sale. Among some interesting facts connected with this new species of trade, we see it stated that, while digging the gun no, the body of a man has been dis inter red, and found in an excellent state of preservation ; and that eggs are frequently found in a good condition, which must have been buried for years. If true, these facts must call up some entirely new principle in chemical science ; for, according to Liebigs doctrine of eremacausis, and even common experience, one would hardly look upon put re scent excrement as a preservation of animal tissues 75 5' 10 objection to the cast iron plough is now, in a great measure, obviated by many dealers, who are in the practice of putting up with each plough, for a slight extra expense, two or more extra points and shares. New ploughs have been patented during the past year. Several applications have been made for patents for the substitution of steel for cast or wrought iron in ploughs, and rejected upon the well established ground that the mere substitution of one well known material for another is not the subject of a patent. Several cultivates and combined ploughs for light soils have been patented; but nothing of definite value can be predicted upon this glass of inventions. An ingenious instrument for digging <a name="potatoes605"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> has been the subject of a patent, and, though it may fail to do all it professes, is certainly an approximation to an invention very much needed. His operation is one of vast labor; and a cheap labor saving machine, which, in case of very large crops, should leave one tenth, or even a larger proportion of the crop in the ground, would be a welcome invention. A promising improvement has been made in the grain cradle, by making the teeth of hollow metal, filling them up with wood sufficiently far to insure strength. The teeth glide very easily through the grain, and are not liable to the objection of warning and sticking where the grain is wet, as is the case with wooden teeth. A simple and effective instrument for gathering fruit from trees has been patented, by which the ladder may be generally dispensed with, and the trees and fruit saved from injury. Some important improvements have been made in smut machines, and in machines for pulling <a name="seeds167"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. The wheat fan, or win no wing machine, has been of late much improved by the use of the spiral fan in the place of the old flutter wheel fan; and, although the introduction of the spiral fan is not recent, yet it has, during the past year, been introduced under such modifications as to render the instrument very serviceable. In connexion with this instrument also, an interesting and useful feature has been secured by patent, consisting of a mode of so operating the screens or sieges as to give just that motion which is imparted to them when they are used in the hand. See hives growing interest is evident in this branch of agriculture, and a large number of applications have been received. Even of them have been patented, and a greater number rejected. Most of the alleged improvements have claimed to be remedies against the bee moth, the pest of the agrarian. As bee culture increases, the bee moth seems to become more numerous and troublesome, and should therefore be vigorously met by vigilance and ingenuity. In this latitude, it requires every attention to save the bees from this their great enemy ; and so formidable has it become from numbers, that the same devices which may, perhaps, be found to give protection further north, will not apply here. Nothing yet seems to be of any value, except placing the hives upon the ground the hives being made very tight, and the entrance of the bees being as low as possible. Chemi  Stry27 Patents Granted. One of the most interesting applications in this branch during the past year, is one for silvering looking glasses, for which letters patent have been granted. The invention consists in the substitution of a coating of silver for quick silver in the preparation of glass mirrors. It has been pub 511 [a[ 75 ]lily announced that the Rothschilds had offered 100,000 for the suppression of this discovery; but the deformity of the amount, and the proverb i al intelligence of that house, preclude the presence of the credulousto such a report. It has been for some time known that al de hyde (which, in chemistry, means alcohol minus hydrogen) possessed the property of precipitating silver from its oxides in metallic for a by the aid of heat; and that a glass tube such, for instance, as a test tube might be coated with silver on its inner surface, by heating in it, over a spirit lamp, certain salts of silver in conjunction with al de hyde. Such a process would, of course, be inapplicable to mirrors; but the patentee has invented means of effecting the perfect reduction of the silver by al de hyde, without the aid of heat. The most important result of this discovery will be found in its bearing upon the health of those concerned in the manufacture of looking glasses. By the usual process of amalgam at ion, such quantities of mercury are used as to render the occupation extremely unhealthy an evil entirely remedied by the new process. The coating is even said to sur pass in reflecting power that usually employed, although this seems rather improbable. To specimens have yet been received at this office, although they have been represented as of great beauty. In the old process for silvering, or rather coating mirrors an amalgam of tin and mercury is laid upon the surface of clear plate glass; and this amalgam, when freed from the mercury by pressure, constitutes the reflecting surface. The extensive use of mercury in this operation renders it extremely unhealthy ; and the coating thus formed is liable to be de faced by chemical changes, as is frequently witnessed in the spots occurring upon the backs of mirrors. It is contended that the new invention obviates these difficulties. The process for coating the glass with silver is substantially as follows: The glass is carefully cleaned, laid upon a table, and a rim of wax, or some suitable substance, raised around its borders. A solution of silver is then poured upon the glass, a little ammonia added, and, from time to time, a little oil of russia and alcohol ; after which, oil of c loves is added, when precipitate on commences, and a pure and firm coating of silver is formed upon the glass, which is afterwards carefully dried and protected from injury. I india rubber fabric she great value of caoutchouc in the arts has led to a great variety of devices to overcome those difficulties experienced on its first introduction, viz: a speedy mode of dissolving, and a speedy mode of drying the solution. To solvent has ever been obtained better than thecaoutchoucine, a liquor prepared by the destructive distillation of the caoutchouc itself; but the great expense of the solvent precludes its introduction at present, and turpentine is generally used as the most economical solvent. A great difficulty has hitherto been experienced in drying the rubber when turpentine was the solvent; but this seems now to be entirely overcome, and chiefly by the aid of sulphur. Unfortunately for this invention, the greater part of the fabrics prepared of I india rubber are for wearing apparel; and the smell of the sulphur, which is retained for an indefinite time, is a serious objection to their common use. As a subject of special interest, and one which has made great advances during the past year, we may cite the invention for manufacturing corrupted or stirred I india rubber fabrics. By this is understood that species of goods or fabric which is now in extensive use for suspendeds, and all kinds of straps where elasticity is a desirable property. The invention mainly consist[ 7& 512 in stretching threads of I india rubber to their utmost tension, or nearly so, and enclosing these threads between two layers of cloth of any kind, as taste may dictate ; the layers of cloth are made to adhere firmly to the threads by means of I india rubber cement, the whole being passed between heavy rollers, to secure a perfect union. As soon as the fabric has become firm and dry, the I india rubber threads are allowed to contract, which draws the cloth into wrinkles; and hence the name of corrupted or stirred goods. The material thus prepared serves a great variety of purposes is made into shoes or slippers, and is introduced in every part of wearing apparel. The threads of I india rubber have also been woven into loose fabrics, producing a better article than the foregoing, though at present more expensive. Caoutchouc, or I india rubber, may be regarded as a highly valuable gift to man, and it is sincerely hoped that the culture of the tree yielding this substance may succeed in the southern portions of our country. From it are made many valuable surgical instruments : it makes the life preserver for the marine r, the gas holder for the chemist, affords protection to the invalid and delicate in health, enters largely intothe composition of valuable varnishes, paces the stables of royalty, serves as roofing to buildings, and a vast variety of purposes both of comfort and economy. Pal eratusThis article, so useful to the housekeeper in the making of bread, sweet ening of milk, accelerateing the churning of cream, &c, is usually made by forcing an extra quantity of carbonic acid gas into the carbonate of potash a. One of the common modes of doing this, is to suspend the carbonate of potash a in suitable vessels over the fermenting liquor in distilleries and brewer is. The process of ferment at ion fills the vats with an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas, which, combining with the carbonate, gives us the super carbonate of potash a, or sal arat us. Owing to the abandonment of the business by a large number of distillers, a considerable source of the supply of this article is cut off; and the inventor proposes, as a substitute, to impregnated the salt by means of the carbonic acid from a common anthracite coal fire. Salt making Two patents have been granted for improvements in this process; in both of which the bring is heated at the surface, instead of the usual mode of applying heat at the bottom of the kettle. It is a well known feature in crystal ligation, that rest or quiet among the particles of a solution insures the formation of large and pure crystals. The agitation consequent upon heating a liquid at its lowest portion interferes with the regular formation of crystals, and the salt is deposited in crude and irregular masses. In one of the two last mentioned patents, the heat is applied over the surface of the bring by means of tubes conveying steam in the other, ingenious contrivances are resorted to for lowering or raising these tubes, according to the height of the surface of the liquid. Evaporation must of course proceed very slowly in these operations; but if purity of the salt is desired, it is thus attained. Sugarvery important improvements have been introduced in sugar making, and some inventions patented during the year 1843 have been put to the test during the past year. And if reports which have come casually to this office are true, they must be of great value to the inventors, and of the highest importance to the Southern portions of our country. The improvements are three fold being in the economy of fuel, evaporating thesirups, and granulation of the sugar. I important improvements have also been made in the modes of felt ration. In one of these, the sir up, or, in 513 deed, any liquid to be filtered, is run into the centre of a cylinder filled withpulverized charcoal, or other filtering material; the cylinder being kept in rapid revolution, the liquor is forced through perforations on its outer surface by centrifugal action. The experiments with the corns talk sugar have been prosecuted with promising success, and it is likely to become a profitable occupation. Lardthe separation of the two proximal e constituents of land, viz blaine and s tearing, or, in common phraseology, land oil and candle stuff, has been for several years an object of pursuit, and is now accomplished in a very perfect manner. The chemical processes described in my last report for separating these substances seem to have been in a great measure superseded by mechanical agency ; pressure, when applied in a certain manner, being found fully to answer the purpose. The most valuable improvement, and one for which a patent has been granted, is the application of pressure to the solid tissues containing fat, before they have been burned or, rather, over heated) in the process of trying out, as it is called. Heard and oil produced in this way are purer, sweeter, keep much better in the warm climates, and are rendered in large quantities. A foreign patent has been granted for purifying oils, particularly for soap oils, by forcing air through them when in a heated state. Lampblacka mode of making lamp black has been patented; which, it is asserted, produces a inch larger quantity from a given weight of resin than the old method, in which the smoke from the burning resin was carried through long chimneys, and condensed upon bags or mats that portion of the smoke passing out of the chimney which would have made the finest carbon or lamp black. In the new process, the smoke is received in a very large apartment and condensed upon the walls and floor, from which it is brushed off when sufficiently accumulated. The apartment is made tight, and without ventilation ; and the calculation is so made, that the amount of oxygen in the air of the room will be more than sufficient to consume all the resin which is put into the furnace. As soon as one burning is over, and the smoke all condensed, the windows are opened, a fresh supply of air admitted, and the operation again repeated. Music. The i olin piano, which is a combination of the instrument well known as the accord ion with the piano for te, has attracted much attention, and, if reports are true, the inventor is reaping a rich reward. Attempts were made many years ago to effect this combination, but without success. The inventor has so arranged the operating parts of the two instruments, that the piano for te movement is not at all interfered with in operating the accord ion. The action of the piano and accord ion are made simultaneous, at the will of the performer, by a very simple contrivance. The instruments are well adapted for situations where injuries, very likely to happen to the accord ion, are easily repaired; and where the proprietor or performer is enabled to tune the piano by the accord ion the pitch of which is not so apt to change under the influences of moisture, changes of temperature, and frequent use, as the strings of the piano. The piano has, for several years past, been very much improved, particularly in the touch or movement, and by the introduction of cast metal frames to sustain the strings; giving greater stability of pitch and improved tones. The piano may, perhaps, take rank next to the violin, as a musical instrument affording opportunity for the exercise of taste ana skill ; but genius is not 3[ 75 ]514 satisfied with the piano as it is, and is bent upon increasing its capabilities to suit the diversities of taste, and place it at the head of the list as an instrument of versa tile powers. Within a few days, a patent has been granted for a mode of producing the harmony c tones upon the piano, by connecting with a pedal an apparatus which shall make a slight pressure upon the middle of the string: thus giving the harmony c oct ave. The pressure is made to imitate, as nearly as possible, that of the finger in producing these exquisite tones upon other stringed instruments. \a\ Pressure upon other nodes of the strings would of course produce harmony c tones; but the inventor is satisfied with the harmony c octavos. A patent has been granted for the combination of the glass i chord with the piano; and in the same connexion an improvement has been made in the tones of the glassichorditself, by a more elastic mode of suspending the strips of glass than has been before used. Calori  Of 54 Patents Granted. Any of the patents under this class are of a useful purport; but the subject has been run so threadbare, from the immense number of patents hitherto granted, that but little chance is left for the display of genius. I n regard to stoves, there is much diversity of opinion as to their comparative economy; and the domestic regulation of families, and their peculiar and distinct wants, growing out of difference of circumstances, requiring so many varieties in this article of furniture, that the number of models of this invention far exceeds any other in the office. To the casual observer the inspection of this class in the model room might appear as offering promise of a patent for every change of form that could be devised, and a precedent for the same liberality of action in every other class of inventions but, from the nature of the invention, the patent able features are, in a large majority of cases, out of sight, and within the stove. A large number of applications for patents for stoves have been rejected, as presenting nothing more than mere changes of form. Fireplacesa patent has been granted for a peculiar construction of fireplace, in which the inventor proposes to obviate the smoking by so constructing the chimney, in building the house, that a current of air, brought from out of doors, descends in a sheet the entire length of the arch of the fireplace, and comes down obliquely forward, in front of the fire. Patent has also been granted for a mode of curing smoke chimneys; the substance of which consists in dropping the back of the fireplace about six inches below the arch, and enlarging the throat above the arch. The inventor contends that neither of these features alone would cure the defect but their combination is essential to the result. Several improvements have been made in the construction of lamps, for preventing the overflowing and leakage of oil about the cap and wick tube a serious inconvenience with all hand lamps. The foundation of the several improvements is found in a patent granted for an oil fee der, in which the same evil was obviated. The improvement seems to be of little avail in the glass hand lamps, as they are very apt to leak at the junction of the metallic cap and the body of the lamp. Whether the leakage is here owing to the per me ability of the cement by oil, or to carelessness in cementing the cap to the lamp, the manufacturers can best decide; but certain it is, that a large majority of the glass lamps offered for sale even those 515 75 ]provided with the improved cap are unfit for delicate fingers to handle. The improvement consists mainly in providing a cap of considerable capacity, about the base of the wick tubes, to catch the oil that flows over by the capillary action of the wick ; but, as oil finds its way so readily between metallic surfaces, even when pressed very tightly together, it becomes necessary to provide against the leakage between the threads of the' screw, by which the cap is fitted to the lamp. This has been effected by placing the cap with its screw entirely within the cup for catching the waste oil. It the bottom of the cup is a small hole, serving to supply the lamp with air, and return to the lamp any oil caught by the cup. In metallic lamps, there being no other joint than this within the cup, the remedy is perfect but the improvement will be of no avail in glass lamps, until some means are devised of securing the caps to the glass to prevent leakage. Under the head of cal orifice, has been included a patent for a reflect or for light houses; though, strictly speaking, it is an optical instrument. The mirror is of placed copper, struck up in the usual carbolic form, and covered with thin glass, conforming in shape to the mirror. Silver exposed to the air in almost any situation soon tar wishes, principally from the action of sulphur; but when exposed to sea air slackens very rapidly, from the action of the chlorine of the sea water. Consequently, silvered mirrors in light houses require frequent cleaning ; and, from the coarse materials employed usually in such places, they soon become de faced and worn out. The advantages promised from the improvement are: 1st, that the silvered surface of the mirror, being entirely protected from the air, is always bright, aid is thus saved from injury and wear by rubbing; and 2d, that, from this circumstance, the amount of silver used in plating may be much diminished, so as even to admit of galvanic plating. Some patents have been granted for land lamps; but thus far no hand lamps have been found to burn land well, without some contrivance for keeping the land near the top of the wick. The complication of such contrivances, and their liability to get out of order, render such lamps too expensive. The devices for conducting the heat of the flame downwards into the land are still resorted to; though it is entirely nugatory to bring a conducting body into the flame for this purpose, as the shadow cast by the conductor, and its refiigerating effect upon the flame, render such lamps useless. *the art of elect romping has not been before the office as the subject of application for a patent; but several specimens of silver plating upon iron work for harness show a highly improved condition of the art of plating by the galvanic method. The art promises to be ultimately of great value, though considerable difficulty has hitherto been experienced in laying on the precious metals to such a degree of thickness as to prevent acids and cor riding solutions from getting at the inferior metal underneath. The moment this takes place, the whole work is rapidly destroyed, the acid working under, and entirely removing the deposit e of gold or silver, and acting with greater energy upon the inferior metal, from the fact that it is in contact* Continued from class of chemist y, page 513. L w with a metal of and opposite electrical character, which forms a galvanic series, and facilitates the attack upon the most oxidizable metal. 'his art, sometimes called the galvanoplastic art, has been abused by the vicious for the purposes of counterfeiting the precious metals; but there can be no truth in the prevailing opinion that bank notes have been counter felted by the aid of this art, in conjunction with the Daguerreotype process. It is supposed that a bank note is first copied by the Daguerreotypeof the normal size of the note ; and the plate upon which the copy is thus taken is fetched by chemical action, and thus made to produce face si miles of the original' The difficulties in the way of such. a procedure are seemingly insuperable, and are as follows Firstly. To arrangement of lenses ever known can produce an image perfect in all its detail and proportions of the normal size of the object. Secondly. To process of itching a Daguerreotype impression has ever been devised to produce engravings equally perfect with the original. Thirdly. Bank note engraving is the most difficult of all kinds to imitate from the minuteness of detail ; and, lastly, as the ink required to produce a tolerable impression from an fetched Daguerreotype must be of a peculiar kind and color, there would be extreme difficulty in producing an imitation pass able even with the most ignorant. The first difficulty mentioned would alone be sufficient to quiet all fears upon this subject. The only danger to be apprehended is from electro type copies, the process of procuring which was described in my last report; but it the original engraved plate is well guarded, no evil can arise fro in this source. Cements, pigments, Act number of applications have been rejected, and several patented, for waterproof pigments and cements. The basis of most of them is one of the products of the destructive distillation of the coal in the gas works usually the naphthol in combination with the tar. These pigments are very useful in cases where insects are troublesome, as the odor of the naphthol is very noxious to almost all the insect tribe. Healing wax patent has been granted for combining with small sticks of sealing wax a composition which would igni te the wax by friction, saving the trouble of procuring a lamp to assist in sealing letters. Pressesmuch emulation has been displayed in this branch, particularly in presses for cotton ; and many of them have given evidence of great mechanical ingenuity, though it is" feared the complexity of some of the most beautiful presses will operate against their introduction. The great difficulty with most of the cotton presses has been a want of strength ; but, among the presses patented during the past year, it is believed that this condition has been answered, without rendering the presses too cumbrous and slow of action. Attempts have been made to use the direct action of steam upon a piston to move the plate n of the press, but without success. A patent has, however, been granted within a few days for a steam cotton press, which appears to do away with the difficulties found in all previous attempts. Devices have also been resorted to, for accommodation g the platon of the presses to bales of different sizes. For instance ; when more cotton than is sufficient to make a bale of a given size should happen to be put intothe press, the attempt to bring such a quantity to the usual size might strain or break the press; to guard against which, when the pressure reaches the amount of force for which the press is graduated, the plate n gives back, and saves the press. Several ingenious self acting presses, principally for pressing cheese, have been patented516cid12717 f ,a[ 7PrintingThis art, of the highest importance to man, though brought, as we presume, to a high degree of cultivation, is receiving every year such extraordinary accessions, that we are half inclined to place it in its earlieststageStereotyping has, during the last fifteen years, made scarcely any advance upon its original condition; but, but ing the past year, a very important improvement has been made in casting and finishing the type blocks, by which a very large number of plates may be cast at once and that, too, without marrying a single block. One principal feature consists in placing the moulds vertically, instead of the old mode of placing them in a horizontal position; and there are other important improvements in finishing the blocks, by planing and chiseling machines an operation heretofore performed by the use of hand tools. But the most striking improvement in this art is one made in Germany, and just announced in the public prints of making the stereotyped blocks of iron, instead of the usual type metal. If stereotyped plates can be made of cast iron, as stated, we must hail the invention as one of the most valuable of the age, as it will reduce the price of books to a very little above the cost of the material. It has been stated that, by means of the improvement, the whole Bible has been printed for about 25 cents. To official authentic at ion can be given of the above; but we are not much surprised at the announcement, knowing the wonderful perfection of Russian and German iron casting. Two signal improvements in printing presses have been patented during the year in one of which there are six pressing cylinders revolving about an axis, the cylinders being furnished with an ingenious arrangement of fingers, which seize the sheets of paper, carry them round and over the bed, perform the pressure, and deliver the sheets in a rapid and beautiful manner. The press requires four attendants, and delivers the sheets as fast as they can be fed in by the four. The other press is for printing the sheets on both sides, which it does before they are delivered, by an. admirable and very compact arrangement of the machinery. Perfect operating models of both the last named inventions were deposited in the office, affording ocular proof of their success. Booksevery thing tending to lessen the price of books must be looked upon as of the utmost consequence to mankind at large; and though the improvements in printing share the highest honors in the glorious work ofdisseminating knowledge, and carry the means of information to the doors of even the most in digest, yet it has its hand maid in paper making, and its hundreds of auxiliaries in other branches of science and art. Of paper making, the records of the office show nothing special, though intelligence has been received of the highest promise of success, from an invention reported last year, viz : making paper from the cane, growing so abundantly in the Southern portions of our country. An important improvement has been patented for making the backs of books, which must contribute considerably to abate their expense. The forming of the backs of books has heretofore been the slow work of the hands; but, by the invention before us, the book is passed through a machine which forms the back at once, and in a dura be and perfect manner. It is effected mainly by the pressure of a roller, having upon its periphery a concave surface, adapted to the convex it of the back of the book. I have thus taken a brief view of such inventions patented during the past year i as have borne, upon their front, features of striking novelty, thetT75 518 semblance of utility, and the promise of success, irrespective of my own humble judgment. A large number of patents have undoubtedly been secured, which will eventually be of value to the inventors and the public but, as time must prove them, nothing could be given but a mere synopticaltable; and I have endeavored to avoid any expression of opinions bearing prospectively upon patented inventions, but have rather repeated the promises and hopes of inventors, and added such animal versions as were derived from truths too palpable to escape notice. The character of the inventions presented during the past year has sustained the reputation of our nation for genius, enterprise, and search alter the useful. The yearly increase of applications points clearly to the illimitable nature of our duties, and the future magnitude of your department. Each novel and notable invention seems to introduce a family of cong enters, and gather early around itself a numerous offspring. To sooner was a novel feature introduced in presses during the last year, than four applications for improvements upon the same were made during the space of two months. To sooner were the Crotonwaterworks in operation, than genius was called upon to facilitate the introduction of the invaluable privilege, and expedite the enterprise; and a large number of applications have been made for inventions specially applicable to this purpose. Hundreds of such instances might be cited, but it would be a work ofsupererogation to show the interminable progression of science and art. The increase of mans wants is commensurate with the enlargement of the field of knowledge not such actual want or privation as is characterized in the abhor ism, necessity is the mother of invention' but something far happier, and more ennoblingthe want or desire of those means which shall gratify his thirst for knowledge, and place him in a higher sphere. It is true we might, in running over the annals of invention, reverse, in many cases, the ad age, and pronounce invention to be rather the mother of necessity, and tell of the un merited fate of many a poor inventor; but, still, with all our sympathy for him, there is yet this encouragement to offer to others that, in a large number of cases, genius meets with its true reward and to it mankind will be ever indebted, though they may sometimes forget or withhold regeneration.

I claim combining with the dipping box the vent tube c, proceeding from the cock a, as set forth, for the purpose of drawing off the volatile oil, without allowing of the escape of gas. James Crutchett. To, 3574. In the old revolving interest table there was a cylinder containing the interest, having the days and months stated at the head of each column (in 631 [a[ 75 ]stead of a dial and pointer) enclosed in a round paste board case or box, having an opening in front, with the principal passed on one side the cylinder being made to revolve, by turning the shaft of the lower end with the fingers; and therefore I wish it understood that I make no claim to any part of this arrangement. But what I do claim as my invention, and which I desire to secure by letters patent, is the before described combination of the revolving cylinder A, containing the vertical columns of numbers indicating the interests, with the permanent vertical scale c, showing the principal, and the dial D, representing the days and months for which the interests are to be ascertained, and the pointer E, operated in the manner and for the purpose set forth above, or in any other mode substantially the same, by which analogous results are produced. John Hatfi Eld. No. 3575.

Benjami  N Roop. No. 3576. I am fully aware that mould boards have been made with the lines straight, which are parallel to its base, but not parallel, as I believe, to the edge (u, s) of the board; and I am also aware that lines radiating from an assumed point have been applied to the forming of the face of a mould board such lines having been straight, or of such a curvature as may have been preferred by the maker; but such assumed radiating point has been below the base line of the mould board, and has consequently failed in effecting the purpose intended. I do, not therefore claim any thing new in the principle; but I do claim to have devised a mode of carrying out the principle upon which my mould board is formed, so as to have constructed an instrument more perfect in its action than any hitherto made. And I will here observe, that, whilst I have given such precise measurements and proportions as I have found, and verily believe, to be the best in practice, they may be deviated from to a slight extent, without essentially changing the construction of the improved plough. The radiating and parallel lines, for example, may be slightly curved, instead of being straight; the particular outline may also be in some degree changed; whilst the whole structure would remain substantially as described, and my right be as really violated as though such color able changes had not been made. Aaron Smi  Of. No. 3577. What I claim as my invention, and which I desire to secure by letters patent, is setting the end of the log, by causing the end of the slide upon which the log is do aged, as the carriage is rigged back, to come in contact with an inclined guide, which is again moved laterally toward the carriage the required distance, for another and similar set, as the carriage advances 75] 632 toward the saw, by means of a latch, or other similar append age, in contact with an inclined gauge, or adjustable level, attached to the slide carrying the aforesaid guide; in which position the said inclined guide and gage are held by a paw l attached to the said slide, dropping into a rack fixed on the frame of the mill, or other suitable place ; and this method of setting the log I claim, whether it be effected by the combination of parts above set forth, or any other substantially the same for producing like results. Sbenjami  N Webb. No. 3578. What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the above described mode of uniting the hut and the spokes by making the latter embrace the former, instead of being inserted, as heretofore done; by which arrangement the connexion between the hut and the rim of the wheel is stronger, and the hut is less liable to bend out of the central line, James Mccollum. No. 3579. I do not in this patent make any claim to the manner in which I attach the land side and mould board to each other; nor do I herein make any claim to the particular manner in which I form the face of the mould board, although these are fully represented and described in this specification; these improvements having been made the subjects of claims in an application for a patent for improvements in ploughs of cast iron, the oath appended to which application is dated on the 20th day of February in the present year, (1844) nor do I claim the placing of two mouldboardsuponone beam; nor the causing of the rear plough to throw its furrow slice upon that of the fore plough these having been effected by a plough for trenching. But having ascertained, by varied experiments, that not only the special form of the outline of the two boards in their relationship to each other, as well as that of the turn of their surfaces, are points of great importance, I do claim the special form given to the two boards in their outlines, as designated by the numbers on the vertical and horizontal lines in figures 8 and 15, and on the lines showing the width in figures 7 and 14; these numbers, however, being taken as relative, as the size of the whole plough may be varied. It Will be manifest that, in making this claim, I cannot intend thatthesemeasurements should be taken with mathematical exactness, but that the outlines and proportions should be substantially the same with those set forth. I claim the particular form given to the heel of the hinder mould board, as shown by the triangular space a, S, m, figure 8, and the hind view of this part in figure 8, his; by which form the slice deposited by the fore plough is left undisturbed, and that cut by the hind plough is raised, preparatory to its being deposited upon it.

Morgan Morgan, Of. No. 3676. Having thus fully described all the parts of the engine or apparatus which are necessary to an understanding of my improvements, what I claim therein as new, and desire to secure by letters patent, is first, the within described arrangement for blowing off the contents of the box C, by means of the pipe S, S, independently of the blowing off of the general contents of the boiler. I claim the manner in which I have combined and arranged the smallauxiliary steam engine, the fire engine, and the supply pump, with the supply pump, by which the action of the slide valve is regulated, and the water supplied to the boiler claim the particular manner of regulating the cut off of a steam cylinder, (herein described and represented in figure 3,) whether applied to the small axillary engine for filling the boiler, or to any other steam cylinder to which it may be adapted. I claim the manner in which I have combined the double valve (e' e with the float and an axillary engine, for the purpose of injuring its ready action in the boilers of high pressure engines. I do not claim to be the first to have used two valves upon one stem this having been done in what is called the balance valve ; but I do claim the special arrangement of the double valve in the combination, and for the purpose above described. And I do hereby declare that I do not claim to be the first inventor of the application of an axillary engine made to operate by the agency of afloat, so as to set in motion a supply pump for the supplying of a boiler a method of doing this having been described by I sac N. Coffin, and patented by him on the 13th day of September, 1839; but I limit my claim, as above specified, to the arrangement and combination of the respective parts of the apparatus, as herein made known. For do I claim the using of a box to enclose the float, excepting when this is done both at top and bottom, and in combination with a tube, such as is represented at H H ; by means of which arrangement the float is guarded against the effects of foaming. And   do hereby further declare, that I do not intend to limit myself to the precise form and arrangement of the apparatus as herein described and represented, but design to vary the same as I may find expedient, whilst I attain the same ends by means substantially the same. I have, for example, now in operation on board the steamboat Trot on, on Long I s land sound, an apparatus constructed by me, and substantially the same with that herein described; but, instead of the single steam cylinder of the axillary engine, I have used two cylinders, the piston rods of which are attached to a three throw crank shaft; two of the cranks having the two steam piston rods attached to them, and the third working the supply pump an arrangement that will probably be preferred, as operating more steadily than the single cylinder engine. Dani Of Barnum75 ]656 to, 3677. Davis  no thus fully described the nature of my invention, and shown, the manner in which the same may be carried into operation, what I claim therein as new, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the manner in which I govern the action of the slide valve of the axillary engine by the aid of the tap pits, the vibrating pieced, the sliding piece g, and their appendages, as set forth. I claim the regulating of this action, whether the apparatus be constructed precisely in the form represented, or in any other in which a like effect is produced by means substantially the same.
