Washi Ngtonpri Nted Of Wendell And Van Benthi Uybe REPORT OF THE Commissioner Of Patents. Patent Offi Of, January, 1848. Of    R: In compliance with the provisions of the act of Congress, entitled* An act in addition to the act to promote the progress of science and the useful arts" approved March 3, 1847, the' undersigned has the honor to submit his annual report. During the year ending December 31, 1847, the whole number of applications for patents, is fifteen hundred and thirty-one. The whole number of caveats filed during the same period is five hundred and thirtythreeiSThe number of patents issued in 1847 is five hundred and seventy-two, including fourteen reissues, three additional improvements, and sixty designs; classified and alphabetical lists of which, with the names of the patentees, are annexed, marked K and L. Three disclaimers were, during the same time, entered. Within the same period, five hundred and eighty patents have expired a list of which is annexed, marked M. There were during the year, nine applications to extend patents about to expire, six of which were rejected and three granted by the board, established by the act of July 4th, 1836, to hear and determine that class of applications. The claims embraced in the respective patents issued during the years 47, are also annexed, marked P. The number of applications for patents examined and rejected during the year 1847, is five hundred and fifty-seven; being very nearly as many as were granted. Any of the rejected cases may, however, be reconsidered, and perhaps, upon farther examination, passed, and, patents issued for the inventions or improvements claimed by the applicants. The receipts of the office during the year 1847, including duties and fees, paid in on applications for patents, caveats, reissues, disclaimers, additional improvements, extensions and for copies, amount, in the whole, to      $63,111.19; of which sum,    $8,008.43 have been repaid on applications withdrawn, and for money paid in by mistake, as per statement marked A. The expenses of the office during the year 1847, are as follows, viz For salaries                             $16,350; temporary clerks,      $6,937.57; contingent expenses,    $8,657.77; compensation of the chief justice of the District of Columbia, sitting on appeals from the commissioner of patents,                                 $100; library,                           $1,049.58; agricultural statistics,        $465; amounting, in the whole, to the sum of            $33,559.92, as per statement marked B. There was also expended during the last year, under the act of March 3,4 X. 1837, for the restoration of records and drawings, the sum of           $310, as per statement marked C. The aggregate of expenditures under the different heads above enumerated, is        $41,878.35; leaving a balance, to be carried to the credit of the Patent Fund, of          $21,232.84. V In the first day of January, 1847, the amount of money in the treasury, to the credit of the Patent Fund, was                             $186,565.14; which, with the balance paid in during the year 1847, will, on the first day of January, 1848,amount to the sum of            $207,797.98. It will be seen, that the surplus carried to the credit of the Patent Fund, during the last year, is much greater than that of any former year. This, arises from two, causes, first, the great increase of applications for patents and caveats over any former year; and secondly, the inability to examine and decide upon applications in a reasonable time after they have been filed in the office, growing out of the inadequacy of the examining force of the' office, causing a comparatively less number of withdrawals, and a comparatively less amount of expenditure for copying and recording patents. If Congress should authorise an increase of the scientific corps, so imperatively needed, the number of withdrawals will be greater and the other expenses of the office will be increased, and thus the balance next year, will be, in all probability, much smaller than it is this year. All moneys paid into the treasury on account of the Patent Office, are set apart by the ninth section of the act of July 4, 1836, and the fourteenth section of the act of March 3, 1837, for the benefit of the Patent Office, and de nominated the Patent Fund; out of which all expenditures provided by existing laws are to be paid, the Patent Fund being especially appropriated for that purpose. By thus establishing the Patent Fund, and appropriating it to the special object of defraying all expenditures of the Patent Office authorized by law, Congress expressed its intention to constitute the office upon the principle of a self sustaining institution which is to exist upon it sown revenues, and not depend for support upon the general treasury. Thus far, it gives me pleasure to say, the intention of Congress has been fully carried out, the office having not only paid its own expenses from its own revenues, but it has accumulated a comparatively large balance in the treasury to its credit. With the exception of the cost of erecting the present Patent Office building, to which the office contributed                                 $108,000, from its own funds, it has never been a charge upon the treasury. Nearly all of its revenues are derived from inventors It is sustained by their contributions 4 its services are appropriated to the promotion of their particular interests, although rendered to all other interests when required and it may, therefore, truly be regarded as the head and representative of the inventive genius and the industrial arts of the country. The annual reports of the two principal examiners, addressed to the undersigned, giving a view of the inventions and improvements which have passed their respective desks, are annexed, marked D and E. To these two important reports attention is particularly called. Theygite an interesting summary of the scientific operations of the office during the past year, thus presenting in a small space the most conclusive and gratifying proofs of the progress of our countrymen in the improvement of the useful arts: It will be seen from the two papers referred to, that the year just past has been fruitful of inventions of a most important arid valuable character, if they have not been of that novel and brilliant description x. a. 5 which sometimes surprise and startle the world, at the same time benefit in git by their great utility. The peculiar circumstances of society in this country growing out of its settlement very recent when compared with the age of other civilized portions of the earth, and imposing the necessity of subjugatingthe forest, of smoothing down the rugged face of nature, and of planting upon its bosom the arts of industry, which have rapidly terminated and developed themselves into great and important interests, now flourishing with a vigor and energy which enable them to become the formidable rivals of: similar interests of older nations have tended to stimulate the inventive genius of our people to the production and improvement of machines and processes of amutilitarian and labor saving character, rather than to the pursuit of more scientific discovery. Hence, while we in ay be behind other countries in the discovery and development of scientific principles, we are probably equal with, if not in advance of them, in their application to the useful purposes of life. But, if the genius of our countrymen is not now so much absorbed in the investigation of abstract science as that of the citizens of older and more op u lent countries, the circumstance of society so rapidly improving by the steady tide of prosperity which sets in our favor, will soon place us in a condition to contribute our share to the sum of knowledge which the combined genius and labors of the learned of all civilized nations annually bestow upon mankind. It will also be seen, on reference to the reports of the Examiners above referred to, that the labors of those two officers are of a very varied and complicated character, embracing in their range the whole field of invention, and requiring a thorough knowledge of every branch of science, as well as the state, past and present, of the arts in all countries. From this fact the talents and attainments requisite for the able discharge of the duties a p pertaining to their desks may be readily inferred. It may be safely assumed that there is no office in the Government, the duties of which are of a scientific nature, which requires more mental capacity, or more close and intense application, than that of Examiner of Patents. It would, therefore, be reasonable to suppose that there would be attached to that office, a salary commensurate with its duties and the talent and attainment which it requires. But, so far from that being the case, the Examiners now receive but.                               $1500 per annum, a sum paltry in comparison with the abilities and qualifications which they must possess, very much below the salaries paid to persons filling stations requiring scientific attainments of an inferior grade, and only equal to: the common clerk ships in the offices of the Capitol, and the weigheds, measures, and grangers of the Custom Houses. My predecessor in his last report, called the attention of Congress to the inadequate salaries allowed to the Examiners in this office, and respectfully recommended an addition to be made to that. branch of its service. In the two reports which I have had the honor to submit to Congress, I have expressed my concurrence in the recommendations of my predecessor; and from the action which has already taken place in the two branches of that honorable body, I am encouraged to hope that it will not be long before justice is done to that valuable class of officers, whose merits and claims I now again commend to its favorable consideration. The necessities and embarrassments under which the office is now laboring on account of the want of an adequate scientific force to perform its greatly increased business, impose upon me the duty of earnestly but relax. aspect fully soliciting the prompt action of Congress for its relief. A brief statement of facts will show the absolute necessity of an addition to its scientific corps. By the act of July 4, 1836, re organizing the Patent Office, the Commissioner of Patents was allowed but a single Examiner. By the act of March 3, 1837, he was authorized to appoint another Examiner. And by the act of March 3, 1839, he was authorized to appoint two Assistant Examiners. Thus, within a period of less than three years from the reorganization of the office, there were two principal and two assistant examiners provided for by law; since which time no addition has been made, because none has been authorized. In 1840, the first entire year after the last addition to the examining corps was provided for, the number of applications for patents was 765, the number of caveats filed was 228, and the number of patents granted was 475. During the year 1847, the number -of applications for patents was 1,531,the number of caveats filed was 533, the number of patents granted was 572,and the number of applications rejected was 557. Thus it appears that the business of the office has increased one hundred per cent. since the last addition was made to the examining corps in 1839. In the year 1844, the year preceding my appointment to the office of Commissioner, the number of applications for patents was 1,045, and the caveats filed 380. In 1845, the number of applications was 1,246, caveats 452. In 1846, the number of applications was 1,272, caveats 448. And in 1847, as before stated, the number of applications was 1,531, caveats 572. Thus since my appointment to the office of Commissioner of Patentsrthe business of the office has increased in the ratio of 33 per cent. During the five years commencing with 1840, and ending with 1844, embracing the five last years preceding my appointment to the office of Commissioner, the amount paid into the treasury to the credit of the Patentfund was          $25,200.43. During the three years since my appointment, the amount paid into the treasury is           $37,018.72, showing an increase of surplus over expenditures in a much greater ratio than 33 per cent. In 1844, the business of the office was quite equal to the ability of the examining corps to perform it, and in anticipation of the early necessity of an addition to that branch of the service of the office, my predecessor in his last annual report suggested that such addition would soon be required. During the last three years it has far transcended the capacity of the examiners to do it as it should be done, or to do it at all, and hence it has accumulated until it has produced serious embarrassment to the office, and very great injury to the interests of the inventors. The office is now seven or eight months in ar rear of its business, and is daily becoming more and more embarrassed. In view of the increasing accumulation of business and the consequent embarrassment of the office, I called the attention of Congress to its condition and recommended an immediate addition to its scientific corps in my report of January, 1846. Before the close of the session of 1845 6, anticipating from the great amount of more important business then pending before Congress, that the necessities of the Patent Office might be overlooked, I again called the attention of Congress to the subject by a letter addressed to the Committee on Patents of the Senate, dated June 10, 1846. Congress, however, adjourned, without taking any action for the relief of the office. X. 7 n my report of January, 1847, I again repeated my request for an addition to the examining corps, pressing in urgent but respectful terms the embarrassments of the office growing out of its increase of business, and the absolute necessity of the adoption of suitable provisions for its relief. The session being about to close, without, as I apprehended, any action for the relief of the office, I again brought its embarrassments and necessities before both houses of Congress by duplicate letters addressed to their respective committees having the interests of the Patent Office in charge, dated February 17th, 1847. At that session a bill passed the House of Representatives providing, among other things, for an addition to the examining corps; but failed in the Senate for want of sufficient time to act upon it. The embarrassments of the office continuing, and greatly increasing in consequence of its rapidlyaccumulating business and the want of an adequate force to execute it, at an early day after the commencement of the present session, and in anticipation of my annual report, I again by a duplicate letter addressed to the Committees on Patents of the House and Senate, dated December, 1847, respectfully but earnestly requested the interposition of Congress for the relief of the office, by providing for an adequate increase of its examining corps. Thus have I, in five separate communications to Congress and its appropriate Committees within the last two years, made full expositions of the embarrassed condition of this office growing out of its greatly increased and increasing business, and the inadequacy of its force to perform its duties. In view of these facts, I am confident that the Patent Office cannot beheld responsible for the embarrassments and delays which exist in one of the branches of its service. I am conscious that the inventors by whose contributions this important institution is sustained, have grievous cause of complaint on account of the disappointments and injuries which they suffer from the delays which their business is compelled to encounter in the Patent Office, but I am confident their enlightened liberality will appreciate the earnest and persevering efforts which have been made by the undersigned to remove the just causes of their complaints, and that they will patiently wait the action of Congress for their relief, which, it is gratifying to know, may be confidently anticipated before the close of the present session. In my former reports I have recommended a change in some of the features of the patent law as it now exists. For the nature of those recommendations, and the reasons on which they are founded, I would respectfully refer to the annual reports of this office, for 1845 and 1846. I n my judgment the changes proposed are necessary to give adequate security to that valuable and meritorious class of our citizens engaged in inventive pursuits. As the law now is, the remedies which it affords to patentees are, in most cases, inadequate to the protection of their rights and the prevention of infringement upon them by that unscrupulous and unprincipledclass of persons, who make it a practice wilfully to deprecate upon patent rights, and who, from the basely criminal character of the offence which they commit, are stigmatized by the application to them of the infamous epithet of pirate. Certainly, adequate protection should be given to the honest inventor who devotes his substance and his incessant toil for the benefit of society, against the free looters who invade without scruple his property, which, to him, is more sacred and invaluable, because it is the cherished creation of his own genius. Unfortunately, property in patent rights is not generally looked, up o, by8Ex. society in the same light in which property existing in other forms is regarded. This results, perhaps, from the fact that many useless inventions have been patented, by which the public have been imposed upon and deceived. If such be the fact, it does not in any respect affect the general principle upon which not only property in inventions, but all rights of property, are founded. Nobody doubts the right of property which a man has in his lands, houses or common chattels; and all agree that he has a right to claim from the government .under which he lives, protection in the enjoyment of his property. May, so careful is the government itself of the sacred right which every citizen has in his own property, that it never takes it from him without giving him an adequate compensation for it. The necessities of the government are, in certain emergencies, supreme over the rights of its citizens, and, by virtue of its right of eminent domain, it can take the property of its citizens for the public use. But in all civilized countries, in which the immutable principles of morality and justice prevail, governments never take the property of their citizens and appropriate it to their own use, without first giving an adequate compensation for it. This sacred immunity from unjust invasion of private rights, even by the sovereign power of the state, is secured in all the constitutions, national and state, of this confederacy. They recognise the inviolability of private property, and provide that it shall be taken only for the public use, and then only upon the condition of an adequate indemnity to be first awarded and paid.  It is upon this very principle that the law is founded which provides that property in patent rights shall, on certain conditions, pass from the inventor into the possession of the public, after the lapse of a fixed term of years. Our whole patent system, having its origin in the constitution itself, is built upon the recognition of this absolute right of the inventor to the exclusive enjoyment of the productions of his combined genius, labor ad capital. It regards such a description of property as the law does all other descriptions, as sacred and inviolable, in the possession and enjoyment of which the owner has a right to claim protection. But it subjects it, as it does all other descriptions of property, to the necessities and uses of the body politic, on the return of a fair and just equivalent. The inventor having the sole control over his invention, may use it, m secret if he pleases. He is not bound to disclose it to the public, and the public has no right to its use except by purchase, unless he should voluntarily surrender it. If the community should get the possession of an invention in any other way, it could only have surreptitiously obtained it. Hence, in order to induce him to disclose it, and to permit the public ultimately to enjoy it in common with himself, the government, representing the community, offers him the exclusive enjoyment of his property during a, term which it supposes will be sufficient to enable him to obtain from its sale to others, an ample regeneration for his time and expenses in producing it. Therefore, upon strict principles of justice and equity, he is entitled to complete protection in the enjoyment of his rights during the term limited, and if he is not thus protected, the contract is in effect broken on the part of the government; and if such a contract, expressed or implied, existed between man and man, it would, if thus broken, be declared a nullify, and the inventor would be r emitted to the enjoyment of his original rights, or exemplary damages by way of compensation would be given to him. And this system is just and equitable to the inventor as Well as to society. X. a. There are ample reasons why private and exclusive property in inventions should cease, and the inventions themselves become a part of the common property of the national body politic. If it were not the case, but, on the contrary, if the inventor and his representatives were to be protected in the perpetual enjoyment of his discovery, improvements in' a great measure would cease, and advancement in the arts and manufactures would be greatly retarded, to the detriment of the best interests of society. Therefore it is necessary and just that discoveries, inventions, and improvements in science and the useful arts, should, under proper circumstances, be taken from the inventor and appropriated to the public use, upon the condition that the proprietor shall bejustlyremunerated for this surrender of his private rights for the benefit of the paramount interests of the community. Hence, while recognising his absolute right of property in his invention, and promising him protection in the enjoyment of it, as other citizens are protected in the enjoyment of their property, subject always to the superior necessities of the public interest, the patent system provides that the patentee shall enjoy the exclusive monopoly in the use and sale of his invention for the term of fourteen years. It supposes that he will be adequately regenerated for his invention in that space of time, and that at the end of it, it will be just and equitable that his property in his invention should cease, and that it should pass into general use. It adopts this mode of compensation g him for the appropriation of his private rights to the public use, instead of appraising the value of his invention and a warding to him a specific sum in money for it, as is done in the public appropriation of other descriptions of property. And there can be no doubt that a this is the best and wisest method that has yet been devised to compensate the inventor; best for him, and best for the public. As his compensation depends upon his own efforts, he makes every exertion to perfect his invention, and introduce it into general use, during the term to which his exclusive right is limited. Thus does this wise policy benefit both the inventor and society. But while his exclusive property in his invention exists, it must be conceded that the inventor has a right to demand of the Government, the most ample security and protection in its enjoyment. This security and protection he does not, under our present imperfect system, enjoy. In the contrary, the difficulty and expense, and the absolute impossibility, in some cases, of vindicating his rights, have rendered the present laws enacted for his protection, almost absolute nullifies. To remedy this imperfect ion in the existing system, is the object of the amendments of the patent laws, proposed in the two former reports of the undersigned. While the steam engine, most potent of all the creations of genius, is daily coursing before our eyes, wafting as upon the wings of the wind its precious freight of human life, and its countless treasures of industry and commerce; while the mysterious telegraph speeds our thoughts with the swiftness of lightning which is its obedient and trusty messenger; while magnificent man factories stud our land, stunning but de lighting us with the never ceasing movement of their wonder working machinery, it seems unnecessary to remark upon the incalculable value of the labors of the inventor and his claims upon society for protection in the enjoyment of his just right s. And, sooner or later, the undersigned is confident they will be fully recognised and protected by the enlightened legislators of a great republic, whose progress has been so much accelerated by their genius and enterprise. In my last report, I had the honor to suggest the propriety of reducing the 10 X. duties now exacted from foreign applicants for patents to the same rate of duty required of American citizens, when it should appear that the governments to which such foreign applicants belonged, had made corresponding reductions in the charges and fees now imposed upon the applications of citizens of this country for patents granted within their respective jurisdictions. Upon more mature reflection, I have arrived at the conclusion that the interests of this country would be best promoted by reducing the duties on all foreign applications to the same amount now required of its own citizens. In the first place, no such insidious distinction is made by other governments between the application of their own subjects, and those of American citizens. It is indeed true, that the duties charged for patents by most of the governments of Europe, are very high compared with those charged by the government of the United States upon its own citizens. But the same duties are charged by foreign governments on all alike, whether native or foreign, without any discrimination in favor of one or the other. This policy is liberal and enlightened, and worthy of emulation by a great and generous nation; a characteristic which, it is hoped, may be always justly claimed for the United States. But, if high and magnanimous sentiments of justice are not sufficient to induce the repeal of the unjust discriminations which our laws make and enforce against foreign inventors, and it is necessary to appeal to the lower and less respectable considerations of self interest, it may, I think, be clearly shown that this country would derive from it a benefit infinitely transcend ing the paltry revenue which it derives from the few foreign inventions which are patented here. The great expense which attends the procuring of patents in most of the governments of Europe, and particularly in Great Britain, prevents the patenting of many valuable inventions which are never voluntarily made public, but are used in secret at home, and, of course, rarely become known in other countries. If our laws permitted the patenting of such inventions on the same terms on which patents are granted to American citizens, many of those inventions would find their way into use in this country. More of the valuable inventions which are deemed worthy of patents abroad, even at the great expense on which they can only be obtained, would be patented and introduced into use here. The great extent of our territory, its' growing population, and its rapid increase of wealth, offer promises of reward to the foreign inventor which can be found in no other country. To induce him to come here, we have only to place him upon tie same footing, and to grant to him the same privileges, which our own countrymen enjoy. We should, by such a wise policy, increase our means of emulating and rivaling other nations in the arts and manufactures. For would it be injurious to our own citizens engaged in inventive pursuits, for it fortunately happens, that there is no competition or conflict of interest among inventors, each exploring a new and untried field of experiment, and each aiming to discover principles and combinations which have never been before known. During the year 1847, there were but twenty applications for patents from foreigners, upon which the aggregate sum of    $8,800 was paid intothe treasury. Of course, if they had each paid but the sum of             $30, the fee charged upon applications of citizens, the sum would have been but       $600. To supply the deficiency in the revenues of the office, which will be occasioned by the change proposed in reference to foreign inventions, it would be necessary to look to other" sources than those at present provided. The sum x. a. 11 of          $3,000, could be obtained by authorizing the charge of a moderate fee for recording assignments, a service which the office now performs, without compensation, for a class of persons a great majority of whom are :a last to be exempted from contributing to its support. A much larger sum might be obtained by a repeal of that provision of the law which authorizes a repayment of twenty dollars on the withdrawal of an application for a patent that has been rejected, which would operate beneficially to the Patent Office and to the public, by preventing many applications for inventions of doubtful utility and value. A very considerable increase of foreign applications might also be reasonably anticipated, which would contribute to supply the deficiency occasioned by a reduction of the present duty charged upon such applications. Thus, from all these additional sources of revenue, the office would not only sustain itself, but would be able to add to its vigor and efficiency of action as the increase of its business might require. It is hoped that these considerations may induce Congress to deliberate, and favorably to act upon the proposition for a change of the existing law, in i relation to foreign inventions, which is now respectfully submitted. The rapidly increasing number of applications for patents afford convincing proof of the wisdom and sound policy of the present patent system of the United States. The very low terms on which patents can be obtained in this country, when compared with the cost of obtaining them under most other governments, encourage attempts at discovery and improvement, not only in the higher branches of the arts, but also in the most humble. Hence, the inventive mind of the country is busily at work in all its various grades, daily bringing forth valuable improvements and contributing to the means of comfort and enjoyment in all the ranks and conditions of social life. His office, standing in a position from which it can contemplate the whole field of discovery, can mark, from year to year, the great progress of our countrymen in the sciences and arts, and their application to the varied industrial pursuits in which our people are engaged. For is the genius of our countrymen confined to the invention and improvement of valuable machines and processes of manufacture. Stimulated by our present imperfect law of designs, their attention and efforts a returned to the production of the beautiful in form as well as the valuable in use. This result is daily becoming more and more visible in numerous articles and manufactured fabrics, the designs and patterns of which are now patented under the law of designs. Hence, it encourages the hope that our countrymen will soon be able to compete with the ingenious artisans of other countries, in those fabrics and manufactures which not only require a high state of perfection in machinery, but also the production of those beautiful and pleasing forms, figures and designs which adapt and recommend certain kinds of manufactured articles and fabrics to the taste and fancy of the consuming portion of the community. It will be recollected that no appropriation was made by Congress for the Report upon the state of Agriculture, for the year 1846, and none accordingly was made. At the last session the usual appropriation for the collection of agricultural statistics was made, which duty has been performed, and its results are contained in the paper annexed, marked F. In account of the interruption of the agricultural report in 1846, and the consequent suspension of the investigations in which this office was then engaged, and the abandonment of all the efforts which it was then making, and means which it had in its possession to obtain information, the 12: X. undersigned has had i much difficulty in returning this branch of his duties. Met, it is believed that the estimates of the crops for 1847, now submitted, will approximate very nearly to the real quantities produced. I ft they should be defective in any respect, as they must of course be, p effect .accuracy being unattainable, they will be found to err on the favorable side that is to say, they will be found to be below the actual results. In examining the tabular estimates annexed to the rep it, it will be seen that, while some of the crops inferior in value and amount, have remained nearly stationary, or perhaps slightly diminished, the great staple products of 'agriculture have steadily increased thus furnishing, as usual, ample provision for domestic consumption, and an additional surplus for exportation. It will be perceived that the corn and sugar crops have largely increased since the last estimates of this office were submitted to Congress, which was for 1845. The wheat, cotton, potato e, rice, tobacco, and oats crops, have not increased so rapidly, although they exhibit a very satisfactory addition to their aggregate accounts. In the whole, the husband man has reason for gratitude to Providence for the additional abundance which it has during the past year beneficently bestowed upon him The season which has just passed has been generally favorable to the growth and maturing of the maize crop, but not so favorable for wheat, The former crop requires hot and comparatively dry weather, while a more humid atmosphere, and cooler temperature are more favorable to the growth and development of wheat. Therefore when the season is less favorable for one crop it is more so for the other. And thus, while one crop may partially fail from causes adverse to its growth, the other is sure to be benefited and increased by the very same causes; thereby securing ample provision against famine or dear th, unless sent by special visitation of Providence. It should not, however, be forgotten that one great source of supply forhuinan food has been mysteriously and alarmingly smitten. For some years the potato e has been visited with a <a name="malady0"><mark>malady</mark></a>, the cause and remedy of which, it has baffled the sagacity of man to discover. Although almost innumerable theories have been advanced to account for the plague which has seized upon the potato e, the secret still remains hidden from the scrutiny of human intelligence. The <a name="disease0"><mark>disease</mark></a> progresses both in this country and in Europe, threatening the entire destruction of that important article of food for man and beast, and when and where its destructive course shall be stayed, belongs not to human wisdom or human effort to determine. While, from the abundance of other articles of sustenance, the partial <a name="loss0"><mark>loss</mark></a> of the potato e crop has caused no suffering, and but little embarrassment, in this country, in other countries, its destruction has brought in its train a frightful amount of starvation and distress. The deprivation and suffering which it has inflicted on the people of other countries, have revealed the great resources of this, and demonstrated its capacity to supply the wants and demands of other nations to any ext, en t which can be reasonably anticipated. It was, indeed, a spectacle grateful to humanity, and sublime to contemplate, to see our fertile and prolific country opening its rich stores of agricultural products to feed the finishing millions of other nations, and to arrest the strides of appalling and inexorable famine which was sweeping them by thousands to the grave; selling to those who had the means of purchasing, and generously giving, without money or price, to those who had not. The quantity of grain of all kinds estimated in bushels, exported during the; commercial year ending August 31, 1847, was 41,273,998 bushels. X. 13ff this quantity, 19,768,579 bushels was wheat, and :206 906 64 .bushels was I indian corn; the! remainder being rye, barley, and: oats. :a. And yet this large quantity sent to foreign 'countries, did not exhaust our surplus products by millions of bushels. ;in a tour through several of the States bordering; on the great western lakes, during the last; :summer, the undersigned found the depots of grain, the remains, of the crops of 1846, filled to overflowing, and all the avenues of transportation choked up with the immense quantities which were pouring through 'them to the Atlantic coast to seek markets abroad. It will not exceed the :truth to. say that the surplus of grain in this country, and particularly of maize, is sufficient to. meet any demand which all the corn purchasing countries of Europe combined can make upon us under any; probable circumstances. The limits of supply beyond our own consumption, are, from the smallest quantity up to two hundred millions of bushels, if demanded by i the wants of foreign nations. The only difficulties to be encountered; would be the inadequate means. of transportation from the interior' to the coast, and ships: to early our surplus product across the Atlantic. Already the wheat crop equals 114,000,000 bushels, and the maize crop about 540,000,000. The former could, in the course of two or three years, be much increased, and the latter could be increased to the amount of more than 100,000,000 bushels, l if the foreign demand should be sufficient to induce so great an expansion of that branch of agricultural production. The quantity of grain imported into Great Britain- in 1847, was10840000 imperial quarters, or 86,720,000 bushels. The exports of grain from this country during the same period, nearly equalled one half of that amount, and most of it was carried to Great Britain and her dependencies, If returns, which are daily expected from Europe, shall be received in season, a full exposition of the corn trade between this country and that portion of the world, together with an estimate of the probable demands ofiErope during the present year, will be made in one of the appendixes to this report. An estimate of the value of the principal crops produced in the Unitedstates during the year 1847, will also be appended. In surveying the agricultural productions of the Union, we are not only struck with their abundance, but with their great variety and value. I to territorial domain extends from the frigid regions of the north to the genial climate of the tropics, affording almost every variety of temperature, and every kind of grain and vegetable. In the north we have rich and abundant pasturage, giving forth the valuable products of the flock and dairy; in the middle and western regions of the Union, corn in all its varieties is produced in super abundant quantities; and in the south rice, cotton and sugar grow luxuriantly; and nearly all in sufficient quantities to supply our domestic consumption, and furnish large surpluses for exportation, thus furnishing nearly all the value as well as built of our foreign commerce. Whencontemplating the extent and the value of its products, the number of persons engaged, and the capital employed, the agriculturists may well believe that agriculture is the great transcend went interest of the Union, upon which all other interests are dependent. And he has equal reason to console himself with the honorable character and exalted dignity of the pursuit in which he is engaged. To occupation offers a greater field for experiment, and for the application of science directed by sound judgment, Experience has proved that ever grain, vege14Ex. table, and fruit, is susceptible of improvement by scientific cultivation. Science and skill have converted the potato e from a half poisonous root to a valuable article of human food. They have wrought the same magietransformations upon the apple, p each, and many other fruits and vegetables. Science investigates the nature of soils and manures, and developed the elements of plants, thus pointing out the means by which soil, manure, and plant may be adapted to each other and more abundantly reward the, labor and skill of the husband man. And to crown all, genius stoops from its lofty flight to lessen the but then of his toil, and mitigate the severity of his labors, by conferring upon him useful implements and valuable machines. Truly may agriculture be called the mother of the arts, the most honorable and the most prolific of good to the world, to which all other arts pay grateful homage, and with which science itself seeks honorable association May agriculture be ever cherished by the American citizen as the interest of his country greatest in honor, dignity, and importance, and constituting the very foundation of its independence, wealth and power. A portion of the sum appropriated for agricultural purposes has been applied to the purchase of seeds for distribution; some of which are of new varieties, although not so many as desired. The interruption of the agricultural labors of this office in 1846, and the difficulty of establishing agencies abroad, by which new seeds could be obtained, have prevented the procuring of many from other countries. Met the varieties which will be distributed are believed to be valuable, and worthy of introduction into those portions of the country in which they are not generally known and cultivated. The quantity distributed will more than equal that of any former year, and will exceed sixty thousand packages. A portion of them has been presented to the Patent Office by the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce of France, through the generous intervention of that well known and philanthropic gentleman, M. Patte mare, to whose glowing enthusiasm and untiring perseverance in the noble scheme of national interchange, of which he is the project or, this country, and particularly this office, are greatly indebted i Suitable acknowledgments and returns will of course be made. The undersigned has also to acknowledge his obligations to his predecessor, the On. Henry L. Ellsworth, Charles List, Esq, Nicholas Long worth, Esq, and others, for able and valuable papers upon various subjects which will be found in the appendix to this report. I also take great pleasure in bearing especial testimony to the very "able manner in which Charles L. Fleischmann, Esq, formerly employed in this office, has prepared for the use of this office, the results of his observations during his tour in several of the countries of Europe, and particularly in Germany, in the summer of 1845. A portion of the results of his observations will be found in his very interesting article upon the management of sheep, wool growing, agricultural schools, and many other subjects appended to this report. It is doubtless well understood that the agricultural report of this office is limited, by the appropriation by which it was authorized, to four hundred pages. Special pains have been taken to prevent its exceeding that limit. Met, as it is impossible to determine the quantity of matter it will require to fill four hundred printed pages, it may fall short of, or may somewhat overrun that number. If the latter shall be the case it will, of course, devolve upon the respective Houses of Congress to determine whether or not the surplus matter shall be printed. Six. 
15As the internal commerce of the Union, transportation on canals and railroads, and the interior trade of cities, have an important relation to agriculture, I have endeavored to collect some statistics upon those subjects, which will be found embodied in one of the papers in the appendix to this report. The limited means at my disposal, and the difficulty of reaching the sources from which information in relation to such subjects can be derived, will, of course, account for the comparatively meagre and unsatisfactory results which are presented in the paper referred to. But they will serve to show, to some extent, the vast amount of the internal commerce of the Union, and the benefit which would result from full and accurate information upon that important subject n view of the great emulation and rivalry of nations in manufactures trade and commerce, which mark and distinguish the present age, it is of the utmost importance, that those who are called to preside over the political and economical interests of great communities, should thoroughly inform themselves of their resources and elements of power. Without this knowledge the legislator and statesman are but poorly qualified for the high trusts which they are appointed to execute. Therefore in many of the enlightened countries of Europe, plans and systems have been devised and organized, through the instrumentality of which, comparatively accurate returns of the annual products of labor and capital employed in the various branches of industry in which their citizens are engaged, are obtained. In this country no such system has been organized; yet, it is believed, one f night be, with very little expense and with very "beneficial results. Such, however, would depend upon the cooperation of the individual states of the Union for the success of such a plan. It would not be difficult to obtain returns approximating to accuracy, of the industry of any state, i fits legislature were to require by law the assessors of taxes or other appropriate officers, to take a census every year, when they were performing their other duties, of the capital and products of all the important interests, agricultural, manufacturing, mining and commercial. The inquiries should embrace every pursuit and every product; in agriculture, the quantity of land cultivated and appropriated to each crop, the amount of each crop, even to the most unimportant, the number and increase of animals, products of the dairy, &c. &c. In manufactures, mining and commerce, they should embrace the amount of capital employed; the quantity and value of raw material consumed, and of products; wages of labor; in short, every thing, which would tend to show their extent and importance. These returns, analysed and condensed by some officer of the State Government, appointed for the purpose, and then transmitted to some appropriate bureau or department of the general government, and there embodied in the form of tables, would each year present a rent roll or income sheet, which would surprise by -to results, and exhibit at a glance the vast resources of the republic. In some of the States this plan has been partially adopted, and the result has been most gratifying. In 1845, Massachusetts caused such an investigation to be made of the products of its capital and industry, and the result exhibited an aggregate val he of                              $114,478,443. It is a proud monument to the intelligence, enterprise and energy of her people. Other States could doubtless exhibit an income sheet quite as flattering, if they would take the pains to procure the materials with which to make it up. I have been informed that a bill has been introduced and is now pendingianthe Legislature of Louisiana, providing for the establishment and organi16Ex. nation of a bureau of statistics. It is ardently hoped that the measure may be carried, and that the example which will be thus set by Louisianakresulting from an enlightened view of the importance of her great interests, agricultural and commercial, will be speedily followed by other States of the Union. All have industrial interests of sufficient importance to justify the establishment of such a bureau in their respective governments. I have the grateful satisfaction of acknowledging the receipt of a very valuable donation of books which have been bestowed upon this office by the Minister of Agriculture and Commence, and other high official persons connected with the French Government, and by several of the institutions and -societies of the city of Paris, which were presented through the intervention of that distinguished and indefatigable philanthropist, M. Alexandre Patte mare, so honorably known as the founder of the system of national interchange. Receiving the donation in the spirit in which it was bestowed, namely, for the noble purpose of cultivating and cherishing sentiments of friendship and amity among nations, I deemed it to be my duty to make, as far as it was in my power, a fit and appropriate recognition of the' gift. I have therefore caused to be prepared for delivery to M. Patte mare, and presentation to the several officers of the French Government, and the institutions of Paris, and to several of the cities of France, copies of the reports of this office, which will hereafter be forwarded to them from year to year. I have also caused to be prepared, especially for the office of the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce of France, drawings and descriptions of the most valuable inventions and improvements which have been patented at, this office during the last year. I am also informed by M. Patte mare, that the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, in further an ce of the system of national interchange, has consented to make preparations for a fair to be held in the city of Paris, at sometime in 1849 to be hereafter appointed, for the exhibition of the products of American genius and skill. To that fair the American inventor, manufacturer, and art ivan, will be invited to send models and specimens of machines, fabrics, and manufactured articles, and ample provision will be made to receive and exhibit them conspicuously. It is also proposed that, at some suitable time, a similar exhibition shall take place, of specimens of the genius and skill of the inventors, manufacturers and artisans of France, in one of the cities of the American Union. Of course the accomplishment of this grand design will require the cordial cooperation of the citizens of both countries. It is hoped and believed, that the concurrence and aid of our ingenious countrymen will not be withheld from this novel and interesting experiment. In conclusion, I would respectfully invite the attention of Congress to the necessity of enlarging the Patent Office building. Already the rooms appropriated to the reception and arrangement of the models, have become so crowded as to prevent their proper classification, and to cause serious embarrassment to the business of the office. And, if Congress should authorize the increase of force required in the scientific department of the office, there will not be a sufficient number of convenient and suitable rooms for the accommodation of the official corps. It is, therefore, suggested, that provision be made at the present session for the construction of the two additional wings contemplated in the plan of the Patent Office adopted by Congress, As it would take two or three years to complete them, the accommodation which they would furnish, would be very much needed long x. 17 before they could be completed. If the National Gallery were appropriated to the use of the Patent Office, the necessity of the enlargement of the Patent Office building above recommended, would not be so urgent. But as that spacious hall is now principally occupied by articles belonging to the Exploring Expedition, which were directed by an act of Congress to be deposited there, and will continue to lie thus occupied until the completion of the edifice of the Smithsonian I institution, it cannot be appropriated to the use of the Patent Office for some years. In view of this fact I have deemed it my duty to recommend an early appropriation for the enlargement of the Patent Office Building. By the act of March 3, 1837, relating to the Patent Office, the Chiefjustice of the District of Columbia was constituted the appellate tribunal of the office, to which appeals from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents have since been taken. From that time down to the present many appeals have been taken from the decisions, of the Commissioner, and decided by the Chief Justice, who has sustained his decisions by able and elaborate opinions, involving important principles of patent law. In the judgment of the undersigned, the publication of those opinions are important for the information of persons doing business at the Patent Office. I have therefore appended a copy of them to this report, to be published or not, as may by either house be deemed expedient.

Patent Offi Of, January 6, 1848. To The Hon. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patentssi    R: In conformity with your requisitions, I have the ,honor here with to submit the following notice of inventions referred to me for examination. From the great accumulation of business and the inability of the present limited number of examines m your office, to prevent its increase, it will hardly be expected that this report should embrace such detail of subjects as has been given in former years, as the time required for the collection of the facts must necessarily be taken from the now pressing duties of examination of cases waiting their turn. It may be sufficient to state, that in the year 1846, the number of applications for letters patent presented to the office, was 1,272. In the first of January, 1847, there were 147 applications at my desk waiting for examination. During the year 1847, the number of applications presented to the office was 1,531, and on the first of January, 1848, the number of applications at my desk, waiting for examination, was 423. Thus it appears, that the accumulation of cases, un examined, has increased, in a greater ratio, than the increase in the number of applications. This condition of things is necessarily consequent upon any considerable accumulation of un examined applications, as these cases are daily the subjects of reference, with a view to avoid interferences, ana from the eagerness of inventors, they become daily the source of correspondence and other kinds of attention operating seriously to retard and interfere with the investigation of cases duly before the examiners. The following notice of patented inventions has been prepared with as much care as the state of affairs would allowAGRI Culturenumber of patents granted, 43.--I n agricultural pursuits a marked disparity is exhibited between this and every other country. We are an agricultural people, and pride ourselves with pre eminence in this respect. But our advance and advantages are characteristic, and are to be found chiefly on that side of the median line in this wide field of occupation which marks the boundary between mechanical and chemical economy of farming. In the husbanding of farming resources we are much behind European nations, and even, perhaps that singular people the Chinese; while, in variety, extent and utility of labor saving instruments for agriculture, we greatly expel. The difference obviously grows but of the differing necessities and characteristics of the people and the soil. If records of patented inventions may be considered a fair ex potent of the mechanical facilities enjoyed by the agriculturists of different countries, then the above position is correct and the comparison striking. The whole number of patented inventions in this country, belonging to the class of agriculture, is 2,043. In this class are included, not only the various instruments for tilling the earth, entering and gathering crops, and preparing them for market, but also every implement and machine belonging to the comprehensive subject of rural economy. X. Doc. -to. 54. Piougha very novel modification of this implement has been patented, in which the <a name="mould0"><mark>mould</mark></a> board revolves upon a central pilot. The <a name="mould1"><mark>mould</mark></a> board in form is concavo convex, or shaped like a shallow dish, through the centre of which passes the bearing or pilot, the convex side of the <a name="mould2"><mark>mould</mark></a> board being towards the land. Horse Rakestwo forms of horse rakes have been patented. In both these inventions the subject of improvement is the mode of liberating the rake before it is turned over, and to check it in proper time as it comes, round. In one of these rakes the turning is made upon segment wheels and much facilitated, while the liberating and checking of the rake is effected with great ease and r certainty. ,cheese 'shelf convenient apparatus, for the purpose of turning and drying cheeses, has been patented, in which a number of cheeses are turned he one operation. A frame containing a series of shelves is made so as to revolve upon a horizontal axis, and the ho a ole is readily in ver ted for the purpose of turning. the cheeses upon: the shelves prior to the inversion, shelves are placed over the; cheeses, which, after the inversion, become their support Fruit. Gathereran instrument of this class has been patented which gathers, or rather receives the fruit as it falls from n the tree, without bruising, aid conducts it into barrels. It is an old practice to hold or suspend a sheet under a tree to receive the fruit without injury. The patentee in this case provides a large sheet, consisting of parts so put together as to form a number of tapering funnels, the small ends of which are let down into barrels to receive the fruit. Hurry Comnbseveral minor improvements have been made in the last year in this instrument. One deserving especial attention has been patented, in which the cleaning of the comb is effected with the greatest ease. Thinged plate, through which the rows of teeth pass, and which catches most of the dirt, is occasionally raised up and brushed off, and as the teeth pass through the narrow apertures in the plate, they are stripped of whatever adhered- to them, and thus it is but the work of a moment to clean the comb. Worn Crushersa number of machines have been recently introduced for cutting and grinding corn fodder. In this, as well as many other sections of country where corn is raised with such facility and grass so apt to fail, it is highly important to the farmer to reduce the corn stalk to an esch lent form, instead of allowing them to stand in the field or be wasted in any other way. The construction of machines for effecting this object is simple, and consists mainly of the combination of a straw c utter with two, grinding or crushing cylinders, the cutting knives being larger than in the straw c utter to suit the material to be cut. As the corn s talks are cut by, the knives into short pieces, these are received into a hop per which conducts them between the grinding or crushing rollers. Two machines of this class have been patented during the past year, promising a successful accomplishment of the operation. Chemi Stry. Number of patents granted, 25. As this branch of science is progressing more rapidly than any other of the present day, its application to the arts in a measure keeps pace, and the past year exhibits an interesting catalogue of inventions under this clas20Ex. Toe. N : 54. -but little credit can be a in ied for our own country in the advancement of the science of chemistry in comparison with- Germany, France, Wee en and England. I while we admit the deficiency and plead the infancy of or jinsitttitons as the most obvious and natural apology, we are warrant   ed up oh facts in claiming pre eminence in the application of chemistry to the arts and this without necessarily arroganting genius, as our advancement in this latter respect is perhaps due to that very condition which we have pleaded for our backwardness in science. The foreign applications under this class hive been few, and. two of the patented inventions presenting uncommon interest, were from citizens of the United States residing abroad. : .a. The newly applied substance known chiefly by the name of Gutta Percha has been a most fruitful subject of applications for letters patent, and a though: no patents have yet been granted, still, in some cases th clainshaYe been admitted, and some information concerning this curious substance may be very desirable at this period. The following extracts give full information upon the subject of Guttaperchautta Merci ta, (and ,your, Not. No. Of, Any. 1847, p33This is a vegetable substance, which though only known to Europeans for a few years, is now extensively used in the arts for various purposes, as a ,substitute for caoutchouc, because it has the valuable property .of dissolving withcid127ut i being vulcapized. But while thus frequently employed, and constituting an important article of commerce, the plant which produces it was unknown until by a lucky accident, during the residence of Mr. His. Cobb in Singapore, where he has been (and in "other Malay I s lands) employed in a botany cal mission by Mr. Fetch, of Peter, he detected this plant and sent home numerous specimens which prove it to. be a newsapotaiceus plant, of which a figure and description will shortly appear in this. Journal, under the name of Lassies Took, accompanying numerous well dried specimens, (though unfortunately without co roll as) Mr. Cobb judiciously sent small 'sections of the wood, which is peculiarly soft, fibrous* Gutta Percha, a Malay term signifying Ragged Sum, pronounced as if s pelt. Gutta Pertsha. Gutta Percha hm not yet been fully investigated as to its chemical composition, and it does not appear whether in elation to caoutchouc it presents a case of isomorphism or isomerism. fn the first case it would present a substance differing in chemical constitution fromcaoutchouc. but assuming similar form and physical properties; in the second case the two substances w mild resemble :each other in chemical constitution, but differing in form and physical proper t, s. The Gutta . Percha, however, appears in a variety of forms, in. some of which it closely resembles caoutchouc in physical properties, while in other forms these properties are hard, -recognised. According to F ra day, the composition of cagutchoiuc is carbon 87.2 and hydrogen. 12.8. According to Dr. Maclagan, the composition of Gutta Percha is, carbon 86.36, hydrogen 1 215, while, according to Soubeiran, Gutta Percha gives carbon 87.8, hydrogen 12.2. The disagreement in these two analyses would warrant further investigation, and it seems not unlikely that the new substance will be found iso medical with caoutchouc. Like caoutchouc it is so ruble in coal nap the, in caoutchoucine, in turpentine, and in ether and insoluble in alcohol and water. I to most remarkable and distinctive property, as stated by Dr. Maclagan in his communication to, the Scottish Society of Arts, is the effect of heat upon it. When placed in water at 110 War, no effect is produced upon it; but when the temperature is raised to 145 or upwards, it gradually becomes so soft and pliant as to be capable of being moulded into army form, or of being rolled out into flat plates. When in the soft state it possesses all the elasticity of common india rubbed, but it does not retain this property long. It soon again begins to grow hard, and, in a. short time, varying a cording to, the temperature and the size of the piece, regains its original hardness and rigidity. The specific heat of this substance has not yet been determined, and it would be interesting to compare it, in this respect, with caoutchouc22. X. and spongy, pale colored, and traversed by longitudinal receptacles or reservoirs, filled with the gum forming e bony black lines. It appears that a gentleman, Dr. Montgomerie, was the person who first brought the Gutta Percha into public notice. He writes thus in the Magazine of Science, 1845 : I may not claim the actual discovery of Gutta- Percha, for though quite unknown to Europeans, a few inhabitants of certain parts of the Malay an forests were acquainted with it. Any, however, of their neighbors residing in the adjacent native villages, had never heard of it; and the use to which it was applied was very trifling, for I could only ascertain that it was occasionally employed to make handles forparangs (or wood choppers) instead of wood or buffalo horn. To long ago as 1822,when I was assistant surgeon at Singapore, I was told of Gutta Percha, in connexion with caoutchouc; and some very fine specimens were brought to me. There are three varieties of this substance, Gutta Fire k, Gutta Cuban, and Gutta Percha. I may here mention that the latter name is often erroneously pronounced in England, the ch is sounded by the Malayans like these letters in our word perch (a fish) And attention to this point is of some importance; for if our countrymen were to ask the natives for Gutta, Her ca, they would probably be told that such a substance was unknown, while plenty of Gutta Percha might be procured by pronouncing the word correctly. The name is pure Malay an; Gutta meaning the gum, or concrete juice of the plant, and Percha, (pronounced Percha) the particular tree from which it is obtained. I could not help thinking that the tree itself must exist in Yuma tra, and perhaps derive its name from thence, theMalayan name for Yuma tra being Full Percha; but though the Straits ofMalacca are situated only one degree to the north of Singapore, I could not find that the substance has ever been heard of there or in Yuma tra. But to return to the period when I first noticed the pa rang handle that was made of Gutta Percha; my curiosity being excited by the novelty of the i material, I questioned the workman, a Malay woods man, in whose possession I saw it, and heard that the material of which it was formed could be moulded into any other form by dipping it into boiling water till it was heated through, when it became plastic as clay, re gaining when cold its original hardness and rigidity. Dr. Montgomerie goes on to say that he purchased the pa rang handle and se it for more of the substance, and that on instituting experiments he ascertained that Gutta Percha was likely to prove a most valuable material for making those parts of surgical instruments which had hitherto been formed of caoutchouc, the latter having the inconvenience of being easily injured by damp and hot weather in the tropics. Themedical Board of Calcutta highly approved of Dr. Is suggestion, and the Society of Arts in London awarded him its gold medal for the discovery. I ll ness prevented Dr. M. at that period, from visiting the forests where the tree grows. He, however, ascertained from the natives that the Percha is one of their largest trees, attaining a diameter of three or four feet; that its wood is of no value as timber, but that a concrete and ed able oil, used by the natives with their food, is obtained from the fruit. In many parts of the island of Singapore, and in the forests of Oh one, at the extremity of the Malay an peninsula, the tree is found; it was also said to grow at To ti, on the south eastern coast of For neo, and Dr. Montgomerie addressed his inquiries to the celebrated Mr. Rook e, resident at Faraway, and was assured by that gentleman that it in habits commonly the woods there also, and is called Jviato by the people, who are not, however, acquainted with x. a. 23 the properties of the sap. Mr. Rook e says the tree is often six feet in diameter at Or away, and is believed to be plentiful all over For neo, and probably at the thousand islands that cluster to the south of the Fruits ofSingapore. I to frequency is proved by the circumstance that several hundred tons of the Gutta Percha have been annually exported from Singaporesincle 1842, when the substance first came into notice. There is reason, however, to fear that the supply must shortly decrease, and the price be raised, from the wasteful mode in which the natives collect it, often sacrificing a noble tree, of, probably from fifty to one hundred years growth, for the sake of twenty or thirty pounds of gum, which' is the largest, quantity any one trunk ever affords. The juice might, in all likelihood, be obtained from the. Percha, as from other trees, by tapping, and thus procuring a smaller portion for several successive years; but this process is too slow for the Malayans, and is also less likely to be adopted because the forests are common property. The people fell the tree, strip off its bark, and collect its milky juice in a trough formed of the hollow stem. of the plant ain leaf, when, being exposed to the air, it soon coagulates. Dr. Montgomerie suggests, among the less immediately obvious uses to which Gutta Percha is applicable, that of making raised type for the blind, and embossed maps for the same unfortunate beings ; it takes a clear, sharp impression, and is also tough and dura lee; he thinks it would likewise be found serviceable in stopping delayed teeth. In the abstract of the new patents given in the October number of the. Of a gaze of Science and the Arts, we notice that C. An cock, Esq, has taken out a patent for improving the manufacture of Gutta Percha, He suggests several methods of purifying the substance, which generally comes here much mixed with extraneous matter. It may be dissolved by heat and strained, or passed through a screw press, or melted by the addition of rectified oil of turpentine; and, after filtering through flannel or felt, the solvent may be elaborated. In every case the Gutta Percha should form aresiduum of the consistency of dough or putty this plastic state being gained by the maintenance of a suitable temperature during the above process. Mr. An cock would combine Gutta Percha with caoutchouc, and a substance called gin ta wan, (we have no clue to what this gin ta wan may be in order to form an elastic material imperious to water; varying the proportions according to the greater or less degree of hardness or elasticity required for making elastic bands, a compound is used where 50 parts of Gutta Percha are combined with 24 of gin ta wan, 20 of caoutchouc, and 6 of or pigment. From a mixture of these, Mr. An cock also prepares a light, porous and spongy material suited for stuffing or forming the seats of chairs, cushions, mat tresses, saddles, &c; likewise, springs of clocks, clasps, belts, garters, and strings. Wherever the requisite is flexibility and elasticity, then the quantity of Gutta Percha should be diminished, and increased where firmness is wanted. By pro longing the process much hardness maybe a q tired, and moulds and balls of Gutta Percha will bear turning in the lathe, like wood or ivory. The material is also applicable to useful and ornamental purposes, as picture frames, door handles, walking sticks, chessmen, handles of swords, and knives, buttons, combs, flutes, &c, &c. Wythe admixture of sulphuric acid, or of a tenth or larger part of vegetable wax :or tallow, any. degree ,of sol ability, plan cy and softness may be acquired; or the composition may be used as varnish to cover other materials 24 X. concealing any odor, and imparting a surface imperious to water. I n printing and painting of silk or cotton, it seems applicable to, many uses, for it amalgam ates readily with colors; when interposed between two thin sheets of gold leaf or tin foil, it combines them firmly in one. Numerous are the purposes to which Mr. An cock proposes applying theGuitta Percha, but the above named may suffice for our readers. Gutta Percha. Soubeiran; (your. de Harm, et de Him, Any 1847) The chemical relations of Gutta Percha are almost identical with those of caoutchouc, separated from impure ties by hot water and from the accompanying resins by alcohol and ether, the substance was obtained in a state of purity by Soubeiran. Submitted to an analysis it gave carbon 87.8,hydrogen 12.2; while according to Vara day, caoatchouc gave carbon 8 72, hydrogen 12.8. The action of solvents is also similar with the two substances. Later and. alcohol have no effect; ether and most volatile oils produce only imperfect solution. The true solvent is oil of turpentine, which produces a clear and color less solution, from which the Gutta Percha may be obtained unchanged, by evaporation. The specific gravity of Gutta Percha is 0.9791, that of caoutchoucbeing 0.9355. Prolonged exposure to a temperature of about 3000 produces translucent e and a deeper gray color; but hot or cold water gradually restore the primitive appearance. An application suggests itself to us which we have not as yet seen mentioned. We refer to its use as a substitute for cork and other materials for air tight closure of chemical vessels, through which tubes, &c. are to be passed. There is no doubt that in the hands of the chemist this substance will soon become one of his most valuable materials. Before the British Association, (Atheneum No. 1027,) Mr. Luck having alluded to his experiments, described the mode he followed in obtaining his <a name="mould3"><mark>mould</mark></a>. It is to be rolled out on a smooth surface in sheets of 'any convenient size: suitable to the object to be taken, and varying in thickness according to the size. For small objects, from the 1 to -of an inch, is thick enough. The sheet is dipped for a moment or two into boiling water, and placed warm upon the object, upon the surface of which it is to be carefully pressed with the finger point, or a convenient elastic pad, so as to insure its close and uniform adaptation. In moulding soft objects, it is of course necessary that they should possess elasticity or presidency, as is the case with living or recently dead animal bodies. The Gutta Percha does not seem to be applicable to taking moulds from very fragile bodies such as many fossils which would not bear the requisite pressure nor admit of the removal of the <a name="mould4"><mark>mould</mark></a> when rigid, without risk. The most delicate objects, however, and slender projections, if firm enough in the original, may in the plaster cast be removed from the matrix without any difficulty when the latter is softened by momentary immersion in hot water. Mr. Her dan stated that there were two kinds of Gutta Percha-one white, the other black. The former was the best for modeling. He had written to Mr. Rook e of For neo, on the subject, who informed him that an unlimited supply might be obtained from that country. Mr. Crawford said it was not hard till after it was submitted to theheatEx. of boiling water. The proper way of pronouncing the ,word was Guttapertsha, which was a Malay term and dignified ragged gum n. Caoutchoucthe prepared caoutchouc has been before submitted to. a high heat for the purposes of drying and induration; but a patent has been granted for exposing the article to a high heat when Paris white is introduced as apart of the composition. The patentee avert that the rubber thus prepared will resist the heat of the sun and artificial heat, and is not affected by exposure to cold. The degree of heat used is 560 Fahrenheit. As nearly all the fabrics of prepared rubber have been very objectionable for articles of clothing or wear about the person from the odor and dis coloring property of sulphur, any improvement dispersing with this offensive ingredient will be received with general interest. There have been various modes in occasional use for preparing rubber without this odor, but as the process of drying by sulphur is sq much cheaper, it has come into general use to the exclusion of all others. A patent has been granted for a process of preparing this substance without the aid of free sulphur, and, as it is alleged, with equal economy. The specimens exhibited to this office were entirely devoid of sulphur out odor and of remarkably good texture. The invention consists in the employment of the acids of sulphur of a lower degree of oxygenation than sulphuric acid, in combination with suitable bases The patentee prefers the use of the hyposulphites alone or in combination with other salts of the acids of sulphur as for instance, the sulphates or with sulphur its. Another mode also of preparing the rubber has been patented, consisting of a series of novel steps or methods of treatment to be adopted before the complete fabric is obtained. The first is the reasoning process, substituted for the old plan of exposing the raw rubber to the action of the atmosphere, which was slow and tedious. By the new process the rubber is exposed to the joint action of air and steam at 2000 Fahrenheit, until the sap, as it is termed, is entirely removed. The second step is that of drying the rubber when it is spread out. and in the sticky or tack y condition. The rubber is exposed to the heat of steam at 2500 or 300, in an apparatus of peculiar construction, and is managed so as to avoid the condensation of steam upon the goods. The third process is that of sulphuring or thionizing, as it is now generally termed. I instead of mixing the sulphur with the mass, the rubber is submitted to the action of the fumes of sulphur or sulphur out acid gas, either before or during the curing process. The fourth is the substitute for running, a method formerly adopted, and one of much uncertainty. The rubber, while its surface has the peculiar clammy feeling is exposed to the va prizing action of a rapid current of air. There are also three other claims to machinery and contrivances by which the above principles of operation are carried into effect. As a matter of general information it may be well to observe here, that the method of preparing india rubber by solution in turpentine or othermenstruum, is mostly discontinued. The rubber is reduced to a pasty mass by a heavy grinding operation, and then carried through a succession of rollers until it is brought into sheets of uniform texture. During the grinding operation great heat is developed, and during the rolling great quantities of electricity. Turpentine and Losing patent has been granted for refining turpentine26Ex. for the production of the pine oil, as it is termed, for burning in lamps. The resin out matter is separated by treating the turpentine with potash a, and in order to effect thorough admixture the liquid is forced through a succession of fine straineds. After this operation rain water is added and the whole suffered to stand for twelve hours, when the pure spirits will be found flowing above the water and impure ties, from which it is drawn off. A patent has been granted for an improvement in the distillation of crude turpentine, consisting merely of an agitator or stirring apparatus, working without the still, the shaft of the agitator passing through a stuffing box in the top of the still. The stirring of various liquids in the operation of boiling is a common device, but has never been before applied in the production of turpentine, and is in this case, as asserted, attended with considerable advantages. Turpentine consists of two liquids, one boiling at a much higher temperature than the other, which is obvious from the very interesting fact, that while boiling without pressure its temperature may be raised more than 2000. In view of this constitution of turpentine, (although unknown to the inventor of the improvement) the application of the stirred in this particular case was considered novel and advantageous. Le aching Resin patent has been granted for a mode of be aching resin by the following process: Take 12 gallows of caustic potash or soda of 50 to 100 hydrometer, for heavy liquids, and raise the let to a boiling heat. This is then charged with a barrel of resin and the heat continued until the water boils through it. When add 15 gallons of boiling water, continuing the heat with agitation; and when it has boiled five minutes the heat is discontinued, but the agitation kept up as long as practicable. The all ali is drawn off and the coloring matter washed out with boiling waterBleaching Shellaca patent has been granted for be aching this substance by first treating it by heat with pure carbonate of potash and subsequently with chloride of lime mixed with chloride of soda. Barbaric acid is then added to the solution, when the pure gum floats upon the surface and is removed and washed. The specimens of the bleached gum and the bleached resin were both exhibited and proved the success of the operationrSugarSeveral patents have been granted for alleged improvements in making sugar, relating to the first operation in the cane juice. This most critical, and hence, in reality, the most important step in the process of sugar making, has been, within a few years past, the subject of such varied experiments and diverse opinions that nothing definite can be said" of the value of the several inventions for which letters patent have been granted. The chemical changes are so rapid in the expressed juice of the cane that it becomes of the highest importance to defeat e quickly, or remove those substances which cause such changes. Letters patent have been granted for a process aiming at this object, in which the cane juice is speedily brought to a heat above the boiling point by heating under pressure, as it is alleged, for the purpose of more effectual y coagulating the albuminous matter and causing the separation of otherimpurities. Another patent has been granted for defeating cane juices by means of the saceharate of lime instead of the cream of lime, commonly used and subsequently removing the lime by means of an acid or acid salt. The inventor proposes the use of sulphur out, sulphuric or phosphorus acid. X. a. Paper Pulp patent has been granted for the mode of making the pulp from straw. The. material of straw has long been used for this purpose, but the mode of' treatment is believed to be new and is as follows The straw, or other vegetable fibrous material, is heated or boiled with milk of lime twelve hours, in a suitable boiler, and the lime and coloring matter washed out in a suitable tub. The fibrous matter is then transferred to mills tones, so arranged as to crush it, and at the end of this operation the pulp matter is again transferred to another tub for further washing out the coloring matter. The pulp y matter is next removed to a second set of boilers, where fresh lime water and an alkaline solution of the strength of two to four degrees of the hydrometer is supplied, and the heat continued for six hours. At the end of this time the whole liquor and pulp are forced up by steam pressure into a third washing tub, where it is washed, and sulphuric or m uratic acid of the ordinary strength used for be aching purposes, is supplied, and the contents kept in agitation for two hours, and the acid is then entirely washed out. The pulp is next returned to the second set of boilers, where it is mixed with all ali of the strength of two to four degrees of thehydrometer, and boiled four hours, or until the all ali is spent. The pulp and liquor are again forced up into the third washing tub, and all so ruble matters washed out of it. Chloride of lime of the ordinary be aching strength is now added, and agitation kept up for two hours longer when steam is let on and the boiling continued until the salt is spent, when the whole is discharged into the fourth tub, where the spent chloride of lime is washed out. The pulp is now subjected to the operation of pouring, which consists of submitting it to the action of acid and water of the usual strength used for be aching, and keeping the whole in agitation for four hours. It is now ready to be discharged into a fifth tub or set of tubs, when the process is considered as completed. The most interesting and probably the most valuable of the patents granted during the last year, under the subject of chemistry, are two which have been granted to an American citizen, now residing in England. One is for the manufacture of sulphate and m urate of potash from fields par, and the other for decomposing alkaline salts by the action of steam at a high temperature. The latter appears highly interesting as a purely scientific discovery, apart from its practical value. In this exhibition of the solvent power of steam, we see at once a new, powerful and most economical chemical re agent. In the process of decomposing fields par, the inventor heats together a potash fields par, lime or its carbonate, and the sulphate of either lime, baryta or, strontia, and afterwards lixiviates the mixture with water. The heat is to be kept at or above redness. In obtaining the m urate of potash, the m urate of either soda, lime or iron is added to the potash fields par, in place of the sulphate above mentioned, the modes opera n di being substantially the same as in obtaining the sulphate. The process of decomposing salts by steam is so rep let with interest and novelty as to warrant the c station in full of its description by the inventor. My invention consists in a method of decomposing the sulphates andmuriates of the alkalies and alkaline earths, by exposing them at a high temperature to a current of steam or vapor of water, by which the acid is carried off, and the alkaline base either remains free, or enters into combination with some third substance provided for that purpose28Ex. a. To de compose sulphate of lime, and obtain from it sulphuric and sulphur out acids, and free lime, I proceed in the following manner: I have a fire clay cylinder of close texture, and of any convenient size, placed vertically in a furnace, and provided with openings at the top and bottom for charging and discharging, which openings are capable of being closed air tight. To the top of this cylinder I adapt are escape -tube of fire clay, for conveying off the acid vapors; and to the bottom, for the admission of the steam, I adapt another clay pipe, connected 'with a steam boiler, by a series of fire clay tubes, which are to be kept at a red heat. In order to diminish the co erosion of the cylinder by the sulphate of lime or the lime itself ,I line it with a coating of native carbon rate of magnetic, applied in a similar manner to the usual clay linings of chemical furnaces fill the cylinder with pieces of sulphate of lime, about a quarter of an inch in diameter, and i having lured the openings air tight, I heat the cylinder arid its contents to a high red heat. I then pass steam from the boiler, through the red hot clay tubes, into the bottom of the cylinder, and up through the charge. The heated steam, in its passage through the pieces of sulphate of lime, carries off the acid in the state of sulphur out acid and oxygen, with sometimes a little sulphuric acid mixed with it. The acid vapors pass off by the escape tube at the top of the cylinder, and I convey them by stone ware tubes into a leaden chamber, in order to combine them into sulphuric acid by the usual means. I take care that the heat is not raised so high at first as to melt the sulphate of lime in the cylinder, but I increase it towards the end of the operation, the charge becoming more invisible when partly de composed. I have an opening in the tube conveying off the acid vapors from the top of the cylinder, by in means of which I examine the vapors from time to time, and from the relative aridity of these, ascertained by the usual tests, I judge of the progress of the operation. I regulate by a stop cock the quantity of steam passed through the charge in the cylinder, maintaining the supply at that point which produces the greatest quantity of acid in the Vwpors. When the vapors cease to contain any notable proportion of acid, the cylinder arid its contents being at a high red or low white heat shut off the k team, withdraw. the charge from the cylinder by the lower opening, and put in a fresh one to be treated like the first. The charge thus operated upon will be found to consist chiefly of caustic lime. When I wish to out ai. the acid and alkaline base from the sulphate of magnetic, I first drive off by heat all its water. Then introduce it, in small pieces, into a cylinder such as I have before described, and operate upon it in the, manner directed for the sulphate of lime. But I take care to keep the heat at Ilwredness at fir t, to prevent the fusion of the charge, which would c like up the cylinder and prevent the passage of the steam. The decomposition of the sulphate of magnetic takes place at a much lower temperature than tliatof sulphate of lime, (a low red heat is sufficient) and a considerable part of the acid is given off in the state of sulphuric acid. When the charge has been treated as directed, the residue will be found to consist chiefly of caustic magnetic. When I wish to de compose the sulphates of baryta and strontia, I operate upon them in a reverberating furnace. This mode is less advantageous for the manufacture of sulphuric acid than the use of the close cylinder formerly described, but I prefer it for the two last mentioned sal is, because I consider their bases the more important product of their decomposition, and the hydrates of these alkalies, and particularly that of baryta, being visible, X. Doc.  No. 54.* 29 would have much tendency to cor rode the interior of the cylinder, at the heat necessary to de compose the salts. I use a common reverberatory furnace, with its hearth covered with a compact bed of native carbonate ofmagnesia, three or four inches thick Several clay steam pipes are introduced through the roof of the furnace, so as to throw a current of heated steam over the whole width of the hearth; these pipes are connected with a steam boiler by a series of fire clay tubes kept red hot. The sulphate, broken into pieces of about half an inch in diameter, is spread over the lining of carbonate of magnetic on the hearth of the furnace, and brought to a high red or low white heat. A current of steam is then admitted from the boiler, through the red hot tubes, upon the charge. The acid of the sulphate is carried off by the steam, and when I wish to condensed it, the acid vapors are conveyed along with the gase: of the fire into a leaden chamber, to be combined into sulphuric acid by the usual means. The quantity of steam thrown upon the charge is kept at the point which produces the most rapid evolution of acid, and the charge is stirred occasionally, so as to expose fresh surfaces to the action of the steam. Is the contact of de oxidising gases with the sulphate is injurious, I admit, if necessary, by suitable openings above the fuel, such an excess of air as will render the atmosphere in the furnace oxidising. The sulphate of strontiarequires a higher heat than the sulphate of lime for its decomposition, and the sulphate of baryta still higher than the sulphate of strontia. When the sulphate of baryta is partly de composed the mass melts and becomes more visible as the decomposition proceeds. I judge of the progress of the operation by testing a portion of the charge from time to time when it dissolves altogether or nearly so in dilute nitric acid, I withdraw the charge which now consists chiefly of the hydrate of baryta or strontia. To obtain m uratic acid, and the hydrates of baryta, orstrontia, or caustic line from the m urates of these bases, I employ the same process as that above described for the decomposition of the sulphate of baryta. The sulphates of potash and soda may to some extent be decomposes by being subjected at a high temperature to the action of a current of steam in the manner directed for the decomposition of the sulphate of baryta. But owing probably to the volatile nature of the bases of these salts at a high temperature, no large proportion of them can thus be obtained in a free state. To aid therefore the decomposing action of the steam, I employ some substance capable when mixed with these sulphates, highly heated and, exposed to steam, of forming a combination with their alkaline bases which shall yet when cold give up the all ali to the action either of water or of water and carbonic acid. Of. the large class of substances possessing these properties which for convenience, I will call combining substances, I prefer to use either aluminaor the sub phosphates of alum in a. The alum in a is prepared by strongly in iting the sulphate of alum in a, or by any other well known process. Thesubphosphate of alum in a is prepared (as directed in chemical works) by mixing solutions of the phosphates of soda, and the sulphate of alum in a, and adding to the solution a slight excess of ammonia. I mix the alum in a in the state of powder with an equal weight of the sulphate of potash or of soda also powdered, and spread the mixture upon the hearth of a reverberatory furnace, such as I have before described for the decomposition of the sulphate of baryta. The mixture is then heated, exposed to steam, stirred, and the operation conducted in all respects in the manner described for the x. 
treatiunt of the sulphate of baryta. When it is desired to collect the sulphuric and sulphur out acids produced by the decomposition of the sulphates of potash and soda, I prefer to moist en the mixture of alum in a and the sulphate with water, and form it into balls about half an inch in. diameter, which I heat and expose to steam in a close cylinder in the manner formerly described for the sulphate of lime. When a specimen of the charge shows by the usual tests that it contains no notable proportion of sulphate under composed, the operation is completed. I then withdraw the charge, lixiviate it with hot water, and when the clear solution of alum in ate of potash or soda thus obtained has become cold, I pass through it an excess of carbonic acid until no more precipitate of alum in a is formed. The clear solution of carbonate of potash or soda is then drawn off and elaborated. Thealumina thus recovered is again used as the combining substance. When  wish to obtain the alum in ate of potash or of soda, I :merely e vapor ate the solution above described without introducing the carbonic acid. The m urate of potash or of soda I merely e vapor ate the solution above described without introducing the carbonic acid. The m urate of potash or of soda may also be de composed when in a fused: state by the action of steam, alum in a or the sub phosphates of aluminabeing present the operation is to be conducted in all respects in the same manner as that just described for the sulphates of potash and soda. But owing to the great vol ability of the m urates of potash and soda when exposed at a high temperature to a current of air or steam, a large quantity of the m urate will escape with the steam and gases, of the fire in the state of vapor under composed, and will be lost or will be difficult to con dense. I prefer therefore to effect the decomposition of the m urates of potash and soda by causing their vapors intimately mixed with highly heated steam to pass slowly through a mass of small pieces of alum in a kept at a high red heat. I use for this purpose a vertical fire clay cylinder lined with a coating of native carbonate of magnetic to diminish the co erosion of its sides by the all ali, and made with convenient openings at top and bottom for charging and discharging, which openings should be capable of being closed air tight. I arrange a cast iron retort so that its tube enters directly the cylinder near its bottom. The retort should have a charging door at the top capable of being made air tight, through which is introduced the m urate of potash or soda to be de composed. The m urates of potash and soda will not vapor i ze freely when fused and highly heated, unless the atmosphere above them is continually changed. This may be effected by a current of steam, and I find that I can sufficiently regulate the quantity of the salt volatiled from the retort, by the amount of steam which I blow over its melted surface. I therefore insert a' small steam pipe into the top of the retort, so as to throw a jet of heated steam upon the surface of the melted salt, and thus force its vapor to enter the cylinder. The quantity of steam thus introduced to aid the volatilizationis not sufficient to de compose all the salt vol utilized. The rest of the steam necessary for this purpose is passed directly into the cylinder by a fire clay pipe entering it near the bottom, and connected through a series of fire clay tubes kept red hot with a steam boiler. Both steam pipes are provided with cocks, an escape tube is inserted into the top of the cylinder to convey the acid vapor and the vapor of any under composed m urate into suitable condensers. I have an opening in this tube, by which I can withdraw at times a portion of the vapors in it, to examine their saline and acid character six. a. The cylinder and retort are to be so constructed and arranged as to allow their contents to be heated to high redness and upwards by any of the well known means- The mode of operating is as follows: The discharging door being. closed air tight I fill the cylinder with alum in a in pieces of about one quarter of an inch in diameter and fill the retort with the m urate of potash or soda and then close both the charging door of the cylinder and that of the retort air tight. I now bring the cylinder to a high red or white heat and the retort to a cherry red heat, so that the salt in it is melted and ready tovolatilize freely at the admission of steam upon its surface: steam is now passed from the boiler through the red hot tubes into the cylinder by the pipe entering near its bottom, so, that is filled with highly heated steam passing upwards in a slow current through the interstices of the pieces ofalumina. I now admit by degrees a jet of heated steam into the salt retort, by the pipe entering its top, and thus drive a quantity of salt vapor into the cylinder, where it miles thoroughly with the current of steam which has entered by the other pipe, and ascends with it through the column of highly heated alum in a. In its passage the alkaline base of the m urate combined with the alum in a, forming an alum in ate of potash or soda and the muriaticacid together with any salt vapor which may have escaped decomposition, passes off with the steam through the escape tube at the top of the cylinder into the condensers provided. The progress of the operation can be ascertained by examining the nature of the vapors which are passing through the escape tube. When these vapors contain a large quantity of salt and are strongly acid at the time, I admit more steam through the pipe leading directly into the cylinder, and if this does not have the effect of diminishing the quantity of salt in the vapors, I lessen the quantity of steam thrown into the salt retort, and by that means decrease the supply of salt vapor driven into the cylinder. There the escaping vapors contain but little salt and a large quantity of acid, I consider the operation as proceeding favorably and I always endeavor to regulate the quantities of steam passed through the two pipes and by that means, the proportions of salt vapor and steam thrown intothe cylinder so as to produce this effect. When the escaping vapors contain a large quantity of salt and steam and but little acid, the cylinder and its contents being at a high red heat, I consider that the decomposition of the salt is no longer effected in the cylinder, and I then shut off both currents of steam, withdraw the charge by the lower door and replace it by fresh alum in a. The withdrawn charge is then lexiviated with hot water, and the solution of alum in ate of potash or soda thus obtained is treated with carbonic acid, as before described. The lining of the cylinder should be examined occasionally, and kept in repair so that the fire clay may not be cor roded by the all ali. Provided the charge of alum in a in the cylinder is readily and equally per me able to the current of steam and salt vapor, the smaller the pieces of which it consists and the greater the surface they expose to the current, the more rapidly will the decomposition of the m urate proceed. The steam used need not be of a higher boiler pressure than will suffice to secure its passage through the charge in the cylinder. The sub phosphates of alum irina may be substituted for the alum in a in the processes for the decomposition of the sulphate andmuriates of potash and soda, and its action is even more powerful, but its first cost is greater. Although to aid the decomposition of the sulphates andmuriatesof potash and soda by steam at a high temperature, the use f eitheralumina or its sub phosphates is preferred as the combining substance, yet there 32 X. are a great number of substances which also possess the requisite properties, but act with various degrees of energy. Thus many salts which contain already a certain proportion of base, will yet, when exposed in contact with the sulphates and m urates of potash and soda, at a high heat to the action of steam form a combination with the potash or soda decomposable, when cold by water or water and carbonic acid." The sub phosphates of lime, baryta, and strontia, and the subsilicates of lime, baryta, and strontia, will under these circumstances combine with the all ali and yield it to the action of water alone when cold. The sulphates of baryta and strontia although themselves decomposable by the action of steam at high temperatures are still capable of thus aiding in the decomposition of the sulphates, and m urates of potash and soda, and yield the all ali by the action of water. The neutral phosphates, and neutral silicates of potash and soda, when thus treated form basic salts which are so ruble in water and decomposable by carbonic acid. The alkalies, lime and magnetic, will l so thus combine with a portion of free potash or soda which may be extracted by water. Other materials are capable of being- used as combining substances; but I have named these which I consider preferable The decomposition of the m urate of soda by the action of steam at a high temperature may be applied to the production of sulphate of soda by exposing the m urate mixed with sulphate of lime to a high heat and to the current of steam. For this process I use a horizontal cylinder of close fire ware, protected on the inside from the action of the lime or the sulphate by ining of carbonate of magnetic, and provided with ;an opening for charging capable of being made ai" tight. i I n to :the top of cylinder, at one end, a steam pipe is introduced, and from the other end at the top an escape pipe connect with suitable condensers for collecting the va prized salt and acid. The cylinder is half filled with a mixture t of equal parts by weight of sulphate of lime and muriateof soda, the opening made air tight, and the cylinder and :its contents brought to a red heat. A current of heated steam is then admitted which passes over the surface of the melted mixture and carries off m uratic acid with more or less vol utilized salt into the condensers. When the steam escaping from the cylinder ceases to contain any notable quantity of m uratic acid, the operation is discontinued and the charge is withdrawn. I to so ruble salts are extracted by water and the sulphate of soda separated from any under composed m urate by evaporation and crystal ligation. In this operation the heat should not be raised so high as to cause the decomposition by the steam of the sulphate of soda produced, or the sulphate of lime itself. Though I prefer in all the above described processes heating, the steam highly before passing it upon the salt to be de composed, yet the psameeffectwill be produced whenever the stern and salt are in contact at. the proper temperature for the respective decompositions, whether they have both been previously heated, or one alone heated so highly as to be able to raise the other to the required temperature. As has been before stated, some of i the salts are decomposable by steam at a much lower temperature than others, but with all the decomposition proceeds more rapidly in proportion as  the heat is increased. -I claim as my invention the decomposing the sulphates of baryta, strontia, lime, and magnetic, and the m urates of baryta, strontia and lime, by: expose x. Doc . No. 4. 33ing them at a high temperature to the action of a current of stamp for the purpose of obtaining the acids and the alkalies of these salts respectively. I also claim thud decomposing the sulphates and urates of potash and soda, for the' purpose of obtaining the acids and the alkalies of these salts respectively, by exposing them at a high temperature- to the action of a current, of steam- alum in a, or the other combining substances, being present. I also claim making alum in ate' of potash and soda :by the action of a current of steam upon a mixture of alum in a and the sulphate or m urate of potash or sod at a high red heat. I also claim the making sulphate of soda by The action i of a current of steam upon the m urate of soda at a red heat, sulphate of lime being present as described.

Photographic Pictures patent has been granted for a process of producing and fixing pictures upon paper. It has been known for some time to the scientific community as the Talbotype. Such a knowledge would dear a patent in England, but a subject of Great Britain or any other foreign power may, at any time subsequent to the publication of his invention in a foreign country, take out letters patent in this country, provided the invention has not been introduced into common use in the United States, and that in all such cases the term of the patent is limited to fourteen years from the date of publication of the foreign letters patent. It was known to the office that the Talbotype had been the subject of experiment with individuals as a matter of investigation and scientific amusement, but this could not be construed as public and common use, and the patent has been accordingly granted. The description of the process by the inventor is full of scientific and practical interest, and is as follows, viz The first part of my invention is a method of making paper extremely sensitive to the rays of light. For this purpose I select the best writing paper having a smooth surface and a close and even texture. First part of the preparation of the paper dissolve one hundred grains of crystallized it rate of silver in six ounces of distilled water. I wash one side of the paper with this solution with a soft camels hair brush and place 334 X. a mary upon that side by which to know it again, I dry the paper cautiously at a distant fire, or else I leave it to dry spontaneously in a dark place. Next   dip the paper in a solution of iodide of potassium containing five hundred grains of that salt dissolved in one pint of water; I leave the paper a minute or two in this solution, I then take it out and dip in water; I then dry it lightly with blotting paper and finish drying it at a fire, or else I leave it to dry spontaneously. The paper thus far prepared may be called for the sake of distinction iodi red paper. When well made it is quite insensible to the action of light, and will keep for many years without suffering any change. Second part of the preparation of paper his second part is best deferred until the paper is wanted for us. When that time is arrived, I take a sheet of the iodi red paper and wash it with a liquid prepared in the following manner: Dissolve one hundred grains of crystallized nitrate of silver in two ounces of distilled water. To this solution add one-sixth of its volume of strong ace tic acid: let this mixture be called A.; dissolve crystallized garlic acid in distilled water, as much as it will dissolve, (which is a very small quantity) let this solution be called B. When you wish to prepare a sheet of paper for use, mix together the liquids A. and B. in equal volumes. This mixture I shall call by name of gallon it rate of silver. Met no more be mixed than is intended to be used at one time, because the mixture will not keep good for a long period. When take a sheet of iodizedpaper and wash it over with this gallon it rate of silver with a soft camel s hair brush, taking care to wash it on the side which has been previously marked. This operation should be performed by candle light; let the paper rest half a minute and then dry it lightly with blotting paper. When nearly or quite dry the paper is for use; but it is advisable to use it within a short short time after its preparation. Use of the Paperthe paper thus prepared, and which I call talbotypepaper, is placed in a camera obscure, so to receive the image formed in the focus of the lens. Of course, the paper must be screened or defended from the light during the time it is being put into the camera; when the camera is properly pointed at the object this screen is withdrawn, or a pair of internal folding doors are opened, so as to expose the paper for the reception of the image. If the object is very bright or the time employed sufficiently long a sensible image is perceived upon the paper, when it is withdrawn from the camera. But when the time is short or the objects dim, no image whatever is visible upon the paper, which appears entirely blank. Nevertheless, it is impressed with an invisible image, and I have discovered the means of causing this image to become visible, This is performed as follows take some gallon it rate of silver, prepared in the manner before directed, and with this liquid I wash the paper all over with a soft camels hair brush. Then hold it before a gentle fire! and in a short time, (varying from a few seconds to a minute or two) the image begins to appear upon the paper. Those parts of the paper upon which light has acted the most strongly, become brown or black, while those parts on which light has not acted, remains white. The image continues to strengthen and grow more and more visible during some time; when it appears strong enough, the operation should be terminated and the picture fixed. The Fixing Process n order to fix the picture thus obtained, I first dip it into water, I then partly dry it with blotting paper, and then wash it with a solution of bromides of potassium containing one hundred grains of the x. Doc.  Of. 4.salt dissolved in eight or te i ounces of water, or else I fix it with a hot solution of hyposulphite of soda in the way described in a subsequent part of this specification. The picture is then washed with water, and then finally dried. The picture thus obtained will have its lights and shades reversed with respect to the natural objects, videlicet, the lights of the objects are represented by shades, and vice versa I call it a negative. But it is easy from this negative picture to obtain another which shall be positive or conform able to nature, videlicet, a picture in which lights shall be represented by lights, and the shades by shades. It is only necessary for this purpose to take a second sheet of the same sensitive paper and place it in close contact with the first, upon which the picture has been formed; a board is put beneath them and a sheet of glass above; the whole is pressed into close contact by screws. Being then placed in sunshine or daylight for a short time, an image or copy is formed upon the second sheet of paper. This image or copy is often invisible at first, but the image may be made to appear in the same way that has been already stated; but I do not recommend that the copy should be taken on this kind of sensitive paper, on the contrary, I would advise that it should be taken on common photographic paper. His paper is made by washing good writing paper first with a weak solution of common salt, and next with a solution of nitrate of silver; but since it is well known, having been freely communicated to the public by myself in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine, and that it forms no part of the present invention, I need not describe it here more particularly. Although it takes a much longer time to obtain a copy upon this paper, yet the tints of the copy are generally more harmonious and agreeable. In order to fix such positive copies, I recommend to dip them into three separate vessels of warm water, then into a cold solution of hyposulphite of soda, and lastly to dip them once more into three separate vessels of warm water. The following may be considered auxiliary and additional modifications of my discovery or invention. I sometimes take a sheet of iodi red paper and wash it over with a solution of garlic acid in water, and then dry it. Paper so prepared, I call lo garlic paper; it will remain good a considerable time if kept in a press or portfolio. When wanted for use I wash it with a solution of nut rate of silver, which renders it sensitive to light and fit to be used in the camera. This process differs from the Talbotype process before described by me, in not using the nitrate of silver and garlic acid in conjunction. I find it is advantageous to use them separately on many occasions because it removed the great inconvenience arising from the speedy decomposition of gallon it rate of silver. Since the yellowish tint of some Talbotype negative pictures impedes the process of taking copies from them; in order to remedy this defect, I plunge the picture into a hot bath of hyposulphite of soda or any other so ruble hyposulphite, dissolved in about ten times its weight of water. This solution should be heated to nearly the boiling point. The picture should remain in it aboutcid127ten minutes; it is then removed, washed and dried. By this process the picture is rendered more transparent, and its lights become whiter. It is also rendered exceedingly permanent. After this process, I sometimes wax the picture, by causing melted wax- to penetrate into the pores of the paper, the object of which is to give icitrasedtransparency36 X. a. In the above described process, I claim as my own invention and. discovery. First the preparation of iodi red paper as above described, which is not itself sensitive to light but serves as the basis of all the subsequent operations. Ssecondlythe employment of garlic acid, in conjunction with iodine, and the salts of silver to render paper extremely sensitive to light, the garlic acid not having been used in Photography previously to my discovery. Thirdly it was not known previously to my discovery thereof, that paper could be impressed with a latent or photographic image. I claim this as my own discovery, and likewise the means of rendering the image visible at pleasure, viz. by washing the paper in the manner before described with gallon it rate of silver or with any other chemical liquids 'which act upon those parts of the paper only which have been previously acted upon by light. Fourthly the using hot or boiling solutions of the hyposulphites in order to give increased whiteness to Talbotype photographic pictures, and at tie same time, make them exceedingly permanent. Fifthlythe waxing Talbotype negative pictures, in order to make them transparent, and thus to facilitate the obtaining positive copies therefrom the said pictures having been previously white ned by immersion in the hot solution of hyposulphite, as last mentioned. Run Cottonthis interesting invention reported upon so fully last year, seems to hold its reputation for utility, though it has not yet been rendered available in the government service for firearms. Time may yet develop some mode of obviateing the objections in this particular. It has, however, been extensively employed for blasting with much greater efficiency than gunpowder. The terrible explosion of the Run Cotton Factory in England, proves that there is more danger in its preparation than at first apprehended. There have been several applications for letters patent for alleged improvements in the preparation of gun cotton, one of which has been abandoned by the applicant; another rejected; and one waiting its turn for examination. In the announcement of the discovery of gun cotton, it was considered by many as one of scientific interest only, and generally supposed to be of no practical value. But the fact of its present extensive manufacture and use, and the continuance of frequent applications for letters patent for alleged improvements in its preparation, warrant the presumption r that it is to be a discovery of lasting benefit. The following additional intelligence from the inventor himself upon this subject will doubtless be received with interest The substance to which I have given in German the name of schdeswolle, and in English that of gun cotton, having excited a lively curiosity, it may be interesting to the scientific world to become acquainted with some details of the way in which Was first led to its discovery The results of my researches on ozone, led me, in the course of the last two years to turn my attention particularly to the ox yes of nitrogen, and principally to nitric acid. The numerous experiments have made on 6 th subject have led me, as I have stated in detail, in Poggendorffs Anualen, a adopt a peculiar hypothesis on the so called hydrates of nitric acid, sulphuric acid, &c, as well as on the normal nitrates, sulphates, &c. X. a. 37 For a long time I had entertained doubts as to the existence of compound bodies of this nature, which cannot be isolated, and which are stated to be capable of existing only in combination with certain other substances for a long time also I had come to the notion that the introduction of. these imaginary combinations had only been an apparent progress in theoretical chemistry, and that it had even impeded its development." It is well known that what has most contributed to the admission of the existence of these compounds, has been the opinion generally received among chemists respecting the nature of nitric acid. Starting from the existence of the compound of nitrogen Of, as an undoubted and demonstrated fact, notwithstanding the impossibility of is plating it, they always cite nitric acid to prove the existence of compounds which cannot exist in an isolated state. In my opinion, there is no degree of oxidation which is represented by 5, and what these chemists designate by the formula, +a+ Of must be considered as being really Of, +a+ -of ; I am even inclined to regard the normal nitrates 5 +a+ Of, as compounds which must be expressed by 4 +a+ 2. Amongst other motives which induce me to admit this opinion, I will mention the fact that we can obtain hydrate d nitric acid, or a normal nitrate by the direct mixture of 4 with 12 or. Other considerations which I have had occasion to detail elsewhere, induce me also to consider hydrated sulphuric acid to have the form Of+ Of, and not that of Of, +a+ Of, and a normal sulphate, that of Soro . It is sufficient here to observe that Of, placed in presence of, gives rise -to what is called hydrated sulphuric acid, and that Of, placed in presence of B a 0, or P b O, gives rise to what is called sulphate of the old of bar sum or of lead. Doses compound, to which the formula 2 Of, +a+ 2 has been assigned, should have, in my opinion, 2 Of, +44. Admitting this, I considered it probable that the mixture of 2 (of+ Of) (a= 2 (of, +a+ Of) with 4 +a+ Of, (a= 5 +a+ Of) yields 2 Of, -of, and that at the same time 3 2 is disengaged, or enters into a loose combination with what is called the bisulphate of deutoxyd of nitrogen. In other words, I conjectured that a mixture formed with thedydrates of nitric acid and sulphuric acid would possess a very great power of oxidation, and would form a kind of au a re gin, in which the combination Of, would act the part of the chlorine. In this hypothesis, and abstracting Of, from the acid mixture by means of a proper oxydable body, there ought to remain Doses compound." Guided by these suppositions, which, I admit, may be as little founded as they are contrary to the ideas received among chemists, I commenced in December, 1845, a series of experiments with a view to put my hypothesis to the proof; it will be seen, in the sequel, whether the results at which I arrived te rid to confirm it mixed some flowers of sulphur and a certain quantity of the acid mixture of which I have spoken: immediately, even at a temperature of 320 F., a lively dis engagement of sulphur out acid gas took place without the production of deutoxyd of nitrogen. After the reaction, which was accompanied by a development of heat, there remained a color less liquid, which, mixed with water, disengaged a considerable quantity of deutoxydof nitrogen, and acted generally as a solution of Doses compound in hydrated sulphuric acid would have done." I should add here, that a mixture of four ounces of hydrated sulphuric acid, with a single drop of nitric acid, on the addition of flowers of sulphur 38 X. disengaged a sensible quantity of sulphur out acid. To assure himself of the presence of the latter, the operator has only to hold over the liquid a strip of paper which has been covered with iodid of potassium paste and tinged slightly blue by exposure to chlorine. The liberated sulphur out acid will soon dissipated this blue color." Selenium and phosphorus are oxydized in the same manner at low temperatures in the acid mixtures in question; and this latter is modified to such an extent, that on the addition of water, an abundant dis engagement of deutoxyd of nitrogen gas takes place." I o dine, even, in the shape of powder, and shaken up with the acid mixture, rapidly absorbs oxygen, when exposed to a low temperature; and there is formed, besides iodi c acid, the compounds to which Billon has lately drawn attention. After the reaction a liquid remains, which, diluted with water, gives an abundant dis engagement of deutoxyd of nitrogen and liberated iodine' My experiments on ozone having shown that this body, which I consider to be a distinct peroxide of hydrogen, forms, as well as chlorine, at the ordinary temperature, a peculiar compound with o defiant gas, without apparently oxidising in the least, either the hydrogen or the carbon of this gas. I had the idea that it would not be impossible that certain organic matters, exposed to a low temperature, would likewise form compounds, either with the peroxide of hydrogen alone, which, on my hypothesis, secures, in a state of combination or of mixture in the acid mixture, or with Of. It was this conjecture, doubtless, very singular in the eyes of chemists, which principally led me to commence experiments with common sugar made a mixture of one part (volume) of nitric acid, of 1.5 specific gravity, and two parts of sulphuric acid, of 1.85, at the temperature of 360; I then added some finely powdered sugar, so as to form a very fluid paste. I stirred the whole, and, at the end of a few minutes, the sac charing substance formed itself into a viscous mass, entirely separated from the acid liquid, without any dis engagement of gas. This pasty mass was washed with boiling water, until this last no longer exercised any acid reaction; after which I deprive it, as much as possible, at a low temperature, of the water it still contained. The substance now possessed the following properties: exposed to a low temperature, it is compact and brittle; at a moderate temperature, it may be moulded like ja lap resin, which gives it a beautiful silk y lustre. It is semifluid at the temperature of boiling water at a higher temperature, it gives off red vapors; heated still more, it suddenly de flag rates with violence, without leaving any perceptible residue. It is almost in sip id and color less, transparent like the resins, almost insoluble in water, but easily so ruble in the essential oils, in ether, and concentrated nitric acid; and in most cases it acts in general like the resins in a chemical and physical point of view; thus friction renders it very electro negative. I will add, that the acid mixture, by means of which this resin out body was obtained, has an extremely marked bitter taste. I wished to make experiments also with other organic substances; and I soon discovered, one after another, all those about which there has been so much said of late, especially in the Academy of Paris. All this passed in December, 1845, and the first few months in 1846. In March I sent specimens of my new compounds to some of my friends, in particular to Messrs. Vara day, Herschel and Drove. It is necessary to note expressly that the gun cotton formed part of these products; but I must add, that x. hardly was it discovered when I employed it in experiments of shooting, the success of which encouraged me to continue them. Accepting the obliging invitation which I received, I went, in the middle of April, to Wiurtemburg, and made experiments with gun cotton, both in the arsenal ofLudwigsburg, in the presence of artillery officers, and in Stuttgard, before the king himself. In the course of May, June and July, with the kind cooperation of the Command ant de Peche l, of M. Burkhardt, captain of artillery, and other officers, I subsequently made, in "this city, (pale) numerous experiments with arms of small calibre, such as pistols, carbinesc, and afterwards with mortars and cannon experiments at which A ronde Kriidener, the Russian ambassador, was several times present. I maybe allowed to mention, that I was the person who fired the first cannon loaded with gun cotton and shot, on the 28th of July, if I remember aright, after we had previously ascertained, by experiments With mortars, that the substance in question was capable of being used with pieces of large calibre. About the same time, and indeed previously, I employed gun cotton to blast some rocks at I stein, in the Grand Duchy of Laden, and to blow up, some old walls at Mile; and in both cases I had opportunities of convincing myself, in the most satisfactory manner, of the superiority of this new explosive substance over common gunpowder Experiments of this kind, which took place frequently and in the presence of a great number of persons, could not long remain unknown; and the public journals soon gave, without participation on my part, descriptions, more or less accurate, of the results which I had obtained. This circumstance, joined to the short notice which I inserted in the May number ofPoggendorffs Anna len, could not fail to attract the attention of German chemists: in the middle of August I received from M. Letter, professor at Frankfort, the news that he had succeeded in preparing gun cotton and other substances. Our two names thus became associated in the discovery of the substance in question. To M. Letter the gun cotton must have been particularly interesting, as he had previously discovered an organic acid which de flag rates readily. In the month of August I went to England, where, assisted by the able engineer, Mr. Richard Taylor of Pal mouth, I made numerous experiments in the mines of Cornwall, which were entirely successful, in the opinion of all competent witnesses. Experiments on the action of gun cotton were also made in several parts of England, under my direction, both with small firearms and with pieces of artillery, and the results obtained were very satisfactory. Until that time there had been little or nothing said of gun cotton in France; and it will appear that the short notices which Mr. Drove gave at Southampton at the meeting of the British Association, and the experiments with which he accompanied them, served first to attract the attention of French chemists to this substance. At Paris, the thing was at first considered hardly credit le, and jokes even were passed upon it; but when there could no longer remain any doubt as to the reality of the discovery, and when several chemists in Germany and other countries had published the processes which they employed to prepare the gun cotton, then a lively interest was manifested in a subject which had    n the month of June, I made also the first percussion caps, and employed them with success for muskets, in the presence of the above mentioned officers3940Ex. just before excited derision, and it was soon pretended that the new explosive substance was an old. French discovery. It was declared to be nothing more than the xyloidine first discovered by M. Braconnot, and afterwards investigated .anew by A. Pelouze, and the only merit left i me was to have conceived the happy idea of putting this substance into a gun barrel. The knowledge of the composition of xyloidine ought to have sufficed to convince those who put forward that opinion, that it is not suited for firearms, on account of its containing too much carbon and too little oxygen for the chief part to be converted into gaseous matters during, the combustion. I twas moreover very easy to discover the essential differences between thexyloidine of Braconnot and gun cotton. Nevertheless the error was kept up for some months Matters stood thus, when, on the 4th of last November, a Sboetch chemist, Mr. Rum, of Glasgow, published a memoir, in which he showed that gun cotton is not the same product: s xyloidine, but that it presents an essentially different composition; and towards the end of the same month, the Frenchacademy received a communication of the she nature. The gun cotton was then no longer: xyldidine; it was called pyroxyloidine, and the first was admitted to be unsuitable for firearms. I f; therefore, it is proved that from the commencement of 1846, I prepared gun cotton and applied it to the discharge of firearms and that M. Boettgerdid the same in the month of August if it be admitted that xyloidinecannot serve the same purposes as this cotton, and if it be notoriously known that what is now called pyroxyloidine was not brought before theFrenc Academy and' the scientific world until towards the middle of last november, the idea of attributing to France the discovery of gun cotton cannot be seriously entertained, or of as signing to me mr ely a practical application of that which another had discovered. Appeal to the justice of Frenchmen, to decide the point to whom belongs the honor of not only being the first to apply the new substance in question, but also of having first prepared it to M. M. Braconnot and Pelouze, or myself. I must, moreover, add expressly, that it was not xyloidine even which led to my discovery, however intimate may be its relation with gun cotton; it was theoretical ideas, possibly very erroneous ones, but which are peculiarly my own, as well as some facts which I was also the first to discover. Him cut que is a principle of morality on which society at large rests why should it- not be strictly respected in the republic of science? . Pelouze is a distinguished chemist, and already possesses a sulicienty high reputation not to require to elevate his pretensions on the merits of others and I am fully persuaded that this estimable chemist, of well known truth of character, will, appreciating with impartiality the circumstances which have occurred, freely render me the justice to which I consider myself entitled de, Dec. 28 1.846. The above article from Professor Schonbein was first published in' the Archives des Sciences Physique et Naturelles. Microscopic Examination of Run Cotton ; by Dr. Bacon, (from. Bostonsoc. At. List, Web. 1847, p. 195.)Specimens of the cotton, before and after preparation, were put up in Canada balsam, on slips of glass, and covered by very thin glass. When viewed by transmitted light, with powers from 150 to 800, many of the fibres of the gun cotton appear thickened, but no other change can be perceived in comparison with the un prepared article. There is no appreciable difference in the transparent y of the two. X. 
41They were now examined in polar sized light by means of the polarizingattachment to the microscope. When the polar iting and -analyzing prismsiare so arranged as to afford a dark field, the rib and like fibres of the cotton before preparation are seen -as luminous objects upon a black ground aid are tinged with bright -and varied colors. They are thus proved to possess a strong polar iting power. The gun cotton, under the same circumstances, presents an entirely different appearance. I to fibres are much less luminous, and have a nearly uniform dull blue color. It is evident that the process of preparation has, so altered the structure of the fibres as to lessen very greatly their action onpolarized light. t of un cotton prepared by I Dr. Jackson by immersion for twelve and for eighteen hours in the strongest acids, has not lost its polar iting power in any appreciably greater degree than after an immersion of three minutes only. This agrees with the results of other modes of trial in indicating that the latter period is sufficient for the complete preparation of the cotton when the acids are of full strength. In all the specimens there are some filaments so nearly destitute of polar iting power as to be nearly invisible on the black ground, but none have been found entirely without action. When the polar iting and analyzing prims are in such a position as to give a bright field, a portion of the fibres become tinged with a color approaching to orange, while the remainder appear color less, as in ordinary light. Purifying Liquids by Galvanism patent has been granted for an interesting process by which a feeble galvanic power is employed to separate salts, acids or alkalies from water or other liquids. Two porous vessels containing water are partly immersed in the liquid to be purified, and a zinc plate placed in one vessel and an iron plate in the other vessel. Other metals would answer, but the inventor prefers the above. The zinc and copper plate being connected by a wire, galvanic action is established, and the salts or other so ruble matters are carried through into the porous cups, And these accumulate in one or the other according to the electrical relations of the impure ties.  Lubricating Compounds patent has been granted for a lubricating compound, which is represented to be already in extensive use for rail car axles. Six parts by a eight of whale oil are mixed with one part of asphaltum and heated gradually to .500 or 600 Fahrenheit, and then two parts of coal tar are added, stirring the mixture until the materials are incorporated. It is alleged to be a cheap and economical liquid and does not stiffen in cold weather, or agglutinate from use. Calori Of C. Patents granted i 35. Stovesthis class of inventions has multiplied, upon the office much above any other, and d although the subject is in itself easy of comprehension, yet the examination for letters patent for a cooking stove is frequently attended with more difficulty and nice discrimination than would arise from an invention of a complicated character. Quite a number of patents have been granted for stoves, all presenting novelty of arrangement or combination, and yet it is difficult to .select from among them all any one feature of decided interest. A useful article of foot stove has been patented, consisting of a vessels x. to be filled with hot water and surrounded with non conducting material, and provided with an opening large enough to receive the feet and entirely cover them with a heating surface. In the ordinary foot stoves the feet are warmed only from below, while the stove in question warms the feet above, and on the sides, as well as below. An improvement in the boilers of cooking stoves has been patented, and although a most simple device, it is one which appears to have been much needed. Very one using a cooking stove must be aware of the difficulty and expense of boiling water in the largest size boilers. A portion only of the bottom being within the blue of the stove exposed to the fire, while the whole surface of the upper part is exposed to the air, it requires a large amount of fuel to raise the temperature of the water to the boiling point and maintain it for any length of time. This difficulty has been to a considerable extent removed by in closing the boiler with a causing which is open at the bottom where it rests upon the stove, and allows the fire or the products of combustion to rise between the boiler and causing, and thus economies much heat. A jacket around a boiler above a stove, merely to serve as a non conductor, is an old device, but the novelty in this case consists in making this jacket to d communicate with the blue of the stove, rendering it unnecessary to carry the bottom of the boiler far into the blue. Eating Wheel Fires patent has been granted for a furnace of peculiar construction, which, it is alleged, will heat the tire much sooner and with less fuel than the ordinary way of heating upon the ground in the open air. It is a circular furnace, made up of separate sections for the sake of port ability, and may be used in or out of doors. Trying Train and Flourthe subject of kill drying grain is one of increasing' importance, in view of the increasing exportation of that article. It is often remarked, that corn meal bread made at the North of Southern corn, differs essentially from that made at the South. It is doubtless to a considerable extent true, and the difference is not entirely due to the operation of transporting, but in a great measure to inattention to the proper drying of the grain. A greater number of applications for letters patent for corn kills has been made during the past year than probably ever before within the same space of time. Several patents have been granted, but the principles of drying and heating have so long been well understood in their application to other materials that little else of novelty has been introduced than in the mechanical contrivances to suit the change of material. Ventilators, or Chimney Capsthe subject of smoke chimneys is one of so much moment and interest as to engage and invoke the attention of men of science, and involves the most important considerations of economy of fuel, personal comfort and health. New subjects have been essayed by a greater variety and multiplicity of experiments than the curing of smoke chimneys, and yet there is wanting a practical manual upon this subject, which should provide remedies 'for the numerous contingencies.  I from a survey of facts it must be obvious that there can be no universal rule of construction and operation, and that in providing remedies they should be adapted to the varied circumstances of building and locality. This complication of the conditions renders the aid of science very necessary, and the subject at times has received attention from the British Association. Several patents have been granted for chimney caps professing superiority over other known forms in improving the draft of chimneys. There are mainly three classes of chimney caps for the prevention of smoke. The42ex. a. 43 first is a move able cap which by a van e is made to turn in such manner as to have the exit of the smoke in the direction of the wind. The second class is the cap in which, from peculiarity of form, the draft is increased by the tendency to produce a vacuum at the mouth of the exit pipe. Under this class the varieties of form are very numerous. The third class is one in which the cap revolves by the action of the wind, and this, operating to revolve a fan or spiral within the chimney blue, raises the smoke mechanically. The caps of the first and third class generally obstruct the draft when they do not readily obey the action of the wind, which, from undue friction, and resting of the axles or spindles upon which they turn, is too frequently the case. Of the second class, two forms have been patented, termed the injecting and electing ventilator. The first is the reverse of the second in operation, and at first sight was so considered in its construction. Both forms were, upon the first examination, decided to be wanting in novelty, or so closely resembling other known forms as to present no distinctive feature. The cases, however, were open for explanation, and this was furnished in the most satisfactory manner by actual demonstration. As a mere change of form is not the subject of letters patent, and as in this class of inventions the value of the cap depends upon peculiarity of form and a slight difference in form sometimes makes a great difference in the result, a practical illustration is of great value in testing the question of novelty. The patentee of the past named ventilator, exhibited by complete experimental trials with an extensive apparatus, the full value and operation of his ventilator, and demonstrated in a conclusive manner the difference between his own invention and those to which he had been referred as presenting similarity. The principal features of the electing ventilator are, a clonic frustum mounted upon a tube of some length, and a plate or tender supported at some distance above the blue or opening in the clonic frustum. The diameter of the opening through the tube and clonic frustum is the same as the diameter of the chimney blue. The cap is secured permanently upon the chimney and according to the experiments performed here, gives a strong upward draft, whatever may be the direction of the wind. The injecting ventilator consists of a number of inverted clonic trust a, so arranged that a current of air from any quarter, blowing upon the cap, causes a strong downward draft. The two ventilators are designed for combined, as well as separate use. The inventor contemplates their general application to ships, steamboats, crowded rooms, and, indeed, to all cases where ventilation is necessary. The experiment has been tried on shipboard with success. The injecting ventilator supplying the hold with air, and the electing carrying it rapidly out; ana thus by a current of air in one direction these caps are made to cooperate, and must be more efficacious than the many contrivances for merely forcing air into the hold. The inventor represents that one cap may be made to cover any number of flies in a chimney, and that in one instance, a chimney containing 14 flies, was surmounted by a large cap and the draft in all the flies made perfect. This invention has been submitted to the rigid scrutiny and received the approbation of the American Academy of Science and Art. The inventor asserts that he has found but one condition under which the electing ventilator will not act to raise a draft. This condition can never occur when the cap is upon a chimney, and perhaps might never be 44 "x. found when the cap is in a vertical position. But it sometimes happens that stove pipes are carried out of windows and through the side walls of buildings. The cap is serviceable in such cases except when the direction of the wind is exactly at right angles to the plane of the wall. If the direction of the wind is at all oblique to the wall of the building, the cap performs its functions; but when it blows directly against, or at right angles to the wall, its function ceases. In a philosophical point of view this is a subject of great interest. The inventor has found, that the air, under the latter condition, isn a denser state than the surrounding air, which is readily proved by thebarometer. The crowded or compressed state of the air in this case is readily accounted for, and the cessation of the function of the cap. The subject of ventilation g houses is perhaps of more importance in this city than most others. First, from the imperfect mode of making the interior walls of houses by putting the plastering directly upon the brick walls without the use of fur ring; the walls, more especially if papered, become exceedingly damp and <a name="mould5"><mark>mould</mark></a> y, soon destroy the paper, and are disagreeable and unhealthy: A free circulation of air becomes very important, therefore, to counteract these evils. Secondly, the chimneys are in almost every instance built without reference to scientific principles, being generally too low above the buildings, very rough inside from projecting brick and mortar, which materially obstructs the passage of the air, and generally having very awkward throats. The necessities of the case may be readily inferred from the great number and variety of chimney caps employed in this city, to the disfigurement of buildings, both public and private. It is to be regreted, that architects in this country, make this subject one of so little consequence as to suffer their works to be de faced by the awkward contrivances at present so numerous upon the public buildings.

In lieu of a single needle attached to the card there are three needles, two of which are movable on pilots in the ordinary manner, and one stationary, or permanently attached to the card. Theirpivots, or centres, are all in the same meridian line. The instrument was compared with others in the office and found to settle in r the magnetic meridian sooner than any of those tried of the ordinary construction. It presents novelty, and is believed to possess the advantage claimed for it. Locks patent has been granted for a self adjusting pendulum, by which the necessity of carefully levelling a clock is dispensed with. The pendulum is attached to a heavy pendulous bar, which has its centre of motion coincident with that of the pallet wheel, and thus in an inclined position of the clock, the pallets preserve their proper relation to the pallet wheel. Lever And Screw. Number of patents granted, 12. Packing Cotton in Cylindrical alalesA. patent has been granted for a mode of pressing cotton, presenting novelty and claiming success. Theex. 45 cotton is made to mat by pressure rollers and under pressure is wound upon a shaft from which it is removed when of sufficient size. If the pressure in this instance can render the cotton as compact as the powerful presses employed in packing bales of the usual form, there would be some advantage in managing the bales, but whether this advantage can compensate for the <a name="loss1"><mark>loss</mark></a> of room in st owing cylindrical bales, is a question to be decided by those connected with such business. Steam Pressesthe steam press used principally for cotton- appears to be coming into extensive use, and has been the subject of frequent applications for letters patent. The plan first proposed, and adopted for a while, was to apply the steam piston directly to the follower of the press. It has been found advantageous, however, to combine the piston with the togglejoint press, and for i peculiar mode of doing this, letters patent have beengrantedSTONE And Clay.

Sofa Tableone of the most ingenious devices in household furniture ever presented to this office has been patented this year. Any attempts have been hitherto made to. combine various articles of furniture in one piece, such as sofas and beds, beds and wardrobes, beds and tables, &c, of which there are many specimens in the office. These devices frequently fail to go into use, from the complication and expense of the article. The sofa table alluded to differs but little in appearance from a common sofa, and with great facility and dispatch may be converted into a large table and two benches suitably cushioned. The back of the sofa, which extends nearly to the floor, is drawn up over and rests upon the two, arms of the sofa, and the seat of the sofa is divided longitudinally in two parts, which are46Ex. readily detached from the frame of the sofa and separated from each other, forming the two benches or seats for each side of the table. The invention appears to be well calculated for use in private and public apartments, but particularly suited for such places as the cabins of steamboats.

Of Of Arts. Number of patents granted, 19. Musical I instruments patent has been granted for a novel species of musical instrument in which the tones are derived from tuning forks. The sound of the tuning fork is by itself feeble; but if while vibrating it be held over the mouth of a vessel which would give a vibration in unison with the note of the fork, the sound is very much increased. This fact has been long known, but the inventor has availed himself of it in a peculiar manner in the production of his instrument. By means of 'keys like those of the piano for te, the forks are struck with a hammer of a peculiar kind, an essential difference being made in the hardness of the hammer for the high tones. The resonance of sound is obtained by means of boxes of thin wood immediately behind the tuning forks. The lower tones a reproduced by spiral wires similar to those used as substitutes for bells in common clocks. Some of the notes in this instrument are very sweet and of considerable volume. There appears, however, some difficulties to be overcome, such as want of volume of tone in the extremities of the scale, limited range, and the different character of sound from the wires; all of which the inventor believes to be sur mount able. Printing Pressesseveral interesting improvements in printing presses and in king machines have been patented. One which presents much novelty and has been fairly tested as to utility, is a rotary form of press. It is affirmed that this press has produced upon a trial experiment, twenty thousand copies an hour. The feature of the press will be readily comprehended from the preamble to the specification, as follows: "by improvements are applied to that class of printing presses in which the form of types is arranged on the surface of a cylinder, with a series of impression cylinders, in king rollers, &c, arranged around it, so that by its rotation the types are successively inked and give their impression to the sheets of paper as they are fed in by the impression cylinders, the number of sheets to be printed by one revolution of the cylindrical bed depending on the number of impression cylinders arranged around it; the number of impression cylinders being governed by the diameter that carries the types and the distance between the impression cylinders. The nature of the first part of my invention consists in arranging the form or forms of types on a segment of a cylinder, while the other portion of its surface is employed to distribute the ink, and therefore answering the purpose of a distributing table. The second part of my invention consists in giving to the in king rollers, which are arranged in set h around the cylindrical form and distributing table, and also to the transferring roller of the in king apparatus, a motion in and out, or towards and from the axis of the cylinder around which they are are x. a. 47 ranged, so that they may make pressure on the cylindrical distrilgiting table as it passes under them to distribute the ink, and be thrown out sufficiently far from the centre to transfer the ink to the forms of types, as the face of the types must be the segment of a larger cylinder than the segment which forms the distributing table, that this, (the distributing table) may not ink the impression cylinders when passing by them. The third part of my invention relates to the in king apparatus and consists in giving to the duct or, or fountain roller that takes the ink from the fountain, a slow continuous rotary, instead of an in permitting motion as heretofore, so that the ink shall be regularly transmitted to the taking roller, and thence to the distributing roller, &c; and also in connecting the harbor of this duct or or fountain roller with the mechanism that gives to it the slow rotary motion by means of a hatchet that it (the duct or roller) may be turned forward when desired to alter the supply of ink. And the last part of my invention relates to the method of securing and retaining the types on the cylindrical bed, by means of column rules which are thicker at the outer than at the inner edge, so that the faces of any two of them shall be parallel with each other, or nearly so, to hold the column of types as tight at the top as at the base, the said rules being made with projections from the lo we. edge, to fit in re bated grooves in the bed, so that the columns of pes, with the rules separating them, may be pressed together by screws i at the side of the bed, in the usual manner of securing types, and thus secure and hold the form of types on a cylindrical surface, as effectually as on' a flat surface; this important object having, long been essayed in various ways, but never before to my knowledge, successfullyattainedPrinted Floor Clothsan interesting improvement in the art of printing floor cloths has been patented. In the common printed carpets the figures are very rough in appearance, and although designed to imitate the figures upon woven carpet, yet the imitation entirely fails, from the hard outlines given by the printing blocks. The improved printed carpet can with difficulty be distinguished from woollen carpets. By a simple contrivance of shifting the printing blocks, the sharpness of the outlines is removed, and the figures appear to be raised and soft. Surgery.  Number of patents granted, 17. Undeithis class are included many inventions not strictly of a surgical character, such as machines for exercising, inventions for artificial incubation, and subjects of a physiological character. Several patents have been granted for exercising machines, under the appellation of swings, baby jumpers, &c. In the former the object has been to enable the person to swing himself with ease, and in the latter to give salutary and pleasing exercise to infants and young children by suspending them in a frame or basket, hung upon springs, so that a slight touch of the foot upon the floor will cause a considerable upward movement and vibration of the machine. I inhalation of Etherthis discovery and invention patented in 1846,and noticed in the report for that year, has circulated through- the civilized world with greater rapidity than any other improvement of the day. : But serous attempts have been made, in England and on the continent of U 48 X. rope, to claim priority in this invention, but thus far the entire merit of originality and priority belongs to our own countrymen During the last year, experiments have been extensively prosecuted in Paris, on the inhalation of ether by animals, and have led to interesting results. M. Flourens observes, from his investigations, that ether acts first upon the cerebro m, and disturbs the intellect; then pon the cerebellum, affecting the equilibrium of movement; next upon the spinal cord, when it extinguishes successively sensibility and the power of motion; and, finally, upon the i medulla oblongata, when it extinguishes life. In his late experiments the action of ether has been pushed to the_ extinction of life. M. Flourensin order to compare the effects with those of asphyxia, subjected two dogs to the simplest kind of asphyxia produced by the gradual consumption of the oxygen contained in a given volume of atmospheric air. When the asphyxia had reached the required point, the spinal marrow, exposed, showed no signs of feeling when cut or lacerated, and only feeble muscular contractions in pinching the motor portion. M. Flourens hence infers that there is a marked analogy between etherization and asphyxia. But in ordinary asphyxia, the nervous system loses its forces under the action of the black blood, the blood deprived of oxygen; and in etherizationthis takes place at first, under the quiet influence of the singular agent to which it is subjectedSillimans Your. July, p. 138. A patent has been granted for an apparatus for inhaling either. It has been found that the vapor of ether to produce the proper effects upon the system must be mixed with atmospheric air, and as the mixture is imperfectly made in the ordinary mode of inhaling, the apparatus in question renders the operation easy and certain. The instrument is simple in its construction. I to principal feature is in the arrangement of a valve which admits a current of atmospheric air to be mixed with the vapor of ether. Been substitute for ether Professor Simpson, of Edinburgh, has, in the chloroform, or tr i chloride of for my le, discovered :an agent which more rapidly, and without communicating .any offensive odor to the clothes of the patient, produces entire insensibility. To inhale r or instrument of any kind is necessary. A few drops put on a handkerchief and thus applied to the mouth and nostrils produces the desired effect in a few seconds. ;ProfessorSimpson has brought his discovery before the Medicochirurgical Society of Edinburgh, and it has been tried within the last ten days at most of the hospitals in London with complete success. At all these experiments the most serious operations in surgery were performed without pain to 0 the patient, and there was no disagreeable smell, as when ether is used no coughing or irritation of the a il passages, or as y thing to show that the patient felt inconvenience from the administration of the chloroformEglishJevewspaper. Arti  Of Of  Of I Ncubati  Of. The operation of watching chickens by artificial heat is much more extensively practised in Europe than in this country, though of late years the traffic in such business has increased. Two patents have been granted for modes of artificial incubation, the point aimed at in both being to imitate as clearly as possible the circumstances of nature. A good idea of the invention and its objects may be gathered from a short preamble to one of the specifications, as follow six. 
49Heretofore, in arranging apparatus for the watching of eggs by artificial incubation, it has been usual so to construct the same that the eggs are placed in a heated atmosphere, of a temperature which is thought the best for the purpose, so that the whole surface of each egg has heretofore been subjected to the same temperature, which I have discovered, after numerous experiments, is highly injurious, and only a very low per cent age of the eggs submitted to artificial incubation can by such means be hatched, and I attribute that result to the evaporation of too much of the fluid of the egg. It will be found, and it is a well known fact, that the germ of the egg floats at the upper part of the egg, and the bird, in natural incubation, applies the direct heat of the body to that part of the egg, and the lower part of the egg is comparatively at a much lower temperature than the upper part where the germ is. In addition to which, the bird often leaves the nest for a time, by which each egg is more or less ventilated Now the object of the first part of the invention is so to arrange apparatus for artificial incubation that the heat may be contact heat from above, whilst the lower surface of the eggs are kept comparatively at a low temperature, and by such means to imitate nature as nearly as in ay be. I would remark that the arrangement of apparatus for obtaining the requisite heat from above, to eggs, for carrying on the process of artificial incubation according, to my invention, may be varied; and therefore, although I shall hereafter describe an arrangement of apparatus such as I have found fully to answer, and is what I believe to be the best for the purpose, I do not confine myself thereto so long as the peculiar mode of carrying on the process of artificial incubation by top contact heat be retained The second part of my invention relates to the arrangement of apparatus to serve the purpose of the mother in- imparting warmth to the young bird, and consists of circulating heated fluids through flexible pipes, so that the young birds can pass under and press themselves against such heated flexible pipes or surfaces; and such an apparatus will be found to offer alike mode of applying warmth to the young to that which is offered by the mother; and the young having a yielding warm surface above, against which they can press themselves, they will not be found to huddled together as has been heretofore very commonly the case in bringing up young birds and such muddling together renders the young very weakly and tender, and very few are raised to maturity n concluding this imperfect view of some of the notable inventions of the past year, your examiner may be permitted to remark, that he has omitted to mention many inventions of obvious value and interest, for want of time.  Should the embarrassed condition of your examining corps be relieved, so as to allow a more patient investigation f the subjects before them, the preparation of their reports would be greatly facilitated, and the striking features of all important and interesting inventions faith full jr delineated. As it is, your Examiner feels that he has not done justice to such topics a shave been embraced in this report, aid trusts that due allowance will be made for its imperfect ion. Respectfully submitted, Schas. G. 'PAGE. Examiner of Patents 50 X. a. E. Report of W. P. N. Fitzgerald, Examiner of Patents. To Hon. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Of    Of n accordance with the established usage of this office, I respectfully submit to you the following report upon the progress of- the arts, so far as they have come officially under my consideration, during the past year, and upon the progress and condition of business at my desk it the time this office was committed to your charge, its business had already increased to such a degree that it was no longer in the power of the examining corps to keep pace with it. Applications had already accumulated, which the most strenuous efforts could not diminish, and the close of the first year found one hundred applications upon my desk un examined, and about the same number were awaiting my action at the close of the second, and the unparalleled increase of business during the last year has swelled my list of un examined applications to three hundred and fifty-three. As applications accumulate, a great variety of miscellaneous business connected with them rapidly springs up, and increases, occupying much of the time of the examining corps and rendering it impossible to make that progress which would be attained if an accumulation of business did not exist. Thus, the very fact of an accumulation of business becomes one of the most aggravated causes of accumulation, and the more there is to do, the greater the obstacles in the way of its accomplishment. It may be safely asserted that the miscellaneous business arising out of the great accumulation of applications is nearly equal to all the business revolving upon examiners and assistants four or five years ago; and to bring up the business now before my assistant and myself, would tax to their utmost the energies of two examiners and two assistants. In giving the number of un examined applications before me, none are noticed except those which are on my desk no allowance being made for the numerous applications in the hands of agents and applicants for amendment, or the still more numerous class of rejected applications which are liable at any time to be again called up before the office under modified forms for re examinations. These cases being taken into account, it at once appears that the back business of my desk would give full occupation for one examiner and one assistant for at least one year. Delays are always particularly annoying to applicants for patents, but circumstances are often connected with them of a character peculiarly vexatious and expensive. It frequently happens that after the filing of an application, and before its examination .is possible, other applications of a similar character are filed, and when they finally come up for examination it is often found that two, three, and sometimes four are in conflict with each other requiring interferences to be declared, voluminous testimony to be taken, hearings to be had still longer delays, great expenses, and not un frequently hotly contested appeals. All of which would have been avoided by prompt action upon applications when filed. These proceedings which the accumulation of business has rendered frequent, have greatly embarrassed the business of the office and obstructed its progress. X. a. 51 n both of my preceding reports I had the pleasure of stating that no appeal had been taken from the decision of any case referred to my desk; but within the past year four appeals have been taken from such decisions and contested with an unusual degree of determination and per tenacity; but in every instance the decision of the office has been fully sustained and affirmed by the chief justice of the district, and it is believed that the results will deter others from taking appeals and embarrassing the office, when there is no reasonable ground for alleging error, as the hope can no longer be entertained that its decisions will be reversed without such grounds. When there is a conflict between the claims of two or more individuals, perfect impartiality is aimed at, and the utmost care is taken to decide between them, in the manner dictated by justice and the laws governing the action of the, office; and a close approximation to right is the more easily attained from the fact that the parties are seldom known either to the commissioner or to the examiner, and a decision is therefore arrived at upon the merits of the case, without any of those disturbing prejudices or pre possessions which might be suspected to arise from a previous acquaintance with the parties. The na single party is before the office claiming letters patent, every thing receives the most favorable construction for him which it can bear, and he has all the benefit derive able from a sincere desire to grant his petition, if it can be done in accordance with law. I f, therefore, errors are committed, after the careful presentation and examination of a case, they would naturally be in favor of the applicant, and would seldom furnish any just ground of appeal. One of the interests of the examiner can possibly be involved, and it very seldom occurs that even the face of the applicant is known to him, and he is therefore free from those influences which. so often warp the judgment, and is left at liberty to pursue the course pointed out by his best judgment, and by doing his duty, to secure for himself the reputation of a faithful and efficient officer. To pursue a different course, would be doing wrong without temptation; and any examiner who would not follow the path of duty from principle, would be urged to it by the exercise of common sense and the sentiment of self preservation. It appears, therefore, that causes of appeal can seldom occur, and it is believed that the past history of this office in this particular will exercise a favorable influence upon the future action of applicants and their advisers. It is difficult to imagine any tribunal that could be more inclined to deal liberally with inventors than an office constituted as this is, for the sole purpose of fostering the arts and extending encouragement and protection to all those whose inventive genius and patient perseverance are successfully devoted to the amelie ration of the condition of man by further and more varied applications of science to the useful arts. The progress of invention during the past year is evinced not only by the great increase of applications for patents, but still further by the fact that a greater proportion of these applications present features of novelty than of those presented during the preceding year. The number of applications referred to me for examination during the past year is seven hundred and forty-four; the number approved and passed at my desk is two hundred and seventy-five; and the number of rejections is three- hundred and thirteen. Some applications have under modified forms been rejected more than once, and therefore the above number of rejections exceeds the number of rejected applications. By reference to former reports it will be perceived that the number of applications referred to one examiner the last year is about equal to the number referred to both, even so recently as 1842. X. a. And to this should be added the miscellaneous business arising out of the causes herein before noticed. The following eleven of the twenty-two classes into which applications are divided at this office, are committed to my charge, viz 1st. Metaturgy and manufactures in metals 2nd. Manufacture of fibrous and textile fabrics, and all machinery there for 3rd. Steam, and other gas engines 4th. Navigationcomprehending naval architecture, pro pellets, marine implements, &c. &c 5th.

Hydraulics and pneumatics, comprehending hydraulic engines, water wheels, wind mills, machinery for raising water, fire engines filters, &c. &c 11th. Miscellaneousconsisting of such applications as are not comprehended in any other classes. These several classes shall consider in the order above indicated, reviewing as I proceed, the more prominent and unimportant improvements. in each which: have come officially under my observation during tlepaatyear. Metalurgy, And Manufacture I N Metals. These important branches of the arts have received during the past year the attention to which they are justly entitled, and many improvements have been made and patented, and" numerous applications still remain un examined. The nature of these improvements will develop e themselves, as we proceed. Goldbut one patent has been granted th, past year, for separating gold from the sand and other impure ties which are found mingled with it. Life process is wholly mechanical, and is intended to separate gold, which is not chemically combined with other substances, but simply mixed. with them. This is the condition in which gold is usually found. It does not, like iron, copper and other baser metals, easily combine with other substances, and hence the fact that it is usually found pure, and simply; mingled with, foreign substances. The apparatus patented does not differ from those heretofore used sufficiently to render a particular description of it necessary or interesting, and it will be sufficiently .understood by a perusal of the claim. Copperone patent has been granted within the past year for an improved process of reducing copper ores. This metal very readily combined with many other substances, and is therefore unlike gold, usually found in, combination, and requiring a severe chemical process to effect its separation. It is sometimes found nearly pure but this is an exception to the general x. a. -53 rule. The reduction of copper ores is a matter of considerable difficulty, and the process patented to a foreigner may be of importance, and it is therefore presented in the following extract: " The object of my invention is to facilitate the smelting of copper ores, and it consists in the application of iron with alkaline substances to the smelting such ores and the decomposing and disintegrating by means of water the products obtained by such application. When I operate upon ores containing less than twenty per cent. of copper, and more sulphur than two parts by weight to four parts by weight of copper, I commence by treating them in the same manner as is usually practised by smelters, videlicet, by first catching them for about twelve hours, in an ordinary cal dining furnace, and then removing them to a smelting furnace known by smelters as an ore furnace, for the purpose of fusing them, adding, if necessary, the usual flutes. When well fused, I skin off the flag and run out the residue either into sand moulds or into water, forming, at this point what is technically known, as 'coarse metal" When I operate upon ores containing less than twenty per cent, and a smaller proportion of sulphur than two parts by weight to four parts by weight of copper, I mix with them other ores containing sulphur in larger proportions, so as to make the average proportion of sulphur in the whole reach two parts by weight to four parts by weight of copper, and proceed to calcined and fuse as before stated." When the ores by themselves, or by mixture as aforesaid with other ores, contain a greater proportion of sulphur than one part by, weight to four parts by weight of copper, and also more than twenty per cent. of copper, I omit both the cal dining and fusing processes before described, and commence by treating such ores as hereafter directed for treating 'coarse metal' I shall designate the product in the two first cases, and the ore in the last case, as 'coarse metal' To every ten ton weight of this I add fifty six pounds of soda ash (containing about fifty per cent. of all ali) and fifty-six pounds of soaked lime, and transfer the whole to a fusing, or, what is termed by smelters a metal furnace, and fuse the mass. When the whole is in a state of fusion, I skin off any flag which may have formed, and then add one hundred weight of scrap iron to every ton of the 'coarse metal' and I disperse the iron over the surface of the melted mass as equally as possible, and close the door of the furnace until the whole is melted. I then stir the whole well and rapidly with a rabble, and immediately tap the furnace and run the mass into sand moulds. As soon as the mass is sufficiently set to be removed, I put it into a shallow pit containing water enough to cover the whole, and allow it to remain therein from two or three hours, by which time the mass will have become partially de composed and disintegrated. I then run off the excess of water and remove the mass, and allow it to remain in a heap in the moist state until the whole becomes reduced into a fine powder, which I have generally found to take abouttiwentyfour hours. I then wash the powder by any convenient means. I have succeeded well by using a large box, having a double perforated bottom of good; between the perforated boards is placed a metallic gauze wire of from twenty-five to thirty-five meshes to the inch. I place this box in what is known by smelters as a tapping pit of water, having first provided a vent from the pit below the level of the bottom of the box; over the aperture of this vent is a metallic gauze of from sixty to seventy meshes to the inch, I then introduce a quantity of the powder to be washed into the box 54 X. and, having stopped the vent, I pour water in until the box is full. I then open the vent and allow the water to run off. I repeat this process twice. I now remove the powder to an ordinary cal dining furnace, and I apply heat very moderately at first, increasing it gradually for twenty hours, so as that at the end of this time it should reach a bright yellow heat. This yellow heat, I continue for six hours longer, taking care to stop short of such a heat as would cake or fuse the powder, and I keep the powder regularly stirred at intervals during the whole time. I now remove the powder from the. cal dining furnace to a fusing or 'metal furnace' taking the precaution to sprinkle it with water when drawn from the cal dining furnace as is usually practised, and to every ton weight of this powder I add in the fusing furnace about one hundred weight of anthracite coal, also in powder, and ten pounds of sand, adding, if I find it difficult to fuse, lime or flour s par as afflux. When the whole is well fused, I skin off the flag and tap the furnace into sand. The product thus run out I have generally found to be fit for the refining furnace, and I subsequently refine it in the usual manner but if, as in practice will sometimes happen, a small portion of the product should be regal us, this regal us, which is rich in copper, I roast and afterwards refine. The flag s dimmed off as above contains copper, and may be employed as usual with charges in the ore furnace as a fluid ronThree patents have been granted for obtaining iron from the ores-one of which was a re issue of a former patent, and therefore does not require notice. The first of these patents is for reducing ores in the ordinary cupola furnace, and consists of little else than the addition of a constant jet of steam upon the mass, while undergoing the process usual in such furnaces. The patentee considers the improvement which he has made of great importance, but it has not yet been thoroughly tested. The other patent under this head, is for a mode of producing malleablebar iron directly from the ore. The process and apparatus heretofore resorted to in bloom series, for preparing the lo up or bloom for the trip hammer, are attended with many disadvantages. The forge fire is such that all the ore and other materials for the lo up cannot be placed upon it at once but as large a mass as can be accommodated is placed upon the fire, and as theimpurities are driven off, and the mass diminishes, another portion of the ore and other materials are added, and this is repeated until the lo up is formed and prepared for the hammer. In this process, as the forge is open on all sides, it will be perceived that the outside of the mass is constantly exposed to the atmosphere, which cools the mass, and otherwise much rewards the process, rendering much time and fuel necessary and as the mass is partially reduced, the addition of cold materials produces 'a similar effect. These new materials require additional time for reduction, and the same is true of the succeeding additions, and it is therefore evident that those portions of the ore, which were earliest placed upon the fire, are kept there much longer than is necessary, and are in danger of receiving injury therefrom, and the incongruous mass is with great difficulty brought into the same condition, and prepared for the hammer. To obviate these inconveniences, the patentee in question prepares a close chamber for the reception of the charge, and of' sufficient size to receive the whole charge at once; the upper part of the charge is supported, in some degree, by move able bars extending across the chamber, and there suitable doors which may be opened when necessary, for the reception x. a. 55 of the charge, for the working of the lo up, and for removing it when ready for the hammer. When the lo up is nearly reduced, a new charge may be introduced, and made to rest upon the bars above mentioned, so as to receive all the benefit derive able from the heat which would otherwise be lost. The advantages of these improvements appear obvious, and they are said to be in successful operation, effecting a great saving of time and fuel, and increasing the quantity and in proving the quality of the iron. Steelletters patent have been granted for improvements in ovens or furnaces for the manufacture of steel. The improvement consists in so arranging the flies about the oven, that the heat shall be more equally and directly applied and economized. The oven and furnace do not greatly differ from those in use, but every improvement in this branch of manufactures is important and the invention in question seems calculated to produce favorable results. A few patents have been granted for improvements in furnaces and forges within the year, but they are unimportant. Letters patent have also been granted for an improvement in welding cast iron to steel or wrought iron. The general principle upon which this mode of welding is effected has long been known and reduced to practice and the patent in question was granted for a slight improvement in the mode of applying the cast iron. An ingenious and convenient mode of moulding and casting door plates has been patented within the year. The improvement is in the pattern. The pattern, except the letters, is in one piece, having the general form of the plate; but so constructed that blocks, having each one of the letters of the alphabet upon it, or a blank, can be slipped in and changed at pleasure, making a complete pattern for the plate and name required; and immediately after use the letter blocks can be changed, and the pattern prepared for another name. The convenience of this device is obvious. Rollingletters patent have been granted for improved machinery for twisting and rolling iron into bars. The process of manufacture, and advantages of this kind of iron, as well as the nature of the machinery used in its manufacture, are fully set forth in the following extract n the manufacture of iron, either by rolling or hammering, the fibres are all drawn longitudinally, which, for the rails of rail roads, for the tires of rail road wheels, and a variety of other purposes, renders it liable to break off in thin leaves or scales, or to split length wise, f his state of things being common in the two instances specified. The object of my invention is to treat the iron, either in the original manufacture thereof, or afterwards, as to avoid this defect, and thereby render the iron for these purposes moredurable, by laying the fibres in such form and direction as to prevent it from sealing off or splitting; and my invention consists in twisting the iron, in, or before, or after the operation of rolling or hammering, so that the fibres shall wind around one another, in manner somewhat similar to the fibres of hemp in a twisted rope or strand and the second part of my invention relates to the machinery by which      carry into effect my improved process, and consists in combining two or more sets of rollers, one or both of which are to be draw rollers, and one set turning in the usual permanent bearings, and the other set or sets working in a frame or chuck that rotates on an axis at right angles to the axis of the rollers to twist the bar of iron between the two sets of rollers. To enable any one skilled in the art to apply my improved process of treating 56 X. iron, and to construct and use the machine which I have invented there for, I will describe the mode of procedure which I: have essayed as well as the manner of constructing and using the machine therefore he bloom of iron, or a bar previously formed, is taken while in a heated state, and twisted while undergoing the operation of hammering, which may 'be done by securing one end of the bloom or bar in a clamp and rotating it while the hammer rests on the other end, or by securing the two ends in separate clarffps and turning one of them, or both, in opposite directions until the required twist has been given and then subjecting it to the operation of hammering. But when the bar is to be drawn by rolling, it is to undergo the operation of twisting while passing between the rollers, or after it has passed between one set and before it passes between the second set. And when it is twisted on its way to the rollers one end of the bar may be secured to a clamp, which is to be rotated as the bar passes between the draw rollers is the bars thus prepared are in most instances to be re worked to receive the required form or forms, according to the purposes to which they are to be applied, it will be evident that they may be twisted as they pass from the hammer or the rollers, instead of giving the twist before the hammering or rolling; and to effect this the end of the bar may be clamped a sit leaves the hammer or rollers, and the required twist given; but it is better to give the twist before the iron has undergone the operation of rolling or hammering, as it is then more highly heated, and the fibres will not be so severely strained as they would be after the metal has been partly cooled." When iron has been treated and worked according to this process the fibres instead of running in the bar longittdinarily in straight lines, will run in the direction of a felix, gradually approaching to a straight line from the circumference to the axis of the bar, so that when used for making tires, or for other analogous purposes, the bar will be prevented from splitting a ong its length by the tenacity of the fibres which cross the bar in the direction of a felix instead of the mere adhesion of the fibres together; and when used for the rails of rail roads or similar purposes, none of the fibres can be separated from the mass longitudinally, as heretofore, nor can the iron be stripped off in scales, until i the fibres have been cut' off on each side, for by their direction they pass diagonally from one side over the surface and down the other side, whereby they are completely tied together Letters patent have also been granted for forming pen barrels; by drawing- -a process similar to that of making wire: arid another for forming horse shoes with dies, &c. The novelty in both these patents is very slight, and does not require particular attention. Fileswithin the last year letters patent have been granted for a machine for cutting files. It is somewhat complicated, and cannot well be described in this place. The cutting is not effected by blows but by pressure, and the object of the patentee is to increase the pressure upon the chisels, in proportion to the resistance met with, whether the resistance arise from a variety of width, or hardness of the blank. The varied resistances arising from differences of width of the blank, as there is a regularity in the shape of the file, are easily met; but those which arise from its varying hardness as it is not known at what points they will occur, are very difficult to contend with by any machinery at present known.

57Spiral Knivestwo patents have been granted for machinery for grinding spiral knives-one of which was a re issue and has heretofore been noticed. The' other machine grinds the knives in the direction of their length while attached to the st duke s stock traversing end wise, and the shaft of the grinder as it revolves having a vibrating end wise motion to preserve the smoothness of the surface of the stone. As a vast number of theseitives are in use in every part of the country for various purposes, this machine promises great usefulnessiSheet Mltalseveral patents have been granted within the year for the improvements in the machinery for working in sheet metal. This class of machinery is of a simple character and much has heretofore been done to in prove it. Little therefore remains to be done except to refine and perfect the various parts of the machine without very prominent changes of principle and although these refinements are often of great practical usefulness yet it does tout appear necessary in this place to go into a minute description of them. Such should be reserved for inventions of a more striking and original character .a. Letters patent have been granted for an improved machine for setting and filing saws. The machine possesses merit, but it would be difficult in this place, without drawings, to give an idea of its operation. Letters patent have also been granted for a portable machine for planingmietals. This machine differs but little in principle from the machines already in use but its portable character is such as to give it peculiar advantages and cause it to be used in shops and factories where other plan ing machines are already to be found. It is susceptible of being attached temporarily to a bench at any desirable point, or directly to the thing to be operated upon, where it performs its duty and may afterwards be removed to any other place, where it may be needed. It will readily be perceived that thins machine is an important auxiliary to ordinary planing machines; and it great usefulness in machine shops generally is equally obvious. Grip Hammersthree patents have been granted within the year for improvements in trip i hammer s-one of which is a re issue, of a patent already noticed in former reports, and ai other for additional improvements of the same. The hammer in question is attached directly to the piston rod of the steam engine which operates it. The thickness of the mass to be hammered, or other considerations may render it desirable that the hammer should rise higher at one stroke than at another this variation of stroke is regulated by the opening of the eduction valve of the steam cylinder. His valve may be operated by hand or by the machine itself and the additional improvement above mentioned has reference to the operation of the valve by the machine. The valve is controlled by a series of springs which in their turn are controlled by a kind of trigger attached to the piston rod. When the hammer strikes, the momentum of the heavy end of the trigger causes it to descend elevating its short end and forcing it against the machinery which closes the eduction valve, and the hammer is immediately raised The machinery is conveniently adjustable. As the manner arises carrying the trigger With it when it arrives at the point to which by the adjustment it is intended to rise, the short end of the trigger strikes a pin throwing up its long end and relieving the parts which have held the valve closed, upon which the valve opens, the steam escapes and the hammer falls the trigger remaining in the same position till the hammer strikes when the momentum of the long end of the trigger causes it to descend and close the eduction a valve as before. The device is ingenious and useful, rendering 58 X. the machine not only self acting but easily giving any desirable variety of stroke. The other trip hammer for which letters patent were granted, has the general appearance of the ordinary trip hammer, being attached to a lever or handle working upon tr unions. This hammer is operated by steam and the valves and other parts are so arranged that the attendant can regulate or immediately arrest the action of the "hammer at every point. The spring which aids to throw down the hammer after it is raised is a steam spring communicating with the boiler, thus increasing in strength in proportion to the power operating on the hammer. The apparatus appears sufficiently simple and efficient, and will doubtless be found useful. Toolsletters patent have been granted for several inventions under this head, comprehending hammers, chisels, wretches, a users, bit stocks, drills c. These patents generally do not require particular description, but one or two of them deserve notice. The improvement in a users above mentioned consists in a modification of the twist. All who are acquainted with boring are aware that one of the greatest obstacles to be overcome arises from the c logging of the chips, which often renders it necessary to withdraw the anger for clearing. Any devices have been resorted to, for the purpose of enabling the anger to clear itself, and with more or less success. The plan adopted by the patentee is to add to the other improvements a constant variation in the twist so as to leave greater space between the threads for the chips at the upper end of the twist than at the lower. Thus the chips being less compressed will the more readily rise and the anger will clear itself. The bit stock mentioned above as patented, is in its general character and appearance like those in common use. The bit when set in the stock is usually held by a spring catch. Although this catch is in general sufficient to prevent the bit from falling out, yet it does not hold it firmly the bit readily shaking in the socket. I instead of this spring catch therefore the patentee uses a ring, which may be turned by the thumb and finger on the stock, having a portion of the thread of a screw on the interior, which as it is turned, catches into the notch in the thank of the bit at once holding it and drawing it tight up to the shoulder where it becomes immovablelMetallic Pipetwo patents have been granted for improvements in the manufacture of metallic pipe. The first for improvements in machinery for welding iron pipe much resembles some that have been used before. I t need not here be described. It presents but little novelty, though that little appears to be important. It has been patented in England and may be found described in the English journals. The other patent is for improvements in machinery for making pipe of lead or other similar metal. One of the most approved modes of manufacturing lead pipe introduced but a few years ago is to place the melted lead in a strong cylinder having a die and core of proper dimensions for the exterior and interior of the pipe the core being supported by a bridge at the mouth of the die. At the other end of the cylinder is a piston operated by an hydraulic press. After the metal has been allowed to "set" the power of the press is brought upon the piston, and the lead is forced forward through the bridge which separates it into several parts, which by the great pressure applied reunite and pass out of the cylinder between the die and the core in the form of pipe. To more effective and satisfactory mode of manufacturing lead pipe has heretofore been known. But it is subject to one great objection. The power required is almost incredible, and it ix. with great difficulty that the parts can be made of sufficient strength to resist the force applied. Any improvement therefore upon this kind of machinery which will cause it to be effective with diminished force is of primary importance. The lead when "set" has not acquired its usual hardness but is so nearly a semifluid that great pressure upon it by the piston causes the lead to press in all directions like a fluid with nearly equal force. The pressure therefore of the lead upon the sides of the cylinder is nearly equal to the pressure of the piston and when we consider the immense power applied, and that the whole mass must be forced forward until it has passed through the die the resistance arising from the friction of the mass moving along the sides of the cylinder will readily be understood to be one of the most serious obstacles to be overcome. The invention in question entirely obviates the necessity of forcing the mass forwards, and therefore avoids the greatest obstacle heretofore encountered; and this is done by an improvement of the simplest character. The die instead of being placed as heretofore in the head of the cylinder, requiring the lead to be forced along the sides of the cylinder to it is placed in the piston head and moved forward upon the lead so that the mass of lead relatively to the cylinder has no motion and consequently makes no friction nor resistance and all the power required is simply that which is necessary to cause the lead to pass out between the die and core to form the pipe. This improvement is of very great importance, as it brings relief to lead pipe machinery at the very point where it was most seriously needed. There are other incidents and minor advantages, possessed by this machine over others, which will be easily understood and which it is unnecessary to set forth. Letters patent have been granted within the year for a type machine for the manufacture of type from mall table metal. This machine in its general characteristics is like a nail or spike machine. It roles the wire into a flat rod which is received into proper dies where it is held, cut off, and punched into the general form of type, and a die of proper form resembling a header die is brought up against the end of it forming the required letter when it is discharged and another blank received. Those acquainted with spike machinery will easily understand the modifications necessary for forming type, and that there would be but little novelty in such a machine. Two patents have been granted for improvements in rivets, for uniting the parts of bands for gullies. The object of one improvement being to prevent the band from slipping at the point of union, by an improved form of the rivet head, and the other to give a novel form to the thank to preserve the strength of the band, at that point. Both improvements are slight in themselves, but seem to promise useful results. A patent has been granted for improvements in machinery for manufacturing metallic suspended buttons. The blanks are put into this machine and without further handling the parts are punched, placed together and finished. This machine manifests considerable ingenuity but could not in, this place be intelligible described. One patent has been granted for dies for cutting the threads of screws on screw bolts. These dies have a series of teeth each calculated to cut a little deeper than the preceding, and in proper form for cutting the grooves between the threads. The teeth are formed at such distances apart as to follow each in the trace of the other as the cutting proceeds and the blank advances. The teeth are cut away back of their points to allow the edges or points only to touch the blank, and an ample throat is made for the dis5960Ex. charge of the chips. The die is made in one piece and cuts the largest screws with- great perfection and by the application of a moderate degree of power. 4 By reference to my last report it will be perceived that the number of improvements in screw and nail machines patented the past year, bears but a small proportion to those patented in 1846 ; but it should be remarked that a great number of applications in this class are pending, which it has been impossible to reach, but- which will soon come up for examination. Locks, fastenings and hinges Some twenty patents have been granted the past year for improvements in the above subdivisions, but I must confine my remarks to but few of them. Some are complicated, and cannot here be described. Others resemble devices heretofore in -use, so nearly that a description is unnecessary. One of these patents is for a "chronometric lock" to be used when it is only necessary to open whatever is secured by it, at stated periods. Such locks have long been in use to a limited extent, and have a time piece so connected with them as to operate upon some part of the lock, at the appointed time, in such manner as to allow the bolt to be withdrawn, which cannot be done at any time before that at which the piece is set. The patent in question was therefore granted for a modification of those heretofore in use, and presents but little novelty, and with the foregoing remarks will be sufficiently understood by a perusal of the claim. Several patents have been granted for improved fastenings for window blinds some of them are for catches, very nearly allied to those formerly in common use, but more simple and compact.  Others are for improvements placed upon hinges for the same purpose, so combined as to hold the blind open or shut without causing strain upon the point of the hinge. One of them, for fastening the blind open, has a catch attached to the wall at the outer edge of the blind, a latch is attached to the blind, at the proper point to enter the catch, and the hinge is so constructed that the blind rises asitisopened sufficiently to elevate the latch over the catch in the wall, and when fully open falls, dropping the latch into the catch, rendering it impossible to un fasten the blind without lifting it up. To the hinge there is .iachedalever by which the blind may be elevated whenever it is desirable to close it. This mode of fastening is very effective and places the strain at those points where it can be resisted with least injury to the parts. Patents have also been granted for improvements in patches, knobs, &c for doors, and for several devices for opening and closing them, but, without particularly describing these, I must hasten to the next class under my charge. As the business of my desk is six months in arrears, it will be evident that the foregoing does not, by any means, present an adequate idea of the vast extent and variety of inventions inmietalurgy, and manufactures in metals, developed within the past year -nor will it be possible, for the same reason, to do justice to any of the classes which remain to be discussed; but I shall be obliged to limit myself to the unsatisfactory shadow kings which may be derived from unfinished investigations. Of Brous And Texti  Of Substances And Fabri Of. I improvement are rapidly progressing in this extensive class of manufactures, and in the complicated and almost infinitely diversified machinery devoted thereto. Some evidence k of this progress is furnished by the application six. 61 which have been examined and the patents which have been granted. I tis unnecessary in this place to enumerate the various subdivisions of this class they will appear in the course of its analysis. Hemp Brakerstwo patents have been granted within the year for improvements in hemp bakers, neither of which present any very striking novelty. Such ingenuity has heretofore been exercised, and perhaps many machines have been constructed upon sound principles. But the separation of the fibres of hemp and flax from the wood y part of the stalk without breaking and injuring the fibre, is a task of great difficulty. When the machines heretofore known are used, it is perceived that more or less of the fibres are broken and become "tow" and hence the constant exertions on the part of inventors to make improvements which shall avoid this result and very slight changes are often of great importance. At the point where the hemp is broken, it is important that it should not be rubbed or drawn across an edge, but after it is well broken, so that the hard part is loosened from the fibres it may be slightly rubbed without much injury. One of the patents above alluded to, has for its object the breaking of the hemp over a rest by a better, and then drawing the broken part immediately away from the breaking wheel by the action of two better wheels which shake out the hard fragments without allowing the hemp to touch the breaker wheel, thus  breaking and cleaning at once, and, as the inventor contends, without the usual injury to the fibres. The other improvement is upon the old fashioned brake which breaks the hemp or flax, by placing it on a series of stationary blades and passing a set of move able blades between them, carrying the flax or hemp along' and breaking it. The invention has reference principally to the easy introduction and withdrawal of the hemp or flax in the process of breaking. Leaning Cottonthree patents have been granted during the year for improvements in machinery for cleaning cotton. One of these is for a slight improvement upon a machine heretofore patented by the same inventor. It does not affect the general character of the machine but extends simply to the b eaters which are of wire gauze. A perusal of the claim is sufficient for on understanding of the invention. In many machines for cleaning cotton, the principal parts are a hollow cone in nearly a horizontal position, with another cone working within it, and having b eaters upon its exterior for beating out the impure ties. The cotton is admitted at the small end of the machine, and as it is cleaned passes towards the other end where it is discharged. In one of this class of machines patented within the year the b eaters are so arranged in an inclined position upon the exterior of the inner cone, that while they clean the cotton in the usual way, they operate upon it in the manner of a screw and carry it steadily towards the end of the machine where it is discharged, thus securing a more equal and regular action of the machine upon the cotton. Burring, Harding ad Combing Woolseveral patents have been granted within the year for improvements in machinery for these purposes. There has within a few years come into use a burring cylinder, composed of rings upon a shaft resembling very much the saw cylinder of a cotton gin, with inclined notches, cut at intervals, in the outer edges of the rings thus forming teeth to hold the wool while the burrs are beaten off by a. better working nearly in contact wit lift he cylinder. These notches in the first machine patented were formed with wide throats, wider than the opening leading to them. In consequence of this form, it is said that the wool c logs in the notches, and after being burned cannot easily be removed, and, consent X. 
quently, the usefulness of the cylinder, in other respects well calculated to effect its object, is much impaired. This difficulty has been overcome by making the notches of equal width from the mouth to the throat, by which improvement the cylinder holds the wool as well as before, and at the proper time is easily cleared. The better used on these machines consists of a cylinder with ribs extending out from its outer surface for beating off the burr s these ribs have been placed parallel to the axis, and have also been made to wired spiral ly upon its surface. To the first kind of ribs objections were made, which were removed by the second; but while this removed one <a name="evil0"><mark>evil</mark></a> it was said to introduce another to obviate which, and still retain the advantages of the spiral or inclined ribs, the ribs have been placed in zigzag directions upon the surface of the better cylinder. A mode, of constructing these bearers equally applicable to the straight, spiral or zigzag ribs has also been patented, which secures to the better great strength and lightness. Eaters formed like saw cylinders of cotton guns have, for some years past, been known and in use but in these it will readily be perceived that when in operation each successive tooth follows directly in the track of the preceding and the spaces between the teeth all come directly after each other and, consequently, the action of the better is not equal upon all points of the burring cylinder. To avoid this imperfect ion the better cylinder has been made solid, and grooves cut into its surface spirally, so as to make it resemble a screw with sharp threads. Longitudinal grooves are then cut in the surface of the cylinder across the threads already mentioned, forming the whole surface into teeth and spaces. As the grooves around the cylinder are spiral, it is readily perceived, that each tooth as the cylinder revolves will follow the space left between the two preceding teeth, and thus the action of the better upon the burring cylinder will be equal sized. A similar improvement for feed rollers, for this kind of machinery, has been patentee within the year. Other improvements in burring and carding machinery have been made, but it is unnecessary further to dwell upon them, especially as it would be difficult to render them intelligible without drawings. The oiling of wool for carding, heretofore and still practised, however necessary, is, of course, objectionable, in consequence of its influence upon the woven fabric; and letters patent have been granted within the year, for the use of steam instead of oil which is said to present all the advantages without any of the inconveniences of oil. An ingenious and useful improvement in wool combing machines has also been patented. To obviate the inconveniences of other modes of construction, the comb teeth have been attached to belts and carried forward and around driving gullies or rollers. These belts, owing to their flexibility, furncid127h an imperfect support for the teeth. To obviate these inconveniences of the belt, a series of solid in flexible blocks, following each other closely, have been substituted, travelling like the belt, except at 'the ends where, without turning, they are pushed forward into the field of action, or in like manner are withdrawn from it. This improvement secures the in important ends of firmness and perfect parallel ism of the teeth. Cotton Battingone patent has been granted for improvements in cotton patting. These improvements consist in placing upon the bat formed in the usual way, threads at short intervals, both length wise and cross wise of the bat, for the purpose of giving greater strength to the patting; and also in passing the patting, prior to gazing, between rollers moistened with x. a. 63 water or other thin fluid. Thebatting is then glazed by any known process. By passing the patting between the moistened rollers, and then seizing it, a remarkable degree of strength is given to the sized surface; and by the union of the threads, with this mode of seizing, an article is produced which obviates the many evils which have heretofore arisen from want of strengthHatsSeveral patents have been granted for improvements in machinery used in the manufacture of hats. This manufacture by machinery involves considerable difficulty, and much ingenuity has been exercised upon it for many years. Machines upon correct general principles have long since been constructed, which, presenting slight practical difficulties, have failed to perform, in a sufficiently perfect manner, the duties for which they were intended; and it is but recently that hat bodies have been produced in practical perfection by machinery. The differences between some of the machines heretofore known, and some of those recently patented, are very slight; but in this kind of machinery these slight changes often constitute the distinction between machines utterly useless and those of vast utility. One of the patents above alluded to, is for machinery for forming or placing the fibres for the hat upon the perforated cone, so that they shall be properly distributed and prepared for felting. The following extract will sufficiently set forth the characteristics of this machine: " Our invention is for improvements on the method of forming hat bodies by throwing the fur or other fibres on to an exhausted perforated cone placed in front of a trunk or tunnel which receives the fur from the rotating brush or picked, and guides the delivery of it on to the perforated cone. Our first improvement consists in making the sides of this trunk of thin sheet metal, or other substance which can be readily and easily bent to the desired form, so that the aperture of mouth of the trunk which directs the deposit of the fur, etc, on to the perforated cone or former, can be changed at pleasure to increase or decrease the deposit of fur on any part of the former, as it maybe desired, to increase or reduce the thickness of any part of the hat. His object, which is of great importance in the manufacture of hats, has been attempted by providing the mouth of the trunk with a jointed hood which can be depressed or elevated; but it is found in practice that this does not regulate this distribution so effectually as our improved method, for any desired curve can be given to the sides to give a gradual enlargement or contraction to any part." Our second improvement consists in making the top of the trunk so that the end towards the former can be depressed or elevated at pleasure, the back end being the axis of this motion, by means of which the mouth of the trunk can be adapted to any size of former, and yet have the top of the trunk present an unbroken plane, to avoid catching and retaining the fibres or the forming of eddies in the current of air that passes through the trunk, tending to interrupt the direct passage of the fibres from the brush to the former. The top being so formed as to embrace the pliable sides, that the nipper part of the trunk may always be of the same size, irrespective of the position of the to pour third improvement consists in providing the aperture at the back of the trunk, and below the feed rollers and brush, with a valve or shutter, for the purpose of closing the aperture to prevent the passage of a strong current of air through the trunk at the commencement of each operation, and until the perforated former is covered with a film of fibres, by means of which the forming of welts or air bubbles in the bat is effectually prevented. At the commencement of the operation, and before the perform 4 X c. 
tibnis in the former are partly closed :by the deposit of fibres, it will be ohio us that the exhausting fan in the former will produce a much stronger current of air through the trite k than when the perforations are partly closed, arid that therefore the fibres will be thrown on to the former at the commencement of the operation; this it is found by p experience produces counter curcid127icid127ts, which throw up the first film of fibres from the surface of the former, aid thus forms welts or protuberancesiwhich are very injurious to the bat. But by closing the aperture at the back of the it sunk, the fibres ar first dfiseposited by a gentle current and pressure, and after a film completely surrounds the former, the opening of the valve or shutter admits the current, that the fibres may be thrown on with more force to complete the bat. And our fourth improvement consists in the employment of one, two, or fibre rollers, covered with cloth or like substance, below the feed rollers, therottiiho of which, in- connection with the brush, has the effect to brush, comb i, or otherwise straighten the fibres before they are thrown by the brush arid :caird to the former . Other of the above mentioned patents is for improvements in feltingbyi machinery. The hat body is placed upon a perforated hollow cone, and another hollow cone is placed over it. Cloth should be wrapped around the hat body prior to placing 'the outer cone upon it. Steam is the h admitted through the inner perforated cone to the: hat body, while; the outer cone is c infected by a rod to a short crank upon a revolving shaft which gives it aviiatirig mt if ion on its axis, which effects the operation of feltingATrther of the above patents is for an apparatus for forming the brims of hats in finishing, and is made adjustable so 'as to adapt it to different sizes of hats and brims. The last which I shall mention, is a patent for an apparatus for stretching the tips of hats preparatory to blocking. It consists mainly of a series of levers placed around a circle, their upper ends resting together and forminggsomI e thing like the frustum of a cone. The hat body, after felting, is placed upon thee levers, the tip resting upon their ends, when by pressing a t red die or lever connected - with them the ends of the levers are thrown out, stretching the tip to the degree desiredSpinningA patent has been granted within the year for improvements in machinery for doubling and twisting thread. In this machine th'e sobbing with the thread to be doubled and twisted are placed upon spindles or pins upon a stationary frame, the ends of the threads are attached to a b arresting for the time being against rests on the frame, the loops of thread bet $ been the sobbing and the bar are passed over hooks upon a travelling carriage. The carriage is then run back the proper distance for the length of the thread re required, drawing the thread from the sobbing, and as the ends of the threads are attached to the stationary bar upon the frame they are of course doubled. Each of the hooks in question has a pulley upon its shankw6ith a band connected with the operative parts of the machine, and by proper clutching and shifting of bands the hooks are caused to revolve rapidly to give the required twist, after which the threads are cut near the bob bin sand the bar is laid upon a re el, and by proper changes of hearing the carriage is run in, and the doubled and twisted thread wound upon the re el. After this the same process is to be repeated. The ' further details of this machine cannot be rendered intelligible in this report. Letters patent have also been granted for devices for changing the speed of drawing heads. The object is effected by connecting the gullies thioughEx. 65 which the motion is given to the cog wheels, which communicate motion to the drawing rollers by concentric hollow cylinders on the same shaft and passing over or through each other -each pulley is thus connected with opinion which will give a different speed from the others and nothing is therefore necessary to change the speed but to change the belt from one pulley to another without any modification of the driving power. Letters patent have also been granted for very ingenious and apparently very important improvements in spinning frames, which I should be glad to present in this report, but the complicated character of the machinery renders it impossible. Any of the movements are like those of the self acting mule, and in some respects seem calculated to produce similar results. Dora full knowledge of this machine reference must be had to the patent or to the records of this office. Another patent has been granted for improvements in spinning frames which manifest great inventive genius, and promises very useful results. I to general character may be gathered from the following extract from the patent though the details of a machine so complicated cannot in this place be rendered intelligible by invention relates to the carding, condensing and spinning of fibrous substances, particularly wool, by a continuous series of operations constituting a combined machine, and the nature of my invention consists, first in giving to the first pair of draw rollers that receive the movings from the condenser, an intermittent rotary motion when this is combined with the second and third pairs made with their peripheryes in segments, with the segments of one set placed at right angles to the segments of the other so that when the second set are drawing the rolls or moving between them and the first pair that have an intermittent motion, the thread shall receive twist from the spindles to the second set, and when these have performed a portion of a revolution, equal to one segment, and liberate the rolls or movings, the other pair begin to draw, the twist given to treads from the points of the spindle to the second pair is permitted to run up to the rollers that move with an intermittent motion that the movings may be partially twisted the better to sustain the drawing operation The second j part of my invention consists in giving a reciprocaling motion to the guides around which the roles or moving pass between the condenser and the first pair of draw rollers that have an intermit merit motion, for the purpose of taking up the slack made by the continuous delivery of the condenser during the time that these rollers are not in motion The third part of my invention consists in giving to the guides around which the movings pass, an intermittent motion on their axis corresponding with the intermittent motion of the first pair of draw rollers, to prevent the breaking of the movings by friction in passing around the guides. And the last part of my invention relates to the mode of regulating the amount of twist to be given to the threads, by varying the watch of the two pairs of segment draw rollers, that is to say, by varying the distance between these two sets of rollers, which at the same time varies the distance between the lower pair of rollers and the points of the spindles, this being effected by mounting the lower pair of draw rollers on slides, so that by means of a rack and opinion they can be moved up or down the cog hearing which communicates motion from one of the pairs of segment rollers to the other, being connected by joint so as to retain the cog wheels at their true pitch, as the distance between the draw rollers is varied 66 X. a. Cordageas nearly allied to the class of spinning machinery, it may be here noticed that two patents have been recently granted for improvements for machinery for the manufacture of cordage. One of the improvements patented is for the manufacture of hempen rope, and combines the stationary laying block with a condensing tube, whose diameter can be changed at pleasure by the insertion of trumpet mouthed tubes to adapt it to ropes of different sizes, and in combining therewith a conical drawing roller so arranged as to regulate the strain upon the rope in condensing. The other machine patented is for the manufacture of wire rope. I n this machine arms extend out from the main shaft, which support the spindles upon which the sobbing are placed. The sobbing incline a little inwards towards the shaft; the strands are led off from these sobbing directly through a pair of grooved friction rollers, held together by weights or springs, which hold the strands while the laying is effected by the revolution of the main shaft and the sobbing. These friction rollers act as condensers. All the hearing heretofore used to prevent or modify the twist of the wires is dispensed with as injurious to the rope and an obstruction to the operation of the machine. The rope after passing the friction rollers above mentioned, passes around a large grooved drawing wheel, and under grooved pressure rollers to the drum which receives it. The simplicity of this machine is much in its favor, and enables it to run at a speed vastly higher than those heretofore in use for similar purposes. It is said to produce an article of wire rope of the best quality, and with much more rapidity than has heretofore been attained. Weavingseveral patents have been granted within the year for improvements in looms, the characteristics of which, so far as possible, I will sketch. Machinery of this kind is so complicated that it is seldom possible to give a clear idea of improvements upon it without drawings. Letters patent have been granted for a very simple and perfect knitting loom for knitting comforts and other similar articles. In this loom as many different colors of yarn, upon different sobbing, can be used as may be desirable; and they may be so arranged as to produce shades or contrasts in the fabric at pleasure, and stitches are made at a single operation, and in the time of one stitch, entirely around the article to be knit. In this machine the needles are arranged in a circle and parallel to each other, and in a vertical position. The sobbing are placed above upon a revolving frame. The yarns are then brought down and prepared in some convenient way for the knitting to commence. The needles then rise, and as they descend again each hooks upon one of the yarns and draws it down into a loop. The bob bin frame then revolves sufficiently to bring each yarn to the needle next to the one which last seized it; the needles then rise, and the loops already formed hang upon the thanks of the needles without rising. When the needles again descend each hooks upon the yarn which has been brought forward to it, dragging it down and forming another loop. As the needles descend they pass through 'a ring surrounding them all, and by which the hooked points are bent up close to the thanks of the needle, allowing them to pass the loops first formed, and as the needles continue to descend the first formed loops fall off from the needles around the necks of the newly formed loops. Another similar movement of the machinery in like manner forms new loops and casts off the last ones in the same manner, and thus the operation continues until the knitting is completed. This machine indicates much in x. 
67genuity and possesses great merit. As the knitting proceeds, the fabric is drawn off by weights and gullies. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in looms for weaving Brussels carpets. A faint idea of the character of this loom may be gathered from the following extract from the patent, and it would be impossible in this place to present a more detailed description which would be intelligible: "the character of the first part of my invention consists in making the mechanism, which weaves the cloth or forms the body of the fabric separate, and having a distinct organization from the mechanism which operate the fig during wires, removes them from under the pile or fig during loops and introduces them under the open fig during warp, each of these having a distinct and separate organization, and being operated separately and connected by an intermediate mechanism, which starts one of them as it arrests the other by shifting what communicates the motive power from the one to the other. The character of the second part of my invention consists in taking thefiguring wires from the apparatus which removes them from under the pile or woven fig during loops, by means of fingers or their equivalents, which receive and transfer them to the apparatus by which they are introduced under the fig during warp send the third part of my invention consists in the method of introducing the wires under the fig during warps by means of a box into which they are dropped, which box (or its equivalent) is carried under the fig during warps, drops the wire and is then moved back For the reason above given, I am obliged to pass entirely noticed several other looms which are well worthy of particular remark. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in weavers' he doles. These he doles are formed in the following manner: A suitable number of threads are placed in a machine adapted to the purpose, and for some distant e are formed into two brains. After a sufficient length of this br aid is obtained, the threads are all braided together for a short distance; the threads are then, separated and to   e braiding proceeds, producing two smaller brains, until sufficient is formed for the length of the o op through which the war p is to pass; the threads are the a mater mingled and all formed into one br rid for ra short distance, and they are then braided separately until a sufficient length is produced for the meddle. This meddle promises to answer an excellent purpose and appears to be free from the objections incident to most others. Letters patent have also been granted for a machine for braiding theseheddles, but it cannot be understood without drawings. Fire Gauzeletters patent have been granted for an improved manufacture of wire gauze, which although it might be considered as belonging to manufactures in metal, may be appropriately noticed here. This gauze is generally made on looms, and when the wire is fine involves no difficulty. When the wire is larger and coarse, however, it is found that the warp wires alone bend, and the filling wires remain straight, rendering the fabric very imperfect. The improvement in question consists, principally, in crimpingthe filling wires by proper machinery, and cutting them into proper lengths before laying them between the warp. The improvement is great and obvious; and by it gauze can easily be woven sufficiently coarse for grating or railings. Letters patent have also been granted for a loom for weaving this kind <68 X. gauze, in which the warp re rains fixed and strained between the ends of the loom, and the lay travels along over it beating up the crumpled filling wires, as they are inserted. Holding and measuring cloth Three patents have been granted for machinery of this kind within the year; but they are not easily described, and do not differ from those formerly known sufficiently to render any description, which could be her 6 given, interesting or useful. Having touched upon the improvements in each subdivision of this interesting class, I must now leave them, without further analysis, and proceed to the examination of the other classes under my charge. Dress of business and numerous interruptions admonish me to be brief. Steam And Other Gas Engi Nes. Twenty-five or thirty patents have been granted within the year for improvements in steam engines, comprehending modifications of many of the features of that important machine. To much ingenuity has been exercised upon the steam engine for such a length of time, that, as might be expected, few of the improvements, which have been examined, amount to any thing more than slight refinements upon what has heretofore been done, and therefore a review of them would not be particularly interesting; and, without descriptions more minute and full than would be appropriate in his place, very little light could be shed upon the subject. It should, however, be remarked, that results of the utmost importance may arise from very slight improvements in machines used so extensively and under such a variety of circumstances as the steam engine. The number of patents granted in this country and in Europe, for improvements in the steam engine, is almost incredible; but it should be recollected, that these improvements are not confined to the general character of the machine, but are connected also with its adaptation to the multifarious purposes to which it is applied, and the endless variety of circumstances in which it is placed so that many modifications which would be absolute disadvantages, for some purposes, would not only be patent able, but of the highest importance in others. Some improvements have a general application, and are advantageous in any engine to which they may be applied; but in general, it cannot properly be said that one variety of engines is superior to another that the reciprocaling engine, for example, is preferable to the rotary, or vice versa, without taking into consideration the circumstances under which it is to be applied. Each is best in its appropriate sphere, and neither is likely to sup plant the other. There fuel is plenty and cheap, the nice improvements which have been made for economic sing fuel might be out of place and result in disadvantage. There water is pure, the ingenious devices which have been resorted to, for the prevention of incur stations, deposits c, would, of course, be an incumbrance. Under some circumstances, the most complicated engines are indispensable to success, and, under Others, the simplest engine can be most advantageously employed. Thus, in addition to all other causes, circumstances, ever varying, furnish constant employment for inventive genius, and at every progressive step the field expands before it. As I deem a severe analysis of the improvement in steam engines unnecessary, sketches of a few only, will be submitted. Letters patent have been granted for a reaction rotary engine, constituted and operating substantially as follows: The steam is generated in a circus x. war tube or hollow ring. Between the point where the water is admittedcid127and that where the steam is discharged, the tube is closed by a plug or otherwise. These two points are very near to each other; and the opening for the discharge of steam is nearly tangential to the hollow ring. It about half the distance around from the point where the water is received, to that where the steam is discharged, the tube is partially closed by a plug having small perforations for the passage of the steam, thus dividing the tube into two chambers. The water enters the first chamber through the shaft which is hollow and which has a branch tube extending from it like a spoke to' the circular tube. The furnace is circular and by it the fire is applied constantly to all parts of the circular tube. The water is supplied to the first chamber of the tube, and as the heat is intense it flashes into steam and passing through the apertures in the partition plug is still further heated by the circular furnace and is finally discharged tangentially with great velocity, and by its reaction gives rapid motion to the circular ring and its shaft. There great velocity, with little power, is required, this engine may be useful. Two other rotary engines have been patented which have recesses in the periphery of the revolver, and counter recesses in the causing. When the steam is admitted it acts directly upon the revolver; it then acts expansivelybetween the recess in the revolver and that in the causing, then rushes forward into the next recess, &c, and finally has a free exit from the engine after having gone nearly or entirely around. The specific difference between these engines cannot, in this place, be intelligible set forth, and their general features must therefore suffice. Letters patent have also been granted for so combining a steamwhistaewith a float as to give an alarm when the water in the boiler becomes too low. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in several varieties of steam valves. A few years since, letters patent were granted for adropcutoff valve of considerable notoriety, which, when it fell, was received in a cup containing a liquid to prevent "slamming." Another device for the same purpose has been patented within the year, which substitutes a move able inclined plane for the liquid. Letters patent have also been granted for connecting steam chests with side pipes by flexible joints in the following manner. I instead of bolting the steam chest directly upon the pipe it is attached in any convenient manner by a steam. tight joint to one edge of a flat ring of sheet metal, and the pipe is attached in like manner to the other edge thus forming a flexible connection between the two which will compensate for any expansions or contractions of the pipe resulting from the various changes of temperature to which it is subject. It has been found desirable in some cases to place the boilers of locomotives and their engines on different cars and in consequence the relative, positions of the two are subject to a variety of changes from uneven ness of the road and other causes. These changes would of course disturb the connections of the pipes with the boiler and engine. A system of jointed pipes has therefore been adopted and patented which compensates for all these relative changes of position, and obviates the inconveniences which would e arise from the old mode of connection. Passing over the other improvements iii this class, I will call attention to a j rheumatic engine patented within the year in this country and in England. This engine possesses but little novelty. The principal point of which li70Ex. in regulating the pressure of the air upon the piston. This is effected by a stop cock in the pipe leading from the reservoir to the engine. Thisstopcock is operated by the pressure of that portion of the air which is admitted to the piston, and, consequently, when this pressure is greater than is required the stop cock partially or entirely shuts off the air from the engine. It will be readily understood that whatever may be the pressure of the air, within the main reservoir, with this arrangement, the pressure on the piston will not exceed that to which the apparatus is adjusted. It may appear singular that inventive genius is still directed towards improvements in engines of this kind when experiments the most numerous and of the most convincing character have incontestably established the fact, that heat applied to the expansion of any gas affords but a small fraction of the power which would be derived from the same amount of heat applied to water or other liquids. It is, doubtless, true, that many ingenious men are giving their labors to the improvement of rheumatic engines under a his apprehension of principles, and in the vain hope of causing them successfully to compete with the steam engine. But such is not the case with all. There are, doubtless, circumstances under which the rheumatic engine, with all its advantages on general principles, may be eminently useful, in practice; and it is in this view of the case only, that improvements in these engines can be considered in any other light than that of ingenious trifling. San instance in which these engines are useful, it may be remarked that they can be operated by a degree of heat vastly below that which is required to produce steam, and, consequently, in many factories where little power in the engine is required, they might be operated by what would otherwise become waste heat, without expense, when the use of a steam engine would be expensive, and, perhaps, might not be justified by the duty to be performed. This is one of the striking illustrations of the degree to which circumstances influence the usefulness of machinery which seems to operate in defiance of so- nd principles. Without extending my remarks i a pon the subject of steal n and gas etc i es, I wily or )need at once L, the cnasileratijn of my next class, which isNAVGiAT. Of And ,of Of I Mplementsabicid127ut twenty patents for imp over to c1mnprehencedl in this .lass have been granted wh in the year, some of which appear to I e very d stable. Lie i mass of these improvements howe a er ale not such as to claim particular attention in this place, although calculated to operate well and upon principles slightly different from such as have previously been known. Great utility cannot be expected in every patent able modification but the vast importance of the few will easily reconcile us to the many. It is often observed also, that a novel modification from which little or no benefit seems derive able i; frequently the first step towards the most important results. Ship and Coat Buildingseveral patents have been granted for improvements in the models and in the general construction of vessels. One of these is for constructing sail boats with two hulls or feels, united together at the bow and having but one stem the hulls diverge and the space between them presents an inclined surface rising gradually from the lower end of the stem towards the stern of the vessel. It is said that this boat has greater stability than others, and with the wind a beam, will sail better in a word that it possesses all the advantages of the twin boat without it six. disadvantages. With a side wind it will be perceived that the tendency to cap size is counteracted by the weight of the wind ward hull, which must be raised entirely out of the water, or the boat cannot go over and when the wind is strong the wind ward hull is said to be raised sufficiently to present but little resistance, and that the boat will run with the resistance due only to the lee hull and that the di verging position of this hull is such that the boat will run closer to the wind and faster than those of the ordinary construction. Letters patent have also been granted for a lighter of peculiar model, and capable of accommodation g auxiliary buoyant y. It is built with a view to unite the strength of a narrow boat with the stability and buoyant y of a wide one. Letters patent have also been granted for building boats without the usual knees, by placing very thick planking together in the form of the boat required, and uniting them all to the k elson by long bent screw bolts passing through them, from the water ways down through the k elson. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in building ships with wooden planking and ribbed plates of iron instead of knees. And also for a mode of ventilation g the timbers of ships by the action of the bile water. The ship must have a water tight lining inside of the timbers, openings are then made through the deck into the space between the planking and inner causing. The motion of the vessel will cause the bile water to rush alternately from one side of the vessel to the other, expelling the impure gases and admitting fresh air. The openings in the deck can be governed in any convenient way. The numerous advantages of this contrivance are obvious. Propellersseveral patents have been granted for improvements in pro pellets; one for an improvement upon a prop elder heretofore patented and noticed. Another for an improvement in ca sings for screw pro pellets, and another for improvements in the mode of feathering the floats of paddle wheels. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in pro pellets, having reference to the position, location, construction and motion of the paddle wheel, which are said to produce a degree of speed in vessels hitherto unknown, and at a moderate expenditure of power. The shafts of the pro pellets are parallel to the length of the vessel, and the floats make a small angle with the shaft. The shaft is so placed that the floats only will enter the water. The pro pellets are placed at the side of the vessel where there is the greatest breadth of beam, and revolve inwards, pressing the water against the hull. The floats are so connected with the arms of the pro pellets as to present a smooth surface throughout their length. The motion of the wheel is intended to be very rapid, and as the float strikes the water between it and the hull, it is said that the water moves but little, but the wheel rushes forward upon it, much as it would upon a solid inclined plane, carrying the boat forward with great speed. This advantage, if it exist, is due to the very rapid motion of the wheel, and to the vis inertia of the water. But this in ode of pro telling has other advantages of a less e qui vocal character. The ordinary paddle wheel, revolving with sufficient rapidity to proper the boat at high speed, say eighteen miles per hour, moves through the air in a direction opposite to that of the vessel, at a speed equal to it sown added to that of the vessel, which will amount, perhaps, to forty miles per hour. Moving at this rate, the resistance which the wheel makesuEx. Go. No. 540 directly to the progress of the boat, and the resistance of the air to the motion of the wheel, which reacts upon the motive power, are, immense, and sub tract from the progress of the boat and from the power of the engine a very large per cent age. These resistances are avoided by the mode of pro telling now under consideration; and not only so, but the prop elder seizes upon the air as well as the water, and without touching the water would proper the vessel at a very considerable speed. The advantage thus gained is very great, but experiment must determine the precise amount of it. If the ordinary wheel is covered by a "wheel house" still the resistance of the air to the motion of the wheel is very great, and the resistance of the wheel house passing through the air at high speed, must also be taken into consideration. It is an unquestionable fact in mechanical philosophy, that power acting directly, as it does in the ordinary paddle wheel, will produce its greatest effect; but when we take into consideration the immense resistance with which it must contend when acting in this manner, the question immediately arises whether it would not to advantageous to exchange a portion of the benefits arising from direct action, for those which result from avoiding the resistances incident thereto. It is believed that the above mode of pro telling is worthy of careful consideration and experiment. Several patents have been granted for steering apparatus, windlasses, ships' blocks, renders for canal boats, &c, which, although useful, do not present those radical novel ties which would render a notice of them, in this place, particularly interesting or useful. Of  Of   L Engi Neeri Of And Archi Tecture. Upwards of twenty patents for improvements in civil engineering and architecture have been granted within the year, some of which will receive particular notice under their appropriate heads. Excavatorstwo patents have been granted for excavations; the one for levelling, that is, excavating earth where it is too high, and depositing in low places. This excavate or is attached to a cart, and may be adjusted or removed at pleasure. The other is for a ditching machine, for forming ditches and embankments, which will answer the purpose of fences. This machine, as it advances, cuts two ditches, the cross section of which is a triangle with proper space between them for an embankment, and deposits the earth and turf excavated from the ditches upon the ground left between them, forming an embankment in such a manner that the turf shall be on the outside and shall completely cover the embankment, from the top to the edge of the ditch. Nail Roadsseveral patents have been granted for improvements i nail roads and machines for keeping them in order, some of which deserve notice. One patent has been granted for improvements in the rail, and the manner of fastening it to die strangers, which allows the rail after it is worn to be turned upside down and end for end thus successively presenting four edges for the action of the fiancees of the wheels and giving durability to the rail. An improvement has also been patented in switches and fixtures upon cars for operating them, the object of which is to avoid the evils arising from an improper position of the switch. The switch and the fixtures upon the car are so arranged that when the switch is out of place it can be properly replaced x. 732 before it is reached by the car wheels. Considering the fatal accidents which sometimes arise from a displacement of the switch, improvements of this kin must be regarded as very important. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in fixtures to l 1. Cor motives for clearing the track of ice, snow, &c. The apparatus is aompletand is calculated to remove all kinds of obstructions from the road whether they be one or many. Letters patent have been granted for a new apparatus for ascending and descending inclined planes by locomotives and their trains. In addition to the ordinary fixtures of the locomotive, wheels griping a central rail are attached and proper led when the locomotive is on the inclined plane and by these principally it is drawn up, or its progress down is properly checkedcThese wheels are governed in their relative positions by strong springs so tat, the lateral motions of the locomotive shall not disturb the central rail, and they are so connected with the train of cars by to gale joints, that the greatest he weight of the train the greater will be the pressure and adhesion of th-wheels upon the rail, either in ascending or descending. This device by which the cars regulate the adhesion according to their own necessities is very use fully and ingeniously applied. Trilling Rocksletters patent have been granted for a drilling machine of very simple construction and which at the same time appears to be very effective. The drill is attached to the end of a cord of sufficient length, which passes over a pulley which may be elevated or depressed to adapt the machine to different depths the other end of said cord being attached to a wheel moved by a crank, which is operated by any convenient power. As the wheel .revolves the cord is wound upon it, and the drill raised, but at a certain point of the periphery of this wheel there is a projection which pushes the cord off and allows the drill to fall and do its work. This winding of the cord upon the wheel and pushing it off, gives it a twist, the effect of which is communicated to the drill, which is consequently turned more or less at every stroke, thus dispersing with the complicated and inconvenient devices often resorted to for turning the drill. One patent has been granted for improvements in dry docks. The invention presents but little novelty and perhaps less utility and need not be described. Letters patent have been granted for an apparatus in combination with structures at the shore, for deepening the channels of rivers. The apparatus in question is for ascertaining the precise direction of current, after the manner of a weathercock, in order to enable the engineer to determine in what direction to build the structures for directing the channel. Three patents have been granted for improvements in fences. One of these fences is intended for the vicinity of rivers which are liable to overflow their banks, and is so constructed that in case of a flood it will fall down and partially float in the water, and be in condition to be easily restored to its position after the flood has subsided, instead of being swept away as is usual in such cases. The others are built upon the "lever and fulcrum" principle, as the patentees term it. The rails of these fences cross each other at their ends and a pass through mort ices in posts or small wedge shaped posts are placed between the ends of each set of rails and the long part of the other, so that the joint cannot yield in one direction without breaking. These fence except occasionally a post of them, are intended to rest on the top of the ground, and the points where the rails meet are held, on the side upon which they74Ex. could yield, by short posts driven into the ground or in some similar and convenient way. Whether these fences will answer a better purpose than those heretofore in use must be determined by experiment. Nail Road Alarmsone patent has been granted for a rail road alarm, but it is a re issue of a patent granted some years since, and too well known to require description. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in metallic roofing. The novelty of the invention is not very striking, but consists principally in so shaping the plates as at once to make a sound roof, and have each plate in such condition that it can be removed and another substituted without disturbing the other plates of the roof. Rheumatic Nail Hayne patent has been granted for improvements in this variety of rail way. Flexible air tight tubes are placed along the track for the wheels of the cars to travel upon. Air is then forced into these tubes, behind the wheels, by any known means, and as the tubes expand in rear of the wheels they are caused thereby to revolve and the car progresses. The tube, the wheels, and the ways, are so adapted to each other, that the air fixed into the tube will not pass the wheel. A very important improvement in pile drivers has been patented within the year. The machine is operated by steam. The driver is connected with the piston rod of a steam engine, which rests upon the top of the pile and is properly guided in its descent. The steam pipe connecting the boiler with the cylinder is jointed so that the apparatus may ascend and descend without disturbing the connection. When the steam is let into the cylinder the piston and driver are raised and by the discharge of the steam are allowed to fall upon the top of the pile driving it downwards. These blows may be given very rapidly, and their force is much aided by the weight of the apparatus resting upon the top of the pile and descending with it. Bridgesthree patents have been granted this year for improvements in bridges. One is for an improved mode of passing the wires or ropes for sustaining suspension bridges across the water. Another is for a system of trusting along the middle of the bridge to sustain it against vertical or lateral pressure. The third is for a combination and some other modifications of the systems of suspension and thrust, heretofore resorted to, for sustaining bridges. The bridge seems to combine lightness, cheapness, and great practical utility, but it would be impossible in this place to give a clear description of it. To other inventions in this class appear to require particular notice, and I will therefore pass on to the next. Land Conveyanceupwards of thirty patents for improvements belonging to this class have been granted within the year, some of which are of considerable importance. Wheels for Wars and Carriagesan unusual number of improvements in wheels have come under my observation this year. Most of which are intended to obviate the difficulties which have always existed in connecting the rims of cast iron wheels with the hubs. The tread and flanchesof car wheels should be chilled; and they are necessarily much thicker than the discs which connect them with the hut. These circumstances render it very difficult to accommodate the shrinkage of the various parts, in cooling, to each other, and if this is not done the wheel will crack or be weakened in such a manner as to become useless or if applied to use disastrous acciEx. 
75dents will frequently follow. To avoid this <a name="evil1"><mark>evil</mark></a> the discs have been made concave, convex, and concavo convex, and fluted in various ways. These shapes, it is easily' perceived, are capable of yielding as they cool in such manner as to compensate in some degree for shrinkage, but still it has been found difficult to cast perfect wheels. Wheels having one disc, and those having two, have already been cast, but letters patent have been granted this year for a wheel with two outward and one central disc. Three discs being made and arranged as above, the plates may be made much thinner, giving the required strength, and cooling quicker, so as to avoid the consequences of shrinkage, after the rim is chilled. In another of the wheels patented the two ends of the hut are connected together by a convex plate which will allow the ends of the hut to approach or recede from each other in cooling and thus compensate for the inequality of shrinkage. In another of the wheels patented the whole wheel, discs and all, are chilled with a view of avoiding unequal shrinkage altogether. Several other patents have been granted for improvements in wheels but it is deemed unnecessary to dwell longer upon this subject. Brakestwo patents have been granted for valuable improvements in carriage brakes which it would be difficult to describe intelligible, and which will therefore be passed over. Boxes for Axlesletters patent have been granted for an improvement in boxes for axles which allows slight vibrations of the axle in every direction, and increases the durability of the parts, at the same time rendering the motion of the cars easier. Another improvement in boxes has been patented which consists of a kind of skeleton frame work to hold the antiattrition metal now so generally used in boxes. The advantage of these is that wherever the soft metal is too much worn the whole can be taken out without difficulty and another frame with its soft metal immediately substituted. Carriagesseveral patents have been granted for improvements in carriages, one of which is for rendering them capable of floating over streams, marshes, &c. where they are too deep for the wheels. The parts are so arranged that wherever the water is sufficiently shallow, the burden will be borne by the wheels, and when too deep for this the whole will float. Several patents have been granted for hanging carriage bodies. One for hanging them, so that any weight at any point upon them will depress them equally at all points. Another for hanging them upon springs and levers, so that the springs shall lie along the bottom of the carriage body; and also for supporting the ends of the spring on the axle near the hut and making it act as the bolster with the fifth wheel above it. Letters patent have also been granted for a convenient mode of changing the pole or t hills of carriages so as to adopt them to one or two horses at pleasure. Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in rheumatic springs for carriages which cannot in this place, be fully described, but which consists principally in connecting the moving and stationary parts together by flexible media imperious to air. Several patents have been granted for improvements in whiff le trees and harness, intended to facilitate the disengaging of the horse from the carriage in cases of necessity. It is not deemed important to give a particular description of them76Ex. a. Letters patent have also been granted for an improvement in was hers and lynch pins intended to retain the lynch pin in place. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in the bodies of coal cars. The car body has the form of an inverted frustum of a cone which allows the bottom of it to extend nearly to the ground between the wheels and nearly midway between the top and bottom of the car body, bars a replaced across to relieve the bottom from the principal part of the weight of he load. It is not thought necessary particularly to notice the remaining improvements in land conveyance. Hydrauli  Of And Pneumati  Of. Upwards of twenty patents have been granted within the- year, for improvements belonging to the class of hydraulics and pneumatics, very few of which can be particularly noticed. These subjects have so long exercised de ingenuity of inventors that little else appears possible, but to refine upon what has already been done. These refinements, however, important, gentlyly differ so little from what has previously been done, that it would be impossible without drawings and descriptions more minute than can be here given to point out their patent able characteristics. Raising Waterseveral patents have been granted for improvements in pumps and other devices for raising water, some of which may be noticed. Two of these are for the combination and arrangement of the valves and valve seats with the waterways in such a manner, that by simply removing a mi all plate, the valve and seats are entirely liberated, and may be removed and replaced without difficulty. The spoon has long been known for elevating liquids from one vessel and discharging them into another; but however, high the liquid may rise in its passage from one point to the other, its has always been discharged at a point lower than that at which it was received, except in the case of the, spoon ram. Letters patent have been granted within the year for improvements in the spoon, by which a portion of the water is discharged at a point higher than that at which it is received. The machine is complicated, and cannot here be intelligible described. Letters patent have been granted for a portable steam pump, intended principally for jumping the water from sunken vessels. It is very compact and effective. It consists of a steam cylinder, piston, piston rod and cross head, placed between two pumps, the cross head being connected with the piston rods of the pump, and operating them. The pumps and engine are in a horizontal position, and the platform upon which they rest is hollow, and contains the valves and waterways. This pump is too well known to sender further description of it necessary. Letters patent have also been granted for a centrifugal pump for wrecking purposes, with which it is said successful experiments have been already made. Two patents have been granted for improvements in the water ram, the jobert of which is to elevate pure water by the use of that which is impure, economicing the pure water and wasting only the impure. The two kinds of water are kept separate during the operation of the machine in the on else by a flexible vibrating diaphragm, and in the other by a stratum of air and vertical partitions. Both machines seem calculated to answer a usefulparposeEx. 
77Letters patent have been granted for a hydraulic engine. It has two cylinders and pistons, and the water, in driving the engines, operates alternately on one side of each piston. This engine possesses but little novelty, and much resembles a primitive steam engine. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in filtering stop cocks, and also for improvements in fire engines. The improvement in the fire engine has reference to stability, and a more convenient and effective application of the power. Several patents have been granted for improvements in water wheels, most of which are slight modifications of those already in use, and some of them are complicated. To descriptions of them, therefore, which would be interesting or useful, could be given in this place, without transcending appropriate limits; and as the same remarks apply to other improvements i a this class, I will here dismiss it and hasten to the next. Of Lls, Mechani Cal Movements, &c. Nearly twenty patents for improvements in machinery belonging to this class have been granted within the year. Any of these "improvements would perhaps more appropriately be de nominated changes, as they appear to promise but little utility, Some of them, however, are worthy of notice. Grinding Millsone of the patents granted this year for improvements in grinding mills was noticed in my last report, having been examined in December, 1846, and although apparently an important improvement, does not require further notice. Letters patent have been granted for a mode of elevating and depressing the runner stones of several mills at a time, so that all shall have the same adjustment by a single operation. Letters patent have also been granted for making the drum which drives the mill spindle, at the same time a fan for cooling the stones and for blowing out any dust which may be in the grain as it drops from the hop per intothe mill. Horse Powersthree patents have been granted for modifications of horse powers, a correct idea of the characteristics of which cannot here be given. One of them appears to be useful, as it is simple of its kind and efficient. The other two manifest much more ingenuity than utility. Fewer attempts at improvements in horse powers seem to have been ma in during the past year than formerly. Letters patent have been granted for improved machinery for elevating grain from vessels. The vessel, in consequence of the motion of the water, is seldom at rest, and the grain to be elevated is for other reasons at various depths. The object of the machinery in question is, by a self acting apparatus, to compensate for the inequalities above mentioned, without interrupting the operation. An ingenious machine for dressing mill stones has been patented this year, which, however, is too complicated to be intelligible described in this place. The cutters are so regulated as to vary the depth and width of the different parts of the grooves in the manner required. Letters patent have also been granted for an improvement in drivers for mill stones, so constructed and connected with the spindle and mill stone that the stone may retain its proper position, independent of the vibrating erwabbling motion of the spindle. A very perfect mode of sWpendingEx. shafts, whether for mills, water wheels, or other similar purposes, has also been patented. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in producing a reciprocaling, by a rotary motion; and two patents have been granted for changing hearing for the purpose of increasing or diminishing the speed of machinery, without interfering with the motive power. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in jointed potmans or connecting rods, which enables them to work evenly and with certainty, and at the same time adapt a long piston stroke to a short crank, or vice versa. Letters patent have been granted for an improved mode of coup long line shafts. In most factories it is desirable that the shafts should be so coupled as to allow some vibration; but shafts for driving spinning, and some other kinds of machinery, should revolve if possible without the slightest vibration. To effect this object, and for great strength, the shafts at the ends where they meet have discs of considerable diameter upon them, which, except near the centre, lie against each other, forming a perfect joint. In the edges of these discs, parallel with the shaft and opposite each other, grooves are cut. A cup, having ribs on the interior of its cylindrical sides fitting the above mentioned grooves, is slipped on over them both, there being an opening in the bottom of the cup or collar to receive the shaft. Screws are then passed through the bottom of the cup and through both discs fastened to the shaft, binding the cup and discs firmly together. This joint is very strong and in flexible. The dorsi ve strain comes entirely on the ribs and grooves above mentioned, and the screws sustain only the longitudinal strain. Letters patent have also been granted for an improved regulatory for machinery. The patentees principle may be variously and extensively applied. A small pump for air or water is connected with the machinery to be regulated and driven by it. This pump discharges itself into a small reservoir, having a float in it, which rises and falls with the fluid. In the lower part of the reservoir there is an adjustable stop cock, to discharge the fluid pumped into the reservoir by the action of the machinery. The float may be connected with the throttle valve of the steam engine, or may be connected with a brake or some similar device, for checking the motion of the machinery. The stop cock is then adjusted to the speed required, and while the machinery moves at the speed required, the water will remain at the sane height, and the float will be stationary. If the machinery should move too fast, the fluid will be pumped into the reservoir faster than it can be discharged, and of course will rise carrying the float with it, and thus operating the throttle valve, and partially shutting off the steam, or bringing the brake upon the machinery and checking its motion. If the machinery moves too slowly, the water in the reservoir will descend, opening the throttle valve, and allowing a larger supply of steam, or removing the brake from the machinery. This regulatory promises great usefulness, and is free from the prominent defects incident to most regulatory now in use. Nothing further in connection with mills and mechanical movements has transpired at my desk which need be made the subject of remarkLUMBER And Machi Nery For Worki Of Therei N. About thirty patents have been granted this year for improvements belonging to this class. It comprehends a great variety of machinery to which important additions are annually made Machines for working in lumber78Ex. have already attained so high a degree of perfection, that almost every variety of form may with the greatest facility be produced and finished by them. Met the march of improvement is onward towards a still higher degree of perfection. Saw Millsseveral patents for improvements in saw mills have been granted this year, one of which is for a steam cross cut saw. 1 this machine the saw is connected directly and firmly to the piston rod of the engine, and the cylinder vibrated slightly on tr unions for the purpose of depressing and elevating the saw as it moves back and forth for sawing; guides to prevenvibrations of the saw are placed near the points where the saw operates upon the timber. A minute description of this machine cannot be given in this place. Another patent has been granted for a .machine for sawing wood. It has the usual motions of machines for this purpose which it receives from a weight; and when the log is s awed off, the saw is raised, and the motion stopped by a self acting apparatus, and the whole prepared for another cut. Letters patent have also been granted for sawing arabs que work for chair backs, &c; for gazing, ascribing, and sawing rails, for winding staircases, and other similar purposes. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in regulating the feed of saw mills. The feeding is usually effected by a hand taking into a hatchet, or rag wheel, and operated directly or indirectly by the saw gate and when a change in the feed is required some modification of its connection is usually made. But in the patented machine under consideration the hand is supported, near the point where it works into the hatchet wheel, by friction rollers resting and travelling on inclined planes and by elevating or depressing these planes, the hand will be allowed to take into the hatchet at the moment it commences its motion forwards, or may be made to pass over one or more of the teeth before the feed commence4Letters patent have been granted for a saw mill possessing great perfection of parts and combinations and great versa utility of action. It is adapted to ordinary rectilinear sawing, to the sawing of curves regular or irregular, and to the sawing of warped surfaces, such as are used in ship building and elsewhere. It will be readily perceived that machinery which is principally self acting and capable of such a variety of duties, cannot be intelligible described in this paper. Letters patent have been granted for slitting boards by a machine having a series of circular knives, of different shaped edges, placed in nearly parallel rows opposite each other, their diameters such that as the board is driven between them each pair cut deeper than the last, until the strips are entirely separated. Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in machines for sawing singles by circular saws. When the circular saw is used for this purpose the distance which the block must travel against the saw for an enter separation of the single, depends not only upon the length of the block but upon its thickness, and therefore provision must always be made for the block carriage to travel, before returning, a distance sufficient for separating the single from the thickest block, which would be greater than is necessary for thinner blocks, and considerable time would be lost after the sawing of each single from all blocks but those of the maximum n thickness. The machine in question is so constructed as to be operated upon by the thickness of the block in such a manner that the thickness shall regulate the 80 X. distance that the carriage shall move, and stop it and allow it to be carried back preparatory to another cut, as soon as the single is fully separated, whatever may be the thickness of the block. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in machinery for making splints for baskets. It is so constructed that the travel of the splint knife can easily be adjusted to the length of the splint, and a lateral motion is allowed to it by suspending it upon taught cords, which will allow it to follow the grain of the plank from which the splints are to be taken instead of cutting. Letters patent have been granted for several improvements in state and barrel machinery, some of which are too complicated, and others are not sufficiently important to justify an elaborate description. Letters patent have been granted for turning the nails in such manner as not to interfere with the grain of the wood. The bolt from which the the nail is formed is not always straight, and if so turned as to make the trenailstraight, it would thereby be weakened and would not hold so well as one that is slightly crooked hence the importance of a machine capable of adapting itself to the grain of the bolt to be turned. Letters patent have been granted for a machine for turning out wooden bowls from blocks. The improvements consist chiefly in the susceptibilityof the machine to be adjusted and adapted to the manufacture of bowls of different sizes and thicknesses. I Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in turning irregular shapes. The principal difference between this and some other machines heretofore in use, consists in the motion of the saws or cutters, which in this machine act with the grain of the wood and upon an axis nearly at right angles to the length of the block to be operated upon, instead of operating across tie grain as is usual. Letters patent have also been granted for machinery for making window sash. Although the improvements are important, yet it would lead me too far to set forth intelligible the merits of the invention. Splaning . Machliesseveral patents have been granted for improvements in planing machinery within the year, some of the peculiarities of which should be noticed. One of these machines has a cylinder with radial cutters placed length wise of the cylinder. This c utter revolves as the plank advances and sores its surface. After passing the score r, the plank is forced against a stationary roughing c utter and also against a smoothing plane placed behind it, which finished the work. Another patent has been granted for improvements in machinery for planing seats for blinds, &c. The machine in question manifests ingenuity, but has too many parts, aid is too complicated for a description in this place, and probably for practical utility. Another planing machine has been patented, whose operative parts consist principally of a rougher to prepare the plank and reduce it to the proper thickness, and stationary planing cutters under which the plank passes a sit leaves the rougher for smoothing. When feed and pressure rollers are so arranged that the last roller on the side opposite to the c utter shall be a little nearer the c utter than the corresponding one on the opposite side, in order that the plank may be slightly sprung down upon the c utter. It is said that this machine does its work in a satisfactory manner and with great rapidity. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in connecting feed x. 81 rollers with each other and with the machine for planing. By the modes of hearing and operating feed and pressure rollers heretofore known, it has been impossible to give them that degree of adjustment which will adapt them to the great variety of thickness of the stuff without throwing them out of gear. This difficulty is obviated by the invention under consideration as follows: Each roller has a opinion at its end, which works into another opinion revolving on a pin, and connected to it by a link equal to the sum of the radio of the two. These two auxiliary opinions are again united to each other by a similar link, which causes them constantly to take into each other. These form a constant connection of the feed rollers with each other through the medium of the two auxiliary opinions; so that when one is caused to revolve, the other will revolve with it. The pins upon which the auxiliary opinions revolve are not connected with the frame, but are simply connected by the links above mentioned to each other and to their respective feed rollers, which allows them 1- change their position freely, following the feed rollers. The boxes in which the dudgeons of the upper feed roller revolve, work in vertical s lots, which allow them to rise and fall at pleasure, and are kept to their place by weights, &c. With this construction it will be perceived that the feed rollers may lie against each other, or may be separated until the three links are in a straight line without interrupting their feed motion or throwing the parts out of gear. His will give all the compass that can be desired, and entirely obviate the difficulty heretofore experienced. I must here close my remarks upon improvements in planing machines and upon the class of machinery for working in lumber. Of Of Arms And I Mplements Of Warthis class is less comprehensive and diversified than the others, and of course presents fewer t objects for inventions. It has this year received considerable attention; and although the number of patents is much less than in the other classes, yet they are more numerous than usual, and on the whole, the improvements possess more than an average importance. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in casting bullets. The moulds are connected together in sections, forming an endless chain or belt. This belt passes under the reservoir of most en lead, and the <a name="mould6"><mark>mould</mark></a> s are filled, and the belt passes along in a horizontal, position until the balls become cool. The belt is then bent around a pulley which at once drives it and opens the sections of the moulds from which the balls fall. The belt afterwards passes around one or more additional gullies and up again to the reservoir, Thus while one portion of the moulds is receiving the moltenlead, the bullets are cooling in another, and are discharged at a third without any interruption. Letters patent have been granted for improvements for that variety of firearms that receive the load at the breach; also, for an improvement in many barrelled pistols, by which all are discharged at once, with very little chance of failure. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in that class of wrought iron guns, which are constructed of states and hoops. Letters patent have been granted for an important improvement in fuses, to be used in blasting rocks, &c. The fuses heretofore used are somewhat uncertain in their action. They occasionally, from various causes, become682Ex. extinct, causing great inconvenience, and not un frequently, consequences, of a much more distressing character, arise from the apparent extinction of the fuse. The workmen encouraged to return to their work by an apparent extinction, and the charge exploding produces immense destruction of life. To make the fuse certain and prevent these disasters, it is made and covered in the usual way, but has placed in its centre, through its whole length, a core thread saturated with saltpeter or a similar substance, which will burn with the fuse, and will not be extinguished by the causes which usually extinguish the fuse. I f, then, the fuse becomes extinct, the core thread continues to burn until it again i unites the fuse, as often as it becomes extinct, until the fire reaches and explodes the charge. The importance of this invention is readily appreciated. An improvement in casting ordnance, apparently of great value, and the last I shall notice in this class, has been patented within the year, which is also applicable to the founding of all large hollow cylinders. The cannon, or cylinder is cast upon a core, in a <a name="mould7"><mark>mould</mark></a> of proper size and form. Tubes are passed down nearly to the bottom of the come. These pipes are for the circulation of currents of air, or water for cooling. The flask or causing of the <a name="mould8"><mark>mould</mark></a> is surrounded by a furnace, communicating heat to the exterior and the cannon, after being cast, is allowed to cool, principally under the influence of the currents of air or water within, and the moderate heat of the furnace without. When the cannon is cast solid and allowed to cool in the ordinary way, the outside first becomes cool, and shrinks to the size necessary to surround the hot mass within. As the mass cools and contracts, the outer part which has already suffered nearly all the contraction it is capable of, cannot accommodate itself to the contraction of the mass within and a strain among the particles immediately commences, and increases until the cannon is entirely cool. That portion of the iron which when hot filled the space within the comparatively cool exterior ring is not sufficient, when cool to fill it without being strained out of its natural state, and this unavoidable strain is very injurious to the iron and impairs the strength of the cannon. If the cannon were permitted to cool within and without, the iron between these two surfaces would suffer in a similar manner, and the like injury would be sustained. These inconveniences, the invention above described was intended, and seems calculated to obviate. The cooling commences within, and by degrees extends throughout the mass, the outer surface cooling last. The inner shell being first formed, all without being still hot, each stratum he it cools can adapt itself to that which is already cooled within. The inner part being cooled suddenly is rendered hard and capable of resisting the action of the charge without injury to its surface, and the outer parts in consequence of cooling so slowly become comparatively soft and tough, and capable of resisting the strains and shocks which it is destined to sustain. Unless there are practical difficulties in this mode of casting which are far from being obvious, the improvement is of immense importance in casting ordnance and all heavy hollow cylinders. Of Scellaneous. Nearly 20 patents belonging to this class, or which are not comprehended in the others, have been granted this year. They are not generally however of great importance, and I shall notice but few of them. Some of the sex. a. 83 patents are for fire escapes, t wine stands for counters, cigar machines, states, cutting and raising ice, making brushes, and making baskets, &c. Letters patent have been granted for machinery for grasping dye wood. I t consists of a series of circular saws upon a shaft, with rings or discs between them to keep them at the proper distance from each other. These saws are parallel to each other, and make nearly but not exactly a right angle with the shaft. The teeth of these saws, when the shaft is revolved, will come successively in contact with every point of the surface to be grasped, and being saws instead of the spiral strips heretofore used in a similar manner possess sufficient strength for the service required. Two patents have been granted for improvements upon those fish hooks, which have an auxiliary striking hook, and which were patented in 1835. One of these patents is for an improved mode of liberating the striking hook for action, and the other is for making the bait hook change able, so that if broken or if a hook be not of proper size another can be easily substituted. Other patents in this class have been granted, but a notice. of them is not important and would not be interesting. I have thus presented a view of the progress of the useful arts, so far as their development has come under my observation, in discharging the duties of my desk. The result would be highly honorable to the industrious and inventive spirit of any people if it were confined, in the classes I have reviewed, to the improvements noticed in this report. But the half has not been told. The genius, energy, and patient perseverance of the inventor in the noble work of improvement, in those arts which minister to the necessities, the conveniences, and the enjoyments of man, have far outstripped the tardy foot of legislation, and have transcended the limits of legislative provisions for their protection. Nearly half the applications referred to my desk during the year remain unnoticed in consequence of a notorious inadequacy of force to make the requisite examinations. In forming an estimate therefore of the vast number and importance of the inventions developed within the year, large additions should be made for those which are still un examined, and consequently cannot at present be described; among which a glance suffices to show there are some whose interesting and important characteristics will not suffer in comparison with the noblest inventions of former years. Respectfully submitted by. P. N. Of Tzgerald, Examiner of Patents. The. 3 1st, 1847 *x. a. Remarks Of The Tabular Esti  Mate. The table just given em bodies the result of our investigations respecting the, principal crops of 1847. Unfortunately for us, however, a link has been struck from the chain of dependence which we have sought to establish for some years past in forming our tabular estimates. Taking the census returns for the basis, we had traced the variety of influences which it was supposed might cause an increase or decrease of the amount of the different products embraced in those estimates, and thus brought down the results to 1845. Were our labors were closed for a full year. In this period, however, similar causes were operating, large sales and settlements of lands, and improvement of husbandry were in progress; the effect of the seasons, the it t crease of population, the influx of immigrants, the operations of trade, all, as before, modifying the calculations to be formed by comparison with the previous years, and creating a new link, to lengthen the connection between the census and the present period. The task and labor on resuming the office once more imposed, of preparing even conjecture l estimates respecting the agricultural resources of our country is now still more difficult than it has ever been. To appropriation was made for the collection of agricultural statistics in 1846; it became necessary, therefore, on being again directed to present a report for the year 1847, to perform the double work of reviewing the sources of information for the former, as well as collecting and condensing the accumulated facts of the present year. To add still more to this complicated task, the lateness of the period, at the very close of the late session of Congress, in which the duty wa- s imposed, deserves notice. This did not allow recourse to the members of the senate and house of representatives, to obtain the names of the various agricultural associations, and of the proper persons to whom the circular of the office might be addressed to procure the information needed. It became necessary, therefore, to recur, in many instances, to those that had been furnished the year previous, with the addition of such others as could be selected for the various agricultural journals, among the warm friends ofagricul are and practical husbandmen in different parts of the country. I tis not unlikely, that in numerous instances of these persons, removals by death or otherwise, may have prevented their receiving the letters sent them, and consequently, these have fallen into the mass of dead letters, or, atlepcst, have brought us back no response. Among the individuals selected w -re officers of state and county agricultural societies, farmers' clubs, and me not various classes and professions, whose business would enable them to form a fair judgment of the state of husbandry, and the aspect, progress and success of the crops in the various sections of the land where they lived. There was another <a name="evil2"><mark>evil</mark></a> we had likewise experienced by the omission of the report of 1846. The various agricultural periodicals which we had been receiving, amounting to some twenty-five or thirty in our country, and twelve or fifteen in Great Britain and on the Continent, were at once discontinued, and on the resumption of our duty in preparing the present report, these including the numbers for that year had to be procured with some delay of time and then examined. In short, to connect the estimates of 1847 with those of 1845, marking at the same time, so far as possible, the progress of agricultural affairs during the interval, it became necessary to crowd, as it were, the labors and results of two years into one. Difficult, however, as it has been, we have essayed the task and performed x. a. 87 it to the best of our ability. The result is contained in the pages of this report. To any one who cursorily runs over the estimates and the remarks which follow, it probably might appear a very easy duty to fill up the columns of a few tables, and gather some 400 pages of matter. The trial, however, would lead to a different conclusion; and, perhaps, a statement of some of the particulars may serve to correct this error. About 1500 copies of the circular of questions, soliciting replies have been distributed in various parts of this widely extended country. This circular contained, besides the topics embraced in former ones, a variety of particulars in relation to the progress of agricultural industry. To those gentlemen who have cordially responded to our request, the thanks of the country a swell as of the office are due. Any of their replies are full, and manifest a deep interest respecting the object in view, and form a very valuable contribution to our means of information. The data thus furnished becomes more reliable, evincing, as it does, the care which has been used in the preparation. Though the questions referred to the year 1845, as the period for comparison by which to estimate the crops of 1847, yet in the replies, much information has also been received in respect to the crop of 1846. They contain, too, valuable suggestions, facts and hypothesis, and a readiness is expressed to aid in all future attempts to collect similar estimates of the agricultural resources of our country. Not less than seventy-five or eighty periodicals, some scientific and agricultural, and others more general, from those issued quarterly or monthly to the weekly and even daily records of information, making in the numbers some thousands, have been examined, and everything, however small, which might be supposed to aid in the object noted; a considerable proportion of these likewise were in ich and German, and required translation, the difficulty of which is the later, from the want of suitable dictionaries, embodying technological terms, and the more minute subdivision of many topics in those languages as compared with our own. Some of the valuable discussions drawn from those sources may be found in the appendix, as well as others, condensed and embodied in the following pages. Besides this literature and science of the journals, many valuable works have been added to the library on agriculture and kindred topics both in the English and French or German languages. The aim in this respect has been to select none but those of acknowledged worth, and recommended by persons or journals of high authority, on whose judgment and commendation we could unhesitatingly rely. Any of these volumes have been studied, or if read less carefully, yet so far examined as to observe any thing that seemed appropriate to the object before us. Among these works, a considerable number relate to statistics in England and on the Continent, and have been studied and reflected upon to gain new suggestions and acquire new methods of eliciting facts, by comparisons and estimates. Numerous references have been made and valuable hints stored up, to guide in conducting our own investigations. The collateral branches of science which bear on the general topic, such as chemistry, botany, geology, methodology and physiology, have so far as practicable, been likewise kept in view, in our examination, and whatever assistance we could avail ourselves of from them in laying up our material, we have used. The territory over which we have had to travel, too, in our researches continually, is vast. At one time a fact must be noted in Paine, then perhaps in Georgia, Florida, Arkansas or Texas, then again in New York or Pennsylvania 88 X. a. Virginia, Ohio, Missouri, I own or Michigan, and so of all the intervening states and further territory. Now we must open our memoranda and enter an item o on a page of notes on England, France or Germany, then perhaps turn to mark down something relating to Australia, South America or China. Long columns of figures in some cases must be col later, comparisons made, and proportions instituted. In the notices taken of the crops, as the history of them for their season was forming, reference has been preserved so far as could be done, and in general, to the climate, geographical situation, geological formation and nature of the soil; the influence of increase or decrease of population, and the state of the market to affect the result; the census, maps, gazetteers and descriptions of every kind have been consulted and laid under contribution, to enhance the value of the condensed summary. The amount of labor has been great, and no pains have been spared to render a faithful report. Four success our fellow citizens can judge. The more accurately the bearings of the above, and a multitude of other particulars of much or small importance in their influence on the result, can be developed, the nearer will be the approximation of the estimate to exactness. Are has been taken to guard, more than ever, against the mistakes of the past years, and to improve the best results of former experience. Some claim might perhaps be laid to higher authenticity in the present result of our labors from the fact, that every year with the same original qualifications, with even ordinary diligence, and certainly then with almost constant application in the repetition of examinations and comparisons, gives increasing facility and ability for the task. The interest one feels in any subject is generally heightened as he pushes his investigations yet farther and farther and a sort of enthusiasm is created which seems often to quick en the readiness to catch in a moment whatever relates to it, as e eye travels over pages and columns of various matter and notes the fact t may be immediately or more remotely useful for the purpose. It would be a species of folly, however, to set up for the result of our labors any higher claim than that of most reliable as a whole, in the present' state of statistical operations in this country. From our examinations we are well convinced that many of the random conjectures of published statements based on some one or two elements of calculation must be far wide of the mark. We should deem them too un safe even for comparative estimates, and still less reliable as independent ones. We doubt not the same imperfect ion, though we believe by no means to an equal degree, may attach to our own; but it is evident that where regard is paid to the principal modifying elements, the result is, to say the least, more likely to be correct than in a different case. It is believed that injustice has sometimes been done to the agricultural reports of this office, by setting them down as filled with had hazard conjectures, unworthy of confidence; and the census of 1840 is mentioned as the only data to which reference should be made. But seven years have passed away, years of manifold changes on our country since those returns were given; and can no allowance be made for their influence; can nothing be done in forming an opinion respecting the development of our country in its agricultural resources he may avail ourselves of this reference to the census however, in aiding in oar own defence in case of occasional errors. Even this national survey, tacts as it is by persons differing as they do in capacity, more or less favorably situated, aided or opposed by the intelligence, or the ignorance and x. a. 89 prejudice of those to whom they apply, suffering from all the drawbacks of a natural unwillingness to communicate what is required rather than left optional, must be of various worth in its details, and will be more reliable in regard to some parts of the country than others. The same will ever be the case with any estimates or surveys which embrace so vast a territory as ours, inhabited ty people so diversified in origin, disposition and means of information, having more or less inclination to aid or hinder any effort for success in such an enterprise. What has been done however, by our correspondents, has been a willing offer; and as .they have been selected for the purpose by their fellow citizens, who from personal knowledge did thus, a sit may be said, touch for their suitable ness; it is not too much perhaps to claim for a condensed result of their labors, combined with what we have reaped from other apparently well authentic a ted sources, the credit of more than ordinary reliance. And here at this point, it may not be improper to allude to the fact that the extensive distribution of the former reports of this office has contributed not a little to awaken a spirit of inquiry, and fit many to understand what was needed, and to act intelligently in view of the call made on them for information. This we deem of some importance and numerous expressions in their replies to the office, show that they have been conscious of this influence, regard it as favorable to themselves and their fellow citizens, and feel an increasing desire to share in its benefits. It is evident that new views of the ample resources of our country have often been thus gained, and after a most extensive examination of the agricultural and other journals, an almost universal approbation of our efforts has seemed to us to have been accorded. Preliminary to a more detailed examination of several of the most important crops, there are a few topics which deserve some notice. It is unnecessary to occupy time in the statement at length of the grounds on which we have proceeded in making up the table, or the particular elements of which it is composed. A reference ,to the preceding reports, in which these are fully stated is all that now seems needful. We barely remark in addition, that the causes specified may exert a greater or less influence in different years and their operation may likewise be modified by others which may intervene, one or more years, and then perhaps be unknown. A glance at a few leading points comprised in the history of the world, and our relations to the same may not here be without interest or advantage, in prosecution of the object to be aimed at in this report a faithful representation of facts in respect to our resources in agricultural wealth and its best modes of development. The state of the world abroad has no doubt exercised an influence on the arrangements of our agricultural industry. There has been a greater demand of us for food by the nations of Europe. We leave out of question here all disputed points with reference to great political theories, and confine ourselves to those facts which will be universally acknowledged. The almost total failure of one crop and the great deficiency of some of the others in Europe, rendered it necessary for those countries where the <a name="evil3"><mark>evil</mark></a> was most severely felt to look to us for a supply. Such was the state of their commercial regulations also as favored the introduction" of our pro 90 X. due on more easy terms than heretofore. The demand thus created has had its influence on a people like our own, not slow to perceive any openings for their enterprise either at home or abroad. Their industry has been stimulated, and the prospect of an abundant market has led the farmers and planters in the various sections of our republic to prepare a greater breadth of land for grain and other crops. The recurrence of the sam. Mysterious cause or <a name="disease1"><mark>disease</mark></a> which has so greatly diminished the potato e crop in our own country has likewise unquestionably turned the attention of some of -our agriculturists still more to other products of the soil less precarious and which might be substituted for that well known and favorite fruit of the earth. The war, it might be supposed, by withdrawing numbers, especially in the west, from the pursuits of agriculture, and of producers converting them into consumers, has lessened the aggregate of the harvests and thus balanced the effect of more favorable influences. This cause has undoubtedly had its influence, and must be regarded among others in looking over the operations of things at home and abroad; but the extent of its exercise on the great crops of our country, it is believed has been comparatively small. The number of practical agriculturists taken from their occupations is deemed too few for their influence to have been very perceptible, and the demand of food may not have been materially lessened on this account. I t cannot, we believe, be viewed as fairly counter balancing other and more influential elements, such as those for instance, which are comprised in the variations of the seasons, the improvements in husbandry, and greater foreign demand. The year opened with unusual promise of activity in business at home and abroad; a prospect which has proved remarkably correspondent to the actual result. Expectation of greater demands from abroad, with a prosperous state of things at home, authorized, it was felt, more than usual effort to meet the requisitions of almost starving nations, and a rnuliplied population of our own. Besides the increased amount already devoted to the winter grains in the previous autumn, the spring and summer seeing, it seems, was considerably larger than usual. Taking the whole extent of the country, the season of the previous year 1846) was favorable; in the large grain districts the crops were abundant, and this, again, may have had a tendency to stimulate agricultural industry, particularly as the outlet for the surplus appeared to be widened. Farmers are proverb i ally influenced not a little by the effect of one or more favorable or un propitious seasons. They feel encouraged, when they have been successful, to go on and extend yet more their enter prizes; but if balked in their expectations by untimely weather and lessened harvests, they shrink back, and scarcely feel willing to repeat their experiment. Happily, this year there had been and yet existed that combination and cooperation of causes which dispelled their fears, and emboldened them to plunge the plough yet deeper and farther into and through the soil; and their most sanguine expectations have met, it is believed looking at the collective aggregate with a proportionate reward of their labor. Whether the stream of surplus products will flow wider, or be narrowed down again to its former dimensions, time must determine; but from the best in for at ion we can gather, we should be inclined to hazard the belief, that though subject to occasional interruption, the progress 'f demand upon our agricultural resources will be steady, and with increase I needs to be x. a. 91 supplied. Acts that we are yearly accumulation g seem to justify this expectation. Unlike many other countries, especially those of the old world, the whole of our population comparatively enjoy the means of livelihood, and are fed from the plenty that a bounds in our land. Last numbers of their poor and starving have sought a refuge among us, and many, too, better provided, have chosen their habitation on the rich and fertile lands of the west and northwest, that are there outspread to invite their residence. Taken in the aggregate, these, while they have added to our population, have probably too increased the amount of products raised among us. The emigration from Europe has been far beyond what it ever was before. By the returns of the collectors of five of the principal ports, to the Secretary of State, the number of persons of this character arriving during the year ending Kept. 30, 1847, is stated to be 233,798, an increase of not less than 82 134 in one year." It is very probable that the addition of others at the smaller ports, and those entering our country by the way of Canada, would swell the aggregate to not less than 300,000, and possibly more. The following table presents the comparison, in this respect, of the last twoyearsFor the year ending Kept. 30, 1846. For the year ending Kept. 30, 1847. I increase.

A portion of this emigration ,to doubt s til ing e s or the Atlantic citlesanc ntnibers a e Imp one c on he various ra 1 roads and works of publicimpro cement still in progress. But the vastly greater number direct their way to the west. A single fact or two shows the influx of population from this source in the northwestern states. In general the current flows on unobserved, but now and then some incident transpired, which calls the attention to its ever widening tide. In the catastrophes which have occurred on the lakes and rivers of the west, it is found that a large proportion of the passengers moving westward are foreign immigrants. Thus, in the case of the steamer Phoenix, lost by fire recently, out of three hundred passengers, not less than about two hundred are said to have belonged to this class. This was the fact, too, in the wreck of the Salesman, on her way up the Mississippi. A very large proportion of the passengers were Germans. The Norwegians alone in Wisconsin are said to number not less than 15,000, and many thousands more are expected soon; 8 000 more are stated to occupy the northern portions of I illinois. From 50,000 to 100,000Germans, it has been mentioned, on what appears to be good authority, are preparing to embark for the United States in the course of another year 92 X. a. I indicative in some degree of the same state of things, we may notice also the sale of the public lands. It is true that sale does not of course imply settlement or cultivation, in all cases, and perhaps not even in the majority of them. Still, many who purchase do improve their lands, and. large numbers of acres are thus brought into the class of crop producing areas in the various parts of our country each successive year, and this item is by no means to be neglected in a survey of elements operating on the great results. Thousands of acres, and some of the best kind, are in every successive stage of improvement, and every year takes from them a fair proportion and adds their products to the great aggregate of the harvests. This, in the more recently constituted States, furnishes a large counter balance to the effect of the disastrous season, and is one reason why, notwithstanding the apparent necessity of reduction in our estimates, we have sometimes put down an actual increase. The sale of the public lands during the past year, as appears by returns to the And Office, amounted to 2,526,600acres, principally in the States of I illinois, I n diana, Missouri, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, I own, Wisconsin. In connection with the foregoing topics of immigration and the sale of the public lands, we may avert to another which is also embraced in the table, and forms likewise an element in the preparation of the estimates of the other columns we mean that of the population. In the absence of better data, our calculations as to this item are based on the annual average increase indicated by a comparison of the census for the period of severaldecennial returns. This rule must however be greatly modified with regard to some of the newly settled portions of our country, which are more rapidly filling up. As a specimen of these we may avert to the estimate of the population of Wisconsin. From reliable authorities we have been induced to set this at about 215,000, and the following table, published two or three months since, is quoted as a proof of the vast difference of the ratio of increase in different periods. The amount for 1847 was put at 225,000,which, by the returns received from that State, we have corrected 1830, ,3 245 1842, 46, 6481836, 11,686 1845, 117,000, estimated, 1838, 18,149 1846, 155,277, census 1840, 30,945 1847, 210,000, estimated. At the same rate of increase, it is believed that an additional 5000 will be a small one for the time that has elapsed since the last estimate above given appeared, which would carry the amount up to at least 215,000 inhabitants. The progress of agricultural knowledge and improvement must not be left without a remark or two, as this is one of those constant elements, which exercise an important influence upon the aspect of our agricultural industry. This knowledge is diffused in no small degree by the agricultural journals, some of which are conducted with distinguished ability, and embody not only selections from foreign works, but also original essays and suggestions of great value. It is with pleasure that we own our indebtedness to many of them for the aid which we have received not only in common with the public in general, but especially by the correspondence and contributions of their editors. The operation of our labors also, in this great field, we believe, notwithstanding the fears of some, has been favorable to the extension of this species of literature. We judge so from the evidence furnished in our correspondence. The spread of knowledge, use fill know x. a. 93.ledge, more and more widely, claims and ever receives our advocacy. I t would be a solecism indeed, were we to act on a different principle, as from this office there is continually going forth, new modifications and combinations of matter, and fruits of genius, to add to the stock of the worlds engine by of improvement. Several new journals devoted to the interests of agriculture have been commenced since the list was prepared, which is found in the report of 1845. Among these, and it is with pleasure we mention them, is one in each of the States of I own and Missouri. The former, called the I owaFarmers Advocate, a monthly of sixteen large quart o pages, was commenced last August at Burlington, I own, at the price of one dollar per annum. The other bears the title of the Missouri Farmer, which we believe is published at It. Charles, or a silly It. Louis, and is a monthly. Thetennesee Farmer and Aortic st, a monthly of 24 pages, 8 vo, commenced in Nashville in the mon i of September, 1846, and was published at the price of                           $1 per annum, but we are unable to say whether or not it is still continued. The Horticulturist also, published in New Work, has commenced since our list in 1845. Another pleasing feature in the progress of this literature, is the increasing disposition manifested by the publishers and editors of the political and literary journals to give a column or more to agriculture and its kindred sciences. Any are the newspapers which have adopted this plan, and very generally some of the best suggestions which make their appearance in the agricultural journals, thus find their way to multitudes at remote distances which they could otherwise never reach. The titles of numerous public journals now have associated with them the word " Farmers" showing the hold which their claims are gaining on the press of our country. We hail it as an auspicious sign, for with these yeomanry of our country, the stalwart sons of the soil, are identified our best hopes of the ultimate progress of our common well beloved Union. The press is likewise continually sending forth many volumes, as well original as re prints of foreign works, which are finding their way silently among the agriculturists of our country, and enlightening their minds as to the great principles of the science, and furnishing various knowledge of a practical kind. These aid to train our husbandmen to think, to reason and although there is still too much prejudice and ignorance, yet we cannot but believe there is a continually advancing progress in the operation of these elements of industrial science on the great mass of our agricultural population. Experiments assume the shape of more reliable at te stations to the truth or error of theories, and hypothesis gradually take the form of well supported systems. The freedom we here claim and exercise, of discussing every thing which presents its claims to be received as favorable to the public welfare, is most admirably suited to bring into exercise :he dormant intellects arid rouse the hitherto un awakened energies of our fellow countrymen on a topic so closely blended as is agriculture, with their owl and their neighbors' weal. As another method of improvement, we cannot pass over the numerous, and as we are happy to add, increasingly numerous agricultural societies and farmers' clubs in our country. Any of the States have flourishing state societies, and even where these do not exist, we find county or district societies. As we have already intimated, these associations are multiplying94Ex. a. Very year adds to their number and efficiency. They exercise a happy influence, and promote agricultural improvements in more ways than one. The fairs or exhibitions which usually form one part' of their instrumentality, hold out inducements to the competitors to aim at higher excellence. The visit of the committees to the farms entered for premium, naturally calls forth effort to arrange every thing in the best order, to remove unsightly evidences of carelessness and sloth, and to turn every means of cultivation to the best advantage. The spirit of order, neatness, industry, and th rift is inspired, and a new state of things, even beyond their own anticipations, testified to the presence of an influence perhaps before un felt. For is this all the subject of it reaps a further and rich reward in the additional value of his products in the market, and thus a real state of prosperity is induced which might possibly not have otherwise existed, The same effect in a measure attends all of the various methods by which the husbandmens aim n is directed to higher excellence; whether in the exhibition of .animals and their products, his skill in driving the plough through the tough soil, or the display he is enabled to make of the various fruits of the earth, which he has brought to win for him the applause of his fellow citizens. His and their modes of culture, of stock breeding, of home husbandry, are compared; new thoughts are struck out by the collision of mind with mind; and he must be a casual observer indeed, an anomalyamong thousands, if he does not bear back to his own farm or plantation some new knowledge, or some suggestion, that may aid his judgment and better his practice. When men thus meet in masses, and often, as is the case in these agricultural fairs, from widely extended districts, and even from the different extremities of our country; when one great topic is the reigning subject of discourse, and all the arrangements are devoted to promote its discussion, it is impossible that even those of slower mood should not feel their blood quickened, an interest excited, enthusiasm kindled, and a glow of generous sympathy be felt for each other and their kindred pursuits. Those who have worn the lodges of their different sects or parties, for a time lay them aside and mingle together as the brotherhood of the soil; and while they learn to respect and esteem each other as sharing in the same great pus i its of life, they smooth down the asp critics cf conflicting opinions, anti the .and grasp they have given or taken, wh en they beheld or learned to recognize each other in another guide than ba fo- e, will tirjge8 in memory when the scene and apparent page an try, as it may be regarded by some, has passed away. The influence of this to bind together those from different parts of our Union should not be despised, but be cherished as ah allowed one, which may contribute somewhat to allay the troubled waters and breathe its peaceful spirit, calm, like the pursuits from which it springs, through all the elements of strife, till the voice of its utterance is heard and obeyed. As a part of this apparatus of means for agricultural improvement, the conventions which are held in the capitals of some of the States during the session of the legislatures, deserve a distinct notice. It is a gratifying sight to see our legislators of the state sovereignties thus meeting for discussion and mutual improvement in this earliest profession of mankind, and we rejoice to perceive that the practice is spreading. Will the time be long before such a convention will hold its meetings during the period of the session of every state legislature, and the practical 'farmer, and the man of. scientific pursuits, and profession, as it were together ascend from the arena of hot debate to re create their wearied feelings in the health full interchange of their x. a. 95 intellectual and experimental stores on the broad and elevated grounds where they may cheer their hearts with the prospect of waving harvest fields, smiling abodes of plenty, rejoicing flocks and herds, and industrious, happy men The reports of the associations and societies, to which we have alluded, belong also, to the literature of this branch of national industry, and form, from time to time volumes of great value for reference, as they embody the results of much practical experience, often, too, guided by science and extensive knowledge. It was our intention to have obtained a list of all the agricultural societies and farmers' clubs in our country, and published it in an appendix; but our catalogue, though a large one, is not deemed yet sufficiently perfect, and it must, therefore, be reserved for some future period. It would be interesting to know the number of their members, the amount they yearly distribute in premiums, perhaps the estimated value of the exhibitions, the number of cattle and other domestic animals, the weight and valuation of the best specimens of these, the average of the finest crops, and a few items more, which might present a birds eye view of the results of their influence. Probably such a plan may only be accomplished by the gradual in gathering and humming up of years; but we are persuaded that it would form an item of no common interest in a report on the agricultural aspect of our country. The list of patents during the year, for inventions relating to agriculture, and the numerous and varied collections of implements and machines for the operations of husbandry, wherever opportunities are presented for the display and examination of them, bear testimony to the progress which is continually making in this branch of agricultural improvement. Some of the most common implements of husbandry have undergone a wonderful change in the course of a few years. The pitchfork, hand rake and he, for instance, how different now from those which were common less than a quarter of a century since. The principles of science have been brought into requisitions to mark out the relations and mechanical powers of the separate parts and their combinations; and much cumbrous, useless wood and iron, has been removed, with a gain, not only in lightness, but also of strength. For illustration, we may refer to so simple a thing as the handle of the fork, rake, or he. Formerly, these were made of equal thickness throughout, but now it has been seen that where but little force is applied or stress is laid, it may be reduced, provided that the middle, in one case, and the end in the other, be made sufficiently firm and strong. We thus get rid of weight and yet lose nothing, but rather gain in the application of power. r Whether steam, th eighty agent that has wrought such wondrous revolutions in other branches of industry, can ever be successfully applied in general practice to cultivation, and thus produce an entire change in the present modes, would seem to admit of a doubt. In broad level plains, like the prairies at. the west, and the savannah of the south, it may be made to drive a plough and furrow up and down miles in a day; but in the mountainous, or even undulating surface, which more generally prevails; it would seem that difficulties must exist to preclude the expectation of deriving from it a similar aid. What may yet be accomplished by different motive powers, less impetuous, though perhaps equally forceful, is a problem yet to be solved. For threshing, win no wing machines and similar stationary operations, the essening of manual labor may yet be great, and the facility of preparing 96 X. the grain for the market, exert a strong modifying influence on the prospects of the husband man. It has been stated that in some of the large wheat growing districts of our country, the use of harvesting and threshing machines has probably added a considerable increase to the amount raised. The progress of improvement in cultivation is evidently in proportion to the effect of the varied means enjoyed by the community, and one need be but little conversant with the increased applications for inventions relating to agricultural implements, to form a pretty correct judgment respecting the operation of the various sources of improvement we have mentioned. We might remark on the application of chemistry, animal and vegetable physiology, geology and other sciences, with domestic economy, in reference to this great question of progress, and as elements not without their bearing on the development of our agricultural resources. But these topics may be better touched upon in another part of this report, where we may treat of modes of cultivation and feeding of animals with kindred, topics. There is one particular, however, which seems to claim our notice. His is agricultural education: a new era seems, in this respect, to be opening upon us. It may take years before we shall have our lohenheims, Schliesheims, Tharands and Moeglins, as in Germany and Russia; but a beginning is made by attempts to establish such schools and colleges. There have been a number of the former set in operation by private enterprise, and in several of our colleges, professors have been appointed who are well qualified to lecture on these subjects. In the time honored universities of Harvard and Pale, two gentlemen who have enjoyed ample opportunities of pursuing their studies in Europe, fill the chair of the professor ships. A man of experience also in science, has recently been placed in this department in one of the colleges of Ohio. Such may be expected from the influence of these and similar positions in relation to this important subject, and here too we may refer our readers to the account given of agricultural education a swell as of the agricultural convention at Breslau, by C. L. Fleischmannesq. This account, with other articles of deep interest to the agriculturists of the United States, may be found in appendix No. 1. Travelling lecturers could likewise do much to diffuse agricultural knowledge. It is an interesting feature which we have noticed of the meeting of farmers' clubs and other agricultural associations in Great Britain, that distinguished scientific men are invited to be present and give their views respecting some topic selected as the subject of discussion. Such information, and of the most valuable kind, is thus communicated in the course of an hour or two, as it is understood the lecturer comes well prepared by a study of his subject. Condensed reports of these -tyres and the discussions which follow, may be found in the agriculturifjournals of England these contain the principles of manures, the theory of rotation of crops, cultivation of the different fruits of the earth, and methods of stock breeding, and a variety of particulars in reference to the management of the farm. A similar course is adopted in some degree, in this country, but a greater extension of its benefits is desirable. The more accurate knowledge is diffused among the people the greater their freedom is from error, time will be saved and many a disappointment succeeding to months of toil may be avoided. Season. It is not proposed to enter much into detail with respect to the weather. The space allotted to this portion of the report will not allow it. Still a six. 97 the state of the crops are so immediately and mainly dependent on the aspect of the season, it would not be a fair exhibit of the influencing causes were we to leave this topic without notice. In this subject we may appeal to the authority of Mr. Awes, an able contributory to the agricultural journals of England, and whose paper on agricultural chemistry, the editor of the London Mariners' Chronicle pronounces "one of the most important contributions to that science which we of late years have had to record" and says " that the agreement between his argument and the long established conclusions of our best farmers gives us great confidence in its accuracy n reference to climate on crops, he says, that although the agriculturists possesses the means of developing the circulatory and e laboratory conditions of plants, (the two which in his view they are required to develop e) by manures and mechanical operations, yet climate exerts the greatest influence over them. By climate, he states that he means the quantity of rain that falls, the number of days on which it falls, and the temperature during the period when the plant is actively growing or forming seed. He gives the result of his observations on this point for three years, and although these were made in England, yet as specimens of the similar deductions which we need in this country, we will sub join them in the hope that persons in different parts of our country may be induced to enter on alike course of observations particularly with reference to the crops. I The period embraced in his table was from the beginning of May till the end of October, and he considered the climate so far as i a ,affected crass in April and May; the wheat climate to commence with May and end with August; the tar nip season to begin with June and end with October. Of course some modifications might be needed in the application of this table to our own particular crops 1844. 1845. 1846.

In the above he remarks in substance, that, as will be seen, the two spring months of 1844, were unusually dry, the quantity of rain and number of days in which it fell small. The summer was hot and dry and the air moderately rainy. There being no climate necessary to an increased ac cumulative and circulating condition of the plants, the favorable growth of the spring crops was prevented; but a hot, dry summer favored the depositing and elaborate ve condition, and this produced a good quality of grain. I n the next year, 1845, the great number of wet days and the low temperature were highly favorable to a circulatory condition of the plant, and therefore green crops of all descriptions and straw, we unusually abundant, and the grain of a bad quality. In 1846, the spring favored the circulatory condition and the crops of grass and c lover were luxuriant. In the month of June, the period when the grain was forming, the temperature was six and one-fourth above the average, and there were only two days in which rain fell, the quality of the grain produced was very fine. In the contrary, the crops of turn is were inferior, owing to there having been thirty-one successive days without rain, twice during the season. From May 2 1st to June 2 1st no rain fell, and from August 22nd to September 2 1st there were only three days rain, being less than one tenth of an inch. In another table Mr. Awes gives the effect of climate on the quantity and quality of produce of the un manured plots of the experimental wheat field, carried through three years as before, and also the average results of variously manured plots 1844. 1845. 1846.

Eight of corn per bushel, in lbs, 606 56 g 63 her cent age of corn to straw, (straw 1000,) 86 8 499 765 n his remarks on the table just given he says that the effect of the climate of these three seasons, as indicated, is quite in accordance with the general character of these seasons. The lowest weight of the bushel, and the greatest amount of straw were obtained in that season which had the greatest number of rainy days and the lowest temperature; that the least amount of straw, with the dries t season, and the first quality of grain were in the hottest summer. He considers it highly important that experiments should be tried in different parts of England with reference to the effect of climate on produce. Nothing but a language and thermometer would be needed as apparatus, and by weighing an acre of the different crops on the farm, and the relation of the grain to straw, leaf to bulb, and estimating the quality of the grain, sufficient data would soon be collected to enable us to speak with certainty on the subject, and the farmer would be able to make an estimate of the quality and produce of his crops, before a grain had been removed from his fields. Even with reference to his own experiments, he feels authorized in saying, that where equal means are employed a farm on which there are a certain number of rainy days in the summer and autumn possesses x. a. 99 advantages in the production of green crops, while, on the other hand, where the least number of rainy days and the highest temperature exist, grain of the best quality can be produced. The views of this distinguished chemist, it is hoped, will henceforth be allowed as a sufficient justification for our gathering and presenting facts respecting the season, which, to some superficial observers, has seemed unnecessary, and a waste of time and paper. The season which is more particularly important, may, with respect to nearly all the crops, be embraced within the periods of the 1st of March and the 1st of October or November about seven or eight months of the year including spring and autumn. The cotton and sugar crop extend yet further but, with this exception, the products are cultivated and gathered within the time just mentioned. It was hoped that sufficient information might be obtained in respect to the time of planting and harvesting the various crops in the different parts of the country, so as to form the basis of some intended deductions. But this must be left for a future report. Besides the general remarks on the topic of the season, those relating to each individual crop, will likewise, in a degree, embrace this particular. The winter in general was colder than usual, and complaints abound to some considerable extent of the winter killing of the fall sown grain, on account of the moist ground being early left without its covering of snow, and consequently exposed to be frozen. The spring was cold and dry; the snows of the latter part of winter lay on the ground longer than usual. In the northern parts of New York and the most northern of the New England states, the public journals speak of large bodies of snow in some instances as late as the month of May. Thus snow is stated to have been on the 1st of May, in many parts of Vermont and New Hampshire from two to eight feet deep, and on the 4th of May in parts of New Hampshire four feet on a level. In Berkshire county, Massachusetts, snow is likewise noticed late in the season as lying two or three feet deep. Frosts also are mentioned as not un frequent during the month of May and the early part of June. A hard frost is said to have been experienced at Saratoga, N. Y. as late as the 20th of June, and the weather is pronounced to have been cold and un seasonable at Boston. It the west, too, the winter was long and severe. The Prairie Farmer, published at Chicago, I illinois, in July, mentions that with but one exception there had not been one weeks weather up to June 15, when the thermometer ranged above 500 in the shade, and that in the latter part of April and 1st of May, there were three weeks, when the mercury at noon, stood steadily at 380 in the shade; it then grew warmer gradually at the rate of about 20 per week, with two or three short intervals. In Wisconsin the sleighing lasted and was excellent, from 1st of January to 15th of March. After this we find mention of cold, dry and dusty weather. The same complaint of a cold season and drought, during the months of May and June, is common in the journals of the Atlantic states, even down to Georgia and Alabama. The thermometer s hewed an average temperature in New York city, in the mouth of April at least three degrees lower than in the last two years preceding; the blossoms also were much later than usual. The Farmers' Cabinet, at Philadelphia, speaks of the cold, dry, backward spring. The quantity of rain there in March, was 4.75-in April 5.85--inMay 1.56. In Bucks county, April 30, the weather is described as cold 100 X. the ground very dry, and but little rain had fallen for four weeks, and high wide prevailed most of the time. In Maryland, in April and May the drought is mentioned, and cold weather and frosts about the middle of Maykilld the fruit. I ce made at Tt well, on the 19th of April, a quarter inch thick. The frosts at the same time extended into Virginia, and at Washington, D. C. and Richmond, the peaches, apricots, &c, were destroyed. Under date of May 12th, it is stated in the Southern Planter, from Lynchburg, that the drought was unusual and there had been no rain for about seven weeks. As we proceed south, there is also more or less similarity in the notices of the weather during the spring and early part of summer. From the Southern Cultivator we learn, as to Georgia, from every part of the state of an un propitious and backward season. The spring opened unusually late, there were frequent destructive hail storms, and northwest winds, with chilling rains till late in May, and cool nights. The average temperature as given in Georgia, for six months from January to June, for 1847 was 580 in 1846, 590, and in 1845, 600. The amount of rain for six months was 20.71, inches; for 1846, 27.09; for 1845, when the drought was most unprecedented, 7.93. In lower Alabama, as we learn from the Alabama Planter, the months of January, February and March were cold and rainy April, May and June somewhat more favorable. The month of July, and the first half of August were also very rainy. August pleasant and favorable, and the same was the case as to September and October. In Kentucky there was drought in May, and the early part of June, though rain enough for the most part of the rest of the growing season. The mean temperature of August was 71.8, amount of rain 2.80; of September mean temperature 66.9; amount of rain 3.94; for October, mean temperature 560; amount of rain 5.05 inches. In Ohio, as mentioned in the Ohio Cultivator, there were early in January wrenching rains, there succeeded cold 10 or 150 below 0. February and March were change able, at times severely cold, but little sunshine and much rain. April and May seem to have been more favorable, though the drought is complained of as late as the 1st of June. June on the whole was favorable. In July there was great heat until about the 25th, and then it was cool for three or four days. August :and September favorable. The planting in general throughout the country was more backward than usual, and in the early spring serious fears seem to have been entertained that the spring crops could not be got in the ground early enough to shield them from the frosts of autumn. But the summer as a whole seems to have been quite favorable, and alternate succession of warm weather and shower s made up for the early drought. The frosts even in the vicinity of Albany, held off till about the 15th of September. The consequence has been that the season was a growing one and the crops of grass, corn, and cotton a swell as grain have proved much more abundant than was anticipated. In the former reports, the plan pursued, was to trace with some minuteness of detail, the aspect of the crops in the different states, from the time of planting or sowing to that of harvesting or gathering. It is still believed that something of the same process is necessary as a part of that combination of elements to which resort must be had to determine with any approach t cox. accuracy, the results of our agricultural industry in the various sections of the country. We do not, however, propose to spread any such collection of data upon our pages, but shall notice as formerly, with less particularityhowever, the progress of the main crops in those states where they may be ranked as among the heaviest staples, and where the increase or decrease will most largely affect the general result. Several of the crops, it is well known, though raised to some extent in many states, yet are distributed in such small amounts that it is difficult to form any estimate and the bearing on the aggregate for the whole country will exercise but a scarcely perceptible influence on the question of our surplus for home trade or foreign market. Thus twelve states at most, raise 810 at least of the wheat crop, a single state more than two thirds of the barley crop; ten states more than three-fourths of the o at crop; four states four fifths of the rye crop; four states four fifths of the buckwheat crop; twelve states more than three-fourths of the corn crop ; ten states more than one half of the potato crop ; six states about five-sevenths of the hay crop; five or six states nearly the whole of the hemp crop; eight states nearly the whole of the tobacco crop; nine states almost the whole of the cotton crop; two states nine tenths of the rice crop five states about five-eighths of the silk crop; and a single state almost the entire sugar crop. These are the states therefore, that must be relied on for the surplus, if there be any of these products to be exported. The number of these even may be lessened; for in some of these sections of our country, the home consumption will more than require their own crops. Wheat. The states of New Work, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia on the Atlantic border, together with the northwestern and western states reaching down to Tennessee, are properly the wheat country of the union. It is very doubtful if more than one tenth of the wheat crop of the first four named states can be spared for exportation; while in the western states probably one fifth might be thus appropriated. Beginning with Ohio, which stands foremost in the census returns as well as in our tabular estimate, we will notice the wheat crop, very much in the order of the amount produced. We gather the following particulars of the progress of the wheat crop ofOhioI n this State, as indeed in nearly all the wheat region, especially that of the west, there were complaints of the presence of the fly in the autumn of 1846. The winter in the early part was open, and as the ground was moist and there were frequent alternate freezing and thawing, great apprehension s were expressed that the crop would suffer severely by being winter killed. These fears proved to have been in a considerable degree well founded, and but for the fact that there had been a much larger breadth than usual sown, the probability is that the amount compared with the crop of 1845, might have been lessened and possibly materially so. The crop of 1846, however, having been large and the prospect of demand most favorable, it is believed that the seeing for 1847 was very much increased. The gradual introduction also of machinery for lessening labor on a large scale, doubtless exerts partial influence, likewise, in this respect. Some of the statements of the best judges respecting the early appearance of the wheat crop in Ohio, it may be well to sub join. Among the authority. ties on which we place much reliance, we would name the Ohio Cultivator. The intelligent editor of that journal seems to have watched the appearance and prospects of the wheat crop, and his numerous correspondents gave him advantages not possessed by every one for so doing. In the month of January, 1846, he notices the prevailing sentiment that there had been much injury done by winter killing in March; when the consequences of the <a name="evil4"><mark>evil</mark></a> were beginning to be developed, he states that the wheat crop had been much injured by the winter the portion above ground was generally winter killed, and on wet soils the roots also though on good lands, the roots looked generally healthy. In the northern section of the state too, an intelligent correspondent about the 17th of March mentions, that the tops had been principally killed by winter, the roots also were dead and thrown out of the ground. As the season advanced in April and May, the reports respecting the crop became more encouraging. It looked more healthy, except on moist lands, where it was mostly killed and was backward even where not killed. In June, it was feared that the wheat would prove light, as the fly had done much injury and the drought had prevented the growth of straw. I nStarke, Hayne, and <a name="loss2"><mark>Loss</mark></a> counties, the injury from the fly is represented to have been great. In some of the counties of the Reserve, however, as Median, Lorrain and Cuyahoga, there was more promise; though even there the crop it was then believed, would be light. In the other hand, in June a journal in Columbia na county gives a good account of the prospect there, and the editor of one published at Cleveland, also speaks as from personal observation on a trip through the northern counties, that the wheat crop looked as well as usual at the same season. In July the wheat fields of Ohio are said to abound in cheat or chess in Picking, Fairfield, Merry andMuskingum counties; where as well as in Grown county, there was also some appearance of rust. Years too were entertained of a short crop in the Reserve. The weather, however, in the early part of the month was very favorable. In southern Ohio there was a more encouraging prospect, I n Lawrence county especially, the wheat crop is said to be remarkably fine in yield and quality. Cincinnati journals speak of some eight or nine counties in the southern division of the state where the wheat had been cut, in which it was believed that what was lacking in quantity would be made up in quality. In the middle of the month, and while the harvest was going on, aided by good weather, the prospects seem to have brightened and the wheat is thought to have turned out better than it was supposed possible- -that there was probably a fair average yield, taking the whole state together the quality was never better. The greatest deficiency it is remarked would be in Rich land, Hayne, Take, &c. counties. Some of the particulars, are as follows n Montgomery county the heads were heavy, plump and well filled. What there is, of the best kind, and the yield larger than was anticipated, though it, doubtless, might fall short of other years in number of bushels, in quality it would equal, if not exceed that of the last year. In Washington county the crop was very light, though the quality was remarkably good. In Trumbull not half a crop. Champagne county a little more than half an average crop. We learn, however, a fortnight later, that the quantity sown was greater than usual, and that there was great perfection of grain and size of the head. In <a name="loss3"><mark>Loss</mark></a> county the straw is stated not to be long but the grain very plump, large and full, and at least a one half crop of the first quality. To in Greene county it was thought not to have x. 108 been an average crop out heavy, the straw was thin on the ground, but the heads large and full of fine, plump and heavy grain. In Vermont county not more than half an average, but the quality very excellent, and will make up for the quantity. In Treble the quantity about three-fourths average crop, and it was believed will allow a surplus of 70 to 100,000 bushels. In Knox county, the wheat crop is said to be a light one, short of an average crop. In Lawrence and Pallida counties, the early wheat was badly thrown out by the frost; the late sown was a failure. From other accounts, in August, we learn that there were many good fields in Picking, Knox, Our on, Crawford and Seneca counties. In Marion county there was an average crop. In Delaware it was much winter killed and affected by the fly. There was a falling off in the Diam i Valley, though what there was, was good grain, well filled and heavy, having no lighted or defective heads; the straw likewise was clear, without rust or <a name="mildew0"><mark>mildew</mark></a>. The aggregate, however, was not supposed to be equal to one half of that of '46. In Duc as county, it is stated in a journal published in Sole do, that the wheat crop was larger than was expected, and it was considered to be nearly an average. It was, also, of good quality, plump and heavy. In Good and An cock counties, on the same authority, it is pronounced to have been a large crop, and of a very superior quality. Similar was the estimate made in other agricultural journals of the west, through their correspondents. The Prairie Farmer mentions, that in Ohio the wheat crop had suffered severely in some parts, but taking the whole state it was believed there was an average crop. According to some estimates we have since received, the crop is thought to have been four fold in Defiance county, and 40 pe cent. more in Erie county than in 1845. In War roll county, owing to the f for able winter and spring, it is placed at 75 per cent. advance. In Rich and county, 50 percent; To rain, about 10 per cent. in some parts, and about the same, or average crop, in others. In Picking county, about the same, though some think that it considerably exceeds the crop of 1845. The average crop is variously given from 6 up to 20 bushels per ac, though the most common one is 18 bushels, and it is presumed that the average in the aggregate must be at least 15 or 16 bushels per acre; in some instances, as we are told, as many as 40 or 50 bushels have been raised per acre. As the crop of 1846 was much larger than that of 1845, which, as by reference to the report of that year, we estimated at 15 per cent. decrease from the one of the previous year, 1844, it is believed that the crop of this year, 1847, compared with that of 1845, the only data to which we can refer at present, was in the aggregate some 15 to 20 per cent. better than that of 1845 though considerably less than that of 1846, which was a large crop. In reviewing our former estimates, we are inclined to think that in some instances we have placed them too low, though perhaps this is the safer side. We differ in the estimate for 1847, from some good judges in Ohio, and we sub join, (see Appendix No. 2) for comparison, an abstract of the reports to the state board of agriculture, which, as will be seen, varies somewhat slim our information. Our reason for giving an increase is, from the fact that the large crop of 1846, and the prospects of the market, led to a large increase of land appropriated to this crop, as well as the information we have gathered from every source at our command. The comparison of those reports is with 1846.104 X. a. The large crop of the previous year, the nearness to the market on the seaboard, and the increased demand for bread stuffs, led to a greater cultivation of wheat in the states of New York and Pennsylvania during. the year 1847. The crop of 1845 in New Work, it will be recollected, was estimated at an advance of the census returns of the preceding year, made by that State. As the actual increase of the amount raised for the period from 1840 to 1844 is seen by comparison of the returns of the general and state census of these years, to have been at an average rate of 275,000bushels, and as some allowance must no doubt be made for what was omitted to be embraced since it can hardly be supposed the census included the whole it seems reasonable to consider the crop of 1844 at not less than 13,500,000 bushels, and making this a basis, allow a yearly increase of about 500,000 bushels under the ordinary operation of affairs. Of course the increased stimulus afforded by the demand for larger supplies since, maybe presumed to have had its effect. It appears, from the best information we can obtain, that the yield per acre in 1847 was at least an average one. In some parts complaint is made of the fly, and winter killing is likewise supposed to have reduced the amount per acre one-fourth or one half, and the average number of bushels is set in these cases at 10, or as low as 7, while in others it is estimated at 14 bushels per acre, and much higher. The spring wheat is stated to have yielded well. One of ~te agricultural journals estimates the <a name="loss4"><mark>loss</mark></a> of the wheat crop of western New York by fly and winter killing, at about 20 percent; In another journal it is said there is scarcely any difference of opinion, that wheat was never better than this year, nor a larger average yield. The crop was probably better in the eastern part of the State; but after making all due allowance for the additional breadth of land sown, we feel constrained to estimate the whole wheat crop of the State as ab but 10 percent. less than that which we gave for the crop of 1845, and which we now think was a little higher than we should place it, from the additional information we have gained. We prefer to err by placing it too low rather than too high. The general aspect of the wheat crop of Pennsylvania, in the earlier part of the season, corresponded to that of many other States, and does not seem to have been promising. As we approach the harvest, the accounts, however, are more favorable. We are told, that there was a much greater extent of surface than usual sown in this State, and that many of the counties would give an average yield. The Lancaster County Farmer speaks of the crop which was sown early in autumn as promising well the later sown would probably fall short. The same is the statement respecting other portions of the State. In others still farther west, it is mentioned as falling short of the crop of 1846, and not an average yield in quantity, but much superior in quality. The straw is also described as being short and thin, but the heads large and full grained, and that a single ear would give as much as two of the previous year. The accounts we have received at a later date, and since the harvest, are similar, except that they represent the crop in Lancaster and some of the more eastern counties not as favorable, and the decrease from the crop of 1845 as estimated at from 10 per cent. to one third. The average number of bushels per acre varies as given, from 8,10, to 18 bushels. As the wheat crop of this State, by the census of 1840,was about 13 14 millions of bushels, and taking the whole seven years, it must be supposed to have increased in consequence of the greater attentiosEx. a. 105 directed to it, to meet the increased demand for the supply of the markets, we believe we are warranted, notwithstanding its un promising character in some of the counties, in placing the crop of 1847 at a considerable advance of that of 1845. Virginia is likewise a large wheat growing State, and the prospects are early described with apprehension of a short crop. In the western part of the State, bordering on Ohio, and in those sections which were contiguous to Maryland and Pennsylvania, it appeared much as the accounts from those States describe it. In the interior and the south eastern counties it yielded better. In Sussex county we are told it was one third more, and the quality better. In Rappahannock, ten per cent. more. In Princess Inn, the same and a few instances we have noticed the estimated increase as high as 50 and 40 per cent. The average number of bushels to the acre does not seem to be as great as in New York and the western States. It is given as varying from 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, up to 15 bushels per acre; probably the general average will not hold higher than 8 to 10 bushels throughout the State. The proportion of the crop, it would appear from the census, is about equal between the eastern and western districts, though the western raises somewhat the larger amount. The crop, as given by the census of 1840, was about ten millions. There has been, as we believe, a gain upon this, and we are led to think that the crop of 1847 was in advance of that of 1845. The same was the case with that of Maryland and the southern States, where there must be allowed a considerable increase. In the southwestern States of Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Arkansas, judging from the accounts given of the wheat crop, the yield was better than usual, and we have estimated it accordingly. We take occasion here to correct a clerical error which has been unfortunately perpetuated in the tabular estimate, from taking down incorrectly the census return of the wheat crop of Arkansas, and yet which, on recurring to the more extended view of the crops, will be observed to have obviously been one. The return of the wheat crop in Arkansas, as given in the census, is about 105,000 bushels. By mistake, it would seem the footing of the column was taken down from Michigan, which stood on the same page, and being unobserved at the time, or since, has been transferred from year to year in the estimate of the crop. Behave restored the proper estimate in the table, corresponding to the original basis. This produces a considerable lessening of the aggregate, and should be borne in mind, in comparison of the crop of 1847 with that of 1845. The wheat crop of I n diana presented much the same aspect as did that of the adjoining states, Ohio and Michigan, at the early part of the season. Complaints were frequent of winter killing, and apprehensions entertained lest the damage should prove more serious than it afterwards did. His may have led to the sowing of more spring wheat than would otherwise have been the case, and the result, in this respect, be more advantageous than it would else have proved. We omit some of the earlier notices, as they correspond much to those already given with reference to Ohio. I no une the account is that though considerable wheat was winter killed, yet the injury had probably been over rated, and in some portions there was a good wheat crop in prospect. As the harvest advanced, the comparative amount obtained seems to have varied in different sections of the state. I n some instances there was an evident increase, in others, the falling off from the usual crop of winter wheat is estimated at one-fourth or one third; the straw was heavy, but there was little grain. The accounts of the agricultural journals, from which we gather the earlier state of the crop, have 106 , X . reference usually to the preceding year, which was a year of abundance insist of the western states. Our later accounts, from answers to the circular, are based on a comparison with the crop of 1845. From these it would appear, that while in some counties the crop is estimated to have been one-fourth or one third, or even two or three times larger than that of 1845, in others a deficiency is estimated, of not less than one half, one third, or one quarter. The average product per acre also varies from seven and a half, ten, twelve, sixteen, to twenty and twenty-five bushels per acre. The more common average would appear to be from ten up to twenty bushels per acre. Taking due allowance for the conflicting estimates, and the various influences which led to a greater extent of seeing, we believe that we are authorized to estimate the crop at an advance of about fifteen per cent as compared with that of 1845. In I illinois, passing over the earlier notices, which are, in a great measure, similar to those already given with respect to Ohio, we learn from the Prairie Farmer of July, that, although in the northern parts the winter wheat had failed badly, yet the spring wheat would go far to supply the deficiency. In August the report was more favorable; for the deficiency in quantity would probably be made up by the fine quality, as the heads were remarkably long and the merry plump. Taken as a whole, it is believed that there was a slight advance on the crop of 1845, though it was not equal to that of 1846. In some of the counties the crop was estimated at from ten to twenty and twenty-five bushels per acre; in others, as Macoupin, Jersey, Green, Madison, &c, we find the average stated at about fifteen bushels, although sometimes from thirty to thirty-five; and it is further said the quantity has been increased four fold in four years, owing to the improvements in getting it out with machines; the present crop, however, was badly winter killed. Michigan is considered by one of her citizens, in a communication to theCultivator, to possess great advantages as an agricultural state. He regards the climate a favorable one, as the extremes of temperature between winter and summer are not so great as in many of the states, further east, of the same latitude. This he attributes to the large bodies of water, which modify the range of the thermometer. The winter lasts from three to four months, during which period the ground is mostly covered with snow to the depth of one or two feet. The ground then is fit for the plough, as he states, about the 20th of March, and often much earlier. About harvest, in July, there is a period of several weeks during which rain scarcely ever falls; a great advantage to the wheat grower, as he is thus enabled to gather his crop with less labor, and free from rust. The soil also is thought to possess some peculiarities which add to its fitness; its extreme depth the deposit, in some instances, being one hundred feet and loose gravely texture, allows of copious absorption, retention and perforation of rain water, thus providing for abundance of springs, and permitting a wide range for the roots cf plants. It becomes also easy of tillage, and is less susceptible of drought. As lime is a constituent part, and there is a good proportion i of the salts required, it is again, well adapted to the culture of wheat. The timbered parts especially, are easily cleared and become very productive, yielding from twenty to forty bushels per acid. The progress of the wheat crop of Michigan, where this product is becoming more and more a staple, is encouraging. The same apprehensions to which we have referred in the account of other states adjoining, existed as fox. a. 107 winter killing but as the season advanced, these forebodings were gradually dissipated. Although the crop may have been somewhat diminished from this cause, yet we are told that in I onya and Went counties, the wheat crop in June looked well seldom better; the prospect of the harvest was not only good, but of being unusually early. In Oak land county, also, the crop improved, and fields which had been despaired of, yielded from five to eight bushels per acre; in that county there was at least one half the usual average crop; while in the north eastern and the central counties of Shiwassee and Clinton there is stated to have been a very heavy harvest. The same is mentioned, also, as the fact with respect to the lower part of the Grand River valley, and nearly the entire western half of the peninsula. Some portions of It. Josephs county, however, suffered from the fly. I n the southern parts of the state the accounts are less favorable, and the falling off from the crop of 1845 is considered to have been at least one half. Behave estimated the crop of the whole state at a comparatively less advance on that of 1845, as that was an unusually good crop. Such also we believe to have been the crop of 1846, a greater amount having been sown than was the case of the previous year, and the year 1847 still more. The yield per acre may not have been as great, but we believe this was more than made up by the advance of seeing. The average yield, by a writer whose opinion we have already quoted above, is considered to be at least twenty bushels per acre, and the crop of the year previous, full 15,000,000. The crops of I own and Wisconsin too, which are now coming much more into competition with some of the adjoining states, from all that we can learn proved unusually good. In the estimates furnished us, we find 20 and 25 bushels put down as an average per acre, and in some instances it is thought, that the quantity raised was two or three times as much as in 1845. These states are rapidly filling up with an industrious population, and although the fly did some damage, and the lower tier of counties in both states par took of the character of the northern ones of I illinois and Missouri, yet before the harvest we are told of the promise of a full crop, when gathered in, which seems to have proved the case. We believe therefore we are warranted by the facts in estimating the increase for both of these states at 50 per cent, above the crop of 1845, and we are not certain that it ought not to be placed somewhat higher, and perhaps double. It is deemed unnecessary to go further into detail in reference to the wheat crop of particular states. Taken as a whole the aggregate crop is probably not as large as that of 1846, better than that of 1844, and not varying very greatly from that of 1845. Any will doubtless estimate it much higher and some persons lower than we have done. We cannot agree however with those who place the present wheat crop of this country at 120,000,000 bushels. The results of the census of New York in 1844,as compared with those of the general census in 1840, would lead us on reviewing the various estimates we have made since 1840, to believe that in some instances we have placed the wheat crop higher than we should now do; though in other instances in the large western states the advance supposed may not have been large enough for particular years, or the decrease allowed too large. As it is, our crop of wheat will probably amount to from 112 up to 114 or 115,000,000 bushels, and will after allowing 10 percent. for seed, 5,000,000 for stock, give four and one half bushels to every man, woman and child in the United States, and leave 20,000,000 for ex ion r :f j recur< :1 we leuuI c i ^5 1,~$ ?CAOC of ri a I dnlatiror. as river h ^he 108 X. of 5 years, and 2,500,000 more of slaves, the ration for the remaining population, after de ducting for seed and food of stock, might be for each person above 5 years of age, slaves excepted, at least 5 bushels, and leave, as before 20,000,000 for export. It is gratifying to state that there appears to have been scarcely any complaint of the rust in the wheat crop of this year compared to many other years. With here and there exceptions, this scourge of the farmer seems to have been comparatively unknown. It is possible that the partial retard at ion of the growth of the plant by the late and cold season may have had an influence in preventing its appearance. This <a name="disease2"><mark>disease</mark></a> included among others under the term brand in Germany, it appears as abundantly proved by Word a and various writers, is a parasitic <a name="fungus0"><mark>fungus</mark></a> which insinuates itself into the ears of the plant or changes the character of its tissues, scatters abroad its spores, and ruins the prospects of the husband man. Although not immediately owing to atmospheric causes, yet it may be influenced by the. state of the weather, and its prevalence to a greater or less degree depends no doubt on the state of the plant in its progress to maturity. Uninteresting description fully illustrated with plates of the various brands in wheat and the other cereals translated from an essay of the venerable Word a, so; celebrated for his investigations into the nature of the parasitic hung i, by a gentleman employed in the Patent Office, may be found in the September and November numbers of the American Journal of Agriculture and Science, published at Albany, N. Y. One writer, we notice, attributes rust to fog, and advises unless protected by woods, &c. that there should be a high tight board fence erected in the direction towards which the fog originates. Another views it as the result of a vigorous growth of wheat in the latter part of winter or early spring, and that in these circumstances the energies of the root having been exhausted at the time when the grain began to form, and the grain having failed for want of support if followed by wet weather the black rust or smut, is produced, or if by dry weather the red rust. Should a time of dry weather occur after the early growth and continue on for two months or more before the harvest, and then favorable weather succeed, a second growth with a new set of roots will be produced. He recommends therefore to endeavor and induce this new set of roots, which may be done bypasturing with calves, colts, sheep, &c. He also recommends close past during as a remedy against the fly. Such suggestions from the experience of practical men deserve consideration, for though the theories adopted mayoePincorrect, yet the facts may be beneficial when applied to use. We sub join a quotation here from the Farmers' Cabinet, describing a method of preparing seed wheat, which is stated to have been used with success for three years f Place a half hogs head nearly full of water in a barn, add flaubert salts until the water ceases to dissolve them; then take a half bushel of wheat in a bale basket, sink it gradually, stirring it with a paddle until every particle of fill is washed out, which will float on the bring; raise the basket suddenly to throw off the filth; let the bring drain from it; place the wheat on the floor and roll it in newly soaked lime, then run it aside to let it dry a few hours before seedingskim the floating filth from the bring, and strain it through a col ander or fine si eve. By this mode one hand can wash as fast as ten ploughs can put it in n 1843, I received one hundred bushels of seed wheat from the west x. a. 109 e ri shore; after seeing more than one half, I discovered smut in it and prepared thirty bushels as stated, washing out a quantity of smut and other filth. In 1844 I found the smut much increased in the wheat not prepared in that prepared, after a careful examination, I found only one smut head then examined the grain, and thought I could see a perceptible difference in favor of the prepared wheat n the fall I seemed seventy-five bushels of that wheat, washing only twelve bushels. In 1845, I examined carefully the twelve bushels seeing, and found no smut; I did not examine that not prepared, but found none in it when eleaisingit for market. I again compared the grain, and observed, if any thing, a greater difference in favor of the prprepred wheat. I also discovered a like difference in a white wheat that I was seedingAs has been already noticed in the remarks respecting the wheat crop, the    I hessian fly has made its appearance, and caused considerable damage in parts of our country; though riot by any means to so great extent as has been the case during some previous years. It would appear, however, that much apprehension is entertained respecting the next years crop in consequence of the attacks of the fly, Which has commenced on the wheat sown in the autumn. These have been so great, it is stated, in some sections of the country, as to lead to the belief that they will be more abundant i than ever in 1848. Perhaps, however, this may prove as un realized a foreboding as the one which went the rounds of the journals in the early part of this year, and which seemed to have been received with more than ordinary credailityprobably owing to the source from which it emanated and which warned the farmers to expect the almost entire <a name="loss5"><mark>loss</mark></a> of their wheat crop. The prediction to which we have referred, appeared the last spring arid was this: the scab would be found to affect the crop in 1847, to such an extent that a great scarcity of good flour would prevail; that as an epidemic it would spread over the whole of this country in 1847 48, appear also in Europe, and pass over the whole Continent, taking the usual course from west to east; that 1847 would be the climax in America, and it would here disappear in 1849, and one year later in Europe. Time must show what is to be the result respecting the anticipation of the fly, and till then, at least, we may cherish the hope that the danger has been exaggerated. Experience in examining and attempting to reconcile conflicting statements, and draw from them the truth in the case, has taught the extreme difficulty of the task, and the little reliance that can be placed on a few local appearances, especially at a period so early as to allow the whole aspect of the future to be entirely changed. At the same time, we doubt not, that the more precaution there is taken in the selection of seed, and its preparation for sowing as well as supervision of its cultivation will prove an additional security against the various evils which may prove destructive to this most important crop of our country. If it should be that no danger was to be feared, the at national circumspection will not be lost, but be amply rewarded in the increased product, and better adaptation of it to the purposes to which it is applied. It is highly probable, and indeed certain, we may say, that under the general term n fly" as it appears in the statements of the public journals, are often comprehended not only the Hessian fly, but the wheat ridge and other insects affecting this grain. Our farmers, many of them, do not discriminate or accurately examine; they perceive some insect at work, they are alarmed at the result, and sometimes signify the danger to their own apprehension by fixing the charge on the alien foe which is said first to have 110 X. invaded our fields of grain where the mercenaries of Hessecassel planted their feet for the destruction of our liberty upon our soil. He that as it may, however, this insect has not only to answer for his own ravages but for every other that seems to be of his with and kin, if their predictions lead them to fasten upon this particular grain. In a Canada journal we have found the following receipts, which are said to have been effectually tried there as a remedy against the "wheat fly" by which we presume is meant the ridge, so often confounded with the Hessian fly." Take or pigment, (which can be procured at any druggists) and with lighted charcoal, burn the or pigment close to the wheat, any time after sunset and before sunrise; at the time when the plant commences to flower it should be repeated, while the fly is found to exist. One ounce is sufficient for six acres Another and perhaps equally efficacious remedy to soon as the fly is discovered, or so soon as the plant shows a disposition to open its flow rest, carry around the patch of wheat strong lights at night, and the darker the better the flies will all rush to the fires and destroy themselves any interesting particulars have been collected during the year relating to the varieties of wheat in use in our country, as well as the uncommon growth of individual specimens. An inquiry was embraced in the circular issued from this office, relating to the kinds most approved, and we hoped to have been able to present a classification of them distinguished by their peculiarities and fitness for the various climates of the United States; butt his must be deferred, for want of completeness, to another time. It is gratifying to observe that the Mediterranean wheat, which was recommended some years since in the report of this office, still holds its place, to a great degree, in the estimation of its cultivates. We have noted numerous instances in different states and sections of the country in which it is mentioned with high commendation, and i freedom from rust and other evils which more commonly attend on other varieties of wheat asserted. We have noticed among other accounts of this kind of wheat, one in Maryland, which, speaks of an extraordinary crop. The mode of cultivation was( as follows The ground, the previous season was devoted to oats, and almost as soon as these were taken off, the manure was carried on, the stubble broken up and well harrowed. It was then left till the 25th of August, at which time it was sown, at the rate of two bushels of seed per acre, then ploughed pretty deep, then a large harrow was passed over it; the first growth is stated to have been destroyed by the fly, but by having an early start, it came out from the root wonderfully, some roots !bearing fifty-four or fifty-five s talks. The product of a single grain numbering fifty-two s talks, in one instance was counted, and found to be one thousand three hundred and seven grains, another gave fifty-eight s talks yielding one thousand five hundred gaiamanAnother person, alluding to the Mediterranean wheat, says that it is proof against the fly, and that its quality, which is sometimes the subject of complaint as inferior to many other kinds, depends greatly on the nature of the soil and time of harvesting. He states that in order to make fine flour from this. wheat, it must be cut in a greener state than other varieties, and indeed as early as can be done without injury. As a proof that much also in this matter depends on early harvesting, and the kind of soil, and that a sandy soil is to be preferred to a clay, he mentions the following facts: His first crop was sown on a clay soil of limestone order, and the crop was' allowed to get quite ripe be for ivan cat. his grain in this case was almost as dark as rye. His next trial- however, was made on a soil more sandy, and the x. a. 1llcroip was cut when the grain was in a pasty state. In being thrashed he found it. much fairer, and it weighed sixty-four pounds per bushel. The bread made of it he also pronounces as good as any ever made in his house. In a third instance, alluding to two heads of Mediterranean wheat, six, and five and one half inches long, and thus of uncommon length, well filled with good sized plump kerseys, the person says that these were taken out of the centre of the field, the land on each side similar, and the cultivation also except the two lands which furnished the sample. The soil was a heavy clay on a lime rock. The two lands in question were dressed heavily with half de composed straw. It matured slowly, but the crop he states exceeded any thing he had ever known from this variety, and he attributes the unusual growth to the top dressing. These facts prove that the failure often of particular varieties which have been recommended may be ascribed not so much to the badness of the seed as to the ignorance or want of care in those into whose hands it may have fallen. The Etrurian, Zimmerman and Red May, are likewise noticed with approbation as well as in the northern sections of the country the Black Tea and other varieties. Some Oregon wheat distributed with other kinds from this office is highly approved. From one small parcel of a kind thus sent out, a variety has been found bearing the name of the Woodfin red straw, after the name of its successful cultivate or, of which the following account has been given. We quote it only in substance. In the fall of 1843, a little paper of beautiful white wheat was obtained from the Patent Office. The number of grains counted were 900; this was seemed in drills and the product gathered in 1844, was one peck and one quart. Unfortunately however, the weevil s were suffered to get at it, which so injured it, that not more than three qu arts remained sound; from this in June, 1845, was harvested three bushels and three pecks. This again was seemed in October, 1845, on five acres of land, being three pecks to an acre, and the crop of 1846 was sixty bushels; part of this was sold at two dollars per bushel, and part retained. Of eight bushels of this, seemed by one person, it was estimated while, in the shock, in July last, there would be made not less than five hundred bushels, worth two dollars per bushel for seed. It is described by its proprietor as plump and fine; a very hardy variety, with a strong, firm stem, less fodder than common wheat, and will stand very thick and uncommonly branching. One bushel is heavy seeing for an acre. Twelve grains of it planted by another person yielded twelve thousand eight hundred grains, and lit for some damage from cattle would probably have reached to fifteen thousand. The proprietor estimates that not less than one thousand bushels of this wheat were raised last summer, in the various parts of Virginia and North, Carolina from the little parcel received from the Patent Office, in 1843. In addition to the examples already given of the great productive ness of wheat, the following selection from numerous others may be deemed interesting: though some of them cannot be regarded as furnishing data for common averages, or perhaps such as are attain able in any case on the large scale, yet they show the bountiful provision there is in the laws of Providence for the cultivation of the fruits of the earth; and encourage a greater degree of care in conforming to the conditions required to fulfil what belongs to man in the production of those crops on which so much of human welfare and prosperity depend. They are anomalies; but anomalies occurring 112 X. according to the regular operation of the powers of vegetable production in circumstances favorable to their development, and as such, are not mere curiosities, but illustrations of some of the wondrous combinations that run through the kingdom of nature and appropriate to a record of facts relative to the action of a fertile soil, and other genial influences on the life of plants and land husbandry. Some of the instances cited it will be perceived took place in but own country and others are derived from abroad. Robert W. Taylor of Virginia, alluding to the Oregon wheat distributed from the Patent Office, remarks, that a gentleman from Maryland, procured a small quantity and after he had sown it a few times, raised enough to sow four and a quarter acres of ground, from which, in 1845, he reaped two hundred and eleven bushels, being over fifty bushels to the acre. Mr. Taylors experiments now commenced with it by seeing one and a half acres of corn ground very late in the autumn of that year with three bushels of the grain, from which, in the harvest of 1846, he reaped thirty-four bushels of good wheat for seed. He pronounces it a valuable variety, with a strong stiff straw, of a very bright yellow color, says that it tillers well, the head is smooth, large and square, and has from four to five grains abreast, of deep red, round, large and full, thin skin and very light br an. Other persons are also mentioned in the same neighborhood as equally pleased with their trial of this variety of wheat. A gentleman states in one of our agricultural journals, that of a species of wheat which he terms "hardware Heat" the product obtained from a single grain which had thirty-seven heads, was two thousand eight hundred and twelve grains, being an average of seventy-six grains to a head; this is said to have been from wheat grown on a lot of newly cleared land, which had never been cultivated but once, when corn (maize) was grown upon it the soil being stiff white oak clay, and on the spot from which the selection was made there was no apparent trace of vegetable matter in the soil; many heads from the same lot, he further states, contained one hundred and twenty-eight grains. He mentions an instance likewise, of a' gentleman in one of the counties in the same state, Maryland, who from a peck of wheat sown, had reaped nine bushels of most excellent wheat. This was light sandy land, top dressed with coarse barn yard litter. Other instances are mentioned at different times in the same journal, of one hundred and twenty-one and one hundred and forty-one s talks from a single grain, the heads large and well filled; and again, the first product of two grains is given as five hundred and forty-nine grains, the one three hundred and twenty-five, the other two hundred and twenty, there being eighteen and nineteen s talks respectively. In Missouri, the product of a single grain is stated to have been seventy s talks, which yielded four thousand grains; this would require but one peck of seed per acre. Of the actual capabilities of a grain of wheat, we have an interesting report of an experiment tried by Edward J. Dance, of Black water, Bags hot, which appears in a late number of the Dark Lane Express. It was made, he states, on a poor sand soil near Bags hot, and it show s what may be done by thin sowing, careful culture, and suitable maturing. The plot selected was thirty rods which had been c lover after rye, and then laid down one year; it was dressed with a mixed yard manure, at the rate of six tons to the acre. The land was dug deeply, the top surface pared off, and put at the bottom of each trench. In the first week of Novemhbrex. a. 1131846, the seed was nibbled in rows of twelve inches by six inches down the row, one to three seed being put in each hole, being about at the rate of two pecks per acre, perhaps rather less. As there are forty-three thousand five hundred and sixty square inches in an acre, and the bushel contains six hundred and fifteen thousand five hundred grains, a bushel would furnish, at the above mode of doubling, seed enough for more than two and three quarter acres, allowing five seed to a square foot. The seed was kept under the ground till the end of February, in consequence of the severity of the winter, and thus the grain became a prey to various insects, &c. as the wire worm, g rub, &c. When the seed leaves appeared they were extremely weak and most un promising, many spots not a plant in a square yard, and not more than half of the holes with a plant, but in order to carry on the experiment even with them, Mr. Dance harrowed the ground in March, and then in April, at this latter time working into the ground a mixed manure, consisting of organic and in organic matters salts of ammonia, super phosphates of lime, sulphate of lime, alkalies and other bases. I nay it was hold twice with the Vernon he. The roots were now tiller ing prodigiously. But as this took place so late the grain did not ripe n earl yard some of the lower ears did not come to perfection. It was however, reaped before the end of August. Some of the roots had sixty s talks. One root was selected, cut low and weighed, the straw and grain weighed forty-eight pounds this would give a weight of sixty-eight hundred weight per acre. The roots of this rod on being taken up and the sand shaken out, were found to weigh thirteen pounds, or eighteen and a half hundred weight per acre. The number of roots on the rod was two hundred and thirty-five, not half the number nibbled and seemed, as in a rod there are five hundred and forty-four spaces of twelve inches by six inches. The average number of straws was seventeen, consisting of fifty or sixty tillers and none less than eight. The grain on this rod measured six quarts and weighed twelve pounds. This yield was about thirty bushels to the acre which is considered very great as compared with the quantity which vegetated, probably more than one hundred and twenty fold. The whole result is thus stated Produce of a rod. Late per acre. Boots and stubble. 13 lbs. 18 cut. 64 lbs.

We might add yet other instances, but these may show how much of the seed is probably entirely lost in cultivation. The discussion respecting thick and thin sowing is still carried on in England with a variety of experiments and arguments on both sides. Experiments have also been tried with respect to the depth of planting wheat. Some of those have been given in former reports. We add one more which is stated on the authority of a French work. M. Moreau of 8 114 X. a. Paris, formed thirteen beds in which he planted one hundred and fifty kerseys of wheat at various depths. The result was as follows it the depth of Same up. No. of heads.

The range from 2 35 inches down to one inch, varies in those that come up only about 20, for the extremes of maximum and minimum of the heads 243, of the grains 2 131. Between 2 13, 2 and 1 inches of those that come up, there is only a difference of about 10 at most; of the heads, only 30; of the number of grains, 1476. Looking at it, however, in another light, we may rank the depth of 2 inches best, then 1 34, then 2 35, then 1 inch, then 2 13 inches. After 4 12 inches- the falling off of the product is 12; from 12 inch to the surface it reached to 9 10. There may have been extraneous causes influencing the difference between 2 35 inches and 2 13 which seem to vary from the general rule; but it may doubtless be considered so far as this experiment goes, that the grain should not be sown at much greater depth than 2 inches, nor nearer than 1 inch from the surface. The difference to be allowed should respect the season, the nature of the soil, &c. As to the mode of judging of wheat, we are instructed by a high authority that the dimpled .end of the grain should be distinctly marked, and the point from which the little roots proceed should be somewhat prominent the end from which the blade springs should also be slightly covered with h airiness or wool i ness. The little protuberances at either of those ends must not have been rubbed off, as the grain is thereby rendered unfit for seed, as it has lost its vitality. Kilndrying also destroys its vitality, and, such seed as has been kill dried will be indicated by the unusual hardness of the grain as well as its smoke flavor. The surest way, however, is not to rely on the point of hardness, but to terminate it near the fire in a glass with as much water as will swell the grain. If damaged by salt water, its taste will be saline, and if for the purpose of remedying it has been washed and dried it will lose its bright and have a blackened appearance. Heat that has been heated in the s tack will taste bitter on being chewed, and if long kept in the granary, smell musty and look dull and dusty. If eaten by the weevil it may be detected by pressing the berne l with the fingers. X. a. 115 More attention undoubtedly should be paid to the selection and preparation of seed; and reference should be had likewise in this to the nature of the soil, climate and modes of cultivation. As a general rule it is believed to be well established that grain of northern climates will succeed better in southern than the reverse. Some interesting experiments on the different varieties of grain are mentioned as having been tried by Men. Harmonon ofWheatland. As he is a well known and experienced wheat grower, they are of value, and we therefore refer to them. See Am. Agriculturists for kept. 1847. There is, however, in almost all experiments tried in our country, too great want of the precision of the European ones, and especially of those of Germany, where every thing is reduced to the rules of economic proportions, and valuable deductions can be made on account of the regard paid to the most minute particulars which may affect the result. In the communication furnished to the office by Mr. Fleischmann, contained in appendix to. 1, may be found some interesting facts respecting the wheat crop of Germany, and in Mr. Ellsworths letter also, in Appendix No16some remarks respecting the same subject at the west. The remarkable fact is mentioned in Sillimans American Journal of Science, that in the north of Russia where the mean temperature is as low as 260 War, all the cereal grains are cultivated with success, although there are only two months and a half or three months between sloughing and harvest, and in some cases the soil was frozen to the depth of 7 feet, and near the place mentioned, on penetrating the ground, it was frozen to the depth of 175 feet. The attempt has been made to convert wheat from an annual to a perennial plant, and it is said, with some good degree of success. The account given, is that was discovered by the steward or director named Her n, of an estate at On stance. After he had ploughed and manured the land, he then sowed it with summer or winter wheat. In the spring, before the ear makes its appearance, he rows it. This he does repeatedly several times in the course of the season, using it as a kind of hay. After this he allows the p ant to grow, and be harvested as usual. The next year it ri pens earlier and bears a much larger crop than wheat cultivated in the usual manner. In autumn it is manured like the grass of meadows, and in the spring the weeds are removed. The effect is stated to be such that from one field four successive harvests have been gathered. The subject is one of considerable interest, as no doubt, if rendered perennial, it would be useful for the purpose of forage. It might be well for some of our enter prizing farmers to test the principle, as it is so easily done, and fuller information relating to it is needed. We have sought for some more satisfactory history of the matter, but as yet have been unable to light upon anything which will give it. At present it is too vague to entitle it to much reliance, though the particular fact does not appear to be at variance with analogy in regard to improvements, quite as great of numerous plants, by particular cultivation. According to Kreyssig, the color of wheat and strength of the cuticledepend on the proportion of clay in the soil. Thus he states, that on a mild soil, the skin is much thinner, and it is whiter; on a heavy soil thick, and the color more yellow. The yellow has the heaviest kerseys and shells out more, but in equal measure gives less flour than the white, which is more delicate and more exposed to the brand 116 X. a. A mode has been invented by S. Men tz, of Boonesboro, Maryland, of pulling wheat and other grains, so as entirely to remove the outer skin, by which a pure white flour is made unmixed with the usual br an. The advantages claimed for it are, that a saving in time in grinding is effected of from 25 to 50 per cent, and of 40 to 52 lbs. of wheat in each barrel, and that it is rendered capable of enduring the heat of hot climates. Mr. Bentzsupposes that the fine particles of br an remaining in the ordinary flour is the reason why it s ours. Specimens of grain, before and after his process, and also of the br an and hull removed, have been furnished the Patentoffice, and the method has received the high commendation of gentlemen engaged in agriculture. A reference will be perceived to it in the letter of or. Ellsworth, formerly commissioner of patents, to which we have already referred, and which will be found in our appendix, No. 2. He speaks very favorably, not only of its application to wheat, but also of a successful experiment with buckwheat. For Mr. Cents letter, see also appendix, No. 2. It may be, however, that the advantages of removing the br an, as respects appearance, will be counter balanced by its being less nutritions, a sit is well known the finer and the more bolted the flour, it is thought less easy of digestion. With respect to the fat forming principle, it appears, by the analysis of Professor Johnston, the proportion of the different parts of the grain stands thus 1000 lbs. of whole grain contains 28 lbs" " fine flour, " 20 lbs." c br an, " 60 lbs. The br an is therefore, much the richest in this principle, and the whole grain ground together is nearly one half richer than the fine flour. As to the muscular matter, it is stated that, In a thousand pounds of whole grain, there is 156 I is." " fine flour, " 130 lbs. Respecting the bone and saline material, Of a thousand pounds, the br an contains 700 lbs." " " whole meal, 170 lbs." " " fine flour, 60 lbs. In this respect, therefore, the br an is vastly superior, and the whole meal has nearly three times as much nutriment as the fine flour. Taking the whole three substances together, according to Professor Johnston, of a thousand pounds, the three substances contain, of the ingredientsmentionedWhole Real. Line Flour. Of muscular matter, 156 lbs. 130 lbs. Of bone material, 170 " 60ff fat, " 28 " 20 354 lbs. 210 lbs. And so, in this respect, the whole meal is one half more nutritiousthanfine flour. The difference of flour, in the making of bread, is often very great. France, in a lecture on agriculture in England, stated that a sack of inferior x. a. 117 flour, weighing 280 I is, would generally make 80 four pound leaves, the increase of weight being 40 lbs; but a sack of superior flour, of the same weight, has been known to make 93 four pound leaves, or the gain is 92 lbs. A very g luminous flour will absorb by far the most water. To that 3 lbs. of flour Will make a four pound loaf. We might add a variety of interesting particulars respecting the culture of wheat in the various parts of our country; but we should extend this portion of the report too greatly; we shall therefore only allude to one or two. Mr. Well, of El ham, N. Y., is stated to have tried the following experiment respecting wheat. In the 4th of October he cleared the tops from a potato field, burnt them and returned the ashes, with the view of sowing wheat. The seed was prepared thus: soaked four hours in bring that would boy up an egg, then scalded with boiling hot salt water, mixed with pearl ashes; passed over a serve, distributed thinly over a barn floor and a dry com post sifted on it, composed of the following substancesoyster shell lime, charcoal dust, oleaginous charcoal, ashes, Jersey blue sand, brown sugar, salt, Peruvian gun no, silicateof potash, nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia. The sun was permitted to shine upon it for about half an hour, when the particles became, as it were, crystallized upon the grain." In this state it was sown at the rate of two and a half bushels to the acre, directly on the potato ground, from which the tops had been removed and ploughed under to the depth of five inches, with a Scotch plough, harrowed once, a bushel of timothy seed sown to the acre, and narrowed twice; at the expiration of fifteen days the wheat was so far above ground as to be pronounced by a neighbor far in advance of his, which had been sown in the usual way on the first of September, thirty-four days earlier. The flour made from this wheat, which weighed nearly sixty-five lbs. per bushel, received the premium. I to superiority was owing to the enormous amount of glum ten it contained-eighteen per cent after having been dried by an air pump over sulphuric acid. His manures were applied for the purpose of producing glum ten. It may be as well to say that a composition made by Mr. P., containing thirty different chemical substances, was spread broad cast over the whole field before the wheat came up, at an expense not exceeding three dollars. The yield per acre was somewhere about 70 bushels. A practice is also mentioned in a western journal, which appears to be worthy of imitation. It is as follows: The grass seed which has shed out, is from time to time collected and also sown among the wheat, from March to the middle of April, as may be expedient. When the wheat is harvested, the farmer thus has a good coat of grass which may be pastured for a few weeks. The cattle are then turned off, and the grass allowed to grow. The next spring and summer he leaves the field fallow, and then in the autumn ploughs it, and seeds it again to wheat. In this way, for twelve years, he has raised wheat from the same ground with no other intervening crop and with improved appearance of the same. There is one more consideration which deserves some attention in relation to the wheat crop. The bushel of wheat weighs less some years than it does others, and the difference often amounts to two, three, or even four pounds. Though this may seem of comparatively little consequence for a few bushels, yet for the aggregate of the wheat crop of the United States, or for a state, or even a county, it makes a great difference. Suppose, for instance, one year the crop of the United States should 118 X. amount to 110,000,000 bushels, and weigh but fifty-nine lbs. per bushel, and in another the quantity should be but 108,000,000 and yet weigh sixty-two lbs. per bushel; the last crop, though less in quantity by two millions of bushels, would exceed the former in weight by 200,000,000 of lbs. Butt his is not the whole state of the case. We learn from good authority that a bushel of wheat, weighing fifty-six lbs, yields but 46 lbs. of flour, while one weighing sixty-two lbs, yields 53- lbs. In this supposition a still further allowance must be made, enhancing considerably the value of the millions of pounds above mentioned. Were we to estimate the product one year at 110,000,000 bushels, weighing only fifty-six lbs, and another at108000000 bushels, weighing sixty-two lbs, then the difference in favor of the latter, though the least in quantity, would amount to 536,000,000pounds in weight, or more than one million and a quarter of barrels of flour. The following, from cheques of different dates, in 1840, with respect to wheat ground at Up ar, Great Britain, exhibits at once the difference in wheat according to the various weights of the grain per bushel late.

From the best information we can obtain, we are inclined to believe that the crop of barley this year was better than in some former years. To little notice, however, is taken of it, on account of its small amount, in comparison with many others far more important, that it is difficult to ascertain its progress. A word or two only is sometimes given to it, in the accounts which we find relating to the appearance of the crops. It is raised in small patches, instead of covering hundreds of acres in close neighborhood. Of course it attracts but little attention; the product of the previous year is hardly recollected, and no deep interest is felt in its success. With the exception of New Work, the quantity raised in the United States would not be worth trying to ascertain. I to use is mainly for malt purposes, and the claims of temperance seem to have contributed very much to lessen the whole. In the state of New Work, which furnishes three fifths of the whole of this crop, while in instances there seems to have been a falling off, yet in general the reports are favorable, and compared with the crop of 1845, it is thought to have been twenty per cent better. In the New England states, also, there has been a slight increase, while in Pennsylvania the reports indicate that less attention is paid to it than formerly, and probably the crop of this year was a little less than that of 1845. In Ohio it was, as it would appear, better than last year, and therefore an advance on the crop of 1845. We are inclined to believe, that in some of the states attention is turned more to barley, not so much for the direct product of the seed, as for the purpose of fodder, and that this may likewise inadvertently cause an increase in the whole amounts. We notice that in some cases where the wheat did not do well, barley is reported as quite successful, and have given a slight addition on the whole to the aggregate crops. In giving our tabular estimates, in this as well as in all the other crops also, we have used in most instances the round numbers as more convenient and after the best examination we can give to the subject, we believe there has been an increase in the whole crop of about ten per cent. at least. In the report of 1845, some observations were made respecting a variety of barley called the Your barley. A letter from Henry Brewer, Esq, ofEnfield, Tompkins county, N. Y., who was referred to at that time as having raised it, informs us that he has been quite successful in its cultivation. He says: "his barley originated from one bushel brought from Scotland in the summer of 1829, by a Mr. Gibbs of this county, and has not degenerated by sowing, as many kinds of foreign grain have heretofore done. This kind of barley has been little used for the food of man, and as yet no call has been made for it for the purposes of brewing. I have used it for the table instead of buckwheat, prepared in the same way. The miller miles all the berne l in with the flour, and then it makes excellent cakes; a number of persons hate eaten of the cakes prepared from this kind of flour and prefer it to buckwheat, especially such as are dy septic, or whose stomach are weak* We have used it for the last two winters. This barley is a four rowe d variety, and is sowed in the spring and is ripe about the same time as the other varieties. It yields about the same as the other kinds, and weighs sixty lbs. per bushel 120 X. a. We perceive that recently some of the agricultural journals are mentioning, as a new species of barley not before brought to the notice of the American public, called the . Camp to barley; but this is a mistake, as it it was referred to in two previous reports of this office, under the name of the Imlay a barley, and efforts have been made, though un successfully, to obtain the seed. Different accounts are given respecting it in European journals. By some it is very much extolled, while by others it is as greatly deprecated. Probably the difference of views respecting it may be traced to the difference of soil or modes of culture by which it was tried. Some of its qualities, if found to be sustained by proof, would render it a valuable accession to our cereal products. According to the analysis of Mr. Gray, the parts of the ash barley are given as follows need. Straw. Potash, 19.1 24.4Soda, -10 time, 3.6 9.6Magnesia, 7.6 1.7Chloride of sodium, 2.3 8.25Phosphoric acid, 31.2 1.8The proportions of potash and soda are given differently however byKoechlin, Lichen, and Schmidtpotash, 13.30 3.91 20.91Soda, 6.53 16.79I n the Transactions of the High land and Agricultural Society of Scotland for 1845, a new variety of barley is mentioned which is said to be characterized thus: First up to the time of ripe king the skin maintains a glossy whiteness, without the slightest streak of brown, while all the other varieties are marked more or less by a brown tinge, the ridges of the grain being uniformly streaked with a brown line. Second the brighter color and greater strength of the straw than in the common varieties. Third the greater distance of the grains from one another on the ear. To that an ear of the new variety, with twelve grains on each side, will be found fully three quarters of an inch longer than one with the some number of grains of either the Chevalier or early English kind. Some of the advantages are stated to be the superior productive ness of the new variety, and, for light soils, the length of its straw. I to tiller ing properties also deserve notice, and, for moist places, where it is apt to sprout after being in the stock, the distance at which the grains are placed from one another on the ear, is regarded as a valuable qualification, since moisture cannot obtain a resting place nor be so long retained as in the ear which is more compactly constructed. The variety of barley called the Cheltenham six bowed, black skinned, is very highly commended in the dark Lane Express. It is hoped that the attempt to procure some of this from England, for distribution from this office, may prove successful. Of this kind it is said to be probably a native of Abyssinia. A person in Cheltenham, in December, 1843, nibbled a few grains on a small piece of land, and notwithstanding the severe winter of 1843 4, and the extreme drought of the summer of 1844, the crop was an extraordinary one. In the 4th of February, 1846, he drilled and dibbledEx. a. 121 ft again, five pecks to the acre. In the 4th of July it was reaped, fifty-two bushels two pecks to the acre, weight fifty-five and a half lbs. per bushel The next produce, in 1846 7, was an average one to the acre of sixty-eight bushels, weighing fifty-five lbs. The plant is considered quite hardy, its flour is excellent and makes nice bread, which will keep moist for weeks, and, if mixed with wheat flour, is very superior to the taste. The straw is also strong, fine, fit for plaiting, and cuts into excellent chaff. Other instances of its great productive ness also are mentioned. A gentleman, from seventeen grains obtained 17,235 as the first product. Another person, from fifteen corns, obtained two hundred and ninety ears, which yielded 20,880grains. Oats. It is believed that more land than usual has been devoted this year to this crop. It is not sown, however, exclusively for seed, and, in some of the reports we have received respecting it, the estimate made is in tons of hay derived from it. This is the case especially with reference to the southwestern states, where however comparatively little attention is paid to it. As a general thing, we should judge the crop not to have been as good for the year comparatively in the northern and eastern states, as in the southern, western and northwestern. The average amount per acre in the northern states, is put down as varying from thirty up to fifty, eighty, and sometimes one hundred bushels, Probably the aggregate average right be reckoned at from thirty to forty bushels per acre. In the southern middle, and southern states, it will not, it is believed, exceed ten bushels, and about the same in the southwestern. In the western and northwestern again, about twenty-five, thirty, forty, and even up to fifty bushels per acre are mentioned; the aggregate average, perhaps, is about thirty bushels. The crop of oats in the state of New Work, taken i or act, was probably not as good as in 1845, but as a whole we suspect the past two years have caused a small advance in the amount raised. In some portions of the state it is mentioned as having fallen off one third or one fifth, while in others the increase is judged to have been perhaps as much larger. In the New England states, as it is generally a favorite crop, it seems to have had its usual attention, with a slight increase of area devoted to it, and, on the whole, to have gained on the crop of 1845. The o at crop of Pennsylvania seems to have suffered in the early part of the season and it is thought yielded less per acre than usual. The estimate of decrease from 1845, in some instances, is placed as high as one-fourth or one third of the crop. In others however it is much less, not more than one tenth, and in some sections a gain is reported. Taken as a whole, from the best information we have been able to obtain, there must have been some decrease and we have accordingly so estimated it. Virginia raises a considerable crop of oats and for the most part the reports respecting it, indicate a very considerable increase. In some portions of the state towards the south eastern section there was a decrease, but in the interior and western parts it was much more successful. It will be recollected that the crop of 1845 was a poor one, and it would appear that the crop of 1847 in those places where it proved most successful was double of the 122 X. former one. This however would be too great an increase probably for the whole state, and we have therefore placed it at about one quarter more. Proceeding south, although the quantities raised are not large compared with many other crops, yet owing to the better season they ought to be considerably increased. Keeping in view the census estimates and the past history of the crop in the state since that period, we have endeavored to form our conclusion respecting it as well as we might. It does not however command that attention in the reports which have reached us, which enables us to speak with so much certainty respecting it, as others which are more in favor. The aggregate amounts here however, will not very greatly affect the whole result. The crops of Tennessee and Kentucky we should judge were good. The increase in some instances is put as high as twenty per cent. This however would seem on comparison, to be somewhat too large, and we have estimated it accordingly. In Ohio, with scarcely an exception the information we have received respecting the amount of the o at crop is favorable. This corresponds too, with the reports to the board of agriculture of that state, to which we have before referred. In some instances our correspondents placed it at double the crop of 1845, and even larger. As a general estimate it is believed to have reached as high as fifteen to twenty per cent. I tis possible, however, that we may have over rated it in 1845. Similar is the report respecting I n diana and I illinois. There was a far larger crop of oats if we may judge from the information received in 1847, than in 1845 in parts of these states. We are inclined to believe, that in these and all the northwestern states, the increase in this crop has been steady for a number of years. The demand for oats has doubtless in ceased and this not merely for home consumption, but for expert to some of the other states. It is impossible to form any very accurate conclusion as to this latter fact, as in many instances oats are included in the list with 'a' other grain he should judge that considerable attention is paid to the raising of posts in Wisconsin and I own, as well as Michigan. The crop appears likewise to have been a successful one during the year 1847. In this account we have felt warranted in allowing a considerable increase on the aggregate amounts of these states. It is unnecessary to go into particulars, as the estimates, though in a high degree favorable, vary however from thirty to fifty per cent even up to twice as much. The entire o at crop for the United States it will be seen is thus larger than that of the year 1845. In forming our estimates of this crop, however, we labor under the difficulty which we have felt with respect to all  the others. It is not easy for persons to keep up a true recollection, except in general, of the appearance of a crop two years past. There is another consideration which may be mentioned here, which probably has an influence on the amount furnished. In some parts of our country it is the practice to appropriate a poorer kind of land to this crop. The average number of bushels per acre, therefore, is not so large as it might be. It is not raised in large and extensive fields, but a few acres at the most, and generally less are devoted to it on a farm. Any persons do not pretend to do more than raise enough to supply their own consumption. Possibly the effect of rail roads in withdrawing numerous lines of stage horses from the public conveyances, may have had a partial influence on the comparative increase in some parts of our country, as it is well known that the consumption of oats by them is large. X. a. 123 n a former report we presented an extract from an English journal respecting the weight per bushel of some varieties of oats.

The most perfect analysis of this plant, however, is that contained in the essay of Prof. Norton, for which he received the premium of the Highlandagricultural Society. This was published by the society in the volume of their Transactions embracing the period from July, 1845 to March, 1847,and is a fine specimen of analysis conducted on scientific principles. Prof. Norton took the plant at different stages of its growth and examined carefully into its constituent parts.

Rye. This likewise is one of those crops which are raised in small quantities, and the greater portion of which is confined to a few states. It is likewise a product which, since its use for distillation has been very much abridged, and does not seem to be in much demand. This fact has contributed to lessen its proportionate increase. It is sometimes, however, on account of being considered the harder grain, resorted to as a substitute for wheat; the spring variety especially is employed for this purpose, in case apprehension is entertained lest the wheat crop prove too small. In Pennsylvania the reports as to this crop are favorable. In a number of counties where its product is proportion ably the greatest the increase in that of 1847 over that of 1845, is estimated at 10, up to 20 or 25 per cent. In some instances it is stated, however, that it is raised mainly for the sake of the straw as litter. The average yield is about 15 bushels on the whole aggregate, though in instances 25 or more are mentioned. In the state of New York we should judge the average per acre may have been larger, but in many sections of this state little or none is raised. The same is the case with the New England states, where, however, it is oftener used as a bread stuff. In Connecticut the amount produced, compared with wheat and the other grains, is large. In that state we believe the crop this year was better than the average one, and probably an advance upon that of 1845. The report respecting it in Paine, is less favorable, and it seems to have suffered from being winter killed in the more northern parts of the state. As a whole, however, it was a small increase for the two past years. The rye crop in New Jersey par took much of that of the states adjoining. It is believed from the best information obtained respecting it, to have been equal and probably better to the acre than the crop of 1845, though other causes may have prevented any additional breadth of land being appropriated to it. Virginia raises a small proportionate crop of rye as compared with wheat, and two thirds of the whole amount produced in this state is from the western district. In the eastern section of the state for some years past the rye crop has failed and thus but little has been sown. In the western district while in some counties the amount seems to have been lessened, yet in others there was an advance it is believed of from 10 to 20 per cent. Taking the whole aggregate product of the state it is estimated to have been better than in the year 1845. In Kentucky, Ohio, and the other western states, though in some instances it is reported to have decreased, yet on the whole there was probably a small gain. In I n diana the rye crop of a few counties is considered to have been twice as great as in 1845. The general average per acre at the west, according to the answers we have received, would seem to be about 15 bushels. I instances are mentioned even as high as fifty and again others as low as 6 to 10. The most frequent however is from 15 to 20 bushels per acre. In parts of Michigan the accounts represent the appearance of the rye crop to have been unfavorable, and in some cases it was nearly destroyed. In others it was on the whole more favorable, and taking into view the growth of the state we may allow a small advance. The attention however is so much turned to the wheat crop, that it attracts but little notice. The in organic constituents of rye are thus given x. a. 125 need. Strawwill and Fresenius. Rich on.

In those states where buckwheat is most raised, the failure of the wheat crop in some instances led the farmers to resort to this grain to supply the deficiency. In consequence of this, there was more raised than there would otherwise have been. In the two states of New York and Pennsylvania where more than one half of the whole buckwheat crop is produced, this was especially the case. In both of these it is believed that there was a considerable advance on the crop of 1845. The average amount per acre is variously estimated at from 15 to 25 bushels. In a few instances we notice in the reports we have received respecting this product, a falling off but generally it is stated to have been a better crop than that of 1845, by from 20 to 50 per cent. The quality was likewise good, and in this respect it was superior to the former one. In the New England states, it is believed there is somewhat more attention directed to the cultivation of buckwheat than formerly, and with few exceptions, it would seem to have been quite successful. The estimate for some of the southern states has been so difficult, and the quantity so small, that it has been omitted in the column. We have thought best, however, to restore in our estimate at this time, the states of Virginia and North Carolina, which were un designedly included among the omitted ones, and we have based our calculations for these on the estimate given in 1843 making due allowance for the aspect of the crops of this grain in the subsequent years. The buckwheat crop in the western states we judge to have also been an increased one. In some instances in Ohio and I n diana, the gain is represented as very large, two or three times as much as the usual crop, and often from 25 to 50 per cent. The reason assigned is the aspect of the wheat crop early in the season. In a few instances only have we noticed among our information, any intimations of a decline in quantity, while the quality is pronounced to have been superior. The demand is stated also to have been increasing for some years, and this has turned the attention of farmers towards it. The number of bushels per acre is variously stated from 25 and 30 up to 50. It appears therefore, that the average product per acre on the amount sown, must have been greater than in the Atlantic states. Taking the aggregate in all the states, we believe therefore the increase on this crop since 1845 has been about 15 per cent. There is besides no doubt considerable buckwheat sown which is never harvested, but turned in upon the land to serve as manure, or top dressing to other crops. Any farmers find their advantage in this application of its growth. I to use as a bread stuff is confined principally to the cakes which are made of it 126 X. a. In one of the English Journals we find a communication by Dr. Stein, describing the Russian mode of using buckwheat, which is as followsSAfter the grain has been divested of the hull, and broken much like ho many by being passed through a mill, a portion of it is placed in a common earthen vessel, so as to fill it about two thirds full. Upon this is poured fresh water so as nearly to fill up the vessel, which is set in an oven heated enough to boil the water slowly. This is continued till the water has elaborated, and tie grain begins to dry; then lessen the heat of the oven; the grain is thus swollen and rises to the top of the vessel and forms a thick brown crust over its edges. It then begins to crack, which shews that it is ready for use. For this purpose cover the top of the vessel with a dish and place it on the table. In breaking the crust and adding butter and salt, mix in the crust with the swelled grain, and it will form, it is said a verynutritious and agreeable food, It is used constantly by the peasantry of Russia, and is most highly esteemed by them. According to an analysis of this grain, by Dr. Lodges, the br an of buckwheat, apparently so dry and innutritious, contains of muscle forming materials as much as the average samples of rice, and, in his opinion, if it agreed with the digestive organs of cattle it would be good food for them. Mai Of Of I Ndi Of Corn. With scarcely an exception, the accounts respecting this crop, in all the states, are most favorable. The amount raised in 1847, is believed to beunexampled in the history of this product in our country. The increasing demand for it, together with the anticipated <a name="loss7"><mark>loss</mark></a> on the wheat crop induced the planting of a much larger breadth of land. Though the cold and backward spring rendered the planting season a week or two later, yet the months of June, August and July were most favorable to the progress of its growth, and all will recollect how in almost every part of our widely extended country, the information which was circulated respecting the corn crop, spoke of its prospect of an abundant yield. That prospect has been fully realized. The frosts of September even held off, in most cases, till the grain had obtained its maturity, and thus was out of the reach of danger. Although this is a crop which is universally produced to some extent in our country, yet owing to the great similarity of its appearance the past season, it will not be necessary to go into particulars very extensively. Our information respecting it through its whole period of growth, from the planting to the gathering, is more full than with respect to most others, as it fell more under the observation of our correspondents in general. New England raises a fair proportion of corn, as compared with other products of the earth. Probably nearly the whole of it is consumed at home. The varieties which are most favorable for the northern climate of these states, are the yellow as distinguished from the southern white kinds. They, contain more oil and glum ten, but less farinaceous properties than the latter. The information from Paine represents the increase of this crop for 1847 over that of 1845, to have generally been from 25 to 50 per cent. and in the northern county of Piscatiquis, some estimates place it as high as double. The season is considered to have been far more favorable. In New Hampshire, where a similar increase of a quarter at least is supposed, the prospect of new rail roads is also supposed to have exerted considerable influence in some parts of the state. The increase of laborers to be sustained while the works were going on, and the additional facilities of x. a. 127 markets furnished when completed, are thought to be the result of these improvements; and thus their action on the increase of this crop may be accounted for. In the other states of New England also, the advance o the crop of 1845, is variously estimated from 20 up to 25 per cent. and the average amount of a good crop is set down in New England as from 25 up to 50 bushels, though much larger ones are sometimes raised. Premium crops indeed, in favorable locations and attended to with more than ordinary care often reach to 75 or 80, arid sometimes 100 bushels per acre. The state of New York is a large producer of corn, though comparatively it does not hold the rank in this state that wheat does. The general account of this crop in all parts of the state is good. There is perhaps an exception or two in which it is thought to have been less, and the reason assigned may be regarded as a somewhat singular one, that too much was planted for good culture. The average estimates in different parts of the state are one quarter to one half more, and it is mentioned usually that more was planted. The eight and twelve rowed yellow seem to be the favorite varieties in most cases. The average product of a good yield is given at from forty up to sixty, though the common one is probably about twenty-five bushels per acre. Similar also is the information from Newjersey. There was a decided increase in the number of acres planted and the product was excellent. We have not noticed a single unfavorable report respecting the corn crop of Pennsylvania. In all parts of the state it seems to have been abundant. The estimated increase varies generally from one third up to 40, 50 and even 100 per cent. In the fine county of Lancaster, sometimes called the garden of the state, it is said that there was one third more than was ever raised, as probably one third more ground was planted, and the increase was 10 per cent. more per acre. In many instances sixty bushels were raised to the acre, where ordinarily not more than twenty-five or thirty are raised. The moist weather in August as well as the favorable season previous, are likewise mentioned as causes of the increase in the western parts of the state. In some cases in Maryland, the corn crop is represented as being short, and that there is an unusual amount of damaged grain. We suspect however, this is local, and if we may judge from the early appearance of the crop, and of its progress through the seasons of growth, as well as from what we learn respecting it since it has been gathered, we believe that a considerable increase must be allowed. The crop of 1845 was not a good one, being considerably less than that of the preceding year. We have also traced back the former history of this product, and have been led to correct some of the preceding estimates which will give a larger quantity for this year, than the mere per cent age might allow. In Virginia, and more especially the western part of it, the increase of the corn crop over that of 1845, appears to have been large. In some instances it is rated as double, in others one half more.  In the eastern section, the increase is supposed to have been not so large, but as varying from ten up to twenty, twenty-five per cent, or one third more. It will be recollected that we allowed a decrease of about thirty per cent. in 1845, on the aggregate corn crop of Virginia; although that year was in many respects unfavorable, yet on reviewing and comparing the estimates with the census returns, &c, we are now inclined to place the decrease for that year somewhat lower, and this consideration must be regarded as influencing the increased amount of 1847.128 X. a. In North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama, the corn crop of 1845 suffered extremely from the unusual drought. The crops of the year 1847 on the contrary, have been far better than usual. In some instances in South Carolina it is thought to have been thrice or four times greater; the greatest crop ever raised while that of 1845 was the smallest. In others it is supposed to have reached to fifty or seventy per cent. The most general estimate, however, in all these states is about one third increase over that of 1845. The average acre able product, is given from twenty up to thirty-five bushels in these states, although it reaches sometimes to forty and fifty bushels. The average of the aggregate crop of the state might not reach higher than twenty-five or thirty bushels. Louisiana raises a very good crop of corn for home consumption, though not equal indeed to that of Mississippi or Arkansas. In these states likewise the statements respecting this crop lead us to believe there has been an increased crop, ranging from 20 per cent. up to one third more than the crop of 1845. The crop of Mississippi for 1845 has been corrected, which increases the estimate. The white you rd seed varieties are mentioned in the foregoing states, as the favorite ones produced. They are better adapted to the warm climate which there prevails, as well as for the purposes to which they are applied of ho many and for bread stuff. Tennessee, as appears from the returns of te census, and as we think too the history of the corn crop show, stands foremost in the amount of this grain produced. The estate of 1845 may perhaps have been too large, but there has bee i some advance on the crop of that year, not so large it would seem by the reports we have received as in some of the other states. I na Kentucky the fine season is stated to have been favorable to the crop. The increase above that of 1845 is variously estimated at from fifteen up to thirty per cent. The acre able product is given at about thirty to forty bushels. Ohio produces a heavy corn crop, and the account of the success of this product of the earth for 1847 is very favorable. With but few t exceptions there is reported an increase, varying from ten, twenty-five and thirty-five up to fifty per cent. In some instances owing to the increase of population, it is stated to have been probably double or the, times as large. There any decline is noticed, the dry season is given as the cause. Theacreable product is generally given as forty bushels. The varieties raised are the yellow you rd, the common yellow, the red blaze you rd seed, &c. Similar favorable accounts represents the crop of I n diana, I illinois and missouri as generally very large. While there is now and then an instance of failure, yet it is most commonly stated that much more was planted and the yield excellent; one third, one half more is not an unusual estimate, as compared with the crop of 1845. In a few instances, two, three or four times more is believed to have been the result. The failure of the wheat crop and the increased consumption, from the increase of population, combined with the foreign exportation, created a large demand, and led to much more being planted, while the toil of the husband man in this respect was greatly blessed. The white flint and yellow seem to be favorite varieties in these states. The acre able amount as given varies from forty to fifty bushel in many instances; in others it does not reach higher than twenty to thirty. Large crops however are sometimes raised, exceeding one hundred bushels. The crops of Wisconsin and I own seem to have suffered somewhat from the cold and backward season, but as a whole there has been a decided in cease, and in some instances it is estimated as high as one hundred per cent. X. a. 129 The acre able product as given varies from thirty to forty and up to sixty-five bushels per acre. In Michigan there was more corn planted than in 1845, and the product was much larger. The average product per acre is estimated as being forty or fifty bushels in many parts, and the whole increase as not less than forty or fifty up to one hundred per cent. It will be seen from this rapid sketch, and we might, had it been necessary, have gone further into particulars, that our large estimate of the corn crop seems to be fully justified. In numerous cases we have see in estimates, apparently on good authority setting down 50,100, and even more acres, at fifty bushels up to seventy-five of more per acres. In one case which is mentioned in the Ohio Statesman, a field of forty acres is stated as likely to average one hundred bushels to the acre. We have not noticed much complaint, the past season, with respect to the various insects which injure maize or I indian corn, and the diseases which sometimes affect this valuable crop, appear to have been much less prevalent. A peculiar <a name="disease3"><mark>disease</mark></a>, however, is mentioned in a part of Maryland, which may deserve some notice. It is attributed to the drought in the early part of the season, and the rains which succeeded in August. The appearance of the corn is thus described by Dr. Use: " The cap of the injure dear is dis colored, and when opened a few grains near the apex of the ear, and one side of it, mark the commencement of the <a name="disease4"><mark>disease</mark></a> in their sickly and shrivelled appearance; this increases in space and intensity until the whole ear exhibits a deadly and gangrenous mass of black <a name="rotten0"><mark>rotten</mark></a> grains, while the whole plant on which it grows is erect, and of the most healthy and vigorous appearance." He accounts for it from the want of solar influence necessary to assist the vital activity of th li plant to elaborate the juices, to de compose the carbonic acid; to fix its carbon, and to release and restore to the atmosphere the oxygen. Whatever: may be thought of the doctors theory to account for the <a name="evil5"><mark>evil</mark></a>, it deserves consideration, as it seems to have done much damage to this important crop in the vicinity of his residence. The estimate we have given of the corn crop may not correspond with that which may be formed by some. We have seen it placed as high as60000000000 of bushels, and again lower than our number. Some allowance must be made in comparing estimates for the time they are made. I that been stated, on good authority, that a bushel of corn from the time of its being harvested till it is thoroughly dry, will shrink 22 per cent. Hence we must de duct from the earlier statement of crops about: one fifth. Thisanay account for the fact that the amount of export does not exhibit the true proportion of the crop gathered. We prefer to fall below the real amount than to exceed It in our estimates. Besides that which is gathered in its grain, there is also a very considerable quantity which is destroyed by soiling; not being suffered to come to the seed, or if so, not harvested. This practice prevails, probably, more at the south and west than in other portions of our country, but the fact deserves notice when averting to the varies products which constitute our agricultural resources for the use of man and beast. We have mentioned some of the varieties which are favorites in the different sections of the country. The tree corn is highly recommended by some, to be sown broad cast for fodder; it is said to be sweeter, not liable to <a name="mildew1"><mark>mildew</mark></a>, arid, in some of our northern states, it is said to be worth 25 percent. more when planted in the same soil and under the same circumstance . Originally it ripened about a fortnight later than the white and yellow flint 9 130 X. but by the selection of the earliest ears, we are informed that in Connecticutrit is only a few days or a week at most behind the others. It is said to have succeeded well, also, as far as 40 north, and is highly praised in, a Tennessee journal as out yielding most varieties, and making the best and sweetest meal, While by the abundance of the leaves it will give the greatest quantity of fodder and the best quality of any known. One of the best of the northern varieties is a kind called the Grown corn from the name of a successful cultivate or on the shores of lake Winnepiseogee, in New Hampshire. It grows but five feet high, produces two or three ears on a stalk, with very large kerseys, and may be planted in hills only three feet apart. It is said that in New Hampshire 135 bushels of shelled corn to the acre have been obtained from it, and on an average, it has been stated by a good judge of the subject, it might reach ninety or more. I n the vicinity of the Hudson river it is said to ripe n early, by the middle of August; the s talks are small and the ears near the ground, and it is not so much affected by the shade as other varieties, which renders it a useful variety for planting orchards. Give ears of this variety, about ten inches long, when shelled, produced one quart of corn, containing 2,000-grains, equal to 6 4000 grains for a bushel. The advantages which this kind of corn possesses over many other varieties, have been stated to be 1. The greater yield with the same culture 2. From its rapid growth, and early maturity, it is secured both against the late spring or early autumnal frosts, and may be early brought into use, or to the market 3. As it is very hard and oily, it is excellent for shipping 4. The small size of the s talks renders it less exhausting to the soil, let    liable to be blown down in high winds, and it may be planted nearer together. The following table which we take from the American Agriculturists, was constructed with reference to the Grown corn, but may, probably, answer for other varieties, which have grains of about the same size. It is for an acre of land with the hills at different distances.

Dr. Use of Maryland, well known to the agriculturists of this part of, our country, speaking of the Oregon, which he received from this office, says, I have grown it and have a high opinion of it; it is a yellow corn, and has a deep grain, and I think it will shell out very heavily. Of the Laden, he says, it has been my favorite corn for many years, as the most productive and most heavy of any kind I have ever tried There are different varieties which x. pass under the name. His reference is to the pure white Laden. Some of the others tried by him proved to be very inferior. An interesting experiment, in which a fine variety was secured, by blending two or three dis similar ones, is mentioned in the Columbia Advocate of South Carolina. The corn produced is stated to have measured, in some cases, from twelve to thirteen inches i# circumference, and from twelve to fourteen inches in length, having from forty to forty-eight rows of grain in an ear. This was, however, the yield of a single ear to a stalk the ears which were from s talks bearing five or six ears or more were smaller, though it is said as many as three of the ears, even of those s talks would each measure, when shelled, nearly twice as much as the largest ear of the common corn. It was mostly of the white you rd seed, but the varieties from which selection had been made are thus described The one was remarkable only for a grain an inch deep, or a cob the size of the finger; another, for its thickness of cob but extremely short, and another still for the length of the cob, but extremely slender, &c. Either of these varieties, regarded singly or separately as to its properties, would have been considered hardly worth the planting. By attention, and suitably blending these varieties, he obtained the valuable one which has been mentioned above, and which might be truly called a mammoth corn. The ground on which it was raised is described as being an exhausted plantation near Monticello, on the red hills of Little river, but the- mode of cultivation is not given. M any instances might be mentioned of the uncommon size of single ears or large crops of corn. A few, however, will be all that we shall quote to shew the capabilities of this most valuable grain. The editor of the Ohio Cultivator mentions a part of a seed ear which weighed two pounds, was twelve inches in length, nearly ten inches in circumference, the number of grains, 1,446, three-fourths of an inch in length, and the corn on the ear measured above a quart when shelled. It is of a kind which requires to be planted early, about middle of April, in Ohio, for a good crop. -another ear, raised by another gentleman, and of a different variety, as it would seem, is mentioned as being sixteen inches in length, containing 1,006 grains. A specimen of I indian corn also was exhibited at an agricultural show, having twelve ears on one stalk. The same journal mentions a crop, raised in Scioto county, of one hundred and sixty bushels of corn on an acre of land. It is presumed, that this of course, means ears before being shelled. The growth of corn, during a part of the last sumner, was most rapid and we notice some statements respecting it which may be interesting in this connection. In Massachusetts, a person in Amherst is stated to have noted the growth of a singles talk, during three Was, as follows: first day, six inches, second, five and a half, the third, five total, sixteen and a half inches in three days. In a Rochester journal it is sa i, that on observing, for many days, in July, the progress of corn, five inches was the maximum for twenty-four hours. Contrary to the common idea, that plants do not grow except in the light of day, the observer found, that both corn and grape vine increased quite as fast from 8, P. M. to 4, A. M., as during any port on of the sixteen hours from 4, A. M. to 8, P. M. If our space allowed, we could fill pages with interesting facts relating to the exhibitions of this vegetable product. We refer to our appendix, Of, for some things relating to the culture, &c, of corn. A translation, with respect to maize in Mexico, and the method of making the tortillks, which132Ex. Doc.

The result was as follows 6 os. 1,4, 7 and 10, when shelled, measured four pecks, one gallon, twoquiirts and one pint, and weighed 70 and a half lbsNos. 2, 5, 8 and 11, measured four pecks, be gallon, two quarts and ne and a half pint, and weighed 71 and a half lbsNos. 3, 6, 9 and 12, measured four pecks, half pint, and weighed 55 lbs. The fodder taken off from the last was also carefully weighed and amounted to 18 I is, which, added to that from which it was taken, is731bs, only one pound and a half more than the corn alone from which notables were taken, and two and a half pounds more than that cut up by thefts. -I t would seem, from this experiment, therefore, that the practice 6 fix. pulling off the leaves for fodder is injurious, as it deprives the corn of nearly the weight of the fodder, when cured, without reckoning the time alsoconisumied in taking them off. Baize has never been analyzed with sufficient accuracy. It is not surprising: that it should have been passed over abroad where it is less knownlutit is remarkable that so favorite an article of food: as it is in our own country and so useful a product for various purposes, it should have been thus neglected. The varieties are so numerous, and their characteristics sodiffereiit that it is true the analysis of a northern corn would not serve for a southern one and vice versa, but the two great species might be analyzed with more minuteness and care than have yet been given to them it will be recollected that in Dr. Jacksons report on the: geology of Newhanpshire, which was. quoted in a former report, the constituents of this grain were pointed out in connexion with other products, and the fact stated tat Dr. Jackson found the great difference between the grain of the ihrhemclimates and those of the southern to be the unequal proportions o ten nd albumen.

To effect so desirable an object, the best modes of kill drying are necessary. Various inventions have been made for this purpose, some of which appear to be very successful, and by which the business is carried on on a, large scale. The following simple expedient has been published as from good authority, and has moreover .been at tested as likewise applicable to rye. It was communicated to the New York Farmers' Club, by a gentleman who find been for twenty-five years in the ship store business. He says that he formerly found much difficulty in furnishing corner meal that wouldlkeepsweet on long voyages, and in warm climates. In mentioning the difficulty to Men as Coffin, Esq. one of the oldest whale men ofNantucket, I he was informed by him that there was no difficulty in keeping corn meal f sweet for: a three years' voyage, by putting a beach stone the size of a large having stone, in the centre of a hogs head of meal and hooped tight, :and for a barrel, a stone four or five inches in diameter and made tight. Experiments were then made in regard to meal to Rio Grande and other southern ports, by sending the meal with the stone and also without the stone, and on the return of the ship, it was found that the meal with the stone in the centre 134 X. of the case kept sweet, while the meal without it was spoiled sour. I, s necessary to have the case -water tight. The same gentleman likewdestated that corn meal in tight rum luncheons when sent to the West I des will keep sweet, while in a common flour barrel it Will spoil. We have received no particular information relating to broom corn, but it is believed that increased attention is paid to its cultivation and manufacture, which appears to be very profitable in some parts of our country. This plant is of a different genus from the maize and is said to be a native of I india; the popular error that they will mix is denied very emphatically by high authority. An interesting account of its cultivation on the Mohawk flats is given in the Cultivator. The persons engaged in it are said to have two hundred acres of land devoted to it. The seed is sown by a barrow or drill as early in spring as the ground w ill admit, in rows about three and a half feet apart. As soon as it is above ground it is hold, and soon after thinned, so as to have the s talks two or three inches apart. It is only hold in the row, to remove the weeds near the plants; the harrow and cultivate or is then run through to keep down the weeds, and a small double <a name="mould10"><mark>mould</mark></a> board plough is likewise run shallow between the rows. I tis not left to risen but cut green. I instead of lipping down the tops' of the corn and letting them hang sometime to straighten the "brush" in one direction, it is not lopped till ready to cut. One set of hands goes forward and lips or bends the tops on one side, and another follows, and cuts them off when bent, a third gathers them into carts or wagons. At the factory they are sorted over and put into bunches, each bunch of brush of equal length- The seed is then taken off by a sort of hatchet, worked by six horses which clearest he brush very rapidly. It is then spread thin to dry on racks in the building, for the purpose. In about a week it can be packed away closely. The quantity of brooms turned out is said to be one hundred and fifty thousand dozen per annum. They are made in the winter. The s talks are left on the ground, and ploughed in next spring, thus keeping up the fertility of the soil. The origin of broom corn as a cultivated product of this country, is inWatsons Annals of Philadelphia, attributed to Doctor Franklin. He is said to have accidentally seen an imported whisky of corn in the possession of a lady of Philadelphia, and while examining it as a curiosity, saw a seed which he planted, and from this small beginning has sprung the present product in the United States of this article. We have no means of ascertaining the number of acres devoted to it nor the amount of product in value, but it must be very considerable. It is raised in Ohio, and in some of the New England states as well as in New York and Pennsylvania. Potatoes. The time was when this crop was numbered among our most successful ones. Affording as it does, not merely a favorite esch lent for the table, but an excellent fodder stuff, tt was a means on which the farmer relied to supply him with sustenance for various animals, with no little confidence. It was likewise assuming a place among our home manufactures for the starch which it afforded. But within a few years there has been a sorrowful change, and throughout almost the whole extent of the country where the common potato is cultivated, instead of ascertaining the amount of the crop, our attention is rather demanded to learn the amount of the <a name="loss8"><mark>loss</mark></a> suffered. X. 135 t is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at any reliable conclusions respecting the productive ness of this crop. We have, as a data to fall back upon the returns of the census, and the estimates of two or three years subsequent, when, happily, the destroying plague had not appeared. Is we shall devote some time to the subject of the <a name="disease5"><mark>disease</mark></a>, we shall only run over the estimates reported to us somewhat rapidly, embodying most of our information under the former branch of the subject. The <a name="loss9"><mark>loss</mark></a> of this crop falls heavily on the state of Paine and the Newengland states generally. Paine has been celebrated for her fine potatoes. Her climate or soil, and perhaps both, have seemed peculiarly adapted to this plant. In her prosperous years of cultivation, large quantities have been raised for export, besides what were necessary for the home consumption. This year, however, this source of her commerce and wealth has been greatly cut off, and in some sections hardly enough have been raised for her own population. In some of the instal ces reported to us, we are told that the Drop of 1847 is fifty per cent. le is than that of 1845, and ninety per cent. less than that of 1843. The a vera e number of bushels also is estimated at not more than twenty bushels to the acre. In some other parts of the state the <a name="evil7"><mark>evil</mark></a> may not have been so f ever ely felt, but the aggregate crop of the state is greatly reduced from to e fair a v( rage one. In New Hanipshire and Vermont, with the oil er states of New England, the estimate of the <a name="loss10"><mark>loss</mark></a> varies. Perhaps the an want of <a name="loss11"><mark>loss</mark></a> is not, on the whole, so great in Connecticut as in the other states. In some instances we have understood that very fine potatoes, and of excellent quality, have been raised there. For some reason or other, the more northern sections of the country seem to have suffered most; twenty-five and thirty per cent. decrease from the crop of 1845 are the common estimate, where the amount per acre is set from one hundred to one hundred and eighty bushels. The <a name="loss12"><mark>loss</mark></a> on the crop of 1847, in the state of New Work, is variously estimated. In some counties, from apprehension of the <a name="evil8"><mark>evil</mark></a>, less were planted, while in others, more contiguous to the markets, there was a large extent of ground devoted to this vegetable. The early appearance of the crop, both here and in New England, was most promising. The vines flourished, and the tubes apparently set so as to encourage the hope of the farmer, that his potatoes would escape, and his labors be at last again rewarded. But in the latter part of August they told another tale the <a name="blight0"><mark>blight</mark></a> came, and the tubes already formed began to <a name="decay0"><mark>decay</mark></a>. In proportion as the quantity planted had been large, was the <a name="evil9"><mark>evil</mark></a>. In some places the <a name="loss13"><mark>loss</mark></a> is estimated at twenty-five, in others thirty fifty, and up to sixty per cent. At all events, there was in the aggregate a great reduction from an average crop. Theacreable product also ranges, according to the estimates furnished, at from thirty up to sixty, eighty and one hundred bushels. In the potato crop of New Jersey likewise, and Pennsylvania, similar deductions are required. In these states there has been rather more attention recently paid to the sweet potato, in consequence of the <a name="evil10"><mark>evil</mark></a> by which the common potato has been rendered less productive. In the reports from this state, as well as in some others, the crop is estimated as it actually was, and the <a name="loss14"><mark>loss</mark></a> by the <a name="rot0"><mark>rot</mark></a> then given. There would seem to be reason for supposing, that viewed in the light of productive ness simply, there may have been an increase in some parts of the state, but the <a name="rot1"><mark>rot</mark></a> has been very severely felt. The <a name="disease6"><mark>disease</mark></a> appears to have been felt for the first time, this year, in particular portions of this state While the <a name="loss15"><mark>loss</mark></a> is variously est i 136 X. mated, from ten up to fifty per cent, yet we are inclined to believe, in the aggregate it did not cause as great a reduction as in some of the states we have already mentioned. The potato <a name="rot2"><mark>rot</mark></a> seems likewise to have been felt to a considerable extent among the common potato, when cultivated in Maryland. It has not heretofore prevailed with very great severity in this state, but it has been gradually extending its attacks further to the south and west every year. In the western parts of Virginia, owing to the scarcity of seed, there were less potatoes planted; the <a name="rot3"><mark>rot</mark></a> also made its appearance, and very considerably lessened the crop. It is thought, however, in some places to have a bated. Not a great many are ordinarily raised, and chiefly for table use they are not resorted to for the food of cattle. The average product per acre is by some estimated at one hundred bushels. The <a name="loss16"><mark>loss</mark></a> is estimated atone third. I need, the general reports from the state represent the crop as seriously affected; though in the eastern counties it is stated that the productive ness was good, but they sustained <a name="loss17"><mark>loss</mark></a> after they had matured. He should judge that the cop cf sweet potatoes was a less one than that of 1845, as the drought diminished the amount produced. The sweet potato crop of South C, olin a is represented as having been a very fine one, in some instances probably double or three times that of 1845. The general average oft the state, per ice, is given at about fifty bushels, though in the vicinity of Chrirleston it is raid to be one hundred, and in other districts one hundred and l fifty bushels per acre. The I wish potato, where raised, likewise were fine. The advices received as to the sweet potato crop in Georgia and Alabama and other states, are likewise favorable; twenty-five per cent, one third, one half, are mentioned as the probable gain on the crop of potatoes for 1845. The season promoted their growth, and the average product, in different places varied from fifty up to one hundred and fifty or two hundred bushels per acre. The common potato is occasionally used, and no complaint is made as to its success this year. In Louisiana it is planted in January. In Tennessee and Kentucky the potato crop is given as varying from ten to twenty and twenty-five per cent. better than that of 1845. Both kinds of potatoes are raised here, so that it is difficult to discriminate. To mention, however, is made of the <a name="rot4"><mark>rot</mark></a>; the average product per acre is given as from fifty to one hundred and two hundred bushels. The Ohio potato crop suffered in particular sections of the state, to some considerable extent. The <a name="evil11"><mark>evil</mark></a>, however, was less in others, and instances are mentioned of a decided increase. The sweet potato is raised here, but chiefly however the common or I wish kind. The <a name="loss18"><mark>loss</mark></a> does not appear to have been so great in I n diana, I illinois andM1isouri as in Ohio, and the states from the east; in some sections it is estimated at a <a name="loss19"><mark>loss</mark></a> from the <a name="rot5"><mark>rot</mark></a>, of 10 to 25 per cent. In others there was an evident gain, and there may have been so in the whole aggregate crop. The <a name="disease7"><mark>disease</mark></a> was felt somewhat this year in Michigan, Wisconsin and I own, but the report on the whole is judged a favorable one. It will be recollected that there was a great falling off of the crop in 1845,so that taking this as the basis of comparison for the present year, we must probably reckon it considerably under the average crop. Regarding the entire crop of the United States, we doubt whether the I wish potato crop will reach to the returns of the census, although there has evidently been an increasing cultivation from t other causes. The sweet potato crop we believe x. a. 137 may have gained on that of the census; and taking both together we believe that it is above the crop of 1845, but not equal to the census returns. In Appendix No. 5, we have sub joined some papers relating to the cultivation of potatoes, &c. The failure of the crop, and its great importance, has led to a variety of investigations respecting its nutritiousness, and its elementary principles, and many most interesting results have followed the experiments which have been made for this purpose.

The following table shows, according to May en, that starch and water always exist in inverse, proportion; where there is most starch there is least water, and vice versa.

The following account mentions a large manufactory of this article in Michigan, at Almost, A peer county. It is probably the largest establishment of the kind in the United States, and is owned by a gentleman who is also interested, it is said, in two others in Vermontwe quote from the Detroit Free Pressthe factory is 214 feet long and 40 wide, including an L. The main building is 134 fact long, 14 of which are used for an engine room, and is two stories high. The lower part has 64 tubs, holding about 600 gallon s each, giving a total of 28,400 gallowss. The L part is 80 feet long by 40,of brick, one and a half stories high, for a potato bin. Loaded team s drive up a platform into the second story, and follow, re a circle, 13 tea is can unload at a time, through trap doors over the bin, \a\ which is calculated to hold 40,000 bushels. One hundred and thirty loads ha c been received in a day, making a total of 4000 bushels. In the second story of the principal building is an oven 10( feet long by 18 wide, for drying the starch; or rather, I should say, an oven of 200 feet by 9, as there is a division in the centre, with doors some ten feet apart. In the oven there are sets of pans, one above the other, which can be turned at pleasure. It is heated from the steam works, and conductors of heat a serried in tin pipes all over the building. The potatoes are shoveled from the bin into a hop per, where there is water constantly running into it, and where they are as thoroughly washed by machinery as a cook could do it for your dinner. When, by the action of the machinery, they are separated from the dirt, stones, and sticks, and pass on to two cylinder garters, at the rate of 100 bushels an hour. From the garters, by the action of the machinery, they go into the serve, that separates the starch from the^ potato. The pulp then passes into four large x. a. 19eisterns, and there again machinery pumps it into the 64 large tubs or cisterns, before alluded 6ff or settling. When the water is drawn off and the starch, by a forcing pump, is carried into the second story, and, when settled, put into the oven I have before spoken of, which is calculated to bake a days work, being the starch from 1000 bushels or 60,000 lbs. of potatoes. The starch is packed in cases and shipped east. The cost of the factory is                              $12,000. Considerable starch was made last season, (1846) but the rotating of some 30,000 bushels last fall curtailed the quantity anticipated. This large quantity of' the raw material was thrown away. It served to feed many cattle and hogs of the neighborhood for some months. The pulp remaining as worthless, is used in fattening hogs, which the proprietor has in a yard adjoining. The factory price for potatoes is ten cents a bushel. Mr. C. has contracted with various farmers to the amount of 400 acres. The average number of bushels raised last' year on an acre, was 275. Allowing the same this year, it will amount to over 100,000 bushels; but this is not half the quantity wanted. Farmers are unwilling to contract, fearing the <a name="rot6"><mark>rot</mark></a>. Present indications are good for the crop. All varieties are used even theRohan. It takes the fall and winter to use up the potatoes; then wheat and corn are used for the same purpose. The quantity made from the potato per year will not be far from 1,000,000 lbs. or 500 tons. It sells for     $5-a hundred in New Yorksan interesting fact is stated in the Pharmaceutical Journal, which seems to prove the great indestructability of sta :h in potatoes: "A gentleman in 1841 (four years before the time of the account given made a pit and filled it with potatoes; but the potatoes, when winter set in, were so far delayed as to be considered worthless. He accordingly buried them in the ground three feet deep to <a name="rot7"><mark>rot</mark></a> and turn to manure. In digging over the spot four years afterwards, a white mass was turned up, which proved to be part. of the remains of the potatoes. Ni examination, -the original layer of two feet deep was found to be compressed into one of eight or nine inches. The upper part of it consisted of a mass of white powder, which, on being examined with the microscope, was ascertained to be pure and perfect starch. In the lower part, the skin part of the tubes, as well as the starch, still remained, and each potato could be separated from the rest like a dried fig; and on removing the dry feel, the inferior was found to consist of starch nearly pure. These remains of the potatoes had a strong and most offensive smell, but the starch, on being washed, was as sweet and white, and in all respects as good as that from sound and fresh b potatoes, though buried in contact with the decaying tubes full three years and a half. The surface of the delayed potatoes was covered with an immense number of earth worms completely matted together, and the <a name="mould11"><mark>mould</mark></a> for six or eight inches above them was full of maggots similar to common house flies; but neither worms nor maggots were found and ong the decayedpotatoesPOTATO <a name="rot8"><mark>Rot</mark></a>.

Any curious questions relating to it have been solved, and whatever l apparently exerts the slightest influence has been most carefully noted and reasoned upon. In our observations respecting this <a name="evil13"><mark>evil</mark></a>, we shall regard it as a great general one. We consider it as an established fact that the <a name="disease12"><mark>disease</mark></a> in our i country is in its main. characteristics the same as that which has- wrought such desolation in Great Britain. and parts of Europe. It will be unnecessary therefore to examine it separately in our own country 3 as our object is :to condensed some of the most prominent facts :and reasonings on thecid127) subject which have been published since our last report, in which we brought together a vast mass of statements respecting its appearance both at home and abroad.

In the Royal Agricultural Society of England, Dr. Salver t sustains the view with respect to variety of diseases as followsSThere appear to be three or four specifically different diseases to which the popular name "potato <a name="disease16"><mark>disease</mark></a>" is applied, viz 1. The one to be seen in every potato warehouse, attacking the end of the potato t@ which the connecting cord is attached and extending along the circumference or outside, the diseased portions remaining dry rather than moist 2. The one commencing in the internal part of the bulb, which becomes so much hardened on being boiled. The internal <a name="disease17"><mark>disease</mark></a> is indicated first by stains on the skin of the potato, seen more distinctly on its being immersed in water; the tubes are quickly de composed, become soft moist, of a dark color, but without disagreeable odor. .  3. The <a name="disease18"><mark>disease</mark></a> in which the fedor is exceedingly offensive, the specimens exhibiting both external and internal ravages of the <a name="disease19"><mark>disease</mark></a> 4. A <a name="disease20"><mark>disease</mark></a>, in which the potato appeared, in the early stages, tobefiiim and sound, but its substance becomes fluctuating and yields to external pressure as the <a name="disease21"><mark>disease</mark></a> advances. In being broken, the potato, though apparently sound, round und to contain a cavity at its centre filled with a fluid matter, which, on escaping, evolves a most intolerable stench n observations it is desirable that the distinct <a name="disease22"><mark>disease</mark></a> be designated. A writer of authority deserving regard, mentions that the brown spotted <a name="disease23"><mark>disease</mark></a> is distinct from that of the foetid put presence. These spots, he says, are not <a name="fungus1"><mark>fungus</mark></a>, but a deposit of earthy matter, believed to be s alicia, as they resist the action of the acids, and if the whole tube r had ,been so, it would, have resembled the dry rot of Bavaria in 1830.. The first point on which we propose to cite some facts is the extent of the <a name="disease24"><mark>disease</mark></a>. With reference to geographical limits, it presents some singular results. The area of its operations has been enlarged from year to year. It seems to have made its appearance somewhat in Europe in 1844, possibly in 1843, as it did in the United States. In 1845 it spread over all the northern and middle countries of Europespain, however, was exempt. In Portugal, with one or two exceptions, also, there was scarcely any traces of it, I talk and Sicily, and portions of the south of France, did not suffer. I n 1844, it was somewhat different the south of France, Lombard y, Syria, and Carinthia were visited by the <a name="disease25"><mark>disease</mark></a>. It was also observed in Bermuda, Jamaica, at the Gape of Good Hope, the I s land of It. Helena, the    s land of Weyl on, and at Australia. It is likewise asserted to have been noticed in Bogota, and not unknown in Peru. With respect to the 'year, 1847, we know less, as the results have not yet reached us. In the cases of Portugal, Gape of Good . Hope, and Jamaica, aboveanentioned, the <a name="disease26"><mark>disease</mark></a> prevailed in regard to potatoes which had been imported from England and America. There is another fact which deserves notice as to its extent in respect to the subject of its attack. I t. does not seem to have been confined to the potato. If not the same, something extremely similar, and simultaneously affected various bulbous roots, tu lips, hyacinths, carrots, onions, tomato e sand, in Jamaica, the dams and the cocoa. This latter plant is formed of ahead with leaves and parts proceeding from it like fingers, and the <a name="disease27"><mark>disease</mark></a> is said c to have attacked the head first, the heart of which is converted into x. a. 143 a black pulp, and becomes a hollow tube; the leaves then droop and die, and the growth of the fingers or eat able part stops. There may be an error in attributing this result to the same <a name="disease28"><mark>disease</mark></a>, but it seems to be admitted as the same in the Tendon Gardeners' Chronicle, from whence the fact is derived. In respect to the other vegetables, the fact of the <a name="evil15"><mark>evil</mark></a> being of the same general character, seems to be admitted. It would be more satisfactory, however, had there been similar analyses made of these vegetables. The extent of the <a name="evil16"><mark>evil</mark></a>, as regards its intensity, is likewise worth examining. We have not been able to collect all the statistics on this subject we wished, but one or two facts may give some idea of its magnitude. The extent of the <a name="disease29"><mark>disease</mark></a> in Holland, in 1845, is stated to have been such that out of fifty hectares, (247 1 acres each) 42,000 hectares were attacked, and the <a name="loss22"><mark>loss</mark></a> is estimated at three-fourths of the whole crop. In France that year it was less, though some portions suffered severely. The <a name="loss23"><mark>loss</mark></a> of the crop in I re land for the same year is supposed to have been 8,500 bushels out of every 26,000 bushels, and so nearly one half. The land thus occupied, was estimated at 800,000 acres, the produce at8400000 bushels, half of this, after de ducting seventy-five per cent. for water, 1,767,000,000 lbs, which is equal to 3,612,900 quarters of corn i. e. grain) or 28,903,200 bushels, at sixty-two lbs. per bushel. In value, the <a name="loss24"><mark>loss</mark></a> in I re land for 1845 is computed at 3,500,000, or                            $18,000,000:in- England and Tales at 1,500,000, or   $7,500,000--making, in the whole, at least          $25,500,000. The <a name="evil17"><mark>evil</mark></a> was far greater in 1846, and is estimated, on the lame authority, at 8,000,000 quarters of wheat. In the kingdom i of Russia, according to an article in the Anna len derLandivirthschaft, &c, vol. I X., by Dr. Julius Hunter, the <a name="loss25"><mark>loss</mark></a> could not have been less than one half of the crop, and perhaps more. I instances like the following are mentioned in different districts: In 1844, 15,000 lbs. per morgen, (three fifths acre) in 1845, 6,000-per morgen, commonly ninety to one hundred scheffels, (about one and a half bushels) per morgen; in 1845,forty to fifty scheffels, and twenty-five to thirty scheffels5000 sacks, instead of 11,400, on the same land both years. As to the time or season of its first appearance in England, it may be remarked that it was noticed during the two years 1846 and 1847, quite early among plants raised in frames, &c. In the month of June it is mentioned in some parts. In the Continent, too, the cause above mentioned doubtless exerted some effect in regard to the time it was first to be seen. In the United States, our notices do not seem to have fixed it at as early a date, especially in 1847. The most usual time we have seen particular sized is from the 20th of August to the 1st of September. I This was the case in Paine and New Hampshire, Newburyport, Pawtucket, Springfield in Massachusetts, in all of which it must have been first seen from the 15th to the 25th of August. In -new Work, Maryland, and Ohio previous to the 1st of September. We have been unable to find any collection of these particulars sufficient for a classification of the subject. Some particulars as to its appearance, in addition to those before given, deserve record. W. Johnson, who calls it a gangrene, says, that previous to the final <a name="decay1"><mark>decay</mark></a>, the specific gravity of the diseased potato becomes one third more than that of the healthy tube r on account of the water it contains; when submitted to a dry heat of 200 it loses its moisture and the progress of <a name="decay2"><mark>decay</mark></a> is retarded if it be not stopped. Except in cases where 144 X. it is inoculated also, it appears first at the end connected with the stem. This he considers against the <a name="fungus2"><mark>fungus</mark></a> theory, as in that case the pores would have vegetated first, or at the same time, as also that salt would destroy it, which it does not. The putrid matter is such that even when salt has been applied to it, it will inoculated sound potatoes. Another writer, speaking of its appearance, says that he has examined it closely with a microscope, and that its appearance is of little white oozings, in bunches of eight to forty, or more, connected like bunches of insects eggs, of a conical shaped and of a shiny, icy appearance. These spread and form a mass like little lumps of starch, and, when dry, feel like starch then they <a name="decay3"><mark>decay</mark></a>, and blotches are noticed where they were first observed then succeeds a white <a name="mildew2"><mark>mildew</mark></a> or <a name="fungus3"><mark>fungus</mark></a>, on which the <a name="decay4"><mark>decay</mark></a> goes on very rapidly. These appearances are at the base of the eye of the tube r. Prof. Petzholdt says, the <a name="disease30"><mark>disease</mark></a> commences by a discoloration of the substance of the tubes, with a matter, and then after a time it disappears. The second stage is marked by an odor like old cheese, which disappears in the last stage. When examined by a microscope at first, the fluid in the cells becomes turbid, then a brown matter deposits on the side of 'he cells, which ire gradually destroyed; the fluid then eva pirates, and the tube r becomes hard and dry. In the early stage of the <a name="disease31"><mark>disease</mark></a> the proportion of water and organic matter is large, *nd of starch is less than usual. The ashes of the diseased tubes being examined, are found to contain less all ali, sulphuric acid and chlorine, but more phosphorus acid and magnetic, than of the healthy ones. He describes the nature of the <a name="disease32"><mark>disease</mark></a> to -be an increased formation ofazotized matters, and a diminished production of more agonized organic matter. In fixing the causes, he gives as the fundamental one, a preponderance offiagnesia and phosphorus acid over the proportion of alkalies and chlorine and 'sulphuric acid. In addition he supposes that there are accidental or s 1 in causes, which are unknown to us. His remedy is a new system of maturing by supplying the deficient substances to the plant. There are some interesting facts stated by different individuals, respecting, experiments tried by them and which as they do not admit of any general classification may ve noticed here. A sound potato was, tied against the diseased part of an unsound one and placed on the cellar floor. In a month the sound one was not affected thinking the skin might hinder it, the experimenter removed it and placed them as before; in the course of two or three months they were again examined; the diseased one was thoroughly <a name="rotten1"><mark>rotten</mark></a>, the healthy one sound still, and although several minute specks of the <a name="fungus4"><mark>fungus</mark></a> showed their attachment to the potato, they could no enter more than the for teeth part of an inch. This the experimenter considered evidence that the <a name="fungus5"><mark>fungus</mark></a> could not make its way am ring the cellular tissue of the tube r just a sit chose, but must wait to have its sprouts circulated with the plant in vegetation. This done, the the work of destruction is easy. Another experiment is given :the potatoes were all carefully selected, put into garden pots with their several mixtures covered over with moss, and then buried one foot six inches deep in the ground, except Los. 10 and 11,which were laid on the ground. The experiment began on the 3d of September, and they were examined on the 13th of October. The result was as follow six. a. No. September 3d. Mixture 1 5 sound potatoes. L .2 5 do 1 diseased.

All sound 5 sound 1 diseased. All got worse 5 sound 5 sound 1 diseased. All very badly diseased. In Los. 2, 4, 6 and 8, where a diseased potato was placed in the midst of sound ones, there was not the slightest indication of the <a name="disease33"><mark>disease</mark></a> being propagated by contact, except in To 6, one potato appeared a little diseased, but not at the point of contact with the diseased potato, so that probably the <a name="disease34"><mark>disease</mark></a> had commenced unnoticed, before the potatoes were selected, for several instances have occurred to the experimenter, which prove conclusively, that contact with diseased potatoes des not produce <a name="disease35"><mark>disease</mark></a> in sound healthy tubes. Those in No. 12, which were mixed with a small quantity of carbonate of ammonia were all much diseased. This induced the suspicion that the <a name="disease36"><mark>disease</mark></a> was caused by a superabundance of ammonia in the atmosphere. ,the following experiment was tried for the purpose of ascertaining this point. In the thirteenth of October, five sound potatoes were put into a jar which had had carbonate of ammonia in it, and smelt very strongly of the substance, also five sound potatoes in another jar of the same size; they were covered up closely and placed in a pine stove. In the 17th they were examined and those in the jar with carbonate of ammonia were all diseased, while those in the other jar were sound. Two of the diseased potatoes were taken out of the jar of carbonate of ammonia, and laid on a shelf in a pine stove. Green tops of healthy potatoes were at the same time put into both jars. In the 19th, they were examined, when those in the jar with carbonate of ammonia showed appearance of <a name="disease37"><mark>disease</mark></a>, but in the other jar, there was no difference. In the 22d those in the carbonate were all quite black, looking as the potato fields did in August and September, while the leaves of those in the sound jar only became yellowish, as if from natural <a name="decay5"><mark>decay</mark></a>. The editor of the London Gardeners' Chronicle, gives a curious fact from his own observation. He received a specimen of old potatoes of 1845, (this was in 1846) which had been accidentally put away in a box of shavings, and kept in a dry place, where they formed internal tubes which by degrees burst through the skin. They were placed on a library table and remained there a month apparently healthy, and gradually became green and purple. But in a few weeks they were found to be attacked by the true potato <a name="disease38"><mark>disease</mark></a>, and when cut acquired rapidly a deep brown color. To hung i appeared on them till long after they were attacked, and then the species was not the bory tis. In an experiment by another person, a garden frame was placed over two plants in a hot- old and preserved there free, while the rest suffered. On10146 X. taking off the light the very next morning, they were found spotted in their leaf. Some potatoes were planted with manure incorporated with the whole of the soil, and others with manure placed above and below the tubes. The former had not one delayed potato in fifty, the latter at least one in ten. In another experiment the manure in one case was spread over the whole ground, at one end of the rows, and at the other end placed with the sets in the trenches. The abundance of diseased potatoes in the latter portion when dug, showed to a foot, where the change of cultivation began. A singular fact is stated with reference to some potatoes, which were selected for seed and hung up in a sack in a dry room. Some months after, when wanted, the sack was opened and it was found that they had vegetated, and many of the young potatoes were as large as walnuts and as much diseased as any part of the crops grown on the land. This somewhat resembles the case heretofore mentioned in one of our reports, of a potato left in the cupboard, which also vegetated and was diseased, and ,forms one of those anomalies of which Air Charles Lemon says this <a name="disease39"><mark>disease</mark></a> exhibits, more than any other he ever knew. As it is desirable that the aspect of the <a name="disease40"><mark>disease</mark></a>, when subjected to examination, in different countries should be compared, we therefore quote the statements of some men of science in the various countries where it hasprevailedProfessor Hers ten, of Freiberg, thus sums up his description of the results of his own experiments. We translate it for the purpose, from the Landwirthschlaftliche Dorfzeitung, (agricultural Village Gazette) ofLSbe. He says: "the new <a name="disease41"><mark>disease</mark></a>, at least in its first stages, is characterized by a decomposition or a chemical change of the cellular tissue, or of the starch y fibrous matter of the sound potatoes. This cellular tissue, by unknown causes and operations becomes changed into a brown substance, insoluble in water, but so ruble in alkalies. In the. alkaline solution, by means of dilute mineral acids, it is deposited in the form of brown, light scales, the essential properties of which, are like those of humid acid, or a modification of hum us. The outer, thick or concentric layers of the single grains of starch meal, appear to be first de composed in the progress of the <a name="disease42"><mark>disease</mark></a> by which means the inner ones are brought into direct contact with the diseased cellular tissue and then gradually undergo a change and decomposition. This <a name="disease43"><mark>disease</mark></a>, in its first stages especially, dissolves the fibrous cellular tissue of the potato tubes, and the destruction of the grains of starch meal is probably a consequence of this decomposition or change, so that the name of cellular <a name="rot9"><mark>rot</mark></a>, given by Professor Putting, of Nordhausen' is a very distinctive and appropriate one. Any of the French and Belgium chemists, have mentioned that the grains of starch meal suffer no change or destruction. My observations in in y experiments are directly contradictory to this, as well as Professor Cuttings. He maintains that in the last stage of this <a name="disease44"><mark>disease</mark></a> the whole potato tube r passes into a putrefactive ferment at ion, and becomes changed into a <a name="rotten2"><mark>rotten</mark></a> fluid substance Professor Alum considers the <a name="disease45"><mark>disease</mark></a> to be an accumulation of the un elaborated juices, or a general dropsy of the plant. "I t cannot be a deter i oration, as it is produced in new seed introduced from America. It has its origin, probably, in the moist and in constant weather, which operated injuriously, especially about the time of the formation of the starch meal x. C.

Professor Alum frequently had occasion to observe, in Cava, the same <a name="disease46"><mark>disease</mark></a> which usually is seen in moist high ridges, as it now less attacks potatoes on 'dry sandy soils. Dr. Conrad Schafer, professor of botany in the university, Griefswalde, in a treatise on the subject, after describing the appearance of the <a name="disease47"><mark>disease</mark></a>, in which he differs from Professor Hers ten, as to the decomposition of the grains of starch meal, as signs the following as the cause of the <a name="disease48"><mark>disease</mark></a>, which we also translate from his treatise on the subject: "the internal cause of the <a name="disease49"><mark>disease</mark></a> lies, as I am convinced, in an imperfect process of assimilation This, the watery cellular juices in excess indicate, which, in a regular and perfect exercise of the power of assimilation, would have been converted into solid substance; further, also, the fact is seen from the recent crude cells which have not come to the development, and which exist in the outer most layers of the tissue; and finally, the same thing is most decisively shown by the great liability to the attack of the cellular skin, which, in the <a name="rot10"><mark>rot</mark></a> of the stem especially, undergoes decomposition. This tendency to decomposition of the cellular membrane, also clearly shows that the otherwise sound potatoes, this year, easily run intothe dry rot, in the wounded places in every case of being cut in hoping, or becoming mouse eaten, &c; while, at other times, a simple crust is formed on the drying up of the place wounded, or the common wet <a name="rot11"><mark>rot</mark></a> intervenes, which the cellular substance resists the longest. -Usual lithe perfectly developed cellular substance belongs to the most insoluble an- undecomposable vegetable substances that are assimilated The opinion of count Aspirin, an eminent French scientific agriculturists, is, that the potato <a name="disease50"><mark>disease</mark></a> is a sort of vegetable cholera. He mentions, that in the south of Europe two crops of potatoes are obtained in one year. The first crop is planted in March and harvested in June; the second is planted in July, after the wheat is cut, and taken up in October. The first of these crops was absolutely sound; the second was diseased. The following table is given by him as to the state of the weather in 1845, to which his observations now referred to relate First Drop. Second Drop 1845. Usual mean. 1845. Usual mean.

M. Aspirin concludes, that no customarymeteorological phenomena can have e been the cause; and, that those who rely :on. such an explanation must have recourse to conjectures v which there: is no possibility of verifying, in short, that in this case, as sin that -of 'the (cid127Asiatic cholera, methodology is : incapable of explaining the :cause. Proflindley, from: whose magazine we have taken i the above, though ;an -advocate for an atmospheric origin of the .<a name="disease51"><mark>disease</mark></a>, says in view of count Gasparn: A s We are .afraid that count Aspirin is right, &c. Mr. Line, however, a gentleman distinguished !for lhiskuowlf he of imteorI  log y, &c. adopts the view, that there was some thin in the atmosphere which specifically caused the diseases ease e bases his- opinion on the following reasons: .1 It is. well ascertained that in 1845. and 1846, other plants and shrub s were affected, simultaneously, with the potato. This was the .more remarkable, as in the year 1846, from the fine ness of the season, ,the .vegetation was too, luxuriant, and. while in. 1846 these t effects on shrubs, and even a trees, ere :noticed in both high lands and liowlnds of Scotland, in. 184 they were not observed in the high lands, where during that year theepoatodisage was likewise unknown, Acid 127) I The pair ta f the potatoes, and -other plants affected, were those ex, posed to the air 3, The only cases where the potato plants were generally saved, were either ,hen the tops had been cut- off or pulled up, before the plants became diseased, or where they had been effectually screened from the blowing on them of the external air. He quoted many cases, In which potatoes covered with cabbages, I indian corn, tall weeds in gardens, and ,frames. and in outhouses, where there was no draught of air had been preserved. I n some instances where a pane of glass had been broken from n a frame, the potatoes near it exposed. to the air at once became spotted, while the others at a distance and unexposed were not affected. Articular fields, also, wereinentioned where the streaks or parallel bends of the <a name="blight1"><mark>blight</mark></a> were found to coincide with the direction of the wind, and to have been produced by single hedge row trees on the wind ward side of the fields. Assuming this to be a true account of the source or origin i, K; Mihienext describes its nature or properties thus: By elaborate meteoriologicat tables he demonstrated that it could not be ascribed to the ordinary elements of the weather. As .to humidity to which it is attributed by Prof, Parting and other sait couldMnotbe attributed to this, because in England, i, 1845;the quantity of rain which fell where the <a name="disease52"><mark>disease</mark></a> was the worst) was rather less thaicid127) usual, and in the high lands (where the <a name="disease53"><mark>disease</mark></a> didn it then a p, pear) rather more than usual) and the moisture suspended wasTrrather less than usual all over Great Britain. There had been many t years in which there was much more rain and moisture than in 1845. Is to the l temperature it is true that in 1845, in England, it had been 5 to 7 degrees, andfinScotlafnd 2 to 3 degrees less than the average, yet when it w si considered that the potato grew equally well: in Ark ney; with and average tfemperatreof 46 degrees, and in the south of England- with an average temperature of 8 degrees, it was evident that it could stand miuchgriatet variations of temperature than he occurred tit 1845; and this tha0ywa put- o^ let l $ X. Toe. To. 54.149to rest by the weather of 1846 which in Great Britain during the summer months was from 3 to 4 degrees warmer than the average- If this atmospheric agent w as not to be identified with any of the ordinary elements of the weather, the only alternative was, that it was some foreign matter diffused through the atmosphere. Mr. Line supposed it to be some compound organic body, capable of being neutralised in its noxious effects by certain gases. In support of this view he instanced the case of potatoes untouched in the vicinity of the copper works- where the copious fumes of sulphur out and arsenic us acids over spread the fields so as to <a name="blight2"><mark>blight</mark></a> the pastures, and others neardimeinsldsand that in some places along the sea shore they were attacked not as soon These various gases he supposed; by their antiseptic properties exerted a saying influence. He likewise inferred that this. deleterious matter was heavier than atmospheric air, because the low grounds w eergnerally first affected, and this could did not be because they were the wet test, as in the best drained lands the <a name="disease54"><mark>disease</mark></a> was the worst, The presence of fogs which gave out a sulphurousodor previous to the appearance of the <a name="disease55"><mark>disease</mark></a> or simultaneous i with it was also mentioned in proof of his view. He drew, therefore, the conclusion that the atmosphere in 1845 and 1846,had over a large part of the earths surface, been impregnated by some subtle or lightly comminuted matter of a nature to be injurious to particular plants. Dr. Christison some years since showed by experiments th. sulphurouschlorine and certain other gases when mixed even in so minute a quantity as not to be perceive able by the smell, would injure and ultimately kill plants and it was interesting- to observe that the effects thus produced by artificial means were precisely similar to what occurred in 1845 and 1846, the injury being first shown by spots on the leaves, and then descending by thefootstalks. This coincidence is the more remarkable as one of the gases operated with (the sulphur out) is heavier than atmospheric air, and -might therefore have, been expected to have .attacked the stems before the leaves. Mr. Line adds, that if the foregoing theory is correct, it might be presumed that the matter impregnating the atmosphere would be to some extent injurious to animal life. This, he states, is verified by the experience of the years 1845 and 1846. During both years there prevailed pulmonary complaints among mankind, and also among cattle and sheep, to a much greater extent than usual. The mortality of England and Tales had for the three months ending September, 1846, exceeded by 30 per cent. the average of the same quarter during the eight years in which the registration of deaths had been carried on; and in some counties the mortality had be et, double what is now stated. As to the origin of this noxious matter it was he said impossible to conjecture. It could not be of local origin, judging from the great extent to which it prevailed. It appeared to have moved over the part of the earth s surface where he was in Great Britain in the year 1846, i a a direction from. W. to N. E. judging by the dates of its arrival at different places, the streaks of <a name="blight3"><mark>blight</mark></a> in fields and the sides of plants first affected. If his views were correct, he said the failure of the potato plant for two years in succession seemed to show that the atmosphere had become unsuited to its cultivation. Mr. 'lines views above given are entitled to consideration, and the argaitents by which they are supported are at .east characterized b, much 150 X. 
plausibility. His theory too, if the fact of such a mi as ma were established, would account for many appearances, and perhaps more of the anomalies of the potato <a name="disease56"><mark>disease</mark></a> than any other. They would also agree with the chemical analyses perhaps in almost all cases. It would be interesting, were the experiment to be made with some of the gases he has mentioned on the potato in growth, to see if it would produce the same state of the plant and tube, which is found by microscopic investigation and analysis to be the case in the diseased potatoes. It may be here mentioned that there are several instances in which a striking coincidence of a heavy and insalubrious fog was immediately followed by the spotted appearance of the potatoes. Dr. Hemp in the opinions expressed by him to the Cambridge Philosophical Society, as also to the British association for the advancement of science, considers it as a deduction from his analyses that the nature of the morbid affection in the potato tube r, consists in an abnormal tendency to premature generation. He maintains also, that the truth of this deduction of his, is proved by the progress of the growth of the tube r. An opinion has been advanced with' much pretension by Mr. Me e, a Fellow of the Royal Society, attributing the <a name="disease57"><mark>disease</mark></a> under consideration to the attacks of an insect which he names the a his vast at or. This insect, he contents, sucks out the juices of the plant, and he grounds his opinion on the fact that the a his is found on the potato plant; that it multiplied very fast; that it punctures the leaves; that it fills the air with its myriads and that where the insect has damaged the leaf of the plant, the same is much influenced by wet weather; that the first appearance of the <a name="disease58"><mark>disease</mark></a> in a healthy and previously damaged plant is always subsequent to the visit of the destroyed, and the amount is directly proportionate to the number of insects \which take away the vital fluid of the plant. This theory, were the grounds even stronger than they are, would still be utterly irreconcilable with many of the facts which have been observed. But the pretended facts are many of them incorrect. <a name="rotten3"><mark>Rotten</mark></a> potatoes and even those in all the stages of the <a name="disease59"><mark>disease</mark></a> have been observed without the appearance of this insect. Another writer too, who claims to have made a minute investigation of the diseased potatoes by the aid of a powerful microscope, asserts that so far from the a his preying upon the potato, this insect actually seizes the <a name="fungus6"><mark>fungus</mark></a> which is found in the potato so diseased. The whole account is interesting, but we ha e not time to pursue it to the length it might need. The theory which maintains the <a name="fungus7"><mark>fungus</mark></a> to be the cause of the <a name="evil18"><mark>evil</mark></a>, and which was perhaps the prevailing theory a: the time of our last report, is less confided in at the present time. It has had many able advocates, among them were Professor Dorr en of Siege, and the Rev. M. J. Berkeley of England, distinguished for his knowledge of the hung i, and some of thescientic men in our own country. But the further investigations seem to have shown that the bory tis infestans Which was the <a name="fungus8"><mark>fungus</mark></a> supposed, is by no means the only one which is found in the diseased potatoes, for as many as seven different kinds are mentioned. This, therefore renders it improbable that the supposed <a name="fungus9"><mark>fungus</mark></a> could have occasioned the <a name="disease60"><mark>disease</mark></a>. It is likewise rejected, for the reason that salt which is known to be destructive to the hung i tribe, and especially to the supposed one, does not destroy the power of the diseased matter. I instances are cited in which the diseased substance after salt has been applied, has been tried successfully togEx. a. 151 inoculated the sound potato. Again, no <a name="fungus10"><mark>fungus</mark></a> has ever been found on a sound and healthy potato, but in all instances the parasite is found in a state of the substance of the plant that has undergone a change. It is not denied bit fully admitted that <a name="fungus11"><mark>fungus</mark></a> is a most common attendant or consequent of the <a name="disease61"><mark>disease</mark></a>, though it is asserted and apparently on good authority, that the <a name="disease62"><mark>disease</mark></a> sometimes exists where there is no sign of the <a name="fungus12"><mark>fungus</mark></a>. It wound seem, therefore, that the hung i, like the insects which are found in the diseased plants, are not its cause; and we are left to conjecture still what may be the source of the <a name="malady1"><mark>malady</mark></a>. Though we are in the dark as much as ever, and perhaps may never be able to ascertain the true source of the <a name="evil19"><mark>evil</mark></a>, still very considerable advance has been made in the progress of the knowledge with reference, to its character. The origin is unknown; but many suppositions have been dis proved. The numerous experiments which have been made have shown that it was not merely owing to the deter i oration of the plant by excessive cultivation; for the <a name="disease63"><mark>disease</mark></a> has affected those which have been imported from the original country of the potato, as well as needling varieties. It the same time it would seem that the constituents of the plant must have some influence, for some varieties are far more susceptible than others. There are some points which appear to be established that early planting has generally been most successful, that dry, light soils, un manured ground, especially such as has been recently burned over and broken up, are the best. In some instances planting corn or sowing barley with the potatoes has proved favorable. The effect of charcoal, lime, t an, bark, &c, has in many cases, proved very useful. Such learning has been brought to bear on the investigation of the <a name="evil20"><mark>evil</mark></a> and many of the treatises on the subject display no little a lumen, and furnish valuable information respecting the history of the plant and its internal structure. One of the best things on this subject we have seen is the microscopical examination of the whole plant, in a sound and healthy state compared with the diseased one, by the veteran mycologist, Word a. This is a very admirable article and is illustrated by colored plates, and perhaps may hereafter be translated and laid before the American public. The treatises of Petzholdt, Albert and I s en lee, May en, Parting and of or. Hunter are also interesting and contain much val table information. These likewise are illustrated with plates. Among those who have written with ability on the subject in Greatbritain, are Professors Kindly, Johnston, Lay fair, Messrs. Line, Berkleyand many others. The condensed summary contained in the Transactions of the High land and Agricultural Society of Scotland, of the state of the <a name="disease64"><mark>disease</mark></a> in Scotland is worthy of careful perusal by those who wish to study the aspect of the <a name="disease65"><mark>disease</mark></a> in that country. At the meeting of the Royalagricultural Society of England, and the numerous county associations and farmers' clubs, there have been likewise able and thorough discussions by men of the first science in Great Britain, as well as facts presented by practical agriculturists, which are embodied in the various agricultural journals of that country. Professors Daubeny, Men slow and From berg have directed to the subject their chemical knowledge, and the result of their investigations likewise have been given to the public. The article furnished by Professor From berg, on the chemical investigation of the potato to the Ran actions of the High land and Agricultural Society of Scotland, and for which he received the premium of that society of fifty sovereigns, contains a vast 152 X. number of valuable facts, relating to the analyses of the. sound and diseased potatoes and will well repay the perusal. In France, Netherlands, Holland, Austria, Belgiuni and Russia likewise, the subject has been presented at the societies of the learned and at the conventions of agriculturists ; and the reports and discussions: exhibit a minuteness of examination characteristic of the 'science of the men engaged in it one directing his attention to one branch and another to another, but combining to furnish the most ample presentation of the varied facts, and elucidateing many points in relation to different bearings of the whole question on national and individual welfare. The following queried which were published in an English journal in 1846, embody many valuable suggestions, and as they present the various theories which have been adopted in a small compass, and touch upon the arguments by which they are supported, may perhaps be use fully quoted here: We omit the first section as of no practical value.

In this country the majority of the cases where the tubes. are first affected, would probably be against it while 2. Those in which it appeared first in the leaves would give the predominance to the hung i; and if we add, 3. The Belgium and Vanish reports, in which the <a name="disease72"><mark>disease</mark></a> is attributed entirely to the hung i, the majority will be large on that side. In the other hand, 4. It is certain that in many cases, the <a name="decay6"><mark>decay</mark></a> has appeared before, and even without <a name="fungus14"><mark>fungus</mark></a> of any kind; nor can the tendency to precious growth, as above, (C. 4,) be attributed to <a name="fungus15"><mark>fungus</mark></a>. The results of the investigation into the infectious character of the <a name="rot12"><mark>rot</mark></a> are not less conflicting, o far as regards the tubes; but in the leaves and stems. 5.

Other plants allied to the night shade family, though without tubes, (as the tomato, &c) have taken the <a name="disease73"><mark>disease</mark></a> this season; nor is it even confined to such species. Will not a general review and comparison of the cases, (rather too complex to sum up, in one sentence) lead to the inference that the <a name="fungus16"><mark>fungus</mark></a> is generated by the <a name="disease74"><mark>disease</mark></a> in the struggle between the vital and material forces; that it becomes a symptom and a medium of infection by contact and even by aerial communication. Soilslast season the <a name="disease75"><mark>disease</mark></a> appeared worst on rich, wet and heavy soils, and least on those which were dry, gravely and petty; but this year, when the infectious s pawn is likely to have been carried in the sap, we; hear. less of this distinction. The facts, however, as well as reason, warrant us in regarding dry and antiseptic soils as least predisposing toputrefactionThe above summary seems to be a fair view of the case as it stood in 1846. Since then there has been but little change, except that probably the <a name="fungus17"><mark>fungus</mark></a> theory has lost ground, and the minds of men seem to have settled down to regard it as an inexplicable phenomenon, existing in a variety of conditions, in different degrees of intensity, and affected more or less by a vast number of circumstances, and for which, as yet, no sure remedy has been found. Various precautions and applications seem to aid in lessening its effects at times, which at others are utterly vain. Perhaps the most prevailing view is one similar to that of Count Aspirin or Mr. Line, as mentioned above, though even this is embarrassed with difficulties. We may embody the result of the examination we have been able to make into the aspect of the <a name="disease76"><mark>disease</mark></a> in our own and other countries, in something like the following 1. There is probably some prevailing gen eric cause, which lies at the bottom of the <a name="evil21"><mark>evil</mark></a>, and produces the peculiar similar i ties that are observed 2. This admits, however, of local subdivisions or subordinate causes, which produces the dissimilarities which seem so irreconcilable with each other 154 X, 3. These local or subordinate causes also exert a modifying influence on the developments of the gen eric cause 4. The gen eric cause, whatever it may be, is most extensive, as to the region of the earth, climate, soil, modes of culture, variety of potatoes, time of appearance; since it more or less affects the fruit in all these respects 5. There are certain usual attendants or accidents of the <a name="disease77"><mark>disease</mark></a>, which are sometimes confounded with its causes, but which rather sustain the relation of coincident results 6. Among the effects produced by the gen eric cause, are chemical changes, developed by chemical analysis and structural and physiological ones developed by microscopic investigation 7. There are numerous well at tested facts, which seem to admit of no classification, but stand comparatively isolated 8. There are certain remedies which seem to be useful, yet cannot be considered un failing or entirely successful at all times 9. The <a name="evil22"><mark>evil</mark></a> is fluctuating even in the same regions, and its progress is hastened or retarded by the state of temperature and the season generally 10. To one of the theories which have been presented appear to meet all the difficulties of the case, and time only can show what is to be its effect on the question whether the cultivation of the potato is to be continued or must be abandoned. As yet the latter alternative does not seem to be demanded. While there is much to discourage, there is also somewhat to encourage. Some sections of our country which have heretofore been visited, have apparently recovered, and this year furnish no complaints of the <a name="evil23"><mark>evil</mark></a> before experienced. In our Appendix will be found some of the views of correspondents and others, but we have not chosen to enlarge upon them. We could say scarcely less on a subject which is certainly an engrossing one in many countries. We regret that a sort of despair as to further investigation seems to have taken hold of the minds of most of our farmers, and hence they have become less attentive to examine and report facts. Still it would be well to watch the progress of the <a name="disease78"><mark>disease</mark></a>, and by instituting new experiments to throw any additional light which might be obtained into the common fund, for the benefit of all. As we have suggested the propriety of continuing observations and experiments relating to the potato <a name="disease79"><mark>disease</mark></a>, it may be useful also to suggest some points towards which the attention should be directed. It may be that every one, if not able to give his attention to all the subjects of inquiry, yet may notice some one or more, and by the combination of those in the same vicinity something may be effected. It is important, then, that the following particulars be noted. 1. Soil, kind, and where practicable, an analysis of its constituent and chemical peculiarities 2. Situation, or lay of the land, high or low, general exposure, &c 3. Condition dry or moist, new or old in cultivation; timbered or prairie previous, and where practicable, geological peculiarities.

In connection with the character of the <a name="disease80"><mark>disease</mark></a>, the question deserves notice how far it appears to have been propagated from the seed tubes or dependent thereupon, and condition of the old sets, and if any unusual changes had taken place 2. It would be well likewise if various compounds were tried, such as might be conjectured to constitute the gases that might operate in the atmosphere, and then effect on the plant and tube r noted. Among the substitutes for the potato, are the application of a great variety of other vegetable products, in combination with flour, to the making of bread' "numerous experiments are related of this kind, many of which have been successful. Scarcely any of the esculents have not been resorted to. The be et, carrot i turn in, have been mixed in various proportions with the usual flour paste, and excellent specimens of bread produced. To quote the descriptions would fill too much space, and probably could be of little use to the 'people of our country, as it is scarcely to be imagined they will be exposed to the necessity of using them. The nutrition qualities of these vegetables, as well as of beans and peas, have been accurately investigated, and the results are valuable156Ex. a. Hay. Although this crop was included in the returns of the census in all the states, yet in quite a number of them there is very little attention: paid to the cultivation of grass, and the hay mention t is i nothing more :than the product of the wild uncultivated, grasses, which grow, spontaneously and clothe the fields and prairies. This fact renders it difficult to from anpinionrespecting the amount. The cultivated crop is confined principally to the New England and middle states, with one or two of the northwestern ones. The season, on the whole, appears to have been .favorable to the production f hay. Thechangewhich .occurred in May and in June brought forward the grass very rapidly, and the warm weather, which allowed its being well cut and .p red, no: doubt very considerably enhanced not only the quantity. but the qu it y ,of the crop, so :that :the, hay was sweeter and more; nutftious than often times is the case. I ukraine it is estimated at from ten; to twenty-five per cent. more, and the, average crop is thought .to have been: fro one to one, aid of all tonspepacre, though sometimes three or more tons a ire raised. I thepreviusisatiate, of, hay in this state, we, have corrected an error which has reducedtheampurntfromi845, though it is a regular advance since the census. I new Hampshire, also, the increase is given as about twenty per cent. more in some sections on account of the good season. The same was probably the case, in the other New England .states, though in parts f these states there may have been a deficiency. The general average product may be    red at about one ton to two tons per acre. The reports from the state of New York also are favorable the increase is estimated variously from ten per cent. to twenty, twenty-five, and even fifty percent. The usual average as given, is about one, one and :a half, or two tons per acre. The crop of the year 1845, it will be recollected, was a short one, having fallen off from that of the preceding one. The accounts respecting the appearance of the hay crop in Pennsylvania are somewhat conflicting. I n: one section there is represented to have been some decrease owing to the drought and cold spring, in others it was supposed there may have been some ten, twenty, or thirty per: cent, increase. The crop of 1845 was a poor, one, and, compared wit it, we believe that the crop of 1847 was an increase deed e. As we proceed on towards the south we believe that there was some gain, though we find the usual fluctuation is. Ohio cultivates a moderate quantity of hay compared with other crops, aid while in some of the counties there was a partial falling off from drought, yet taking the whole state the reports furnished are favorable, and in some instances the increase is supposed to have been twenty or twenty-five percent. more than in 1845, and the average crop rates from one and a half to two tons per acre. The hay crop of I n diana has probably been rated too high, if we include only cultivated hay, as seems to have been the case in the census returns as for %one years we have included the amount also cut from the natural prairies, it would be best for the sake of better comparison to refer again back to the corrected returns of the census as a basis, and in so doing we must of course lessen the hay crop of I n diana, as well as the aggregate for the whole United States. This fact also should be taken into consideration x. a. 157 in any future conparisonrof our tabular estimates. I The hay crop of I n diana arid I illinois- with scarcely an. exception, appears to have been a good oe, and in comparison of the crop of 1845, there was an increase of twenty, twenty-five, thirty, or fifty per cut. ; By one, in certain sections, it is: sets r high as three or four times larger. In Michihiganlkewise, the crop of hay is 'reported to h have been in good one, and in some i- cases u by e that of 1845. It is a crop, however, that excites much less interest tfancid127m anycid127otiers, and therefore t is difficult to form any vcid127ery accurate judgment up seclrti it ' I n the whole g aggregate of the :united States, your impression is, it will h e found to .he been .a better crop than that of 1845, though .probably the increase will not be very large. 'he have also; in some cases, modified our, for er estimates by a renewed reference to, the census returns so thattheremiaybe some variation in the column From what there would otherwise have been. It will be recollected that mention was made of the tss act g pass f; theFillkland I s lands, in one of the former reports of this voice. t appears now that attempts have been made to cultivate it, ii Not land, with~ state of the Duke of Richmondanrd they were successful whncid127sown in pe at. Another successful experiment, in I re laid: is j mentioned (cid127ithe, t I rishFarmers' Journal, and the person by whom it was tried remarks: : I -l : ve no longer any doubt of the tu s sac grass being freely introduced within a short period." In the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of 'nail and, is likewise a letter from the governor of the Talk land I s lands took  rdPmilerston which speaks very highly of the capabilities of it is plant. t is relished by cattle and horses, -and although of slow :growth being three years in coming to perfection, yet could be cut annually. It grows to the height of seven feet by the end of summer, though cut in the spring after it has once 'reached 'its maturity. A plate is also: given in the work referred to illustrating the appearance of the plant. In a letter of the On. He my A. Rise, late minister to Brazil, to the Commissioner of Patents, and published in the Union some time since, he speaks of a species of grass called c. ca pine" which constitutes the chief green food of the Brazilian horses and cattle, the main value of which he states is, that it stands the drought in a hot climate and sandy soil. I to grows in rich soil to an immense height; single s talks or tufts reaching as high as. seven or eight feet. But usually it grows three or four feet high, and is then cropped. It is perennial and not allowed to seed. As soon a scut, the stubble is hold into the ground, and it springs anew from the joints. Of    t is succulent and fibrous, and yields a large volume 'of grass, is not good for cured hay, nor very nutritions, but it is excellent to supply green food in a hot and dry climate, on a low, dry, and sandy soil. ;he felt sure it would be of great importance in, the, southern portions of the United States, but was not sure that it is not there already. North, it would- require to be sown every spring and summer. In the tropics it is perennial, and takes root from the joints like our wire grass. It has a long and broad leaf and is very luxuriant. It would not be good hay, but would be, as he thinks, fine for green food, and for green dropping and living. A species of grass is mentioned in the account given of the meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, on the 12th of May last, which is called the alike c lover. It is described under the name of trifolium hybridum, m as being indigenous in Sweden, where for the last hundred years it has been cultivated in the native pastures of that country, and in some instances it has been known to grow to the height of five feet there, though 158 X. in England it reaches to that only of two feet. The roots are fibrous and the heads globular. It more resembles the white than the red c lover, and maybe described as a giant white c lover, with flesh colored flowers. It yields two mowings annually. Linnaeus noticed it growing in poor, bare; obdurate c lays, where no other plant could be made to ve get ate; but even there this c lover is said to have flourished with uncommon luxuriant e, and yielded shoots as tender and succulent, though not so abundant, as if reared in the most richly manured fields. Turn says, that he tried its cultivation along with that of a great number of other c lovers, placed under the same circumstances, and the result convinced him that there is no other kind of c lover equal to it for feeding cattle. Erhardt also mentions it as very valuable for cattle and sheep. It is further stated, that if the soil is in a good condition, a field of this c lover will last many years in prime, though it will be necessary every other year to bring on a moderate coat of manure. When once this plant is established, it will remain for many years in full vigor, and produce annually a great quantity of herb age of excellent quality. The best method of feeding the alike c lover is either by mowing it for hay, cutting it occasionally as green food for live stock, or feeding it down with oxen or sheep. In the first mode a large quantity of good hay may be procured at a small expense or trouble; the crop in this case must be mown as soon as the heads are in full bloom, and before they begin to turn brown or die away. When the leaves of the lower part of the plant turn yellow, <a name="decay7"><mark>decay</mark></a> and drop off, the crop should be cut as soon as possible, for by standing longer the plant will lose more at the bottom than it will gain at the top. This is usually about the middle of June, and it is better always to cut it too early than too late. When the alike c lover is sown without crops of any other -kind, the seed may be put in any time between March and the latter end of August, but with grain it must depend on the time such a crop is sown. The quantity of seed required is from ten to fifteen I is. per acre. This will produce many tons annually of good herb age, besides the ,supply of seed. It is said, also, that it bears transplanting, so that at the end of two or three years it may be taken up and planted elsewhere. It is merely divided and the fibrous roots a little cut with a p runing knife. It does not suffer from the severe st frosts, nor is the foliage injured by them; freezing weather merely suspends its growth; its propagation may be greatly extended, and it will flourish in the most barren land where very few glasses will grow. It would seem that the advantages of this plant are such that it might he worth a trial in our country. We are not aware, however, that it has been attempted.  As the attempt is making to procure some of the seed, it is hoped the office may be able to distribute it in time for experiments among our enterprising agriculturists. The have placed in our appendix, No. 6, an interesting extract from Dr. Thomsons work on the "' Good of Animals" &c, in which he furnishes an explanation of the theory of hay making. It will be seen that, alluding to the composition of rye grass, before and after ripe king, he says: I t should be the object with the farmer to cut grass for hay at that period when the largest amount of matter, so ruble in water, sugar, &c, is contained in it. This is before its seeing, for then wood y matter predominates. The second point is, after it is cut, to dry the grass so as to preserve the solublepart as much as possible. By a course of experiments it is found that a large portion of the so ruble matter disappears when the grass is converted x. into hay. The result of hay making, therefore, often is to approximate the soft, juice and tender grass to wood y matter, by washing out or decomposing its sugar and other so ruble constituents. The great cause of the deter i oration, he asserts, is the water present, either from incomplete drying or the absorption of it from the atmosphere. In such a case ferment at ion is produced, and the sugar is destroyed. The quantity of water or volatile matter capable of being removed, says Dr. Thomson, from hay, at the temperature of boiling water, varies considerably from twenty to fourteen per cent. If this latter per cent age could be obtained at once, by simply drying in the sun, the process of hay making would probably admit of little improvement; but the best new made hay examined contained nearly twenty per cent. of water. If grass could be subjected to a temperature of 1200, the greater portion of the water would be removed, and it would still retain its green color. When examined, this dried grass consists of a series of tubes, which, if placed in water, vill be filled and become very much as before it was dried. In this form cattle relish and prefer it to hay. The constituents of the grass are pres, served and the sugar does not de compose. A third of the whole so ruble matter may be taken up by water, and hence we see the injury produced by every shower of rain. It is likewise bleached in the sun, and, losing its green color, becomes like straw. I to wax, too, is removed. Considerations like these, are worthy of attention, and too much care cannot be taken to have the hay made properly, so as to preserve in the highest degree the nutritiousness of the grass for cattle fodder. Different species of grass have been used very satisfactorily for bonnet plaiting, in imitation of the Leg horn plait. In Sinclair S Sort us Gramincus Woburnensis, after referring to a kind of s pelt wheat which is cultivated in I talk, for the Leg horn plait, he gives a list of perennial grasses with the soil to which they are adapted. He quote it as one that may perhaps be useful to persons engaged in such manufactures, and, as the work has never been re published in this country, it is of rare occurrence now For Death or black siliseous Door soil.

There are many other species of the perennial grasses, which afford fine straw which, might be added to the above list, but those named above have been submitted to careful trials, and are found to possess the properties stated. Mr. Sinclair recommends those which flower at the same time and are adapted to the same soils, to be sown together. The period of flowering is stated to be the best time, as proved by experiment, in which to cut the straw for plait in imitation of that of Leg horn. In comparing the cult ms cut when in flower with others cut at the time -men the seed is ripe, and after both have been bleached, the former have a bland surface resembling the Leg horn, and the latter a glossy surface like that of ripened grain. The calms, at the time of flowering are said also to be less hollow and more tough and pliable than ripened straw, and so easier to plait. It is, therefore, resumed that the I italian straw is taken when the plants are in flower. The process detailed by Mr. Noble tt is recommended by Mr. Sinclairforbleaching the green straw The calms being selected are placed in a convenient vessel, boiling water sufficient to cover the straw is poured over them, and here they remain ten minutes; then are to be taken out and spread on a grass plat to bl each, are turned once a day, and in seven or eight days are effectually bleached. The time may be shortened if they are allowed to remain in the scalding water one to two hours and then spread on the grass and regularly watered as they become dry, turning them once a day for two days, and then washing the straw clean from the dust. When they must be placed moist in a close vessel, and subjected to the fumes of burning sulphur for two hours. This, it is said, is sufficient to bl each straw in the most perfect manner. Green straw, also, if immersed for ten minutes in a strong solution of ace tic acid, and then subjected to the sulphur out acid gas, is bleached perfectly white in half an hour. Green calms, too, plunged x. a. '161 into m uratic acid d tilted with twenty times its measure of water, and then spread on the glass, became in four days as perfectly bleached as those which were scalded and bleached for eight days on the grass. The texture of the straw was not injured by these processes. The application of sulphurousacid gas to the -i moistened straw, even after scalding and be aching on the grass, had, in every instance, the effect of greatly improving the color. ;If the straw is moist the greatest use of the gas must be obtained, as Later rapidly absorbs it, and assists its action in destroying the coloring matter without injury to the texture. When straw is immersed in diluted acid, it should be whole, for if cut the acid will get within it which is of no use in discharging the color. To imitate Leg horn plait in the most perfect manner, Mr. Sinclair says the straw must be plaited in the reverse way of the common mode of plaiting split straw. The straw, also, must be wrought without being flattened, and the pressure applied after the plait is made. These ti vo points are considered important, as by reversing the mode of plaiting, the fingers have much greater power of knitting the straws finely and closely, and thus produce the appearance of fine ness which belongs to the real Leg horn plait. Hemp. If in may judge from the sources of m formation at our command, of the amount of hemp raised in 1847, it was not a large crop. Less, we are told, was sown and the product was small. In Kentucky we perceive it variously estimated at 15 to 20,000 tons and the whole hemp crop of the United States is set by some at 30,000 tons; others considers this as evidently too high an estimate, and fix rather upon 23 or 25,000 tons. We cannot, perhaps, do better with respect to this crop, than to quote here a statement in a western journal which is said to have been handed to t he paper by a merchant of Louisville. It is addressed to the editor, who says, that the author is well informed on the subject. His estimate, it will be seen, is lower than that of others." A merchant at It. Louis, writing to the editor of the Cincinnati Gazette, says: ' The most carefully formed estimate of the hemp crop of the Missouri river, gives the product, as in round numbers, at 13,000 tons. Add to this the product of the whole west beside, which may be set down at 17,000tons, and you have an amount equal to 30,000 tons; from this de duct the quantity used in the west in manufactures, say 12,000 tons, and you have for export from 18,000 to 20,000 tons, or more than equal to the requirements of all northern seaports, and leaving a considerable quantity for export The foregoing' carefully formed estimate' is entirely erroneous. As it has been much copied into commercial papers, its errors ought to be exposed and corrected. With respect to the crop of Missouri, a true estimate can be easily figured. The receipts at It. Louis show the whole crop, except that portion of i consumed at the rope walks above. A register is fairly made at It. Louis, and published in the commercial paper, as follows Received at It. Louis in 1844, .a. .a. 59,292 bales. S, 1845, .a. 30,987 "1846, .a. 33,853 "S" 1847, .a. 80,336Total in four years, .a. 204,478 "11 162 X. Doc. o. 54. The bales average 250 lbs, which would be nearly nine to the ton; but say seven bales to the ton, 29,211, and divide by four, and the annual average crop of Missouri is 7,303, as large an amounts as has ever been grown in that state in one year. Now prices in 1845 and '46 caused large portions of the crops of those years to be kept back; hence the large receipts at It. Louis in 1847,(80,336 bales) when prices had advanced. It is well known that the old crops are now exhausted, so that the growth of 1847 alone existed in that state. To purchaser or consumer will estimate it above the average here stated, namely: 7,303 tons. It is believed to be less. In three or four hemp growing counties (lay, May, Jackson, Lafayette, &c) it is not near an average, the season being unfavorable, and it is believed the sowing, from want of seed, was less than an average in the whole state. The crop of Kentucky, is more certainly known to be short of the usual average. Some estimate the deficiency at one half; but, allowing for the stacked over of 1846, the deficiency may not exceed one third or one-fourth. But, be the deficiency more or less, the crop is certainly short of a an adequate supply, for the bagging looms and rope spinners now in operation; and we must be large buyers in Missouri. Last year, with the accumulated stocks of 1842, '43, '44 and '45 we purchased in Missouri three thousand tons. Our shipments to the Atlantic, did not exceed five thousand tons so that we exported of the growth of '46, and the accumulated stocks of several preceding years, only 2,600 tons more than we imported. We consumed last year 16,000 tons, and exported 2,000 tons, and had none lefttogether18000. Allowing for accumulated old crops, say 4,000 tons, the growth of 1846 did not exceed 4000 tons. If the growth of 1847 be one fourth less, Kentucky can furnish only 11,500 tons for this years consumption. That that will be depends upon the number of looms and spinners. We have not for many years past used less than 16,000 tons per annum he have referred again to the census returns, and believe we are justified by them in placing the crop of Missouri, higher than the writer of the above statement does, as the whole amount included under flax and hemp, of which the last probably was the greater portion, was 18,000 tons by the census. Some interesting statements have recently been made, respecting the bear grass or Florida hemp as it is sometimes called, and a specimen of it received at this office, has been sent to the Navy Department to have its capabilities for cordage tested. Should the report respecting it be received from Boston, it will have place in our appendix. Sov. All, in his letter to Sov. Rosely, in the Tallahassee Floridian, speaks very Highly of this species of grass as a substitute for hemp, or manilla hemp. He mentions that it a bounds in an uncultivated state in Florida, and as nothing feeds on it, it needs no enclosure. It naturally grows to the h eighth of three or four feet, and if cultivated, might probably exceed this. The leaves of the plant are tied up in bundles, boiled and wounded until the green bark and soft vegetable matter are disengaged from the strong fibres, when they are put in the water and washed out with ease. Very plant will produce a pound of good clean hemp. 5,000 or 6,000 plants may, be produced on one acre. It is considered with eight to ten cents per pound in the New York market. He -says that at this price there is no product so valuable in the United States. In the Landwirtbschaftliche Dorfzeilung, for 1845, page 204, is mentioned a new process for preparing hemp and flax, submitted to the Economicalex. a. Society- of It. Petersburg. The mode was then secret, but in the announcement made by them of this Russian R invention, they stated that the process is extremely simple; it requires no chemical knowledge of any kind, no special manipulations of the artisans ; a wooden frame of very simple structure, which suffers hardly any by use, is all that is required. Any peasant can construct or manage it. Hemp prepared in this mode is admirable for spinning purposes; the flax thus prepared is not indeed better than the usual way, but suffers not so great <a name="loss26"><mark>loss</mark></a>; the preparation of the female hemp yields a richer and more beautiful product, and the settle may also be advantageously subjected to the same process. Further information is promised respecting it, but we have as yet been unable 'to find any continued notice of it, though it may possibly have been inserted under some other heading. In Miles' Register, vol. 3. p. 188, we have the description of a neo application of a plant common, and before unnoticed in our country, to the purpose of hemp and flax. It is a species of urica, to which the name of urica Whitlow i is given, after the discovered, who somehow secured a patent for it. The utility of the discovery is sustained by high recommendations from lecturers on botany, various manufacturers of flax and hemp and a committee of the corporation of New Work. These among other things state, that though its natural situation is in low and moist grounds, it maybe cultivated on uplands; that it will bear from fifteen to eighteen stems on one root, and rises to, the height h of from n four to six feet; that it was considered on examination superior to any flax or hemp they had ever seen, as well in the quantity it produces from a single stem, as its superior strength, beauty and fine ness of texture. That from experiments made by them, they were of opinion that it would produce from twenty to twenty-five per cent. more from the hack le, than any flax or hemp they had ever known, &c. Behave been unable to trace this plant. It does not appear in the Northamerican Botany under the title here given to it, nor do we know why it was abandoned. Possibly a new investigation might confirm the recommendations, but the fact is a curious one in the history of our industrial efforts. An interesting mention is made in the Days ville Herald, respecting a method of preparing hemp, by Dr. Leavitt, and we had hoped to be able to sub join an article in our appendix in relation to his improvements, but by a letter received at this office we understand that it must be deferred till another year. If he realizes all he hopes, his discoveries will be important and even from the remarks of the editor of the journal mentioned, it would seem as if the success already obtained will be of great advantage to the public. He says, "we saw a hemp brake of ingenious construction and great strength, proper led by a steam engine, breaking hemp at the rate of two pounds per minute, or 1 200 pounds in ten' ours and delivering the hemp in such condition as to be more easily and speedily hack led upon the common hand tackle, than the dew <a name="rotted0"><mark>rotted</mark></a> hemp of the common hand brake, and with quite as little, if not less waste. The cleaning apparatus is also thought to be likely to prove equally effective, when furnished, as its simplicity and adaptation seem to warrant this conclusion. More than the whole of the fuel necessary for one steam engine, will be furnished it is said from the hemp i self, by three brakes, and is supplied to the furnace without necessity of a fire in an. The hemp brakes stand in a line over a strong grating, beneath which isa trough, whose sides inclined inward, receive and deposit upon an endless band, running in the direction of the furnace, all the wood y matter falling 164 X. fr on the brakes and carrying it to a funnel, through which it is thrown, into the furnace an Scattered in its bed, in iting instantly, and keeping up an intensely hot fire. A man and two boys are sufficient to attend each brake with ease, and a third one can bear off the hemp from the three brakes, delivered in bands or endless moving to be passed through the various subsequent machinery, a portion of which is designed to supersede the wasteful hacking now in use, avoiding the manufacture of tow entirely. Connected with it is also to be an apparatus for supplying the powerful antiseptic substances now in use in the man factories of ship cordage and canvass in England, the efficacy of which has been so severely tested in the Anigerexpedition and on the western coast of South America, so celebrated for its production in the cordage and sails of shipping exposed to that climate. The material to be used will be made at the factory and will not cost over    $5 for each ton of hemp. If these various expectations are realized, Dr. Leavitts efforts will prove of great value to our commercial interests, as well as probably greatly encourage the agriculturists whose attention is devoted to the cultivation of hemp, and the amount of this product will doubtless be much increased at the west. By a recent trial it appears that the strength of a rope of this un <a name="rotted1"><mark>rotted</mark></a> hemp, was much greater than those of American water <a name="rotted2"><mark>rotted</mark></a> Russia or steam hemp. In a German journal, we find the following short notice of a method of giving to hemp the appearance and fine ness of flax, taken from the I italian of E. R. Ciolfli. As it is simple and easily tested, we have translated it. Take a let of good ashes and a little lime; then allow it to become clear, dip the hemp all over in it, and leave it to steep there for a day. Afterward add to this let for every ten pounds of hemp one pound of soap. Lastly, let the whole boil a couple of hours, and then treat the hemp precisely as you do flax. By this operation nothing else is effected but to dissolve the vegetable blue which renders the fibres of hemp so coarse without injuring its strength. Flax. Though we have no estimate of the quantity of flax raised i fr our country yet considerable attention is paid to it, not only for the sake of the fibre as a material for thread, but likewise for the seed on account of its oil. I n the state of New Work, there is a considerable amount raised for this purpose. In Ohio likewise, it seems to be an object of interest and the profits received from it are said to be very good. Treble county is thought to be the greatest flax growing county in the United States. This year we are informed e crop has been very large, the quantity sown was larger, and the yield of seed about the average. It is estimated that 100,000 bushels of seed were raised, which allowing 10,000 bushels for home consumption, would give 90,000 for exportation. The price at 55 cents per bushel, would amount to        $47,500. If some later method could be devised for preparing the lint, it would be yet more profitable. Hint from the brake is set down as worth                              $15 per ton. In a lecture before the Yorkshire Agricultural Association, Professorjohnston made some valuable remarks o on flax, in the course of which he x. a. 165 furnished the following analysis, which showed the nature of the substance which this plant derived from the soil.

Any interesting facts relating to the raising of flax were also stated at the same meeting, which may be found in the Dark Laneexpress, of August 9, 1847, from whence we have gathered the above. I n Appendix 8 will be found a description of the Belgian Westphalians mode of raising flax, translated from the German, and which, it is believed, will repay the perusal. In the Vienna Zeitung we find an interesting account of a communication made by Dr. Vessel, to the Society of Natural History, respecting the development of flax fibre and its connection with other spinning fibres, especially those of hemp and cotton, which we have translated as probably new to many of the readers of this report The fibre of flax, he says, as is well known, is the tissue of the inner bark of the common flax. It developed itself in the following manner. In the very early circumstances of i be stalk, when the interval knots or joints first begin to form and the leaves are iNearDublin9787703991253779608265108416959946500- -a. V t- .a. To I-- -166 X. unfolding, the whole stalk consists of nearly similarly formed cells, filled with chlorophyll and the four characteristic and variously formed layers of the developed stalk are not yet distinct from each other. By and by this separation and impression of the layers take place; these are formed by the mind or outer bark, the inner bark, the wood and marrow. The inner bark consists of three layers of very long cylindrical cells running in thin texture parallel to the direction of the stem. These are at first thin walled, and contain chlorophyll; by and by the chlorophyll dissolves; from the fluid contents is thrown down a solid secondary deposit upon the inner walls of the cell; then a second, third and fourth, so that the hollow of the cell is thus gradually lessened, and at last there is nothing more than a space left in comparison to the original one of ten to one. In this state, is the inner bark and with it the whole tissue of the inner bark of the stem is developed. The changes which the same undergoes from rotating, and the consequent separation undergone by the surrounding layers of the wood and the outer bark, as well in the preparation of linen as of paper are merely mechanical. In the same manner as the flax fibre developes itself, so does that of the hemp. In a manner essentially analogous to this so far as relates to the secondary deposits on the inner wall is formed the cotton fibre. This, as is well known, is a seed hair of the cotton plant. The difference between the fibres of flax and cotton, is not very difficult to perceive by means, of the microscope after some practice. The flax fibre has an uniform diameter, by means of re agents, evidently easy for making many secondary deposits on the inner wall of the cells of the inner bark, and a very slight, often imperceptible space between these deposits. The cotton fibre on the contrary, exhibits a single deposit on the inner wall of the cell and a wider space of the same. At the Chemico Agricultural Society of Ulster, in I re land, a report was made of an analysis of the water of the river Bys, in Belgium, which is so celebrated for watering flax. Dr. Lodges showed that one gallon of it collected three hundred yards above the town of Outran, and from the middle of the stream contained nearly three grains of organic matter, which, when the water was elaborated to dryness exhaled a strong flax odor, and when the heat was increased, evolved ammonia. The water was rendered muddy by a flocculent matter which examined by a microscope magnifying two hundred and forty times, was found to consist of flax fibres and flax matter undergoing decomposition. ,A species of plant (phormium ten ax) has been recommended by Mr. Poinsett, in He Rows commercial Review, as a product which may be useful to introduce into the south. It is obtained from Kidney and An Diemans And, and is known by the name of the New Zealand flax. Is described by Mcculloch, he says it exceeds every other species in strength of fibre and whiteness. It is thus mentioned in Captain Looks voyage in 1775: up t grows in all places near the sea and considerably up the hills in bunches or tufts, bearing yellowish flowers, on a long stalk." Captwilkes also speaks in high terms of its capabilities, in his Narrative of the Exploring Expedition, and describes the native method of manufacturing it. According to the experiments of A Billadiere, Mr. Poinsett says, the fibre of this plant, is much stronger than any vegetable we know of; that of the a gave Americanabreaks under a weight of seven; that of flax eleven and three-fourths, that~ He- No. 54.ofhemp sixteen and three-fourths; that of the New Zealand flax, twenty-three and seven elevenths, so that it is only exceeded by silk which reaches to twenty-four. For. Poinsett expresses the opinion that it will succeed best in a rich swamp soil and says it may be propagated by the offsets which it throws out at the roots, but thinks it would produce seed in the southern country, which will afford a simple and easy way of propagation g it. It has been found to be capable of bearing the winters in I re land and south of England, and is quite naturalized in the south of France, where it bears seed. Loud on says that there are two kinds of the plant, the leaves of one are yellow, the other of deep red and both resembling the leaves of flags, and that the plant is found both on high and low ground, in dry <a name="mould12"><mark>mould</mark></a> and in deep bogs, but a sit grows best in the latter, that seems to be its proper soil. Mr. Poinsettthinks it would succeed in the rich bottoms 'of the Mississippi valley. The imports of the article into England in 1831, amounted to 15,725 cut. Tobacco. There appears to have been for the last few years a decline of prices in tobacco and this with the increased demand for some other products has turned off the attention from the raising of this plant. It is believed therefore that the crop has lessened. The is more attention paid to it in some of the New England states, but the quantity grown there is too small to make any very sensible difference in the aggregate amount. The quantity per acre is probably considerably larger there than in the large tobacco growing states. In the Albany Cultivatbr mention is made of some successful experiments in this culture in Massachusetts. The variety produced is known, says the account, as the c Connecticut seed leaf" and it usually brings double the price, or more, of the tobacco grown in Virginia or Kentucky. For a profitable crop rich land is necessary, though sandy soils manured at the rate of ten or twenty common two horse or oxen loads per acre, will produce well. With good management the' yield is from fifteen hundred to two thousand pounds per acre, of market able tobacco, at an average price of eight cents per pound. One gentleman is mentioned in South Valley, who has seventeen acres. The crop as managed by the growers in Massachusetts, it is said does not injure the soil, but on the other hand is rendered "an amelie rating one. The liberal maturing applied, fits the soil admirably for other crops; and it is found that wheat and other grain and grass flourish better where tobacco forms a part of the rotation than where it does not. An instance is mentioned where thirty-six dollars' worth of manure was put upon an acre and one hundreds rods of land which was planted with tobacco. This raised a ton of tobacco, north one hundred and sixty dollars. The land was then sowed to Heat and reaped thirty bushels. The next crop was hay which gave at two cuttings four tons. The year 1847, is believed to have given some increase above that of 1845. In New York we have not before noted any, but we learn some attention is paid to it' One man in Onondaga county is mentioned who had ten acres of it which is said to have been very superior, In Pennsylvania it is believed there was no great difference. The amount raised is only in small patches. It has, however, been introduced quite 168 X. Doc. No. 4.recently, into some portions of the state with marked success, not less than two thousand pounds being grown to an acre, worth ten cents per pound. The encouragement thus derived it is supposed will lead to the more extensive cultivation. The early prospect of the tobacco crop in Maryland was not favorable. One of the public journals in May last, remarks that many intelligent planters believe that not more than one third of a crop of tobacco will be grown the present season. In a ride of twenty miles, the editor observes he judged not one hundred acres of the ground to be prepared for the crop; the high price of wheat, rye, oats and corn, leading the farmers to fill their land with these. Since the crop has been gathered, By fords Commercial Journal gives te same reason for the light crop which had been realized. The where Maryland crop is there estimated at about twenty thousand hogs heads. Another, an agricultural journal, at an earlier date remarks that there was not as much ground appropriated to the tobacco crop as in former years, and conjectures that there could not be more than as large a crop as that of last year. The tobacco worm was the subject of complaint in a portion of the tobacco growing region. One journal speaking of its ravages in the vicinity, says that some of the fields were literally strip t by them, and the tobacco was hardly worth the housing. This worm is said by an observant latter to have been on the increase for several years, and that should it continue on a few years it will be impossible to check their progress. The crop of tobacco is Stated to be probably below even the low estimates made, and much in the field was not worth the cutting. There is a slight diversity in t the reports which we have received respecting the tobacco crop in Virginia. In a few instances it is thought to have been somewhat -better than in 1845. The crop of that year it will be recollected was a decrease of the crop of the previous year. The same causes which operated to reduce the quantity of acres planted in Maryland, seem likewise to have exerted an influence in this state, and for the most part there has been a decrease in the product. We have referred again to the census returns and reexamined our former estimates, and thus endeavored to form something like a suitable decision approximating to accuracy respecting it. This too is the more desirable as Virginia holds such a prominent place among the tobacco growing states. One of our correspondents residing in the tobacco region of Virginia says, the crop of 1845 was a good one in quality. The crop of 1846 was of inferior quality, and I learn, 52,000 hogs heads, at an average of 1,450pounds the hogs head. The crop of the current year will be in the market in 1848, and will be far short of the two preceding years; the western states have grown for several years large crops of tobacco, which, together with the crops in the Atlantic states, has given a supply of the article greatly beyond the demand in the foreign markets; that, with the reduced price and the enhanced price of corn, determined our planters to abridge their tobacco crop from one-fourth to one third less, so that I estimate the crop as low as 40 000 hogs heads. The aspect of the crop in North Carolina was much the same as in Virginia, but owing to the severe drought in this state in 1845, and the consequent large deduction made then in the tobacco crop, this fact must be kept in view in determining the probable amount of the crop of 1847. The decrease on this account, even if allowed to be some twenty or twenty-five per cent. from an average one, would yet bring it much nearer to that of x. a. 1691845, or at least diminish it less than if that year had been a favorable one. From similar reasons we have likewise formed our estimate of the crop, of South Carolina, but as the quantity raised is so small, this will exercise very little influence on the general result. I i Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, there may have been an increased product per acre, but the attention of the planters has been so much turned to other and more important crops, that comparatively little can be ascertained respecting it. In Tennessee ad Kentucky as far as respects the influence of the weather we believe the crop prospered. As the crop of 1845 was noticed as unfavorable in Kentucky, which then stood foremost among the tobacco growing states, we doubt whether, even with the attention more turned to other crops, the tobacco crop did not advance upon that of 1845. In portions, however, of the state, there was unquestionably some falling ff. In Ohio there was less land devoted to this product this year, and the whole crop of this state is estimated at from about 6000 to 8 000 hogs heads. In I n diana and I illinois there would appear to have been a slight increase in some portions, while in others it fell off at about the same rate. The tobacco crop of Missouri is one of some importance, and it is believed succeeded as well as usual. The culture of this plant is increasing in Florida, and although the quantity raised in this state is but small, yet it would seem probable that the attention will be gradually turned toward it, and on soils such as are there most favorable to its growth, the best qualities of Cuba tobacco will be cultivated with increasing success. In the report before the last, the estimate for Louisiana was omitted from the column on account of the difficulty of ascertaining respecting it. The amount raised is small, but it has been thought best to restore it after referring to the census and such other information as we could command. Some allowance must be made in regard to this crop from the accounts of the inspection and of sales for home consumption, in estimating the whole product of the crop. There is no doubt a considerable quantity thus used in the states where it is raised, which does not appear in those important means of information to the public respecting the stock disposed of and still on hand in the market. We have sub joined in an Appendix No. 9, an account of the method of raising tobacco in Cuba, which is. stated to be considered of such value that it is forbidden to be sent from the island. It was however procured, translated, and published in one of the southern States. Whether or not this statement may be correct, it is believed to be a valuable document for tobacco growers, and as it does not seem to have been very extensively disseminated, it is judged suitable to add it to this report. The seed of some varieties of Hungarian tobacco were furnished to this office by Or' Fleischmann, which have been planted and found to be remarkably hardy, and the produce will be distributed among the other seeds, which will be sent to the members of congress, &c, from this office this season. -I tis hoped that benefit may thus result from the introduction of these plants, before unknown to our tobacco growers, even should they not prove of the finer kinds. In one of the New Orleans journals we have a notice of an experiment with the seed of a variety brought from Turkey, which is said to have been very successful. A quarter of an acre was planted with it. The product is mentioned as being a very superior article in appearance and quality, and 170 X with a little more than ordinary attention amounted to four times the quantity that is usually yielded by the same extent of land. The following experiment respecting the curing of tobacco, which is taken from the Southern Planter, shows that fire curing is not necessary, but that it may be cured in the shade to equal advantage: "two hundred plants, all as nearly alike as to quality and size as could be discerned by the eye, were divided into two parcels- each of 100 plants, while green 200 lbs. each, and hung on sticks and s u." red to remain on a scaffold three days. When one parcel was put in the in and fire cured the other into a house where there was no fire, and suffered to remain about five (lays, when it was perfectly cured. They were then both stripped and weighed. The fire cured weighed twenty-five pounds the shadecuredthirtytwo pounds being a difference of twenty-eight per cent. in favor of the shale cured. In examination of the inspectors and' buyers, there was no material difference between them the consumption of tobacco is large in foreign countries, as well as in our own. The contract for the French government recently taken amounts to nearly 10,000,000 kilograms, or about 22,000,000 lbs. According to official returns, Great Britain consumed in 1846, 26,557,000pounds. Cotton. Notwithstanding the importance of this crop, and the great attention paid to its progress in the southern journals generally, it is one of the most difficult of all the crops to, estimate at the period at which the report of this office is prepared. The picking continues so late that it is impossible to embody the entire results within the year. There are also numerous influences which operate to modify the estimates which are from time to time published in the different commercial ports, so that they are extremely contradictory. Such, too, are the 'views of the planters themselves as to their own immediate vicinity, and the amount which may be anticipated. We have watched the progress, so far as was practicable, and availed ourselves of such means as were in our power to get the proper information, and have made an estimate accordingly. We do not consider it advisable, however, to 'enter into details, as it would be but the placing on our pages various extracts from the public journals for which we have notroomThe two principal evils to which it is subject, are the Wormnand unfavorable season. There has been some complaint respecting the cotton worm in the early part of the season, and fears, greater perhaps than were realized, were expressed as to its effect on the coming crop. It is said there are three or four species of worms which part under this name. Two of them are ground worms-one a gray cut form, and the other a large black and yellow striped worm, which feeds on both the law and stem. All of the ri, he vere~ and the boil worm included, are considered as not to be dreaded in comparison with the cotton cater pillar called noctua gossypnii. The amount of cotton raised by all the other states, except North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee, is so small as to exercise but very little influence on the cr1opSBeginning with South Carolina, we wish first to correct an error into x. a. 171 which we have been led by some former correspondent respecting the cotton crop of this state, and for a notice of which we are indebted to the kindness of J. H. Davis, corresponding secretary of an agricultural society. He gives the exports of the last crop (1846) at 330,000 bags, or about115000000 pounds. Some of this" he says, "may have been from the states of North Carolina and Georgia; if so, the amount cannot be very great not greater perhaps than our domestic consumption in reference to the census returns, which were but 61,000,000 lbs, we believe this estimate of his must be considered too high; but we place it higher than ever before. Though there is some diversity in respect to the crop of 1847, as compared with that of 1845, yet it is believed on the whole to have been r better. Most of the accounts we have, so consider it. Some fix the increase as high as fifty per cent, and others vary from ten per cent. and more, upwards. The drought of the summer of 1845 is the reason assigned. Although the rains in the early part of the season in 1847 proved somewhat injurious, yet the weather for the gathering was most favorable. We are inclined to believe, therefore, that the crop was fully equal to that of 1846, as above given by an intelligent correspondent. The information given of the cotton i crop of Georgia and Alabama, in the early part of the season, and even during the month of September, was discouraging. Thus, under date of September 8th, we find a communication in the Alabama Planter, of a gentleman who speaks of having travelled over a large extent of country, embracing Dallas, Down des, Merry and Autauga counties, and who says: "with the exception of a few days in the early part of August, we have had heavy and continued rains, up to this time, which have done considerable injury to the cotton crop, causing an overflow at different times of the low lands adjacent to the creeks, and the cotton plant to grow to an immense weed. The lower balls, shaded by the thick foliage above, and exempted from the favorable influence of a hot sun, <a name="rot13"><mark>rot</mark></a> and fall to the ground, only maturing on branches exposed to the air, touched occasionally by rays of the sun. The high lands would have made .a fair yield, but for the appearance of the ball worm, which have extended their ranges to a fearful extent, sparing no fields, but as destructive on the low prairie swamp and cane brake lands as was ever known by any of our oldest planters' He closes this letter by saying: "I n view then of the heavy rains of the season, the lateness of the spring; the backwardness of the crop, the destruction caused by the ball worm, the great deficiency of grown balls left on the plant to mature, who can doubt but that the receipts at Mobile will show another short crop, perhaps shorter than that of last year Another letter in the same journal, from Georgia, under date of September 24, thus speaks: "throughout the counties of Group, Harris, Ballot, fMuscogee, M1riwether and Up son, (six of the largest producing counties in the state) the heavy rains of the summer caused the forms to .drop off, and, since the middle of August, the cater pillar and ball worm have both commenced a struggle to destroy the plant n October and November the prospect brightened, and we find, in the same journal, encouraging accounts, Thus it is said, October 4th: 'The weather generally continues highly favorable for cotton, and we doubt not, that under the influence of a bright, hot sun, the balls are rapidly maturing and opening. Met we cannot flatter ourselves that the yield will b, anything like an average crop. X. -doc. To -54 Again, October 25: "the weather continues highly favorable for cotton, and we hear from all sections increased estimates of the receipts at this port" (Mobilecid127We are satisfied, ourselves, that the Mobile crop will considerably ext red the estimates made a month ago, still not to the extent fixed by many n the same journal, November 15, we find the following: "the Marionreview says, it is now the fourth of November, and there has been no frost sufficient to kill vegetation. This is exerting a most favorable influence on the cotton crop, in maturing what the planters call the top crop, and enabling them to save their staple free from trash and un soiled by- rains. Should this weather continue much longer, the yield i: Merry will not fall very short of an average one." The receipts at the port of Mobile, up tothe31st of december, 1847, exceeded those of the previous year (1846 17 432 l bales, which would seem to indicate that the crop was equal, if not superior to that of the former year. We believe, therefore, that these states will be found to furnish their full supply of the whole cotton crop, as there seems to have been more planted than before. The crops of Mississippi and Louisiana seem also to have suffered some of the evils which have already been mentioned in respect to Georgia and Alabama. A correspondent of an agricultural journal, speaking of these states, remarks: "If the ball and army .worm had not operated, the southwestern crop would have been the greatest ever made' He places the whole crop at 2,200,000 bales, and says that theSplandwill be short, but that grown on the bottom lands good. Under ate of October 24th, we find it stated: "except one rain there has been no <a name="loss28"><mark>loss</mark></a> of cotton or time, and far more up to date than for some few years. Behave not had one for twenty-six days, from the 22d of September to 3d of October." Thus far the crop shows better. In November, also, it is stated: "except the falls of 1830 and 1839, I do not remember so good a one as the present. I have not lost three days since I began to piekThe author complains of much cotton being wasted in the wilds. M. Phillips, Esq, in a letter to this office, fixes .the Mississippi crop at a fair share of 115 000 bales, which he estimates for the receipts at New Areas. :I t would appear that Mississippi grows full half, and probably more than the whole receipts at New Orleans. The cotton crop of Louisiana appears to have been a good one, much, better than in 1846, which was much injured by the cater pillar and army worm, and fully equal, probably somewhat better, than that of 1845. Those* of e Tennessee ,and Florida are also believed to have been fully equal to the average crop. It would appear, if we may judge from the receipts at Neworleans up to the close of the year 1847, that it was fully equal probably to that of 1846. The, are. inclined to place the crop, from the best information we can gather, at about 2,250,000 bales, at least we should judge that it must average two mild in two hundred thousand, the estimate of one of our correspondents. Some place it much lover x, ind others, again, set it at twos million! three hundred and fifty thousand bales, or even still higher. The fact must be taken into consideration that more than usual has been planted, the weather for gathering has when most favorable, and the state of the market has been such as not yet to call into the shipping ports in all cases the due proportion of the crop/ Various species of cotton have been mentioned in the papers as prom172Ex. a. 173 ising advantages to the cotton grower. Among those which makes the most pretensions is the mastoid on cotton, which while it is extolled by some, is as much deprecated by others. Perhaps experiments sufficiently extensive have not been made, through a course of years, so as- to determine its value as compared with other kinds. The principal introduced of it, complains that many persons have been imposed upon by an imitation, and have found it worthless. He claims that the produce is larger, that it also affords a finer staple, and thus is much more remunerative than other kinds. The controversy on the subject may be found in the various agricultural papers which treat of southern products. The seed of the cotton has been often recommended .as valuable for the purposes of oil, and also for manure. It is said, that thirty pounds of cotton will give one bushel of seed, from which may be obtained two quarts of oil good for burning. As a manure, also, it is stated to be peculiarly valuable for the cotton crop. The attempts of the English to raise a competition of cotton grown in  india, has hitherto been unsuccessful. There seems some reason to believe that cotton may yet be cultivated in Turkey, and possibly in some parts of Africa; but many years must elapse, even should these attempts be successful before any competition can be feared from these parts of the world to our own cotton growing states. The cultivation will doubtless increase in Texas and Mexico, should the latter country at last begin to experience the greater influences of industrious efforts which may develop e her agricultural and other resources Of. The amount of this crop is determined principally by the success or failure of its growth in South Carolina. The history of its progress has been furnished us by an intelligent planter who devotes his attention to this business. He remarks "the month of April to the 15th of May is the season for planting. The monthly tides were unusually high this year. The months of June, July, August, to the 1 5th of September, were excessively rainy; the corresponding months in 1845 were excessively dry, the woods were on fire in July and August. From the middle of September to 20th of November, there was but one rain of any consequence. The baroneter showed unusually little variation throughout, ranging well up generally, and more recently very high. I n August the planters on the long rivers were visited by a fresh et which sensibly diminished the crops. The crop of 1845 was about 112,000 barrels it was diminished by drought and the effect of salt water." The crop of 1847 he puts as about 130,000 barrels allowing 600 lbs. net t to a barrel, it being slightly lessened by the August fresh et. I individuals suffered severely but the general average was made up by the heavy crops below. The crop of 1846 was about 146,000 barrels. It is generally harvested in the month of September. The crop of 1847 therefore was probably some per cent. more than that of 1845. This we believe also was the case in the other states where this product is grown, and have fixed it accordingly. Among the varieties of rice is the gold seed rice, so called from its bright 174 X. yellow color. Of this there are two sizes the long grain which was introduced a few years since, and which has since been cultivated with great success, and the old fashioned common sized small grain rice the difference is in the length of the grain, not in its breadth. The new seed was tried by some planters but un successfully, owing to the want of attention to it. Several experiments were tried to determine the truth respecting it as follows n 1845, Vol. Hard (the introduced of this variety) had a field of 16 acres sown equally with the long grain and the other kind in alternate girls. They were treated also exactly alike whilst growing; when ripe with of them was harvested, threshed and cleaned separately, and the res .a' Was as follows to. 1. Rough Vice. Clean Vice. Small Vice.

The writer of the article on this subject says that the lands there possess he essential things which are requisite for its success, richness and cap al city of being made dry or irrigated on account of its being level, and that in every respect they possess advantages equal to any in the United States for the purpose. The introduction of rice in this country is said to have been owing to one of those trivial occurrences which often exert a powerful influence on a nations prosperity. It is stated that in the year 1695, a brig from Madagascar, touching at Charleston on her way to England, anchored off Sullivan S I s land. The captain invited Landgrave Smith on board and presented to him a bag of seed rice, with information of its growth in the east, and its excellence for food and its amazing increase. The governor divided it among his friends, who made experiments with it, which fully answered expectation, and from this small beginning arose one of the great staple articles of South Carolina and Georgia. The mode of irrigation of rice in China is thus described in Fortuneschina, a work which contains many interesting particulars relating to Chinese agriculture: "I irrigation in Chinarice is grown on the lower terrace ground; and, stream of water is always led from some ravine and made to flow across the sides of the hills, until it reaches the highest terrace, into which it flows, and blood- the whole of the level space. When the water rises three or four inches in height, which is sufficiently high for the rice, it finds vent at an opening made for the purpose in the bank through which it flows intothe terrace below, which it floods in the same manner, and soon to the lowest. In this way the whole of the rice terraces are kept flooded continual, Axis. Until the s talks of the crops assume a yellow ripe king blue when the water being no longer required, is turned back into its natural channel, or led to a different part of the hill for the nourishment of -other crops. These mountain streams which abound in : all parts of the hilly districts, are of the greatest importance to the farmer; and as they generally spring from a high elevation in the ravines, they can be conducted at: pleasure over all the lower parts of the hills. To operation in agriculture gives him and his laborers more pleasure than leading these streams of later from one place to another, and making them subservience to their purposes. In my travels in the country the inhabitants often called my attention to this branch of their operations; and I pleased them much when I expressed' my admiration at the skill with which they excited it. -the, practice is not confined to the daddy fields; for I remember once, when superintending the planting of some large trees and shrubs in the garden of Messrs. Went ind Coinhongkong, after I had given" them a large supply of water' at the time they were put into the ground, I desired the* gardener to repeat the dose next morning. But on the following day, when I returned to the spot, I was: surprised to find a little stream divided into many branches, andmeandering among the roots of the newly planted trees. As there was no stream there before, I went to examine its source, and found that it had been led from a neighboring ravine a work more easy than carrying a large supply of water in buckets, at the same :til ne more effectual Mention was made in one of the former reports of this office, respecting a species of rice which is found in the northwestern parts of the United Statessince then it has been further noticed as abundant in the Minnesota Territory. Men. Verplanck, late Commissioner to t the Chippewa l indians, pronounces it better than southern rice, The kerseys are large and its flavor is better; for when boiled and stewed, and left to cool, it forms a consistent mass like good wheat bread, and more nutritions. It is stated that very great quantities grow on all the lakes in this northern country. Of  he outlets and bays are filled with it: It ri pens in the: month of August and is the main reliance of the I indians, during the winter i months, for their sustenance. From this account it would seem that it -might be ai article worthy of attention, and that possibly it may become known arid used in the more eastern states. Some successful efforts have been -made recently in France, to cultivate rice but the experiments have not as yet been made. on r a sufficiently extensive scale to warrant any conclusions as to the probability of it 8 exercising any important bearing on the question of subsistence which' is' so; earnestly agitated in that con i try.

Vahisomewhatmore attended to in certain of the western and southern 'states. But the extent of its cultivation is as yet so small compared to mi any other crops, that it is extremely difficult -to from any estimates respecting it. The effoiitswhich are made by oui silk growers in this country to attain increased perfection, are encouragingly successful- Some of the articles exhibited at the large fairs and in the rooms of various agricultural societies, do greatcredi176 X. to. those who have furnished them. The manufacture of fabrics of domestic silk i has shown what might be done were 'the -energies of our people once turned in a higher degree towards this object Additional information has likewise been i published: Some interesting and' valuable treatises from the French have been translated, including onefromithe Chinese, giving an account of their method of managing their worms. 'he great points to be aimed at among us, seem to be to convince the people that it is a business which will regenerate for the time and trouble and expense of attending to it. For this purpose: it is necessary that the trees best adapted to the climate and soil of the particular section of country should be selected. One great error which has been committed probably has been using the same species of mulberry for all the various sections of the country. The for us multicaulis was thus tried, and in consequence of not being able to stand the severity of the northern winters, was discredited, and not merely so, but likewise by its failure produced a reaction against the business.  There was not enough of sober and considerate management among its advocates, and in consequence of the disappointment of a spirit of excited speculation, the whole business was pronounced chimerical. But there was great want of discrimination in the utterance of this verdict. Though the for us multicaulis may not succeed amid the frosts and snows of the north, it may do so in the more genial climate of the south, and some other harder variety may do for the north. Because, too, men have in judiciously urged on their speculations and became loses, it by no means proves that a more rational method of aiming at its cultivation might not ultimately be crowned with complete success. I need, from the experiments which have been made in such a manner, we can augury the most undoubted encouragement. Another point of importance is the selection of the right kind; of worm. We have heretofore, in our former reports, furnished extracts from those periodicals which are most devoted to this subject, and from a variety of works which contain information relative to the characteristics of the different species which are employed. Any of the questions which have been raised respecting the best methods of feeding have been decided, and with a little. attention to the best sources of information scarcely any one can be at a <a name="loss30"><mark>loss</mark></a> on the subject. The New York Farmer and Mechanics has had its columns supplied with much valuable original and selected matter on this topic, by that practicalsilkcfturist, Mr. An Pps, who has devoted much time and attention to all the particulars which fall within the cognizance of this important business. ,he do not propose to repeat any of the former details on this subject. All that will be necessary will be simply to add any thing that may seem more new and important. A great difficulty in raising silk worms has been the prevalence of the <a name="disease81"><mark>disease</mark></a> called the muscardine. To remedy this <a name="evil24"><mark>evil</mark></a>, the attention of many has been directed. An interesting course of experiments in reference to it, has been published in the Journal d Agriculture Critique et de Jardinage. The views taken there by Euer in He neville are the following 1. The muscardine is a contagious <a name="disease82"><mark>disease</mark></a> produced in silk worms and other insects by the vegetation of a cryptogamous plant of the class of <a name="mould13"><mark>mould</mark></a> discovered by Was si, and named bory tis bassianna2. This plant cannot develop e itself in the body of living insects which are very sound and vigorous. It is propagated by its grains or s po rules, X, a. 177 which are deposited on other silk worms or other insects by immediate contact; or by means of the air 3. When these grains fall on a silk worm they are probably absorbed by the pores of its skin or by its organ of respiration, and thus penetrate intothe body, The germination or incubation of those grains is much more rapid than the growth of the silk worm. Thus for example, six or eight days are sufficient in the fifth stage, to produce death in worms which are artificially infected 4. In the more ordinary, cases, twenty to twenty-four hours after its death, the worm has a rosy tint more or less intense and becomes more and more hard. In twenty-four hours more, following the temperature, it begins to whiten slightly by the first shooting forth of the cryptogamous plant 5. From this point of time, the branches of the fingers rapidly increases and the silk worm becomes more and more white. The plant flowers, if we may call it so, and at the hundredth hour it is in full fructification. Thesporules detach themselves on the slightest touch, or at the least breath then it is only that the worm whitens the fingers like chalk 6. These grains or s po rules are so small, the diameter of five of them only fills the hundredth part of a millimetre; they are spherical and as white as snow, rise in the air like an impalpable powder, or better like a light smoke scarcely visible 7. The worms on which the muscardine seed is blown, present no sign of the <a name="disease83"><mark>disease</mark></a>; they eat with the same eagerness and die suddenly without being wasted or dis colored. The same is the case when they are inoculated 8. If a worm of the fourth or fifth stage is inoculated with the fat of a worm which has died by muscardine, but which presents no white ned vegetation as yet, the worm more suddenly dies according to our experience in about two days, in that case it is indeed a plantation of vegetable shoots 9. Forms affected with other diseases do not die from the muscardinewhen the muscardine seed is thrown on them. In this case it seems to be inappropriate to its vegetation, and when they yield to their <a name="disease84"><mark>disease</mark></a> they remain as usual, and soon become putrefied10. From the foregoing, it seems to follow that the muscardine, as has hitherto been believed, is owing to the bad state of the frames 'r to a great accumulation of worms. This <a name="disease85"><mark>disease</mark></a> consequently has no analogy with the typhus and other contagious or epidemic maladies, of which the cause is at present so little known, at least it results from parasites as was suspected long ago, by the immortal Linnaeus11. As for the atmospheric causes to which are so readily attributed all kinds of epidemic, they play no other part in the production of the muscardine than they usually sustain in analogous diseases. We cannot therefore give them seriously as a specific explanation 12. Forms that die of muscardine, do not communicate the <a name="disease86"><mark>disease</mark></a> to other worms, except when the vegetable substance which covers them arid renders them entirely white, is only in the germ (50, to 55 hours. after the death of the worms) They communicate the <a name="disease87"><mark>disease</mark></a> with great energy 13. It is frequently the case that the worms dead from the muscardineand -covered with a vegetable substance yet in the germ, rapidly dry up, When the botrytig cannot ripe n and yield its seed. The worm remains dry and white; but it does to t whiten the fingers and cannot communicate thedisease1278 X. 14. It is very probable that .he seed of the miuscardine is preserved in the frames infected, even in those which are best kept, by the worms which die after they have mounted on the twigs. In co cooking when the cocoonsare carried away, those which are white ned of which the seed has had time to ripe n and which remain resting on the twigs, disperse a cloud of powder or s po rules, which preserve the principle of the <a name="evil25"><mark>evil</mark></a> for next year. >15. Boa similar cause may be attributed the infection of whole villages and countries. As every one throws the twigs from the frames out of the windows, sweeps the infected chamber, and raises a dust, it is certain that numerous seeds of the <a name="fungus18"><mark>fungus</mark></a> are borne away by the winds and transmit the <a name="disease88"><mark>disease</mark></a> to great distances 16. Moisture in the cocooneries increase the chances of infection in forming the flower, and especially the fructification of the botrytis17. If we take into the midst of a cocoonery (infected) worms raised till the fifth stage in a healthy place, those worms begin by presenting instances of muscardine at the end of seven or eight days. I S. If we take worms from an infected cocoonery to transfer them into acocoonery which has never had the muscardine, this <a name="disease89"><mark>disease</mark></a> will not be stopped, but the mortality continues always increasing. - *a* *a* . We believe that the muscardine might well be a spontaneous existence, or that it is not produced solely by the want of care in training them; that it is not given to the worms by the <a name="mould14"><mark>mould</mark></a> i ness of their litter, by the accumulation of the worms by want of air in the cochons, &c. It is on the contrary sown on the silk worm in the country where the culture of that insect is carried on, on a large scale; just like other diseases which appear in countries where they have not been known, there certain vegetables are cultivated in proportions that are contrary to the view of primitive nature. We by no means would imply that the want of care respecting health, cleanliness and ventilation of the cocooneries are things indifferent; but we think that these ill suited conditions, that give to silk worms many other very disastrous diseases, have not any influence on the invasion of the must, car dine; or that if they have any such, it is simply to increase its ravages, in preserving in the frame the dead individuals which soon furnish seed capable of infecting the worms which have escaped up to the moment of the, attacks of the epidemic. Such is to be done doubtless to attain the end proposed, of finding means of preserving our frames from this plague. Among the means of prevention recommended we notice burning liquid tar morning and evening in the room where the cocoonery is infected. During storms burn it constantly. As a cure-one gram me of fluid chloride of lime, carbonate of soda twelve gram mes, calcined alum sixteen gram mes, in five litres of water, isa receipt said to be excellent for the purpose. The <a name="disease90"><mark>disease</mark></a> above mentioned does not seem to have prevailed so greatly in our country as in Europe. Still it does not seem amiss to know how much injury may be done by its ravages, their nature and the means of preventing or remedying the <a name="evil26"><mark>evil</mark></a>. Several very interesting treatises or papers on the culture of silk worms might very appositely find a' place; in our appendix did our room allow. He can, however, only insert that of Mr. By ram, and which a very competent judge says is just the thing that is wanted. It is clear and simple, yet practical, and in a small compass em bodies much valuable information- Ex. a. 179 may, however, sub join some papers relating to the silk culture should our space allow. The Chinese mode of managing silk worms, their varieties, as also of the mulberry, with the peculiar varieties of each, may likewise be found described in a volume of M. Julie n; portions or rather a summary of which may be found in- the New York Farmer and' Mechanics. We should at once transfer some of these articles to our pages but for fear that our limited space will not allow of it, we can therefore only recommend it as containing much that is both valuable and interesting. To show the progress of the production of this article in Englanditis said to be a well known fact that a pair of silk stockings presented to Queen Elizabeth was worth their weight in gold. Now, however, Mr. Mcculloch estimates the consumption of silk stockings and gloves, simply, annually, to be 2,500,000, equal to 10 or                              $12,000,000. In forming our estimates of the crop for 1847, we have gone back to the census returns, and have corrected them by that basis. We have somewhat reduced the aggregate, though we believe there has been some increase net t, we think the estimate of 1845 may have been too high. Sugarthis is a crop which, so far as regards that made from the cane, is almost confined to Louisiana, and hence it might seem an easy matter to form an estimate of the amount, and it would be so, were the result known early enough to be embraced in our report. But the process of manufacture is going on during the last month we are forming our estimates, and the entire results are not reached till after our estimates have been made. We think, however, from all the information we have been able to gather, that the crop has been a good one, and the product is large. The New Orleansdeltain December, says that "the crop of sugar in Louisiana, it is estimated by competent judges, will exceed the crop of last year by at least one hundred thousand hogs heads. The quantity of molasses of this crop will even exceed that of the sugar as compared, with the product of last year. Notwithstanding the unfavorable ness of the weather, the extensive character of the crops, and the fullness of the cane, throughout the state will fully justify the calculation of the produce of the season. The crop of 1846, it is ascertained, was about one hundred and forty thousand hogs heads. 'two hundred and forty thousand" it is stated, "is. an estimate which no one regards as extravagant. At the rate of fifty dollars per hogs head, this will give the sum of twelve million dollars, the value of a single product of twenty-three parishes in this state Of these parishes there are, however, but fourteen in which' sugar is a leading or principal product. Reducing about two millions 'or the value of sugar produced in the others, there are fourteen parishes which produce ten million dollars' worth of sugar The fact is also noticed that the idea is now exploded which considered that sugar could only be produced on alluvial soil. The experiment has been tried, and most successfully, on the high grounds back of Baton Gouge and above A you Vara; and still higher up on the Red river. The large increase of the sugar crop, among other things, is doubtless 6 wing to the improvements which have been made in the methods of manufacture. The attention of individuals, also, in Georgia, Alabama and Florida, is 180 X. turning somewhat more towards sugar as a product that may be cultivated to greater extent in those states. Texas will, however, eventually be the greatest rival of Louisiana in the cultivation. A variety of interesting particulars respecting the cultivation and manufacture of sugar might be quoted, but as there is not space to do them any justice, we would refer to He Rows- Commercial Review as containing many things on this subject worthy of perusal. The December number for 1847 is peculiarly valuable for this purpose. It will be recollected that the last report (1845) contained a letter from. Tales tier, Esq, U. S. Consul at Singapore, giving an account of the Chinese mode of cultivating sugar. Since that time a letter has been received from the same gentleman, in which, alluding to the former one, he says: "since communicating to you the Chinese mode of forcing the development of sugar cane plants, by close packing in a pit, as formerly described in my communication, it has often appeared to me to be particularly well adapted to the circumstances of Louisiana, where, owing to the climate, he planting of the cane is late, in consequence of which it scarcely comes to maturity when the approach of the cold season obliges it to be cut. By the Chinese mode, would it not be practicable to pack the plants in the manner indicated in the autumn, and then keep them covered over, unexposed to the frost through the winter, during the period of which they would slowly ve get ate, and in the spring be found ready for planting, advanced at least one month over other plants not so treated the effect of which would be to give the cane more ripe king ?a? If this mode is not already in practice, it would certainly do no harm to bring it before the public The suggestions seem to be worthy of attention, and it might be well foi our sugar planters, if they have not done so, to make the experiment. Possibly much benefit might result from the course recommended. The steady advance in improvement of Louisiana, affords encouragement to believe, that the time may not be far distant, when this state, aided by Florida and Texas, will be able to furnish enough to meet all the demands for consumption of this article in the United States. This would be a very desirable consummate on, not merely on account -of the growing prosperity of this state, but as occasioning still increased exchange of products from other states.

In 1844, the v amount produced from all the sugar growing countries in the world wvudown at 778,000 tons, of which 200,000 was supplied by Cuba alone. I tis probable that by this time, therefore, it can scarcely be less than 8 50 to 9000 00 tons, if we include be et and map le sugar. It is estimated that Great Britain consumes as much as 250,000 tons, the rest of Europe 450,000,the United States 150 to 160,000 tons, or more; Canada and the other British Colonies, 25,000 tons. The amount of be et root sugar made in France in 1846 1847, was estimated at 107,190,110 pounds, being an increase of 26,596,432 pounds on the quantity manufactured the previous year. This article shows the importance of perseverance in such experiments as hold out the probability of success. It si well known, as a fact of history, that the origin of this manufacture as a national one, sprung from the necessities of the French people, when in their wars, they were cut off from the usual supplies of cane sugar by the West I n dies. It is not less, too, a matter of record, how great was the ridicule cast upon the Emperor Napoleon for his efforts by way of encouragement to this business. But the best science of that scientific nation was brought to bear upon it one difficulty after another disappeared and now it has become a constantly enlarging and lucrative branch of industry, not only supplying the means of livelihood to multitudes, but in a measure, relieving the whole realm from dependence on foreign nations for this useful article of subsistence and luxury. Were equal industry and science applied in this country, either to the manufacture of be et or corn stalk sugar it is believed that the Most important results might be effected. In some future years very probably such may be the case. We have not been able to learn of any experiments recently, in reference to the latter article. As this year was so fine a one for the growth of the corn crop, had there been attention given to experiments respecting maize sugar, it is not improbable that they might have been crowned with success. But so long as incredulity bars out effort, or rather there is no immediate necessity to aid in overcoming it, but little can be expected. Met the success of the first crude trials which have been made, has been fully equal to that of the earliest attempts respecting the manufacture of the be et sugar, and enough to warrant the sanguine expectations. That a syrupy or molasses can be made from the corn stalk, seems to be readily admitted. That sugar has been made is equally certain; that it may become a profitable object for the agriculturists will doubtless be demonstrated, when a more determined effort has been made to remove the difficulties and overcome the obstacles which have hitherto impeded the graining of the syrupy. Such encouragement might be drawn also from the improvement which has taken place in the manufacture of map le sugar. It is but a few yearssincthe highest reach of art in this manufacture produced only a fine muscovadolike sugar, and now by the improved processes, specimens are annually exhibited at the agricultural fairs, vying with the most beautiful loaf sugar. This has been effected by greater attention to cleanliness in the preparation 182 X. of the sap, and the improvements in the methods of graining and refining the sugar. Different methods have heretofore been given as employed by individuals to whom premiums have been awarded for the best manufactured map le sugar. We sub join one of the most recent, furnished by S. Tinker of Rich land, Oswego county, New Work, to whom was given the premium of the county society, September last The sap is boiled in a potash and cauldron kettle, to a thick syrupy train it when warm let it stand twenty-four hours to settle, then pour it off, heaving back all that is impure. To clarify fifty pounds, take one quart of milk, one ounce of saleratusand the whites of two eggs, well mixed; boil it again until hard enough to lay upon a saucer, then let it stand in the kettle and cool. Stir it very little to keep it from taking in the kettle. For draining, use a tube, tunnel shaped, say fifteen inches square at the top, and coming to a point at the bottom. But in your sugar when cold, tap it at the bottom and keep a flannel cloth damp on the top, two or three thicknesses. When drained, dissolve the sugar in pure warm water, and clarify and drain as before. There is considerable difficulty in estimating the amount of map le sugar produced. One or two considerations, however, deserve weight in addition to the character of the season which always exercises a very important influence on the subject. In most of the older states the increased cutting of timber will tend yearly to lessen the amount. This, too, may operate to a less extent in the older of the new states in the west, as parts of Ohio and  n diana. To far, therefore, as this effect may have any influence we should naturally look for the most decided increase in a very favorable way in the most recently settled states. Another thing to be regarded is the comparative low price of imported sugar. When foreign sugar is high, or when there is a short crop abroad, there will naturally be a greater attention paid to the map le sugar as a supply of the deficiency. When it can be procured, however, in large quantities, and at a low price, the need of the manufacture of another article at home will not be felt. At present the price of sugar is comparatively low, and we are led to believe, from the information furnished us, that less attention has been paid than usual to the production of map le sugar even in those states where it has been hitherto most abundant. In some sections of the country, also, there is considerable complaint of the badness of the season while in others the alternate freezing and thawing is assigned as a. reason for the greater productive ness of this crop. In. the whole, we are inclined to believe that in Paine, New Hampshire and Vermont, there has been a slight increase a lessened crop in the rest of New England, New Work, and most of the middle states, that the same has been the case in Ohio, about the same, or, perhaps, a better crop in I n diana, I illinois, an increased quantity in Michigan, I own and Wisconsin. In reviewing the estimates of past years, and again referring to the census, we have been led, however, somewhat to reduce the comparative estimate of 1845 and this fact must be kept in mind -in examining the column for 1847; as it may produce a lessened amount in the table even in cases where a per cent age of increase has been allpedEx. 
OTHER Products. Besides the crops which. have already passed under notice, there are others which contribute not a little to the agricultural resources of our country, and which are too importaicid127t to be passed over in silence. Some of these had for a long time, held a place in the list of agricultural products raised by our farmers and planters. Others have been but recently introduced, and are but partially cultivated. Among the different crops, in question there are, likewise, some of them which are adapted to particular sections as being unable to bear the severity of a colder climate, while others may flourish with equal success in all parts of the Union. It is customary among writers to divide the remaining crops into the root crops, the god fruits, the oil or drug plants, and the productions of the orchard and garden; and although we may not attempt closely to pursue such a classification, yet there may be, likewise, some advantage in bearing it in mind. The root drop includes the turn in, the be et, the carrot, the par s nip, rutabaga, nmangelwurtzel, and artichokes, and their use is great, as helping to furnish a substitute for other fodder for animals, as well as contributing in a lesser degree more directly to the sustenance of mankind. The circular sent from the office embraced the most prominent of these, and from the answers returned, it would appear, that they have done well. The greatest yield reported seems to be in the state of New Work, and if we may judge from the. information we have received, we should judge that they are more cultivated in that state, and one or two of the New England states than in any other part of the country. The returns of the average per acre vary considerably. Of bees 600 to 1 200 bushels, carrots 500 to 1 200, turn is from 1000 to 2000, the rutabaga 600 to 1200. ' This is greater than we have noticed from any of the other states, by from one third to one half It is believed that more attention might well be devoted to these crops. The great importance of the turn in crop in Great Britain is almost universally acknowledged there. Will yard, alluding to the Swedish turn in or rutabaga, says: " This very valuable root was one of the most important introduction s into British agriculture, for without it a sufficient quantity of animal food for our present large population could not have been produced. It was introduced by Air Joseph Ranks about fifty years ago, but as the old race of British farmers believed nothing could be good, it did not come much into cultivation for twenty years. I well remember, about forty years ago, a farmer, supposed in those days to be one of the best in this neighborhoods may to me find you are a great grower of Swedish turn is; you wont continue to be so. I have tried them, but found them so hard and sticky that I will never grow another' His were, I have no doubt, as he de ascribed, from being sowed broad cast, and left too thick on the ground. The raising a good supply of winter food for cattle, is the very life and soul of farming, for the old saying is a just one, ' no food, no cattle; no cattle, no dung; no .dung. no corn' The abundance or deficiency of the Swede crop throughout the country has a great effect on the price of wheat. If abundant, a large supply of meat is brought to market, the price is consequently low, and when the price of meat is low, the price of bread will not be high. If the crop proves to be deficient, there will be less than an average supply of meat; this will cause the price to be high, raise the price of bread, and consequently, raise the price of wheat 184 X. a. The following is the method by which the Rev. Mr. Aux table, distinguished as an English agriculturists, raised twenty tons of Swedes to an acre. He gave the account at the Sturminster agriculture society. He says: "I determined that I would grow twenty tons of Swedes an a ore, and five tons of tops. If you burn twenty tons, the result would be 500 is. of ashes. Now these ashes consist more than one half of potash, one third of soda, one-eighth of sulphuric acid, (which we get in bones) and the other eighth. of sulphuric acid, with a little magnetic. I then got a lot of saw dust and put it under pigs, and delayed it with phosphorus acid. Now how was I to get more potash? I got wood ashes, and found that these wood ashes contained about two pounds of potash to the bushel, and two pounds of soda. Next, I wanted to get the phosphates. These I got from 200 lbs. of I ch above gun no. The next thing was, how was I to put in the manure? My theory was to make holes about two feet apart, but how was the manure to be applied without destroying the seed? for it is so powerful it will grow no weeds between. I got some good garden <a name="mould15"><mark>mould</mark></a> in which I mixed the seed and manure. The crop began to grow, but the fly got very busy, and I was afraid that after all, I was what they calldiddled." You know white seed will terminate three or four days before Swedes; I got some white seed, and when the plant appeared the fly left my Swedes to go upon the white turn is. There the children neglected to drop the. seeds upon the manure, the roots were not half so big as a marble. When about three weeks ago we took up these turn is. He weighed nineteen and three-fourth fond upon the highest portions of the land, and upon the heaviest twenty-three tons an acre, the value of which i ve will now discuss. What was the cost? Thirty bushels of wood ashes 15. 52 cut. of gun no, 17s. 8d 32 shillings. For manual labor, 19 s 6d. The rent I have placed at is. the acre; rates and titles at 2s. 5d. I n all, in round numbers, 4. Now let us see what the Swedes were worth. I find that 42 lbs, of Swedes will on an average put on 2 lbs. of live flesh. When the value of that at seven cents a pound, dead weight, reckoning that the live weight is to the dead weight as four to three, brings my Swedes to 1 7s. I d. a ton. Now what is the value of the dung? I bring it to is. I d which brings it to 21s. 2d. But I will take the popular value of 15s. 5d. a ton. Now for 4 an acre I have a return of 300 per cent, and if that is not a sufficient return I dont know what is. *a* *a* *a* We agriculturists support 27 millions of people, and our produce amounts to the enormous sum of 540 millions sterling, whilst the exported manufactured goods amount, on the average of six years, to not quite 47 millions The following table, prepared by Stephen, gives the number of turnipsthere should be on an imperial acre, at given distances between the drills, and between the plants in the drills, and the weight of the crops .at specified weights of each turn in. The distance between the drills is taken at the usual width of 27 inches; the distance between the plants is what is allowed to the different sorts of turn is, and the imperial acre contains6272640 square inches. In altering the width between the drills, a calculation from these data can easily be made of what ought to be the weight of crop at these given weights of turnipsEx. a. 185Urual dis t.

This seems to show the vast importance of regulating the distance, and in the management of the turn in crop. Parrots also form a rich food for cows, and from experiments made in raising them, they hold out the inducement of a fair regeneration. The following i the report made by E. H. Derby, of West Newton, in Massachusetts, who raised, of this root crop, at the rate of 1,080 bushels per acre. The variety he used was the orange carrot. He received the premium of the Middlesex society, in 1845.. I ode of cultivation The soil, which is a yellow loam, was appropriated, in 1844, to corn and vine, was moderately manured in the hill, and yielded a fair crop. In 1845, about May 25, it was ploughed by one man, a team of two horses, and the plough put into the beam. Before sloughing, about 18 buck loads of the com post described below, was spread over the field. 'after sloughing, the field was harrowed and carefully raked, and the seed put in by a machine in drills, twenty inches 186 X. apart, arid without making any ridges. The field was needed three times, and the tops covered the surface. Any of the carrots averaged from one to two pounds in weight.

It is hoped that the seed of so mt of the best varieties of English growth will be received at this office before long, for distribution. The carrot, as well as the be et, has been applied, with considerable success, in England and on the continent, fort mixing with flour and making bread. Various accounts are given in the foreign journals which show that it maybe made a tolerable substitute for this purpose. The art i choke has also received a share of attention, as a means of meeting the deficiency from the potato crop. This root, it is .believed, will hereafter become more popular and its cultivation be found to be profitable. The god fruits, such as peas and beans, are not cultivated, generally, to any great extent in this country, except in gardens. In the south, however, the pea appears to hold an important place. In some parts of Virginia no little reliance is placed on its aid. One of our correspondents from that state, thus speaks of it. After having alluded to the corn crop, he says: Next in point of rank comes the pea crop, which has always been of great importance in this coli my. It is for the most part raised among corn, being planted between the corn hills and made at the expense of very little additional x. a. 187 tillage, other than what the corn alone would receive. After securing enough for seed the peas are usually fed off the lands to hogs, and in that way are a very important auxiliary to the crop of corn, many farmers nearly fattening their pork on peas and potatoes, but in addition to the peas made for hogs, we are beginning to cultivate white peas much more than formerly as a sale crop, usually finding them ready of sale at fair prices, but the present has been a bad year for the whole pea family, and the crop may be put down as twenty-five per cent. below that of 1845.

The class of plants which rank under the name of the cabbage plants are cultivated to a limited extent, but furnish a considerable amour it of products both for the use of man and the domestic animals. They contain but littlenutritive matter in comparison to their bulk, but yet are more or less used. Among these we may mention the thousand headed cabbage, a name which seems to have been considered by some a mere in position, unworthy of the least credit. We refer to it here, because the seed of this plant was distributed from this office formerly. To show, however, that it has its merits, we may quote from the London Gardeners' Chronicle, edited by Prof. Kindly, one of the first botanists of Europe, and who could never be instrumental in calming on the public a thing so utter ty unworthy as it may have been conjectured, without any knowledge of the plant, to be. One correspondent of the Chronicle says, "I n reply to a question lately put in your Chronicle, I beg to inform you that I have one and a half acres of the thousand headed cabbage. The half acre I began stripping the last week in October, and up to the end of December I had from it twenty to twenty-five bushels of leaves for my cows per die m. It has been subjected to the alternate frosts and thaws, snows and rains of this very severe winter, and for some days was under water, in consequence of the Thames overflowing its banks. I am so convinced of their excellence for dairy feeding, that I shall this year grow four acres on the plan recommended in Baxters Took of Agriculture, in the intervals between rows of beans. My method of culture, which I found to succeed, is this: In Of arch last I sowed one pound of seed in my garden, In June I planted out three feet distant, every day, in land broken up by the spade from the grass during the preceding winter- The weather being very dry, I employed one or two old men to water each plant well, having first put round each plant as much of a mixture composed of one part of super 1 -x. phosphates of lime to three parts ashes, as could be taken up by the thumb and two fingers. As soon as the plants were well rooted, I earthed them up in ridges, and formed the intervals, and in September the luxuriant e of the cabbages was such, and the ground was so completely covered by their long and broad spreading leaves, that it was no easy or comfortable matter o attempt to walk up the rows." Another person also says, "I know of no green more hardy, Cap land pale not excepted Another still says, I have been in the habit of growing this kind ofbrassica for at least twenty years. It is perfectly hardy, so much so that it will stand, any temperature in England or Scotland. I from experience consider it a great help to the farmer, particularly in the lambing season, and sheep and cows are very fond of it. The produce of this green crop is very abundant when well managed." And yet another, "I tried some, and found them so useful that I grew more every year. They are the hardest plant I know of the brass i ca tribe. I have at this moment a flock of seventy sheep with their lambs, deriving fully half their keep from them, having the run of a large bed of them. They are also a most excellent cow: food for this month (march) and April. Last year I weighed some of the, stronger ,when in full vigor, first ready for use, and found them twenty-four pounds; 4 have no doubt they may be grown to thirty or thirty-five pounds After these statements we trust any further vindication of its distribution to be unnecessary, and would hope that those who may have deemed it matter of censure will do us the justice of feeling that they were greatly mistaken in their estimate of it, as deserving to be classed among the in positions of the day. Large quantities, likewise, of pump king are often raised for the us* of stock; and this vegetable may perhaps deserve more attention, as it requires no additional ground, and is raised among other crops without impairing their productive ness. As an instance of the productive ness of this plant, we notice that of J. B. Toll, of Monroe county, Ohio, who, on seventy-seven rods of land, or not five-eighths of an acre, raised 19,000 pounds, besides seventy bushels of potatoes, which would give of pump king at the rate of fifteen tons to the acre. Unions have also been mentioned in some of the former reports. He merely refer to them now, to quote from a French publication, a mode of raising them in Russia, as furnished to the I imperial Economical Society oft. Petersburg. The onion is cut into four parts leaving the quarters, however, hanging together' at the root, the onion also having first been hung up and dried in the smoke. The same plan, however, it appears, by experiment, will answer without drying by the smoke. The quarters thus united are planted, and produce four fine onions. The onion thus treated is the potato onion, and this course has been successfully pursued in one instance for thirty years, resulting in abundant crops. Asparagus belongs rather to the c urinary vegetables as its use is confined solely to the table, but prized as it is as a health full esch lent, the following description of its mode of culture in Germany, sent with a specimen of rare excellence, weighing six pounds for the hundred heads, to the editor of the London Gardeners' Chronicle, may be acceptable to many of our fellow citizens. The writer mentions that the asparagus in Germany is not suffered to become green, but is eaten white for the same reason that it is most x. a. 189 raised above ground in England, first that the eat able part may be larger, and secondly that the flavor may be finer. The manner of growing it is as follows: "I t is never planted otherwise than in a deep, light and sandy soil, which has been trenched to a depth of 3 feet, well drained and well manured. A thick layer of horse dung is put on the bottom of the trench and mixed with the soil. Strong loam y andclayey soil is decidedly disadvantageous to the growth of this vegetable. I t will not thrive in it, does not become tender and will very often become spotted, and which the common people here call iron <a name="mould16"><mark>mould</mark></a>, especially if drainage has been neglected. We take plants of 2 or 3 years ocid127l according, to their vigor, and usually plant them in furrows which are made at two feet distance and from 1 to 11 feet deep, The distance between the furrows is likewise two feet. In these furrows the plan f~ are permitted to grow uncovered from the month of March or April, the usual and best time for planting, till the beginning or middle of November, at all events before severe frost is coming on. The soil which has been taken out of the furrows and heaped up at the sides is then put in, and the beds are completely level led. The plants have had time during summer to establish themselves sufficiently. Next spring the young shoots will make their appearance above ground and if every thing has been duly attended to; if strong and healthy plants have been selected, and if besides water has been given during a given season, not a single one ought to fail. Some people begin to cut the strongest shoots in the third year, but a better result will be obtained by leaving them undisturbed till the fourth summer, only giving them every spring in February or March, a good dressing of cow dung. Manure is the most essential requisite for growing fine and tender asparagus. The shoots are cut at sunrise and late in the evening at a length of not more than nine inches, cutting them with a long knife under ground as soon as the top of the shoot is lifting the soil. Asparagus will always have the finest taste if eaten immediately after having been gathered, but ought never to be kept longer than one day, and should be covered meanwhile with, light earth, sand or some other material of this description. It is a very bad practice lately in use with our market gardeners to immense asparagus immediately after cutting in a tub with water, leaving it in the water till they bring it to market. By this practice the finer flavor is altogether lost, and the cooks should be warned against doing the same. Whenever manure is not very expensive, the culture of asparagus pays well, since the highest and most sandy land where nothing else can be grown with advantage can easily be adapted to its culture, and will yield a rent for a long series of years. Besides the same land may be made use of for carrots when the time of cutting is over. Giving myself some hundred steps from the Baltic, and having read different accounts of the famous asparagus culture at the sea coast near an Sebastian in Pain, I have last year made the experiment to grow it in pure sea sand containing no hum us or vegetable matter whatever. It only received a moderate supply of manure, and has even not been watered during the last hot summer, nevertheless it is growing this year so well, that I might have cut a tolerable quantity as big as a hcid1271ys finger if I would be foolish enough to do so. I have several thine ca ten green asparagus in  talk and France, but I dare confess for want of better. As far as regards tenderness I am at a <a name="loss31"><mark>loss</mark></a> to understand how asparagus can be improved by being exposed to the drying influence of the air, wind( and sunshineThe190 X. above account is dated at Travemunde near Iii beck, and the to de mentioned of raising asparagus would seem to be worth the trial. Of    n this connexion we may mention a common plant which is regarded as a mere weed, but which is highly recommended as a vegetable for the table; we mean the common settle, to be used like spina ch. In the London Gardeners Chronicle the following directions are given for its use." Soil the young tops and after pressing out the water from them, warm them again with a little cream, butter or dripping and a very little pepper and salt' The editor of the Chronicle adds, the young settle sprouts are among the best of all ingredients in spring soups. The oil plants as they are termed, are quite numerous, though but little has yet been done in cultivating them in this country. We have heretofore alluded to them in our former reports, and some of them have been particular sized. In addition to those notices we may mention a new species of rape seed, which is spoken of as having been noticed in the Royal. Agriculturalsociety of England with commendation. This is the brass i ca chinensis, or Chinese rape seed, called also the s hang ai oil plant, a hardy annual, which is grown for the sake of its oil over the whole country, ioufid that city, but which may be cultivated in every kind of soil. It yields an abundance of oil. It is hoped that we may be able in the course of another year to procure some of the seed for distribution. Another Chinese plant which may perhaps be suitable for cultivation in the warmer sections of our country, and respecting which we hope to gain information hereafter, and perhaps obtain the seed, is the tallow tree of China, Tilling i semi fera, called by the Chinese ookcieon, which yields a beautiful vegetable tallow. It is about the height and, appearance of a pear tree, with twisted branches and a large rounded head. The fruit is enclosed in a dusk like a chestnut, and when ripe the dusk opens of itself showing three white grains of the big ness of a filbert. These grains are subjected to pressure or boiled in water, and the oily matter collected is hard and white like tallow. Three pounds of vegetable oil are mixed with every ten pounds of the tallow, and the candles made of it are also coated with wax. They are said to be nearly equal to wax candles. The trees themselves having leaves of a deep purple or brilliant red, and the blossoms being of a bright yellow, the groves formed by them are said to be very beautiful. Dora fuller description of the process, see Fortunes China, pp. 656 7. The ground pea of the south, or as it is sometimes called, the go user orpindar pea, is highly recommended in the Tallahasseefloridian as an oil plant. The account of it is as follows: " To a few only it appears to be known that the 'product of this plant gives out an oil in some respects unequal led, as an accompaniment to the table: in its natural state this oil has no rival, clear and mild, with a peculiar taste extremely gratifying to the palate, rich and battery; it is of that consistency so much admired in the preparation of salads, anchovies, &c, for table use' " Among plants the go user ranks deservedly as one of the surest crops, not with holding a generous yield even on poor land, and amply acknowledging the superiority of rich land if light and friable. The pea is easily gathered and with less labor than any of the seeds or beans is ready for the press. When pulled, which is most readily effected, and ground, the oil flows most freely and uncommonly clean from the press; but when submitted to the kinownmlodes of clarifying oil, it becomes liquid and pure, and when immediately bottle and sealed appears to re man in a state of freshness, and retains the fine odor so highly agreeable to the aciteurs of vegetable oils in the prepare. a. 191 ration of food. The refuse, after expression, is admirable for hogs, and the vine for stock, if not returned to the soil in gathering the pea; if saved and cured, which is effected with much ease, it miles in the cutting box well with rye, barley oats and rice. The product of the fodder is estimated at more than a ton to the acre; and of peas when cultivated alone and well, fifty to seventy-five bushels. The plant is cultivated much north of us but from fair trial it is found that, like other producing plants, it delights in the rays of a warm southern sun and soil, and that the product is richer with a finer aroma, than the oil from the same plant produced in Virginia and Carolina. I have no hesitation in saying that if this oil was fairly introduced into the northern states, it would take a high rank at the table of thebonvivants. This oil is more readily and with less labor and expense, procured from the pea than it is from any other seed, bean or pea, we know of. It is pulled and ground by simple machinery, and the press required for the extraction of the oil is neither very powerful nor expensive. The production of this oil for commerce challenges the early attention of planters and small as well as large capitalists. Any quantity could be produced and prepared for market, a great part of the labor being of that kind that would suit all; the child, old age, and the cripple all might be employed in the production of this new material. I feel confident that after a little use it would become a successful rival of the best table oil of Europe." If the above account be correct, it would seem that the article is well worth a thorough expericid127ent, and the question may thus be easily decided. The analysis of the k rape plant in respect to its in organic constituents, is thus given by Dr. Rammelsburg. Need. Straw.

In the Journal d Agriculture Critique et de Jardinage, we find the mention of a new oleiferous plant, which is warmly urged upon the attention of the cultivates of France, as possessing many advantages. It is stated that it may be raised even in the temperature of the north of France, and requires but little expense. We have translated it and insert it here, thinking it may be useful. Some of. the advantages it possesses are thus stated. Children of twelve to fifteen years old, girls and boys, are enough for the labor, which is only a slight wedding, so as not to injure the roots of the plant, but which must be done four or five times a year. The gathering of the fruits is within the capacity of children of the same age. The tree only reaches to the height of a metre (about three and a third feet) and scissors are sufficient to take off the fruits, an lost exactly as the grapes in the vineyards of He doc. There are no severe labors which require adult men, except in the preparation of the soil and the planting of the shrubs, after which 192 X. the field nay be given up to the hands of children; who are abundantly able to carry on the cultivation. The extraction of the oil is easy and not expensive, the pulp of the fruit which contains it, being softer than that of the olive, a weak pressure only is necessary to express out the juice. After' being left at rest long enough, known to any one who is accustomed to it, the juice separates into two different liquids: the upper one retains the white color which the must possessed under the action of the press, and the lower one, if the vessel containing it is transparent, looks like a limp id and golden oil, which can be drawn out clear by a fas set placed in the bottom of the vessel, when the person who was charge of the business thinks the proper time has come. This mode of de panting it is preferable because the gross substance which swims on top and which nearly a third part of the entire liquid would mix anew with the oil if it was taken out from the top or from the side. The remainder of the manipulations and care to be bestowed on the oil may be learned ,by example, or the lessons of those who are skilled in the business t is not only by the oil which is derived from it that the o leisler is recommended to agriculturists, every thing on the fruit may be put to use, even to the nuts, which on account of their hardness and rounded form are sought for by the turners to make children collars, &c. As for the substance that remains after the pressing, a chemist of Paris has shown that it may at a little expense be used for the toilet te, and produce an article superior to almond paste, flour of nuts, and which is used for perfume by. The residue m which the must leaves after it is drawn off is capable of being made into soap and also' furnishes various ingredients for perfume by. The cook too may lay claim to a parted the products of this shrub; its green fruits may be prepared and preserved in salt like those of the olive; they are then much like the delicate olives of Province." It is likewise said that moderate soils, and even such as are unsuitable for the culture of the cereals a e good enough for the of easter, which in almost all soils gives such abundant products as to make its cultivation profitable. The above account would seem to be worthy of attention and further inquiry, as it may be, this plant would prove suited to many portions of our country if it were introduced. We have heretofore given some accounts of the cultivation of made der, and spoken of this dye plant as one which may be made an article of profit. In Appendix No. 11, we have sub joined a paper on this subject, furnished by M. B. Late ham, Is c, editor of the Ohio Cultivator, which it is believed will afford much valuable information. The value of m adder imported into this country is considerable, and if the article is well prepared, there seems no reason to doubt that it would find a ready market. Ladder was successfully introduced into France one hundred years since, by Mean Ll then, a Persian, to whom a statue is to be erected. This plant it is said l, now returns to France nearly 25,000,000 francs, or     $5,000,000 per annum. The amount of the m adder crop varies greatly one year with another, and it is difficult to give the mean crop. A hectare it is said, in a well manured ground and in favorable circumstances of temperature, will produce 5,000killogrammes of dry roots, while in unfavorable circumstances it will riot yield more than one half or one fourth of this amount. From the commencement of the present cencid127tly, the greatest crops are stated not to r exceed 2 5000 quintals by measure and the least about 10,000 to 12,000. He gather these particulars from i the Anna les de l Agriculture Francaise. X. a. 193 The average amount per annum of m adder imported into this country as appears by returns procured at the Treasury Department, from 1845 to 1847, is about 6,110,000 pounds, and in value, about       $600,000. The value given is believed, however, to be too low, as it falls below the usual wholesale market price, one quarter if not one half. In the communication of Mr. Late ham, editor of the Ohio Cultivator, (see Appendix No. 11,) to which we have added the returns of the Treasury Department just mentioned, we have most decisive evidence that m adder can be successfully cultivated in the United States. The demand for it will no doubt increase, but if the attention of our agriculturists is directed towards it, they will probably not only find it profitable; it may, too, eventually be raised in sufficient quantities to meet the demand. All that seems to be needed now is, the requisite information in respect to the mode of cultivation. This is furnished in the article in our Appendix, to which we have referred. A number of plants as food for stock are mentioned, which it may likewise be not amiss to allude to here, and the introduction of which would perhaps be attended with good effects. Some of them have been partially tried in this country, but perhaps not sufficiently so, to decide as satisfactorily respecting their real value. Billet is highly recommended for soiling purposes, and especially for feeding horses in some of the agricultural journals, and judging from the statements made respecting it, it is believed that more attention might be very profit ably devoted to its cultivation by our agriculturists. The pimpernell (po tedium sanguisorba) is a plant which is well known in Europe and its use for sheep is greatly esteemed# Mention of it will be found in Mr. Fleischmanns communication. It is called the burst grass and has to some extent been tried in this country, but its use is very limited or scarcely known as yet among our farmers. In the Landwirthschaftlichedorfzeitung, we find it most highly recommended for much cows. It is said to increase the quantity of milk and also its richness. Rows are very fond of it. It is adapted to dry and sandy lands, yields a large quantity of herb age and may be cut from time to time for feeding in the course of the summer. It is also an excellent winter fodder and lasts often as pasturage in mild climates from autumn till spring, preserving its freshness of leaf and goodness for food. (see Appendix No. 1, with plate Another plant which is presented as being entitled to greater favor, is thedcicory or succor y, or wild en dive chi corium intybusa hardy English perennial plant. This was formerly highly recommended by Arthur Young as a forage plant, he having himself tried it with success on his own farm. I n its natural state it is said to appear poorly. It has long thick, perpendicular roots, a tuft of let tube looking leaves, and when it shoots into flower its stems rise from one to three feet high, rigid, rough, branched and clothed with leaves and blue flowers. It is found in England, in dry calcareous soils. In the Continent it has been long extensively cultivated as a substitute for c lover. The roasted roots are also used there instead of coffee. I tis hardy, with stands the winter and comes forward early in the spring. I t will grow in almost any soil however poor, and the mode of cultivation is said to be extremely .simple; the land must be deeply ploughed, and about April the seed must be drilled in rows, about nine inches apart; it must be well hold, singled and needed during the summer, and the plants will continue to thrive for several years. The account given of it in the London Gardeners' Chronicle, from which 13 194 X. we have quoted these particulars, is in substance the following: In 1787,. Arthur Young obtained some seed of chi cry, from M. Pretty de Palleneand tried it. for. Young had seen it prevailing in the meadows of Lombard y, and of the south of France, where it is said to grow naturally, also on the sides of the roads and paths and is used for a salad. A bushel of seed weighing about twenty pounds, is enough for an ardent, about three rooms. If sown in March, in ground well prepared by good tillage, and afterwards narrowed and rolled it has yielded two crops in a year. It is described as denying the several droughts and resisting the storm, is of early growth and with its large and tufted leaves spreading out sideways it covers the ground so as to retain the moisture and preserve its roots from the heat, which dries up other vegetable productions. I to s talks too, are thick and stiff so as to resist winds or rains. It is of rapid growth, and thus furnishes an abundance of fodder at a season, when cattle tired of winter feeding, greedily devour fresh plants. Mr. Pretty made three and even four regular cuttings of chi cry, the first in April, the second in June, the third inAugnstand the fourth in October, and also cut successively as he wanted it, a quantity for the feed of his cattle, and when, at the end of his field the plants that had been first cut were so grown again as to be ready for mowing a second time. There are no meadows, either natural or artificial it is said, the produce of which can be 'compared with that of the chi cry. Some comparisons are given. Mr. Pretty weighed the produce of an ardent of the finest ulcer ne, which when green, from the first three mowings, weighed only twenty-four or twenty-five thousand pounds to the English acre, and when dried 'to hay was reduced two thirds. The product of c lover, he found to be still less. While chi cry supplied green fodder to the amount of sixty-one thousand and ninety pounds per ardent, or seventy-two thousand five hundred and "forty-four pounds, or thirty-two tons per English acre, and allowing the same ratio of <a name="loss32"><mark>loss</mark></a> in drying, would give nearly eleven tons of hay. As a further recommendation, it is mentioned that cattle are never hurt by this species of fodder, which may be given to them for eight months in the year. It yields a crop too in the month of April, which c lover and ulcer ne do not. Rows easily become accustomed to it, and it is also salutary to horses. Mr. Pretty tried the experiment of mixing it with c lover, sainfoin and burned, which made a fine artificial meadow from the commencement of June. In a short time, however, chi cry took the lead and overpowered the other plants. The meadow was mown at the end of July, the weather proving favorable for the work. The six acres produced thirteen hundred bunches, weighing eleven or twelve pounds each. The fodder was excellent, and was much. relished by the cattle. The plants then came up again in September, afforded an abundant pasturage, which was consumed standing on the land, being given up to the sheep. The shepherd was well persuaded that this field of six acres, was more profitable to the flock than eighteen acres of the best ulcer ne would have been. It is difficult to make chi cry into hay, on account of its volume, as it dries ill unless the weather be favorable. As dry fodder, it was readily eaten by cattle, but it is better to use it when green, in which state it is estimated to furnish the most plentiful forage of any plait. Arthur Young cultivated it for years, recording his experiments upon its productive ness. In the first four years the acre able produce was one hundred and nineteeanions, or nearly thirty tons to the acre yearly; one of these years being a, X. a. 195 sowing year and one of extreme drought. The only difficulty mentioned in respect to it, is that of eradicating it from the ground. The roots are long and penetrate so deeply that no plough can go deep enough to prevent them from growing up thickly among the succeeding crop. It is therefore necessary to fallow (or sow some crop which requires the land to be well worked) after chi cry, before wheat or other grain drops are sown. Worn and straw fodder enters largely, into the conduct of the farm, and yet important as it is, no account has ever been taken of it by which an approximate estimate can be formed of its amount. I to price too does it appear in any of the lists of prices in the agricultural and other journals hat indefatigable agriculturists, Major J. Bones of Help ware, to whom we are indebted for aid in respect to the crops of that state, in his estimate places the value of it at                             $185,553,000, for the United States, which even vere large deductions to be allowed from it, would show that it ranks far beyond many other crops that are deemed generally more deserving of notice. We might mention other products which would answer for feeding stock and some may, perhaps, come under consideration w hen we take up the subject of the feeding of cattle, but we have already devoted all the space to the particular topic before us which we can allow. There are a variety of trees, which may yet deserve attention in parts of our country, and were they once introduced it seems probable they might be made profitable. The English walnut has been recommended as highly suitable for Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia; where the raising of this fruit might   be made lucrative. A single tree, sometimes, it is said, yields twenty-four bushels. Still further south it is believed trees of warmer climates might be introduced, and possibly, in future years, the tea tree and similar trees and shrub may become acclimated there. Experiments made in France seem to show that this is not mere wild conjecture. The attention of individuals at the south has been turned to the cultivation of the olive, with a prospect of success. By experiments the sensibility of such projects may be developed, i and it would be no more surprising that they should prove successful than that others deemed more visionary have done so. There is a steady advance in the attention paid to the cultivation of orchard fruit and such. others as peaches, grapes and the lesser kinds. Apples, indeed, are not so much cultivated as formerly for making cider, but greater attention is paid to some fine table fruit. In the various sections of the country, there are individuals who have devoted much time and care to watching the progress of improvement in this respect, and the result of whose observations will be found to be increasingly valuable. ' The success which has attended the effort to export apples to England ,and other foreign countries, has awakened a spirit of enterprise, and, probably, this business will hereafter become more general. But for this purpose the great circumspection of those who have led the way will be needful. Those specimens of our fruit which have been presented to foreign purchasers, by Mr. Well, l have been of such excellence, that an inferior kind would meet with but little favor. Judging from the information that we have gathered, we believe that while, perhaps, along the Atlantic border the, season has not been the most favorable to the apple crop, yet in the interior and the west, large u quantities of this fruit have been raised. Years, too, have poorly succeeded for a few years past some of the kinds most highly prized have seemed to be dying out. New needling varieties have, however, made their appearance and there is reason to hope that this fine fruit will regain its former standing 196 X. especially, as additional experience and skill are now directed to its cultivation. A similar remark may be applied to cher rise. Some of the old varieties have given way to new ones, and of these a portion of them are of rare excellence. Figures and descriptions of these may, from time to time, be noticed in our agricultural journals, and, perhaps, there has been no period in which there has been so great a number of really fine kinds occupying a place in our gardens and house yards as at the present. The p each crop of this year was seriously injured by the cold weather of the early part of the season. The buds were so severely touched that they were destroyed. The p each crop of Delaware, the most famous one in iheUnited States, is estimated by our correspondent there, at 300,000 baskets which, at 40 cents per basket, would amount to                               $120,000. There are about 2500 to 3000 acres devoted to this business. The p each orchards of Ohio are also large. In the Ohio Cultivator we have noticed a number of particulars which show that the business of cultivating this fruit is increasing in that part of our country, It is stated that a gentleman had purchased a farm of 100 acres for this purpose, for which 10,000 well bedded trees were on their way and coming from Philadelphia, as he said he was about to apply the experience gained in New Jersey and Delaxnare to this object that fine peaches may be raised in this state, is very evident from the specimens which are noted as having been exhibited at the horticultural fairs. At the fair in Columbus, it is stated in the Ohio Cultivator of September, fifteen specimens of Wander mark needling (from the seed) of the lemon cling, a remarkably handsome fruit, deep yellow flesh, fine red outside, measured over a foot in circumference! One weighed 14 ounces, and four together weighed 2 lbs. 14 ounces. In answer to the above, it is also stated in the same journal, that some have been raised in I illinois which measured 14 inches in circumference and weighed 18 ounces. In Fairfield county, Ohio, also, it is. asserted peaches have been raised 14 inches in circumference. In Long I s land, the p each is cultivated with advantage. In one of the public journals we notice mention of an orchard there which consists of 20 acres, from eight acres of which, at the second bearing the owner would reap about                               $1250. It is surprising, also, what quantities of strawberries find their way to the markets of our cities. A few particulars, only a slight portion, doubtless, of strawberry statistics, show that even from this comparatively small fruit, much profit must often result. Thus, we find it stated that in twenty-six days, 457 2 bushels were sold in New Work; 514 bushels in a single day. Over 80,000 baskets equal to 83 3 bushels, and weighing, probably, twenty-five torns were brought to that city in one day on the Erie rail road alone. The whole number of baskets sent to New York over this road in the course, of the season is given at 602,640, being an increase over the previous season of 212,000, or 24 per cent. The average value is about 39- cents per basket, the quantity 6 247 bushels, and the weight 260 tons; so that the persons residing along the road are supposed to have received about           $20,000 for strawberries in the last season. Large quantities of this fruit are lo gathered and sold in Cincinnati. A committee of the Horticultural Society put down the best three days' sale at 489, 514 and 411 bushels respectively. I tis also stated that a gentleman near Cincinnati was picking 100 bushels every day from a patch of sixty acres devoted to this object. By the report of the committee of the Cincinnati H6rticultural Society, the quantity sold x. there, in twenty-two days of 1846, is given at 4 150 bushels. :the report of the same committee for 1847, after promising that some small quanrtiftieshadbeen brought into the city as early as the 20th of May, commence their estimates May 25th, and end them June 2 1st; thus making twepty4fourdays, in which period they report 455 2 bushels. This is said to be the actual count of boxes in the market at 8 A. M. Now many came to i market, but went to taverns, restaurants and confectioners, also, the quantities sold at the corners of the streets, or carried from house to house, is matter, say they, of guess work. They suppose, however, that it might amount to twenty per cent. on the above amount, so that this would make a total of five thousand four hundred and sixty-two bushels, sold between the twenty fifth of May and the twenty first of June inclusive. In our former reports we have mentioned a variety of particulars respecting the cultivation of the grape, as well as its indigenous growth in this country. The attention given to it, both for the purposes of the table ,id the manufacture of wine, seems to be on the increase, if we may judge from the information which we have been able to acquire on the subject. Large quantities of this fine fruit are sold in the markets of New York and Cincinnati especially, as well as in some others of our cities. I investigations are also being made to determine the adaptation of the different grapes oPourcrountry for the purposes of making wine. In our Appendix, No. 12,we have given a communication on this subject from Mr. Long worth of Cincinnati, furnished to this office expressly for this report, in which much interesting information respecting the progress of this culture will be found. Other papers of interest on this subject may likewise be added if our room will allow. The cultivation of the grape has also been recommended for some of, the southern sections of our country. The enterprise, we notice, is to be undertaken somewhat largely in Florida, and the prospects of ultimate success are stated to be very good. The grape grows there most luxuriantly, and te only cause which has heretofore prevented persons from engaging in its culture, has he en the fear that the frequent rains might destroy the fruit. Method, however, is proposed to be adopted, of constructing harbors, so that the leaves may shade and shelter the grape. The result is not as yet stated, and perhaps 'it is still too soon to know its success or otherwise. Southalabama has been suggested as affording a favorable locality for the cultivation of the Ll Vaso grape, which is found in the vicinity of the falls of the mio Grande. The soil and climate, &c, are considered to be peculiarly adapted to it, and the desire has been expressed that efforts should be made to introduce it there. Besides the usual varieties of the native grape, which have been long known, and the merits of which have been more or less discussed in the agricultural journals, we, have noticed the mention of some others which may be referred to for a moment. In the Ohio Cultivator, anew variety is noticed as having been found at Gape Girardeau, bordering on the Mississippi, in Missouri, and which is supposed to have been introduced there by the early French settlers. It is thus described: In color and form the grapes resemble very closely the cat alba, but the flavor is quite different, being sweeter and more aromatic, and destitute of the picid127skytaste, also without a pulp. The vine is said to be perfectly hardy, arid it would appear to be worthy of more examination and propagation. A fine grape, on a small island near Oxford, Michigan, is also mentioned in the 198 X. a. Michigan Farmer. It is to Texas, however, and the region of country bordering thereupon, that we are probably to look for new varieties of native grapes. In a letter received at this office him Dr. C. B. Stewart 5 of Montgomery, Texas, he speaks of the great must and grape in very high terms. He says respecting it, that " it is produced and grows luxuriantly without cultivation, and in great perfection, in every part of Texas, and upon every variety of soil, growing equally well upon the high open prairie or in the densely wooded river bottom lands, seeking alike the loftiest trees and the lowliest prairie shrub, and frequently so completely covering the tree or shrub upon which it rests that an entire surface of the vine leaf is presented to the eye. The body of the vine often times attain to six inches in diameter' is roth and covered with a harsh bark, which, sealing off, discloses a smoother and somewhat tender mind; leaves very thick, rou g h brittle, serrated, of a dark green color upon the upper side and nearly white on the under side, and cupping under and about three to four inches in diameter. The fruit grows in bunches of eight or ten grapes, in immense numbers, and one-fourth of them being of the size of an ounce leaden ball, and a large proportion of the remainder three quarters of the size of a three quarter ounce ball none of -them of less size than the half ounce balls full of juice, yet having a thick hull and large pulp surrounding the seed. In August, when they appear to be ripe; they are very pleasant to eat, the juice sweet and of an agreeable acerbity, but leaving a farewell t want upon the throat, and which is unpleasant. Towards the latter part of September and October this effect is sensibly diminished, and they are much sweeter and more pal a table. From a bushel of these grapes, in clusters, loosely thrown into the measure, I obtained, by a slight pressure in a linen cloth, two gallons and a half of a mucilaginous fluid of a deep red wine color, which remained by me for some two months, unchanged in appearance or taste; a partial separation of the mucin age has since taken place, and the fluid has now become pleasantly acid, of a strong, agreeable venous flavor, without having passed through any perceptible ferment at ion. I have not, myself, the time for experiments testing the kind and qualities and yield of wine from this grape, but such experiments as have been made with them have satisfactorily determined that red wines of a high quality and fine flavor can readily be obtained from them. The early inhabitants of the country resorted to this grape to obtain their vinegar, but were not successful in producing ace to us ferment at ion, until, by the admixture of a proper quantity of water, the juice was diluted sufficiently for the ace to us ferment at ion to take place, when good vinegar was obtained. Experiments made some two years since, near Columbus, Colorado, Texas, resulted in the production of fine wine from this grape, of a quality between claret and burgundy, of a superior flavor. In one experiment sugar was added, from the belief that the sac charing matter .f the grape was insufficient to produce ferment at ion; in the other, none was used; the results were equally successful, and the body or strength of the wine such as not to require the addition of any spirit for its preservation. The experimenter was a gentleman of some skill in the manufacture of wine, and from whose mouth I received the above account of his success. I am a confident that any mechanical pressure used in the manufacture of wine, would easily and without great force, have obtained from one to one and a half gallons more juice from those which I pressed slightly in a linen cloth. By proper cultivation the introduction of them among wine growing comxnumUtes, will prove eminently profitable to them." In a still later communicate. it ion from Dr. Stewart, he writes: 1" This fall a French wine maker and vineyards it came from. Kentucky, where he had long been living, to cultivate the grape if he thought well of the country, &c. He is highly pleased, made several barrels of wine for Judge Scott, Fanthorp' Dr. Patrick, at or in Fanthorpsneighborhood. Of e pronounces the must and grape to be the port wine grape, and of superior quality and yield. Very intelligent and practical in his views, and of good experience, he took the must and cluster native from the trees ;there was, as usual, an abundant crop of them this year; the wine from this grape, he said, was genuine port wine. He knew it from his experience, but could not demonstrate it to be so, until after ferment at ion and deposit e of thetartaric of pot ass held in solution in the secret juices. I wait with anxiety for the result. What resources our country possesses in this respect, if this be the fact, for the must and grows every where in our fair land." He adds    found near Fanthorp a native claret grape, of which I have saved a pint of seed, to be planted this spring." He also mentions another variety of grape which he terms the port oak grape, and which he says is a very superior native grape for the table. Similar to the above commendation of the native grapes of Texas, is the following passage in Edwards' History of Texas, published in 1836. The author was an intelligent preceptor of a seminary in Texas. He says, Furthermore, of all t hole countries I have ever seen for producing the grape vine, Texas excess. The variety of kinds and the quality of these kinds, are by far the most numerous and best I have ever tasted. These native grapes are found growing luxuriantly in all quarters, while those in Arkansas and Louisiana, owing to the greater humidity of the atmosphere in those regions, are comparatively acrid and liable to untimely blights. What thenwcid127ill these grapes of exquisite flavor in the province be, when cultivated by the hands of man ?a? as surely no country is better adapted for the culture of the vine than this, where the poorest description of its lands is so admirably suited for vineyards t is well known that numerous German immigrants are now settling in Texas, so that under their skill no doubt these native fruits of the recently admitted state, will be thoroughly tested, and if adapted, as is most probable, to the purposes of cultivation, it may soon be known as the great vine growing section of our union.  It is hoped that its residents will examine and decide upon the various kinds which grow wild and select out the best and most likely new varieties may thus be found which will prove even superior to those above described. Grape vines often grow to an enormous size. An account is given in theHorticulturist, of one which is growing at Burlington, N. J. At three feet from the ground it measures six feet one inch around the trunk, and at ten feet high it is positively three feet in circumference. It is a native male grape, and has been the wonder of the neighborhood as long back as the memory of man reaches. It is still healthy and its giant folds run over and cover four trees, one of which is a full sized white oak and the others are quite large. This vine grows on upland near a spring y soil, its roots no doubt penetrating to the water. The following scale has been made by Mr. To are, of the greatest quantity of grapes which any vine can perfectly mature, in proportion to the circumference of its stem, measured just above the ground When s a deduction from this it seems to be required in the cultivation of the grape that, no vine should be permitted to ripe n its fruit until its stem measures three inches in girt, just above the ground; since this is the lowest figure given, the yield being five pounds. As it is most desirable to preserve this delicious and health full fruit, a mode of preserving grapes described by Peter A. Head, in the Americanwagriculturist, may be use fully quoted in connexion with this subject. The process is a very simple one, and he says that it is perfectly successful; so much s p that grapes were sound in February which had ripened under unfavorable circumstances, having been left also on the vine, until they were frozen as hard as bullets. Some of them kept till May. He says, " I first take a common un glazed flower pot, and place over the hole in the bottom, a small calm shell (or a piece of a broken pot) to drain off surplus water. I then pour in clean white sand, to the depth of about an inch ; next I select a lunch of ripe grapes, perfectly sound and firmly attached to the red uncle. When I hold in the pot in such a position that they do not touch its sides, and, then fill it up with sand, covering the grapes about one and a half inch deep. This being done I set the pot in a room of a temperature of from 400 to 500 or 600 F., and water it about once a week, or as often a sit becomes dry, with a watering pot, having a finely pierced rose attached to it." This is the whole of the process, and the writer of the communication referred to, says that it has answered perfectly for six or seven years. Finely pulverized charcoal may be used instead of the sand; the pots maybe larger or smaller and one or more. bunches may be put in each pot, as circumstances may dictate. When the grapes are to be eaten the sand i, via shed off in clean water. Before leaving this subject of fruit, we may refer to the experiments of M. Are my, contained in the Comptez End us, Vol. 19, and condensed by Berzelius, in his War Bericht, on the ripe king of fruit. In these the following results are believed to be contained 1st. The progress of the ripe king of a juice fruit is continually interrupted, when it is coated over with varnish, which remove sits connection with evaporation. ll. Are my says: " I could, indeed, retard it by covering the fruits with varnish, and on the other hand, accelerate it by making slight punctures on its surface. The same is the case if a slight pressure be made on the peri carp so as to crush some of the cells and allow the air to penetrate to the fruit 2d. During the progress. of the ripe king, the oxygen of the air becomes changed into carbonic acid. 3d. The air which is contained in ripened fruit is often a mixture of carbonic acid gas' and nitrogen. Oxygen gas is not contained in it in any perceptible quantity, but on the contrary, it is contained in the air which exists in entirely unripe fruit. 4th. Heinous acid in grapes, arises not from the change of any other acid, but it is already in it in the first commencement of its development. 5th. If a tree or branch of fruit be watered during the ripe king of its fruits with a weak solution of carbonate of potash, the phenomenon of ripe king then advances, X. the fruit has its color and taste, but it does not form within itself any sugar, because the potash, by the too early sat duration of the free acid in the fruit, prevents the operation of the same, by the formation of sugar. 6th. After the assumed ripe king, we do not find the free acid destroyed in the fruit, but saturated with potash or lime. 7th. The change which it first undergoes, after plucking off from the tree, is caused in the essential parts, by the oxygen of the air. Finally, M. Krems experiments also prove, that agonized bodies of animal or vegetable origin operate upon the composition of the vegetable acetatis in such a manner, that the acid is de composed and the base unites itself with carbonic acid. We may explain how the carbonate of lime in plants is formed, and whence comes the potash, which gradually saturated the acid in the ripe king of fruits. M. Are my also says, that when we accelerate the ripe king of a fruit by artificial means, it is rapidly brought to that period of decomposition which is announced by a yellowish discoloration. In that case the fruit is disengaged of the carbonic acid; the sugar which it contains, soon enters into ferment at ion, and the cells of the fruit, examined by the microscope, are in general, found to be wounded. The next topic which deserves our notice, is the products of the Hairy. These are a rich source of profit to not a few of our farmers, and by many the processes of making butter and cheese, are carried to great perfection. The first requisite is to select such animals as will yield a suitable quantity of the richest milk. There is a considerable diversity of opinion as to the best kind of breeds as much cows. The Older ney and the Ayrshire stocks seem to hold the pre eminence, perhaps, taken as the whole. The next thing, is that the cows should be well fed and kept. The greatest attention in this respect, it is believed, prevails in Holland, where the utmost care is applied to prevent any thing like un cleanliness. Such in the manufacture of butter and cheese, also depends on the requisite management of the milk previous to its being placed in the c turn or tub. We have collected several of the best methods of making butter given in our agricultural journals since our last report. The following is the plan, in substance, pursued by Philip Why sick of Germantown, \who has taken the premium r of the Philadelphia agricultural society for two or three years successively n the first place, great attention is paid to cleanliness. The tin pans are put into a boiler and boiled for an hour, then scoured with white silver sand and pure hard soap and rinsed in pure water and then put away for use. The udders of the cows are washed for three days and wiped with a clean towel. The milk is also drawn in tin pails which have been cleansed in the same manner as the parts; it is strained through a perfectly clean muslin s trainer and put intothe spring house, till four milkings are collected, then the whole milk and cream are thrown into a common barrel c turn, which has been rinsed with boiling water, with a quarter of a peck of hickory ashes and live coals stirred about in it by turning the crank, and then thrown out and the churnrinsed several' times with boiling water; the cows' udders are then washed and milled and this milk strained and poured warm into the c turn; the churning is done slowly, as the tenacity and hardness of the butter depends on this; it should take three hours. When the butter has come it is collected by a clean wooden, lad le and laid on a clean linen cloth as flat as possible, not more than two inches thick. Next take a clean coarse cotton bag which will hold a half peck or more and fill it with ice and with a 202 X. mallet mash it down flat about four inches thick, place the cloth on it till it is hard, then on a clean white marble slab add finely pulverizedsalt to suit the taste, and work out the buttermilk with a wooden spoon and lad le spread the butter flat again, and again stopping up the buttermilk with the linen cloth, which must however, be done very slowly. When it is free from all the buttermilk make it up into pounds or half pounds. The above process may seem to be, perhaps, over nice and in some respect carried to unnecessary minuteness. Any however err on the other extreme, and it is to be presumed, also, that the particular method in regard to the long period of boiling the vessels, &c, applied only to the manufacture of the single specimen of butter, which was to be offered for the premium. The excellence of the Philadelphia butter has been attributed, also to the prevalence of the an thou or ant hum odor atom, or sweet scented vernal grass which is found in the meadows in the vicinity of that city, and which is said to give a peculiar richness to the milk and cream of those cows which feed on it. Were more care taken in respect to the kinds of grass and herb age which are suffered to have a place in the pastures, were only those permitted to grow which are favorable to the production of good milk, and pains taken to eradicate such as are injurious, it can scarcely be doubted that a great improvement would take place in many of the fairies of our country. It would be no very difficult matter to ascertain, the nature of the plants growing on' any spot, and by observation, those of which the cows are most fond and which possess the requisite properties could be selected. The time and labor would, beyond all question, be abundantly repaid by the increased excellence of the butter and cheese which would be produced. By a very accurate investigation into the composition of milk and cream, it has been found that the part which forms butter, is contained in minutes lobules or capsules, the oily particles being covered in little skin. The action of churning is designed to break open these little bags, and to bring the oily or battery particles together. The more perfectly, therefore, that this is done, the more excellent will be the butter produced. In this account thechurn should be well selected and its operation be such, as to secure the end in view in the best possible manner. The more compactly the particles of butter are laid with each other, the less buttermilk of course is found in it, and the more adapted is it for keeping. It is of considerable importance also, to have the best kind of implement with which to work the butter that it may as much as possible be freed from the buttermilk. Various articles have been proposed for this purpose, one of which was described in our last report. The following description we take from the Cultivator, where it is illustrated by a plate. It is believed however, that it may be made clear to those who are conversant with the business of the dairy, without any other illustration. In an inclined stand or table, where the butter is to be worked, is fastened a fluted roller twenty-four inches long, and at the end where the handle is inserted eight inches in diameter, from thence it tapers down to two inches diameter, where it is made fast to the table. There are sixteen flutes or creases brought to ar edge, and so deep as to make the inside of each flute form a right angle and continued to the surface. The handle is seven and a half inches long and two inches in diameter; at the smaller end of the fluted roller there is likewise a shrank five inches long and one and one-fourth inches in diameter, on the end of which is placed a ball two inches in diameter. This ball is designed to work freely in a socket block which is made of two pieces, each three and a half by one and three-fourth inches, cut into a shoulder and let x. Doc: No54203down into the table, so as to rest on the top of the table and se u red below by a key wedge passing through the two parts. The height of the socket in which the ball 'is to play above the table, must be sufficient to allow the roller to ii e fairly along on the inclined plane and to operate to the greatest advantage when the butter is placed beneath it. In the inclined table should be placed a marble block twenty-four inches square, and having around it, cut into the table, a channel to receive the butter milk, to a central point where it may run off in a stream into a bucket beneath Glass milk pans and pipes have been warmly recommended in some of the English journals, and it appears from experiments which have been made, that they possess some advantages over those of tin and earthen. As yet, however, they do not seem to have been introduced very much in our own country. Any statements have appeared in the agricultural journals since our last report, relating to the productive ness in milk of cows, and the methods offeediongthem found 'to be most successful. The Older ney breed is placed by some persons as far superior to all others for the rich yellow milk which they, give. We will have a few instances of the many we have noted, and take these because they come first to hand rather than because they are presumed to be superior to all others. The following describes the qualities of two cows for which the first and second premiums were awarded by the Essex To. (pass) Agricultural Society : The first premium was for a native cow of Henry Dress y, which, from the 2 1st of May to the 2 1st of September, four months, gave 481 7 lbs. 4 oz. of milk; 19 lbs. of milk, by trial, was found to yield on an average 1 lb. of butter, so that the milk amounted to 253 lbs. of butter in this period. The was fed on grass with the exception of seven weeks, when she received two quarts of shorts per day. The second premium was given to Am. Over ill for a native cow, which from the 24th of May to the 20th of September, four months, gave 4 375 lbs. of milk, which, by actual manufacture i yielded 211 lbs. 2 oz. of butter. The, likewise, was fed on grass, with the addition, during the drought and shortness of the feed, for five or six weeks, of one quart of I indian meal and one quart of rye, mixed together, per day. In the Paine Farmer we find mention of a native cow belonging to H. I gals, of Verser, Paine, which, in fourteen days, gave 40 lbs. 10 oz. of butter. In 'the first week she gave 19 lbs. 10 oz. In the second week 21 lbs. In the first week the milk amounted to 253 lbs, in the second week to 367 lbs. 4 oz, being an average for the first week of 25 quarts per day, and in the second week of 26 quarts per day of milk, and allowing a little more than 14 lbs. or 7 quarts of milk to 1 lb. of butter. By experiments tried in feeding cows with mangelwurtzel, it has been ascertained that a very considerable increase of milk and butter is produced. The following is contained in a pamphlet written by Thomas 1Pewley of Cambridge in England, and published in 1828 One morning he selected two much cows which had called in the spring, and turned them out in an over eaten pasture, and fed them every morning and evening only with hay, the milk was measured at each meal, the cream also and the butter weighed at each churning, and for one week the result was, milk 101 quarts; cream 5 quarts; butter 41 lbs. The cows then remained in the pasture another week, and were fed with mangelwurtzel and hay, each cow having half bushel of the root sliced and given to her morning and evening, and the result was, milk 130 quarts; cream 8 quarts; butter 6- lbs. The cows remained in the same pasture one week more, and were fed every morning and evening as at first with hay only, and the experiment produced only 204 X. milk 87 quarts; cream 41 quarts; butter 3, I is thus most decisively p ring, that no small part of the increase of the second week must, doubt le .be ascribed to the addition of the mangelwurtzel. That much depends not only on the kind of food but also on the manner in which it is fed out to much cows, as respects the milk production, is universally acknowledged. " The softer the fodder for the much cow, the more the milk" is a common proverb in Saxony, and it is asserted on the best authority that cows which receive for drink luke warm water, give much more milk than those which drink cold water; especially is this important in winter. I tis also recommended that in the winter the appetite of the cows be excited, so as t take the more drink, for which purpose oil cake and salt are recommended. Some of the best German authors speak of the following methods to promote the secretion of milk. Thus Schweitzer and Lee man declare that the most excellent means to promote the secretion of milk is always a good and strong appetency to drink. For this object they recommend a paste of boiled potatoes, to which is also added bruised corn, br an, oil cake and milk, and then thinned with warm water, so that the who lenity become a thin fluid; the more the cow will take of it the better. His drink is to be made ready for use half a day before it shall be needed, so that it requires only to be thinned with warm water. Bruised grain and ran appear to gain in nutritiousness when they are scalded some hours before use, in hot water, stirred up and then left to stand covered up till used. Clock also strongly recommends, even in summer, in connection with green fodder the same drink, a soup of br an (12 quarts of water for a cow in which 1 . I is. of br an has been boiled and dissolved) to be given after the first fodder with c lover. In the winter this drink, with other articles added to Alba of rye value given twice, amounting from 20 to 24 quarts daily. Schmalz prefers boiled fodder after this sort Clean cut hay, rowe n, chaff, &c, he gives it twice a day, morning and evening. Every also he regards as one of the best roots for the purpose, and would have it kept to be added to the boiled food daily. As to the time which may be considered the milking period we find considerable diversity of opinion among the foreign authors. Clock, Hope, Kreyssig, Cabs t and Buddeus, fix it at an average of about 300 days, or that a cow must be useless in this respect for about sixty-five days, viz: three to four weeks before calling, (hope says, better four to six weeks, and Dittmrann that at least six weeks dried state is necessary for the cow to make her afterwards yield the richest product of milk) then afterwards the calf needs the milk for from four to six weeks more; that is, if it is to be raised. Schweitzer in general estimates the period for milking 309 days, while, on the other hand, Lo tow, In ke, Meyer, Wakens en, allow only 274 days, or three-fourths of the year. Her reckoned it at forty weeks, or 280 days. Larger only thirty-eight weeks, or 266 days, for he allows six weeks for the calf, and eight previous to calling, without milking. Met others vary from 263, 264, 280, 290 up to 300 days. Something must depend on the character of the cow, her age, &c. The able editor of the London Gardeners' Chronicle gives the following answer to a request for information respecting the best food for cows. " Give your cow half a hundred weight of mixed white carrots and mangelwurtzel in the morning, straw chaff as much as you please in the forenoon, with hot salt water thrown over it, about quarter of a hundred of mixed carrots. at noon, and then an oil cake weighing about two pounds, straw chaff at your pleasure in the afternoon, and three quarters of a hundred' of mixed x. a. 20 carrot at night, and if she does not yield a good milk in abundance, it will not be the fault of her food worn s talks is a most excellent food also for cows. Mr. Morris of Morrisania, whose dairy is celebrated for its rich milk, stated at one of the meetings of the New York Farmers' Club, that he kept 126 cows, and that he fed them on green corn, which he found to make richer and better milk than other food, besides its producing more feed than any other vegetable. The tree corn is highly recommended for this purpose. Taken at the period of its greatest weight, and, probably, of its greatest value for either green or dry food when the corn was full in the milk, it has produced forty tons to the acre. The richness of the milk of cows in butter depends on two things, the breed being the same the fodder, and whether the cow is fresh or an old milker. The milk of the fresh milker, as Kreyssig and Schweitzer observe, is thinner than that of an old milker; according to Lampadius the milk of the first month after calling contains go of its weight in butter; in four months, . If the cow be milked three times a day it is thinner than if she be milked only twice. The proportion of butter in milk depends greatly on the fodder, says Schweitzer; the poorest is straw and slop fodder, the richest c lover, roots, &c; and in general average the milk is richest in the autumn. As to the quantity of milk required for a pound of butter, there is considerable diversity of opinion, owing probably to the difference is richness of the specimens examined. Clock and Schmnalz maintain that from twenty pounds of good creamy milk, or about nine and a half quarts, may be obtained one pound of butter, and that cream is to the milk usually as one to seven. Meyer reckons twenty-seven to twenty-eight pounds of milk to one pound of butter, as does also Schweitzer. The ratio of cream to milk, according to Meyer, is as one to ten. Schweitzer reckons one quart of cream to five quarts of milk, or twenty per cent, and from 2- quarts of cream on pound of butter, therefore, for 11- quarts of milk, or 241 pounds, if we reckon the quart at 2- pounds, or 27- pounds, if we reckon it at 21 pounds, will give one pound of butter. Larger gives twenty-five to twenty-six pounds of milk to one pound of butter. Hope allows twelve to fourteen quarts of milk for a pound of butter, and considers it a favorable state if twelve qu arts of milk will give one pound of butter. The same is the computationof Her, Buddeus and Kreyssig, while others fix upon one hundred quart of milk for eight pounds of butter. We might add yet many others, but these are probably sufficient. It is difficult to find any estimates in our country, as the science of proportions seems to have scarcely excited any attention. The specific weight of the milk varies according to its richness in cream. The richest in cream is lightest in specific weight. It varies between 1.028 and 1.035, and on an average, with stall foddering, it maybe fixed at about 1.03. The proportions of fodder to increase of milk have also been observed and noted, but we must omit them here. Should any one desire to pursue this subject further, he may find materials for investigations in any of the volumes of agricultural proportions, which abound in the German agricultural literature, among which, probably: Andres and Kleemans Encyclopedias of Agricultural Proportions are the best. Considerable excitement has been produced, both in urope and our own country, with respect to Guenons methods of determining the mdilkingEx. properties of cows, and the value of the male also as a stock letter of milchkine, by means of certain external marks or differences of the hair, &c with the discovered calls escutcheons. By a recent report of M. Part, in the Central Convention of Agriculture in Paris, the following seems to be the present state of this alleged discovery. It is admitted that there is some general correspondence as respects cows, but the signs are deficient as to the male animals. The classification which M. Due non has proposed is altogether too minute and extensive to be of practical value, as the pretended distinctions of the subdivisions are not verified :on examination. M. Guenonmakes eight classes, each of which has eight divisions, so that he thus constitutes sixty-four varieties, besides one more for the s curious kind. If it becomes necessary to retain all of these, M. Part remarks that M. Guenons discovery can make little progress towards a general reception. A course of accurate experiments is going forward for the purpose of testing the principles thoroughly. Until the result of these is known, probably there will be but little advance in the matter. One of the largest fairies in our country is that of Vol. Each am, of Pulaski, N. Y. His farm consists of 1000 acres, 300 of which are devoted to grass, and he keeps one hundred head of cattle and ninety-seven cows. In one year he made 30,000 pounds of cheese, 20,000 pounds of which he sold at one time at New Work, for from six and a half to seven cents per pound. He feeds his cows mostly on hay and carrots. Of the latter he raises 2000 bushels, and gives each cow half a bushel per day; and besides the benefit derived from his grass for his stock, he gathered not less that 300 bushels of grass seed. According to the state census of New Work, taken three, years since, the quantity of butter made in a year was 79,501,77a3pounds. This, at twelve and a half cents per pound, would amount to   $9,937,716. The s ape year there were milked 999,490 cows, threefifthgof which, it is supposed, were for butter fairies, and the remainder for cheese fairies. This would give, for butter 599,685 cows, which would probably give 500,000 calves; so that a large increase may be calculated in this respect, on the amount of stock kept for butter manufacture every year in that state. The quantity of milk sold it our cities is great. Some idea of it may be formed from the fact that 50,000 quarts of milk daily are carried on the Erie rail road, equal, including the cans to sixty-three tons, not less, probably than 15,000,000 or 16,000,000 quarts a year, which did not find it sway to New York before the road was constructed. The importation of cheese into Great Britain is larger than that of butter. The total quantity in 1846 from Europe amounted to 249,664cwt., and from the United States to 91,901 cut. The American cheese, however, is said to have some faults which need to be corrected to render it acceptable to the English market. These are stated by Mr. Colemanto be, 1st. The softness of the mind, which renders them liable to crack, and which is imputed to their richness, and the remedy for which is to let the cheese, when taken from the press, remain in bring so strong that it will take up no more salt; for four or five hours. It must not, however, be kept too long in the bring, as it may receive injury. The second fault complained of is the acid and sharp taste. This is imputed to some improper preparation of the men net, and possibly to something wrong in the need or pastures. It is also recommended that American cheese should be x. a. 207 colored so as to resemble the English cheese. The American butter is a poor article genera there, and does not find purchasers for table use, but as used to grease ilhinery in the manufacturing districts. The next topic we have usually considered in these reports, is the various modes of feding cattle and stock of different kinds, embracing the divisions of nutrition from food, methods of keeping, and other particulars closely connected with the whole subject. To no ore subject connected with agriculture does the attention, both of practical nine and men of science, seem to be more carefully or earnestly devoted than to this great one. I to importance is increasingly felt, and every year multiplied both the number and the accuracy of the experiments instituted to ascertain the facts of greatest interest connected with it. We have a large mass of valuable material collected, most of which too is probably new in this country, and our only difficulty is to make such use of it as shall embody the results in the best manner. We may refer, however, in the first place, to the ,communications of Mr. Fleischmann, Mr. Ellsworth and others, in our appendixes, for many things useful relating to this subject. Leaving the theory of nutrition till the close of our remarks on this general topic, we may perhaps more profit ably first proceed to present some facts in relation to articles of food for stock of various kind. We cannot however enter much into detail. The agricultural journals, both foreign and domestic, are full of able treatises on the subject. Our object is rather to enlighten by the publication of information which may be supposed to be beyond the reach of the majority of our fellow citizens, than to repeat such as may be already familiar to them. Considerable discussion has existed among the agricultural public as to the best form in which food shall be given for the purpose of feeding or fattening Some persons advocate one method of preparing food, and others directly the contrary. The true course in regard to the matter is doubtless to collect and compare the results of experiments made. We labor, however, under one serious difficulty in this respect. It is not always easy to satisfy ourselves that entire accuracy has been applied in conducting the trials made. There is too great vagueness in the description and many things which maybe supposed to influence the result are often wholly or partially overlooked Numbers are given conjecture ally or in gross, and no regard perhaps is paid to the difference in the times of Weighing or modes of measuring, and hence no two results of different individuals can be brought together for each comparison, and in many cases hardly can those of the same person. He must, however, take them as they are, selecting such as seem to be best entitled to credit. Any of them may at least show the general effect of the particular modes of feeding adopted, although it is not improbable that these might be considerably modified were they to be still more closely carried on. In the Transactions of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society, we find a prize essay containing a report on the feeding of stock with prepared food, &c. by los. Marshall, who seems to have succeeded in fattening stock by giving them good food and suitably preparing it. We extract a few of its details : At 6 A. M. each beast is supplied with about 40 to 45 I is. of yellow but lock turnipssliced ; at 10 A. ' with 1 by. of linseed boiled for 2 or 3 hours with about 1- galls, of water, 2- I is. of ground corn and 5 lbs. of chopped straw, at I P. The turn is are repeated, and at 5 P. M. the prepared food is repeated. At night a little straw is placed in their racks. The ground corn and chopped straw must be mixed together first, and then the boiled linseed being poured 208 X. upon them and mixed with them, may be allowed to stand for I or 2 hours, and given while it is yet warm; for if allowed to stand few hours the mass ferments and quickly turns sour. The greatest clean his is also necessary in the vessels and implements made use of. Such is the practice: now for the results. In one case two of the most thriving were selected from a lot of 12 but locks of nearly the same age and condition, and for the first month were fed on the usual food, swedes turn is, linseed cake and bean meal in the proportion named below v Two others of nearly equal weight were fed with the prepared food. All the four were weighed at the commencement of the experiment April 11, 1846, and their weights are given below in table 1. Los. 8 and 9 were fed in the new way, the other two in the usual mode. They were weighed the second time on the 15th of May. Table I. No. of Tall. Give weight, April 11. Give weight, May 15. I increase in weight. Tones. lbs. Tones, lbs.

Convinced that those which made the least progress were the most thriving animals, the person trying the experiment next fed the whole 4 for a month alike on swedes, mangelwurtzel, &c, and the prepared food, and the following was the result Table L.

Comparing the increase of the same two but locks, Los. 12 and 13 when fed in the old for 34 days, viz: 8 stone, 2 lbs. with the increase of the same when fed in the new way for 31 days, 14 stone, 5 lbs, the superiority of the latter mode is very evident. Next we may look at the cost. First Method of Feeding 10 lbs. of linseed at 7s. per bush. of 56 lbs. or 1 per lb, I s. 3d d 35 I is. of bean meal at I s. per stone, 2 061 00 lbs. of boa l daily at 14s. per ton, or is. and. per week for 20bullocks or for each per week, 0 2 Extra wages is. per week or 21d. per head, say 0 2 most per head per week, 4 3 Second Method of Feeding 21 lbs. of oil cake at 10 per ton or 15s. per stone, I s. 102 1 lbs. of bean meal at I s. per stone, 1 0 620 stone of turn is, extra, say 0 11 in out per head per week, 4 0 4x. a. 209 t will be seen, therefore, that the cost of the two systems is almost exactly the same, while the increase from one is much more than from the other. The following calculation gives the relative value of certain kinds of food, in a little different form from what is sometimes state drops.

Mr. Spooner an eminent lecturer on the subject in England lays down the following propositions with respect to the best food for stock. The skill of the fee der is best shown by the most perfect combination of food calculated to produce most fat, and to get rid at the same time economically of the roots, straw and hay which has already been supplied. Animals cannot be fattened on roots alone on account of the bulk of the food and especially because they contain so great a per cent age of water. Straw alone will not answer because of the vast amount of food thus required. It may however be cut into chaff and use fully employed. In respect to the comparative merits of dry and fresh fodder, according to the experiments of Boussingault, it appears that the fodder obtained from hay is equally nourishing with that from fresh grass. A he ifer was weighed and fed for ten days on green fodder, each day a quantity equal in weight to that consumed being put aside to dry. The animal was then weighed and fed for ten days on the dry fodder, and weighed again. The experiment was repeated, three times, and each time the animal weighed a little more after feeding on the dry fodder than after the green. The difference was not enough to prove that the dry food was the more nutritions, but that it was fully equal to it. A compound for feeding cattle, prepared by Mr. Earner, has a high reputation in England, and if we may judge from the experiments detailed, of the success of those who have tried it, it is a valuable improvement. It is composed of linseed reduced to a in e meal and barley to the thickness of a water by a crushing mill. But eighteen gallons of water into the cauldron, and, as soon as it boils, not before, stir in twenty-one pounds of linseed meal, stir it for five minutes, and then sprinkle in sixty-three pounds of the crushed barley while another person stirs it in. When thoroughly incorporated, which will be in ten minutes, cover it down, throw open the furnace door and de aden the fire, so that it will merely summer till the barley has absorbed the mucin age, when the kerseys will resume their shape, and maybe compared to little oil cakes. The advantage to be gained by boiling or steaming food, is now considered to be well settled. That many kinds of food are increased by boiling admits not of a doubt 14 210 X. 4 measures of oats have thus been increased to 7 measures 4 " of barley " ' *a* 10 "4 " of buckwheat or br an " 14 "4 " of maize " " " " 13 "4 " of wheat " " " " 10 "4 " of rye " "' " " 15 "4 " of beans " " " , 81 ache great importance of warmth, in respect to cattle, is becoming more and more understood. There can be little doubt that a due attention to this particular might aid in saving millions of bushels of food in the course of a year or two, while at the same time the actual benefit of the food given would be greater. The use of salt among the food of animals has been highly recommended. It would appear, however, from some experiments of M. Boussingault, that the only effect of salt is not by way of any nutritions qualities, but merely as a sharpener of appetite. The animals which were supplied with salt ate more, and the food was sooner absorbed in the proportion of two hundred and two to two hundred and seventeen, or one thousand to one thousand and seventy-four; their thirst is also excited, or they drink more in the ratio of 32.86 to 41.16, or one thousand to one thousand two hundred and fifty-six. The following are the experiments undertaken, with the results of them. There were two lots, each of 3 animals, A. B. C., and A'. B'. C'., respectively With salt. Without salt.

Each lot had, also, every ;access i ve day, better food than in the preceding day, and, whenever a ra don was distributed, they were first weighed. The whole time of feeding lasted one hundred and seventeen days. In this time the first lot consumed, of hay, seven hundred and ninety-two kilogrammes; of rowe n, nine hundred and forty kilogrammes; bees, three hundred and twelve kilogrammes, in all one thousand two hundred and fifty.

In the London Gardeners' Chronicle we are told, that if prepared by bruising, they become a very relishing and useful food.  Parrots, also, have been fed out to horses alternatively with oats to advantage. Weniigtt add largely to the examples we have given, but it is hardly necessary. Some very excellent observations on these subjects may be found in R. D. Thomsons researches on food for animals. For. Thomsons experiments bear also on the question connected with the formation of butter as influenced by the food given to the cow, and will amply repay to any one the time and labor of perusal. We would likewise refer to some papers on the feeding of cattle, translated from the German, and sub joined in our Appendix 14. Mr. Fleischmanns communication likewise gives a description of the mode of feeding cattle at Alcsufth in Hungary, which we would further commend to the notice of those wh on may read this report. It will be found towards the latter portion of Appendix No. 1. In Appendix No. 14, together with other papers on the feeding of cattle, sheep, &c, we have given a list of plants offered to different animals, according to a series of experiments published by Linnaeus, but which seems to be almost unknown at the present day, as it is nearly one hundred years since it first appeared in English. The accounts given by Mr. Fleischmann, of the mode of feeding and management of sheep in Germany, the rules for judging respecting wool, and the wool trade there, are so full that it is unnecessary for us to devote much attention to this topic. The facilities of our country for raising sheep and producing wool are great. We will quote a few of the items in this respect which have met our notice. Vermont, though lying far north, yet seems to furnish some of the best specimens in the United States. The number of sheep raised there is large. Are has been taken to preserve, as far as possible, the original breeds, which were imported from Europe many years since. In Addison county alone, it is stated that there were over one hundred thousand sheep, which, for want of hay in 1846, would have to be driven to other sections to be wintered. More than one million -of sheep were reported by the census as raised in this state. In the other Newengland states, also, much attention is devoted to the improvement of the flee ce, and recently some fine Saxon bucks and eyes of the electoral breed have been imported for this purpose. The following relates to the production of wool in Washington county, Pennsylvania." A gentleman who is extensively engaged in the purchase of wool informed us that this years clip in that county is estimated at 1,300,000 lbs ?a? The price paid per pound by purchasers ranged from twenty-five to sixty-two and a half cents. Our friend averaged the price per pound at thirty-seven and a half cents. According to this estimate, therefore, the large sum of       $487,-500 was realized by the farmers of Washington county for this years clip of wool !the attention of the agriculturists of the south and south west, has been directed, within a year or two, to the fine capabilities of many parts of those sections of our country for raising sheep and wool. In a report on this subject to the Union Agricultural Society of South Carolina, it is said, " thousands of acres of land now are thrown away, in every section of the back country, upon which sheep would subsist well during the summer months. In the winter they may be kept at a very trifling cost." Cotton seed is said212Ex. to be an excellent winter, food for sheep, as they are very fond of it and thrive well upon it. The climate is peculiarly well suited for some varieties, and will admit of their being pastured much later than they can be further north. A report on the value of sheep husbandry, by the On. R. F. Simpson, of South Carolina, may be found in our Appendix, No. 14. We would refer for a full discussion of the advantages of the southern section of our country and adaptation for this branch of agricultural industry, to the letters of Mr. And al of the state of New Work, which have been published in our agricultural periodicals. Various articles also may be found in the Alabama Planter and other journals, calling the attention of the public in that and the adjoining states to this important branch of husbandry for the south. The Ohio sheep crop too is an extensive one. From various accounts in the Ohio Cultivator, it would appear that an enlivened interest has recently been excited there, which promises to result in an increased production of wool. A convention of wool growers was held at Steuben ville on the 10th web. 1847, attended by individuals from different states, at which much interesting information was communicated, and in a report prepared for the occasion, the great importance of having wool well washed and cleaned, and of ascertaining the best foreign markets for wool was urged. Committees were appointed for these purposes, and depots for the sale of wool recommended to be established in Springfield, Pass, Wheeling in A for the eastern and western sections of the United States. Any sheep in the course of the year or two past have been taken fronmPennsylvania to Wisconsin, and the prospect indicates that more attention will hereafter be paid to sheep raising and wool growing in that section of our country. Michigan also is thought to possess many advantages for the growth of wool. A writer in the Cultivator describing the advantages of Michigan as an agricultural state, gives the following statement in reference to this subject. "the advantages of Michigan as a wool growing state, are beginning to be appreciated. The surface, broken into gentle hills and valleys is covered with a spontaneous growth of grasses, which are relish ed by sheep and cattle and will alone furnish them sustenance for at least eight months in the year. The export of wool from Detroit alone in 1844, but a few years from the first introduction of sheep into the state, was 236,000pounds. Since then the hills and meadows of many parts of the state have been covered with fine flocks." We might multiply statements and notices respecting different portions of the United States, as adapted to wool culture, but it is unnecessary. The number of sheep, pounds of wool, and pounds to each sheep, given below, are taken from a statement made to the Newyork Farmers' Club. We have no data for the estimates, but those for the United States were so grossly erroneous in the quantity of wool, as printed, that we have taken the census returns and have considered them even as too low, and have accordingly given what we consider a fairer estimate of the number of pounds of wool to each sheep at 2.5 to 3 pounds.

This we believe ami ay b too large an estimate, though the number probably reaches above 25, 0000,000. From the reports to the Ohio Board of Agriculture the number given for 1846 is 2,065;842. The number reported in the statistics of Connecticut, for 1845, is 289,574. The number given in the statistics of Massachusetts, for 1845, is 354,943. In the statistics of New Hampshire, for 1845, the number mentioned is 488,272. The returns of the New Work state census, for 1845, give 6,443,855. It will be seen by the above that the number of sheep in the United States must be large. Compared with the census of 1840, the number in New York in five years had increased above 1,300,000. The data of the other states do not show a comparative increase, but as they were imperfect no comparisons can be rested on them. The increase in New York too seems to have taken place notwithstanding that the prices of wool did not give any additional encouragement, judging from the sub joined prices of wool in western New Work, for eleven years, as follows, which we take from the Cultivator1835 average price 35 its. per pound 1836 " " 36 " "' The latest quotations at New Work 1837 " " 37 " " are as follows 1838 " -a" 35 " " Saxony flee ce .a. 40 to 474 1839 " " 47 " " Peri no. 35 to 40 1840 " " 33 " " t to full blood. 35 to 40 1841 " " 364 " " Common. 29 to 30 1842 " " 30 " " Lambs, city pulled. 27 to 28 1843 " "a( 28 " " " " super. 29 to 30 1844 " " 394 " " " country pulled. 20 to 325 " " 294 " " " " super. 32 to 35 1846 " " 24 " "the fluctuations of prices above given, in some cases are remarkable, but notwithstanding this the number of sheep has become more than one fifthaiagei. If we might allow the same increase on the census returns in all the states, we should bring the whole number at about 25,000,000, for the year 1845, since which doubtless there has been a proportionate increase in the whole number. In Appendix, No. 14, will be found a paper from Mr. Sacrum recommending wool ma tresses, which contains some interesting particulars relating to the subject of wool generally. He pp ears to think that this application of wool will not only be salutary to health, but advantageous likewise in opening a market for our wool growers of no trifling consequence. It is believed that the article will be interesting to many of our agriculturists, and therefore we have inserted it, without, however, presuming to give any opinion as to thefeasibility of the plan. The trial might be made, and the results published might be very useful. In our former reports we have dwelt on the subject of hogs and their products to considerable extent. We have this year procured an article relating to the "how crop" as it is termed at the west, by Mr. List, of Cincinnati, which will be found sub joined in Appendix No. 15, and which will repay the time devoted to the perusal of it. The progress of slaughtering hogs and cattle for the market is rapid. According to a statement published in the It. Louis Republican in 1845 6, the number of hogs slaughtered there for the season was 30,948, of cattle 3,508. The yea i, previous it was estimated at 16,000 hogs and 2,500 cattle. The pork crop 214 X. of the west, of 1845 1846, was estimated at 1,054,624, being an increase on the former year of 179,824 hogs; and the number of barrels of pork supposed to have been packed that year was supposed to be about 60,000. The who e number of hogs in Ohio in. 1846 was 1,405,621, and in sixty-one counties in 1847 it appeared there had been an increase of 274,247, or 25. per cent, at which rate the whole state would give 1,756,000 hogs for the (did 127) ear 1847. We find in the Ohio Cultivatornotices of large hogs raised at the west, of which the following is a specimen: Mr. Haynes, of Centreviille, Mintoeery county, had raised on his farm, by N. A skill, a lot 6ff twenty- to. hogs of u the following weights 528, 521, 514, 506, 505,504, 48, 478, 420, 446, 455, 430, 457, 415, 468, 580, 457, 430, 447,432, 408, 435. , Total, 10,222 I is. At the Teres ford slaughter was a lot of seven hogs, raised by a Mr. D win Bedford, cf Bourbon county, By, which 'averaged in weight 720 lbs. Two others are mentioned as having been raised in Hard in county, in the same state, the weight of which was over 1 600 lbs. If we should estimate the whole crop of Ohio this year at 250 lbs. apiece, which must be a low average; as the number did not include the six months old pigs, it would give for the how crop of Ohio not less than 450,000,000 pounds. In Mr. Ellsworths communication, already noticed, will be found an account of some experiments in feeding swine, and we have collected various others, which however, we shall be obliged to omit for want of room. The following speaks of the excellent qualities of par ships as a means of fattening pigs. It is taken from the London Agricultural Gazette. The writer says: "by pigs are fed once a day with wash from the house, and three times a day with par ships as they were drawn from the earth, neither washed, cooked, nor cut. I calculate to i* the produce from two and a half rods is quite sufficient to fatten one pig. The last anaemia T killed weighed twenty-four stone, five pounds, (341 is) and was between nine ana Tin months old. The pork was declared by all to be excellent, very tender and delicate. In the Oekonomische Neuigkeiten we find an experiment in fattening hogs on milk, which was very successful; but it may be doubted whether it would not be a less profitable use of milk in our country than its common one, and probably but little could be learned respecting the raising of this great staple of the west, from the comparatively small experiments of the agriculturists of Germany, though their experiments are generally conducted with far more precision than those in our own i country. We have but little likewise to add on the subject of Poultry. That the keeping of hens may be made profitable, if rightly conducted, scarcely admits of a doubt. In one instance the account is thus given or.

In Massachusetts from 45 hens were gathered 41 dozen eggs in January, and 26, dozen during the first sixteen days of February, making in all 752 eggs, or about 17 apiece on the average. A writer in the London Gardeners' Chronicle gives the following direction to make the hens lay all winter, which would appear to be worthy of consideration by those who may be engaged in the business of raising poultry: "deep no r posters; give the hens fresh meat, chopped up like sausage meat, once a day, a very small portion, say one half an ounce a day, to each hen, during the winter or from the time insects disappear in the fall till they appear again in the spring. Never allow any eggs to remain in the nest for what are called nest eggs. When the r posters do not run with the hens, and no nest eggs are left in the nest, the hens will not cease laying after the production of 12 or 15 eggs, as they always do when roostersand nest eggs are allowed but continue laying perpetually. My hens lay all winter, and each from 70 to 100 eggs in succession. The only reason why hens do not lay in winter as freely as in summer, is the want of animal food which they get in the summer in abundance in the form of insects. I have for several winters reduced my theory to practice, and proved its entire correctness t is stated that a bushel of corn will last twice as long for hens as a bushel of buckwheat, but the latter will make hens lay eggs more than any other grain, and the profit overbalances the cost. The number of eggs sent to market and consumed is very great. In the year 1846 it is said that 3000 000 were packed and sent from Cincinnati in the spring. A single canal boat is noticed in a Rochester paper as on her way to Albany with 239 barrels of eggs, each barrel containing 90 dozen, which would thus give 258,120 dozen eggs. In France it is stated that 7,250,000,000 eggs are annually used, of which Paris consumes about 120,000,000. The importation of eggs from France by England amounted in 1838 in value to nearly                           $1,000,000, and the annual average amount is estimated at 100,-000,000 of eggs. The amount of money invested in poultry in England is supposed to be not short of 8,000,000. A great controversy has been going on for some two or three years, respecting the true theory of the nutrition of animals. While willing to concede much to Liebigs investigations, yet there are many, both among the English and French physiologists who disagree with him and think that he has been misled and that his principles will not stand the test of trial. He cannot enter largely upon this question, but shall here quote from another some remarks, which seem to us to give a true view of the state of the case The researches of Lie big, Dr. Rout and others, render it probable, if not certain, that agonized substances yield nutriment to the animal structure, and that nonazotized or carbonaceous substances are employed in the respiratory process and produce animal heat; but many facts are at variance with Liebigs opinion that nonazotized principles are incapable of supporting animal life and. of nourishing the tissues; or that principles devoid of nitrogen cannot be converted into agonized compounds. Fresh animal food devoid of fat contains 13.6 per cent. of carbon, and although fresh, ripe fruit contains but 12 per cent. yet sac charing and amylaceous substarcid127ces, upon which the inhabitants of hot climates principally subsist, contain from 36 to 47 per cent. of carbon, and consequently would be likely to generate a2Ls6x. of.

Wish, leeches and other animals h. one structures ;abound in nitrogen p, both live and increase in wight, although kept in pure ater or fed in nonazotized substances. Anderson says that the no magic Doors have scarcely any other food than gum senegal, (cid127cid127ich contains no nitrogen, and" Hasselquist relates that a caravan of. Abyssinuans, consisting of one thousand persons, subsisted for two; months on a stop of gum arabic alone. Those who: gather gum from the trees in Arabia and Senegal live (for a time) almost entirely upon it, and six ounces in, twenty-four hours have proved sufficient for ncid127ans support. In the contrary those articles which contain the most nitrogen are tnotialways the most no tritious, it having been proved that leg luminous seeds (as peas and beariswhicih contain more of the noticed principle than the cereal grains, are lessnutritive than the latter. Lie big attributes this to their deficiency in earthy phosphates; but according t to Braconnet they contain twice the quantity which wheat contains, -and t entry-four times the amount found in beef, Alkials fed exclusively on gelatin e the most highly nitrogen sized principle of the food of the carnivora, die with all the symptoms of starvation The    Russian and Greek laborers and those of many other countries will workfrcim twelve to sixteen -hours a day with great power and activity while living on about one pound of coarse bread with a small bunch of garlic, figs, raisinscid127ci while according to <a name="loss33"><mark>Loss</mark></a>, Box and others, the Indian boatsneiulPatagonians, &c. ho subsist ex closely on animal food require frost to :eight pounds of flesh in: tveityfur' hours.

L .1 _a_ 4 , .a. .r .usual food is deficient of that necessary element; and when it is considered that four fifths of the atmospheric air is nitrogen and only one fifth oxygen can it be supposed, that whilst the latter is acknowledged to be of suclAEx. a. 217 essential service in nutrition as introduced into the system by mastcticationdeglutition and respiration the former should be given out through the skin and lungs, as Lie big states, 'without being applied to any use in the animal economy' ?a? The experiments hitherto made are decidedly opposed to such an opinion. Dr. Rout thinks that the a note of the tissues in some instances may be derived from the air; and Air Humphrey Navy states that n his experiments, an absorption of nitrogen took place during respiration to the amount of one-seventeenth of the volume of oxygen which disappeared from the atmosphere; so that in twenty-four hours the quantity of nitrogen absorbed was as much as two thousand two hundred and forty-six grains. Professor Staff, Priestley, Cuvier, Renders on, Edwards and others, obtained similar results, but Allen and Keys, Berthollet, Urine, System, U long andeDespretz, detected an increase of nitrogen. The discrepancy in these results is probably due to the different circumstances in which the experiments were conducted, and it seems very desirable that a further set of experiments should be made, when care should be taken to obtain if possible the amount of nitrogen received in the food, as well as by mastication and inhalation, and then the quantity exhaled in each case would be a valuable addition to our knowledge. It is the opinion of Rout and Lie big that in the digestive process, starch and other amylaceous and sac charing matters are converted into the oleaginous principles, by the extraction of oxygen of which the former contains a much greater quantity than the latter he have quoted the above remarks at length on account of the importance of the topic on which they treat. The views of Lie big have been very generally adopted in our country without any hesitation; but in Efuropeamong some of the ablest physiologists they are controverted. The same is also the case with respect to his theory of the nutrition of plants as we shall have occasion to show. While his theory and arguments have been diffused from abroad among our agriculturists, little or nothing hardly is known of the overwhelming array of facts which have been brought, to bear against them by men of the most accurate science and practical men in Germany, France and England. The question of animal nutrition may still perhaps be considered a looted one in certain respects, but some of its principles seem to have been settled adverse to his theory. Certain facts are entirely irreconcilable with his positions and these latter must therefore be modified lo meet the former. The general points may be correct, but in carrying out the principles there is serious difficulty. We hoped to have been able to sub join in an appendix a full treatise on the breeding of cattle, by the same author, whose essay we have already translated and placed therein; but as apart only of the original has come to hand, we must forego it now. It is often desirable to determine the proportion of fat or tallow to the live weight of the animal, and various methods have been proposed and tables prepared to aid in this decision. One method accompanied by a table will be found in our Appendix, No. 14, among the papers heretofore mentioned. The importance of this subject has been earnestly pressed in a late No. of the American Farmer. The tables are made out in German measures, but as the foot and inch differ but little from the English ones, probably no serious difficulty need be apprehended from its application. It is probable, however, that considerable modification may be necessary to adapt it to different races or breeds of animals on account of the diversity of their form and structure. The general principles on which it is formed however, may deserve notice and may be useful in constructing others 218 X. Toe. No. 54. The importance of the general economy of the stable, especially as regards construction and ventilation, does not seem enough to be realized in sour country. Tables are generally built too low and no care is taken to provide suitable ventilation. They should be at least twelve, feet high, toulon the foul air to rise and escape. The temperature also, should be properly regulated; light should be allowed so that the eyes of the animals, "hold not be subjected to being brought out of a dark stable into broad sunlight by which they are often greatly injured. The color recommended for the ceiling is stone color, which may be easily made by mixing lamp black with the common white wash. The walls of the stable, should be built hollow the doors high and wide the stall be six feet wide at least, and the sides high, and long enough to prevent the interference of the animals with back other. The stables and stalls of course should contain provision for conducting off the liquid manure, which for the greater part is now almost entirely wasted. Some excellent directions with regard to the construction of stables and the requisite fastenings will be found in the Americanagriculturist. Other agricultural journals contain valuable suggestions on these important topics. The science or theory of cultivation is one which, for a few years past has excited and is now exciting much attention in Europe and this country. Met we suspect that in this country, even among our best informed agriculturists, there is great ignorance of the real state of the discussion abroad. Hair, the great, father of agricultural science in Germany, was a thorough practical man, and he showed by his wonderful success, that his views were not visionary. To has it been with Schwertz, Clock, Hope, Cabs t, Larger, He it and others. More recently, however, Lie big has appeared on the stage, controverting the former views, and his theories have called out earnest discussion. In the one hand he and his disciples have contended for the chemical system which would introduce an entire change in the modes of cultivation; while on the other hand, the best practical agriculturists of Germany will be found in opposition to many of his positions. The publication of his views in England and a in this country has been extensive. Some, however, of the ablest writers in Great Britain have declared their dissent, Lie big may have been premature in the a enunciation of his theories. Isa chemist his reputation entitled his opinions on that subject to credit, Isa physiology st and an agriculturists he has been successfully attacked, and many of his statements, or rather deductions, dis proved. Among his opponents, Under in Holland holds a very high rank, and in the opinion of Berzelius, the great question between Lie big and Under relative to protein, a constituent in the vegetable economy, seems to be decided in favor of Builder. Unfortunately for Lie big, he undertook to reduce his views relative to the nutrition of plants to practice, and compounded a kind of manure which he confidently believed would produce great results. We gave an account of this compound, together with Liebigs essay on the subject of manure, and a description of the process of preparing it for different plants in our report in 1845, and we have been not a little surprise ll to see the same during this year, more than two years afterwards, presented to the public in one of the largest agricultural journals of our country as something entirely new, which is likewise so important as 'to be worth the whole price of the volume even to our farmers. Liebigs manure, however, has been tried both in Germany and England, and cannot stand the test. His attempt to real use his theory to practice has resulted in the most signal failures. And for this reason, among others, the best practical agriculturists of Germany di six. a. 219 card his opinions. -any able publications have been given to the press in which this ground is taken. But while the writings of lie big and Petzholdt his disciple, have been put forth to the agriculturists of this country, they know nothing of Hlubek, Zenger ke, Schultz, and others of high reputation in Germany; of Awes and others in England, who have taken strong ground against his views. We will just quote here the opinion of Dr. Zenger ke, general secretary of the Royal College of And' Husbandry in russia, respecting the work of Petiholdt, which has been so greatly celebrated by some among us. It is contained in a review of recent agricultural literature in the Anna len der Landwirthschaft in den Koniglich Preuissischenstadten. He says, after mentioning the popular lectures of Dr. Alexanderpetzholdt" Ll his book is an epi to me, and partially a further carrying out of Liebigs views, in which we meet with a multiplicity of wholly gross blunders against established facts in agricultural practice. Though the author, for example, reaches that plants only need in organic things which may restore the elements exhausted, as ashes by burning; that animal manures can only be efficacious, sometimes, in consequence of a considerable formation of ammonia which takes place; that there is no reason of any kind to imagine the means of nutrition existing in the atmosphere as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen) insufficient for the success of plants under cultivation; though he breaches more and more of these and similar extravagances, no agriculturists of common sense, whether he regard scientific education ever so highly or ever so meanly, will be induced to cease taking all possible care of his dung hills, and will still acknowledge the enriching of his soil by means of organic substances as justly the highest aim of his efforts." Dr. Zenger ke then refers to the Agricultural Chemistry of Prof. Franz Schultz as one of rare merit. In the same review we find the following character given to Ulcers work on Physiological Chemistry" a work that men of the profession consider the most admirable which our literature has bestowed on this branch of science, and which supplies the most highly important contributions to the doctrine of the i nutrition of plants. This is incontestably sustained by observation and experiment. As characteristic of the book, we will only here add, that the author rejects the idea of the existence of an universal power which governs the organic structure, the so called vital power, as finding no confirmation by experience. Very change of substance in #in organic kingdom, like that in in organic nature is the result of the inherent powers of the elements and need be ascribed to no other cause he may likewise refer here to an essay published in the Royal Agricultural Society of England, by John Men net Awes, on agricultural chemistry, in which he comes out very decidedly against the theory of Lie big, as contrary to well established facts. This essay is pronounced, by the able editor of the London Gardeners' . Chronicle, to be the most important paper that has appeared in England, n this subject, for many years, and one which he thinks may have great influence on the future agricultural improvement of that kingdom. We should be glad, if our space allowed, to sub join the whole essay in an appendix; but we must content ourselves with quoting a portion of it. After giving some account of the progress of agricultural chemistry and alluding to the labors of German and French chemists in organic chemistry, he says, alluding to Lielzig and Boussingault: " Without entering into the merits of the different opinions maintained by these distinguished chemists, I may here observe, that many of the errors into which Lie big has fallen, have, I think, arisen from his not suf2BO X. efficiently considering what agriculture really is. Practical agriculture consists in the artificial accumulation of certain constituents, to be employed either as food for men or other animals, upon a space of ground incapable of supporting them in its natural state. If Lie big had sufficiently considered this distinction, he would not have assumed that certain substances, employed as manures, are of little value, because plants and trees, in their natural state are capable of obtaining them in sufficient quantity for their use. The great problem to be solved as to manure is, what substances is it necessary to supply to the soil in order to maintain a remunerative fertility? The solution of this question appears easy, regard being had only to the composition of the crops removed. Practically, however, there are great difficulties attending it, which can only be entirely overcome by along series of careful and costly experiments. If the ash theory, advanced by Lie big and so industriously propagated by his pupils, were founded on truth, careful examination of the ashes of plants and a few simple calculations upon t the amount of mineral substances exported from the soil in corn, meat, &c, would at once enable us to explain- and remedy the exhaustion of our soils. The farmer, when he sends his load of wheat to market would bring back the few pounds of minerals which the wheat contained, and the return of these to the. soil would enable him to produce the same amount of wheat for market the following year. Unfortunately, however, the ground work on which this theory is raised, is unsound, where agriculture, as distinct from natural vegetation, forms the subject of consideration. Agricultural plants, which practice has shown to differ widely from each other in their respective relations to soil, climate, &c, maturing and position in rotation, possess, at the same time, widely differing powers of reliance upon the atmosphere for the constituents which it is known to supply in a greater or less degree. If grain crops hold the same relation to natural and artificial supply of their organic constituents, as the leguminousplants and turn is, the farmer would not require the assistance of the latter crops; but since compared with these the grain crops, in some important respects are far more dependent upon artificial supply to the soil of certain organic constituents, of which the price is high and the supply limited, it becomes necessary to employ certain plants, which possess the power of collecting these ingredients from the atmosphere, and such a procedure constitutes a rotation of crops After a variety of interesting remarks, Mr. Awes comes to speak of the distinction between organic and in organic manures. He describes the operation of each, and remarks, that the atmosphere may be considered the natural source of organic and the soil that of in organic supply. "I t is the object of agriculture to increase the produce of the soil beyond its natural yield, which can be done by various means." He mentions following, in which the natural produce of the soil, for two years, is concentrated into one; the repeated exposure of the soil to the atmosphere by means of sloughing, causing a decomposition of mineral matter, while the ammonia of the rain unites with the various acids in the soil. Manures also, may supply those ingredients which the soil and atmosphere are incapable of yielding in sufficient quantity. He adds t has been argued by Liebigthat the atmosphere can supply the ammonia from which plants derive their nitrogen, in sufficient quantity for agricultural purposes; and his views on this subject have been echoed through England by a host of his followers. Thismoint, on which so much difference of opinion exists between the Frenchex. a. 21 and German chemists, is perhaps the most important to agriculture which chemistry. can solve. It affects the whole economy of cultivation, 'id the final solution of it must very materially influence the action of all practical agriculturists. With regard to the most important crop, (wheat) my own experiments are so decisive, and through the whole series the results are so uniform, that it is hardly possible to have two opinions on the subject, and what is still more, they are in accordance with the dictates of reason and the practical experience of agriculture. " He goes on to give an account of experiments in the employment of various mineral manures and the results. The conclusion to which he comes is this: "the absolute necessity of supplying nitrogen to enable the soil to produce more wheat than it could do in a natural state, is so apparent throughout this series of experiments that it is difficult to entertain the slightest doubt upon the subject. To long as any available ammonia exists in the soil, so long will mineral manures increase the produce of wheat. The various contradictory results obtained, by the application of mineral manures to wheat are completely accounted for, when it is known that they only increase the produce in proportion to the available agonized matter existing in the soil." He calls the whole class of plants of the natural order to which wheat belongs, nitrogen consuming plants, in contra distinction to the nitrogen collecting plants. Headdsthe theory advanced by Lie big, that the crops on a field diminish or increase in exact proportion to the diminution or increase of the mineral substances conveyed to it in manure, is calculated so seriously to mislead the agriculturists, that it is highly important its fallacies should be generally known. The contempt which the practical farmer feels for the science of agricultural chemistry arises from the errors which have been committed by its professors. They have endeavored to account for, and sometimes to pronounce, as erroneous, the knowledge which ages of experience have established, and they have attempted to generalized, without the practical data necessary to accomplish their end with success. Agricultge will, eventually, derive the most important assistance from chemistry; but before it can propose any changes in the established routine of the former, it must, by a series of laborious and costly experiments, explain this routine in a satisfactory manner' Again: "I t is not very difficult to arrive at a correct knowledge of the action and value of artificial manures. They are generally composed of two or three ingredients in a state of concentration, and are far more rapid in their action upon plants than the manure which is produced by animals. They can therefore be applied with greater success to those crops which are required in an artificial condition and the growth of which cannot be too vigorous. If there be any truth in my experiments, all hope of obtaining annual crops of corn (grain) by means of mineral manure must be forever abandoned. The employment of potash, soda, magnetic, and s iliac have been suggested by chemists from an imperfect knowledge of practical agriculture. Having found these substances in the ash of the plants, they have concluded that the soil cannot supply them in sufficient quantity. I could bring forward a great number of experiments tried at my suggestion upon various soils which would prove that alkaline manures were quite incompetent to remedy the exhaustion from which they suffered; but the general practice of the best agriculturists is more convincing than a thousand such experiments He supposes the case of a soil by successive crops' exhausted of its alkalies to the greatest extent possible, yet it may in a few years be brought 222 X. to a high condition without imparting to it a pound of potash or soda. The only mineral which under a proper system of agriculture, it is necessary to restore directly to the soil is phosphates of lime, Mr. Awes' whole essay is one which deserves the careful perusal of every agriculturists who wishes to see the important subject of which it treats clearly discussed. Mr. Karkeek, also a distinguished lecturer in England, seems to take a similar view of Liebigs recent doctrine, for after giving an account of a variety of experiments, the report of his lecture proceeds: Mr. Karkeek then averted to the doctrine recently introduced by Prof. Lie big, which under estimated the influence of organic manures n the soil, and attached the more importance to the in organic constituents of plants, by keeping up a supply of which in the soil he is of the opinion that the carbon and nitrogen which are necessary for the growth of the plant will be supplied by the atmosphere. This is a theory altogether opposed to the experiments which her. K.) had placed before them that day, and it was also opposed to Liebigs previous teaching. They might rely upon it that the in organic elements vere of little use in a soil as food for plants without a corresponding supply of the organic. The reason that gun no answered so well, was because it contained (like farm yard dung) all the elements which plants require and putting either into the earth restored those substances which plants abstract from it, and which are necessary to their growth lie have before averted to the view entertained by Her, and which, in a modified form, is still maintained by the ablest German practical agriculturists. Below we will give a comparative view of Liebigs system as distinguished from that of Hlubek. We will first, however, avert for a moment to a work by Prof. C. H. Schultz' who, from doubt as to the carbonic acid theory of Lie big was led to repeat the experiments falsely explained by Boussingault, Dobereiner, and Griesbach, and others, as to whether the acids naturally ex is tent in the vital juices and parenchym of the plant and th#acids or oxydized substances, might furnish the oxygen thrown off by plants in the light. From the experiments, and as the result of his former investigations, he drew the conclusion that this is the true theory of the nutrition of plants; that the agonized hum us is converted by the digestive operation of the roots in their vicinity into certain substances. These substances are the gum my juice of the wood, sugar, and the different vegetable acids in the various plants, of which the most common is lactic acid. But besides there are magic acid, nitric acid, tartar in acid, ace tic acid, and acetatis of these acids. Sulphur and phosphorus form plants likewise by the decomposition of phosphates and sulph a tic carbonates by means" of ox alice acid. In the Handbuch fur Angehende Landwirthe, we find a full statement of the theories of Hlubek, and Lie big, and the whole is summed up by a comparison in parallel columns of the great points maintained by each in reference to several important particulars of the theory of the nutrition of plants, &c. Hlubek may be considered the advocate of modified hum us theory which Her so earnestly supported, and which has been the admitted system of Sprengel and all the celebrated agricultural writers in Germany, as well as Air Humphrey Navy and others in England. The following is the comparison alluded to x. 
223Comparison of the Theories of Hlubek and Lie big. The main points in which they differ are the following n respect to the supply of Plants with Carbon. Hlubek. Plants obtain this elementary substance in the form 1. Of carbonic acid which exists in the atmosphere and which is formed by the putrefaction of dung andhumas2. Of he mates, also of dung and hum us extract 3.

Thus for example, in rape, turn is, beans, &c, the product is always in a direct ratio to the quantity of manure employed. Of  Ebi 1. The carbon in plants comes exclusively from the atmosphere, which is produced by the process of respiration and combustion 2. The carbonic acid of hum us contributes to the nutrition of plants only by process of germination. Carbon obtained in a given extent. We may on one and the same soil, whether it be manured or not from a given extent, obtain an equal amount of carbon. Or the quantity of carbon in one and the same soil of a given extent, remains constant, whether we cultivate forest trees, grasses, hold fruits, the cereals. I I Of n respect to the supply of Plants with Nitrogen 1. Plants receive nitrogen in the form of ammonia, especially from the nitrates, since the land cultivated may in a certain degree be considered as a nitrogenous or riotous plantation; the ammonia contained in the atmosphere, is too trifling to take into consideration in maturing 1. Plants receive nitrogen from the ammonia of rain water, and this ammonia is derived not only from the putrefaction of organic bodies, but it is 'also in part a constituent part of the body of the globe 2. Animal manures operate only by the formation of ammonia. I Y.-- (did 127) .reference to the efficacy and operation of Of manure and Humus1. The direct efficacy of manures table manure) and of hum us consists in the attraction a) Of carbon in the form of carbonic acid and extract of hum us, or humid acid and humatesb) Of nitrogen in the form of ammonia and nitrate s c) Of sulphur, in the form of sulphuric acid gas and sulphates 2. The indirect consists a) In the loosening of the soil, promoting the entrance of the atmosphere as well as the spreading out of the roots 1. Manure and hum us have no part in the carbon of the harvest 2. Animal manure operates only by the formation of ammonia, whereby plants are furnished with nitrogen 3. The solid excrements can exert no efficacy in vegetation with the nitrogen which they contain; but 4. The proper effect of the solid excrements is limited to the in organic matter, (constituents of plants224Ex; a. Hlubekb) In the ascent of the warmth of the land, in consequence of ferment at ion and of its dark color c) The increase of the capacity of absorption of the atmospheric moisture. Of n reference to the efficacy of the I n organic Constituents of Plants 1. The efficacy of the in organic constituents of plants as well as of the soil, is confined simply to an indirect influence which depends especially on their physical properties as co lesion, adhesion, capacity for heat and reception and retention of water 2. The geographical extension of the cultivated plant is dependent simply on the degree of warmth and moisture, and luxuriant growth, on the directly nutritions substances (manures in the proper sense) and a careful preparation of the soil. The in organic constituents, vizsilicates, carbonates and phosphates form 'not only the nutrition of plants, but they also play so important apart, that as above mentioned, the peculiar efficacy of the solid excrement of the domestic animals is confined to the supply of the in organic substances. Of   .-I n reference to the efficacy of Gypsum. Gypsum acts directly with the soul- Gypsum fixes the ammonia of the p hur which it contains as a means of atmosphere and supplies plants with nutrition, and indirectly as the ni to- nitrogen gen of the ammonia developed by the putrefaction of manure to the plants, is attracted in the form of sulphate of ammonia; the sulphur of the gypsy min the ground rich in hum us, and so forming much carbonic acid, although no longer exhibiting ammonia, is attracted to plants in the form of sulphuric acid gas.

There should be a definite proportion between winter and summer crops, between those directly and indirectly commercial plants, in order that the danger of failure may be lessered, the labors uniformly divided, the exhaustion of the soil covered, the domestic animals be nourished according to their nature; &c 5. As in plants -we can find no organized excrements analogous to those of the organic animals, and these are confined solely to evaporation, therefore the rotation of crops is not based on the mere exception of plants, but on the grounds above mentioned.

If the fibres of the roots are burdened with excrements, then the plants die; we must tear up the soil and cultivate other plants until the excrements of the plants that preceded are perfectly de composed, when they can be again planted on the same field. (Lie big attaches peculiar value to the still very problem a tic exceptions of plants n the Southern Cultivator for March, 1847, we find an able article which discusses the errors of Liebigs views, and points out the grounds of them very clearly. We can only refer to it, but would commend it to the perusal of those who wish to see the subject very properly treated. With a few exceptions it is the only article we have seen in the agricultural journals of this country, but what seem to admit his whole theory. The writers remarks also on the true province of agricultural chemistry, and the aid to be derived from it, are permanent and deserve attention. He says, speaking of the natural sciences: " to hold them up as a means by which the' young farmer is to conduct his business most profit ably, while he yet remains wholly or partially ignorant of the improved systems of modern practice and management, cannot be followed by the best results. The most. important knowledge must be first attained, and afterwards that which is less essential in practice." Still we should avail ourselves of the many valuable suggestions which chemistry offers for trial and practice, as Prof. Johnston very justly remarks: " It is foolish to refuse to avail ourselves of the morning light because it is not equal to the midday sun n his late preface to Under, Prof. Johnston (with reference to the ash theory) after averting to the fact that the ash of a plant is an assembly age of many and various parts, says: " What exact truth can the analysis of such an ash teach us ?a? It may be supposed, or may be found to possess, sonierudeagricultural value, but exact physiology must by and by dismiss all such empirical results; and refined agriculture will journey side by side with refined physiology. The useful, though introduce tory, and as it were ten native results of our past analyses, will give place to more patient and minute researches, such as those to which the present work points the way Some very interesting discussions respecting farm yard manure, are contained i in the English agricultural journals. We are able to avert only to a few points. In a lecture of Mr. Nesbitt, before the London Farmers' Club, he remarks :a" In the preparation of farm yard dung there are two or three points worthy to be observed. The first is, that many of these substances are so ruble. Now, the common way of preparing farm yard dung, every 15 226 X. body is acquainted with: a large mass of straw and excrement is allowed to <a name="rot14"><mark>rot</mark></a> in the midst of a quantity of water, where, instead of a genial heat being produced, it is washed by the water, which, saturated with so ruble matter, is allowed to run away, as if the farmer intended to wash his manure to make it clean. Now it so happens that every where those substances which are most valuable, are most easily lost. A quantity of dung thus exposed to the action of the water, will lose its potash, its soda, the greater part of its ammonia, its so ruble salts of lime; in fact only the insoluble and comparatively worthless parts will be left behind. There are many ways of making manure heaps. Perhaps the best way is to make layers of animal excrement with straw on a <a name="mould17"><mark>mould</mark></a> bottom; to lay thereon a foot or so of manure and straw, a little gypsy m over that, and sometimes a little <a name="mould18"><mark>mould</mark></a>; then another layer, and so on, covering the whole with six or eight inches of ditch stuffSWith reference to the application of manure, he says t is evident that you ought to apply the greatest quantity of so ruble matter to those plants which grow the quickest. You ought to apply the substances which are most so ruble to those plants which take out manure most quickly; you ought to apply those substances which are least so ruble to those plants which take out the manure most slowly. Now, applying these rules, you will perceive that within certain limits the more your manure is decomposes the more so ruble it becomes. When you first lay it down, it is nearly insoluble, but by the continuous action which takes place, the various substances are rendered much more so ruble, so that it will act much more quickly. Therefore <a name="rotted3"><mark>rotted</mark></a> dung ought rather to be used for those plants which you wish to grow quickly, and dung not so much de composed for plants of a slower growth. Now there are different times of the year for putting manure on the land. Some will put it on in summer and leave the action of the air for the winter. The good effect of that will depend a great deal upon the dung itself, and the rain which falls in the succeeding months. If you put on your land well <a name="rotted4"><mark>rotted</mark></a> dung, and expose it during three or four months of winter to the action of the water and the air, I have not the least hesitation in saying that the so ruble portions will be exceedingly liable to be washed away from the soil. In the contrary, if you put on in the frost long dung, you will not be so likely to suffer <a name="loss34"><mark>loss</mark></a>, because the dung is not yet sufficiently de composed to contain much so ruble matter He urges strenuously the importance of gathering all kinds of manure, and observes that the first duty of the farmer is to prevent on his farm the <a name="loss35"><mark>loss</mark></a> of any substance which can, by its decomposition into manure, reproduce vegetable life. He then strongly recommends the use of bone dust, and, in minute quantities, nitrate of soda, sulphate of soda, and common salt. Iliac, also, in small quantity, may be used to give strength to the straw of wheat, &c. in considered one ton of dung which has been <a name="rotted5"><mark>rotted</mark></a> more valuable than a ton of fresh dung, because it had a greater effect. 'The reason of it is this: In the general action of the decomposition of manure, the ammonia was retained and the whole was reduced into less bulk. They had double the amount of mineral ingredients, double the ammonia; they only lost the carbon and the hydrogen. lie had never yet heard of an instance in which well <a name="rotted6"><mark>rotted</mark></a> dung did not, on trial, prove more valuable than fresh dung. In reference to some misunderstanding of his view, he also added maintain, as I did before, that a ton, of dung which has been <a name="rotted7"><mark>rotted</mark></a> is far more valuable than a ton of dung which has not been <a name="rotted8"><mark>rotted</mark></a> 'x. a. 227 his question as to the application of manures, fresh or <a name="rotten4"><mark>rotten</mark></a>, is also well treated in Gerardines essay on manures. He says" The long or fresh manures which occupy much space, have a more prolonged anddurable action on vegetation than the short, so that they are applied to plants which remain a longer time growing, to strong, compact andclayey soils, which they render light by their fibrous structure. The short manures, which are heavy and compact, exercise an immediate action on plants, but this action is less dura be, and hence these are applied to plants which remain only three or four months on the ground and to light soils. I need the long dung is used in a state in which it is less easily brought into solution, and the short manures are in so advanced a state of decomposition as to have lost a great part of their fe utilizing properties, which have escaped into the atmosphere in the shape of gases and vapors n reference to their chemical composition, he adds" 'fresh manure, which has undergone scarcely any ferment at ion, contains the following substances: Later, seventy-five; so ruble, vegetable and animal matters, and so ruble salt, five; insoluble, vegetable and animal matters and insoluble salts, twenty; vegetable fibre and straw, one hundredBoussingault represents the composition of farm yard manure after six months, which he calls ordinary dung: Later, 79.3; organic matters, 14.03,salts and earths, 6.67=20.7=100.00. According to Boussingault, dung reduced by a long continued ferment at ion to a pasty brownish black mass, or black butter, has the following composition: Later, 72.20; organic so ruble matters and so ruble salts, 1.50; insoluble salts, 10.2 ; straw, converted into pe at, 12.40; finely divided petty matter, analogous to the foregoing 363 10000 Richardson obtained a slightly different result from the analysis of an average specimen of manure in the state in which it is spread on the land: Later, 64.96; organic matters, 24.71; -mineral matters, to was and, 3.20, so ruble salts, 1.34, insoluble salts, 5.79=10.33==100.00. Fresh manure, then, contains one fifth of its weight of insoluble- matters, which can only serve for the nutrition of plans, when converted into newsoluble compounds, into carbonic acid and ammonia. Now, in order to effect this change, a ferment at ion is required which can only take place fully when collected into a large mass. If then the dung be spread on the land immediately after it comes from the stable, this necessary ferment at ion will be imperfectly performed in the soil, so that a greater part of the manure will remain inactive, and the change of the vegetable fibre into nutritivematter goes in very slowly. But if a slight degree of ferment at ion, capable of destroying the co lesion of the vegetable fibre, predisposing it to decomposition and solution, is useful to manure before spreading it upon the land, a long continuance of the same action will prove to be injurious, as is seen in the heaps of manure of our farms. Under these circumstances the mass becomes strongly heated, numerous chemical reactions take place, the constituents are completely de composed, an abundant dis engagement of gases takes place, and a day colored liquid is formed. Hung thus loses twenty-five per cent. of its original bulk, so that one hundred cart loads of fresh manure are reduced to severity-five. The gas disengaged consists chiefly of carbonic acid, carburetted hydrogen and ammonia, the useful effects of which are lost. Navy made a curious and convincing experiment on this head. He filled a retort with dung and placed the neck among the roots in the border of a garden. In less than a week its influence was visible; the grass presented 228 X. a forcible contrast to the remainder of the turf, and vegetated with extraordinary rapidity. Besides the dissipation of the gas there is also a <a name="loss36"><mark>loss</mark></a> of heat, which if developed in the soil, would excite the germination of the seeds and aid the growth of plants. In the ferment at ion which these substances undergo when buried in the soil the gases come in contact with the roots as fast as they are generated. They are there we warm at the moment when they are absorbed by the roots, and are thus much more efficacious than if the manure had been allowed to put rely before it is used. Agricultural works are full of facts which accord with this view. The celebrated Her took great pains not to allow the manure to accumulate in heaps, and to convey it to the land as often as the season would permit. Hassenfratz manured two similar lands, one with long dung in which the straw had only commenced to put rely, the other with perfectly delayed manure capable of being easily cut by the spade. These two pieces of land were cultivated and sown in the same manner; the second produced larger, stronger and more vigorous plants the first year than the former; but the second year when neither was manured the former produced larger and stronger crops than the latter, the third year the former still had a slight advantage over the latter. The conclusion from the foregoing is clear enough; that when we desire to influence a succession of crops we must employ not the delayed manure, the action of which is ephemeral, but the long and fresh, which moreover has the advantage of giving heat to the soil, of removing aridity, of awakening and bringing into action the force of the residues of former manures which have hitherto, resisted decomposition in experience of more than seven years' says Picket, 'has convinced me that we shall be great gainers by using manure as soon as it copies from the stables' ",I n the Journal d Agriculture Critique, there are some very excellent remarks on the foregoing topics by M. Ville roy, contained in a Sort of series of agricultural maxims, which may be profit ably quoted here on the general topic of cultivation, and we hate accordingly translated- them for this purpose as we have never seen them in English before, and they comprise much in a small compass. These observations are a kind of introduction to an article on the properties and uses of water in the cultivation of plants. The subject of irrigation is one which is exciting much interest in Europe as well also as that of draining, and there are many interesting passages on these particular branches of the general one which if we could find space we should like to quote, but we must forego that pleasure at present. M. Ville roy is a practical agriculturists, and stands high as a writer in the French, agriculturists periodicals' Drops are always in direct proportion to the manure which the farmer uses. It is not the largest area which gives the most profit, but that which is best tilled i and especially the best manured. A small farm well cultivated and well manured will give a greater clear profit than a large one, where the same labor and the same quantity of manure is employed on a greater extent of surface. Manure is the basis of agricultural prosperity and success. With a sufficient quantity of manure, the most arid and un promising soil may be made fruitful and abundant in crops. Of all manures there is none so valuable or important as stable manure; it agrees best with all kinds of fields and plants and modes of culture. Even if other more energetic manures be employed, this cannot be wholly dispensed with, and they should be used rather to augment its action or red x. place it. Those manures are not in sufficient quantity or so universal as to supersede the use of stable manure and as a general thing cultivation would be impossible without the aid of this latter. In the same degree as the product depends not on the area, but on the culture and quantity of manure, does the greater quantity of manure depend not on the greatest number of animals but on the greatest amount of fodder consumed. Animals produce nothing of themselves they only transform the fodder, they consume into manure; part of it is assimilated for their sustenance and a part becomes excrement or manure. The more nourishment is given to beasts the more fe utilizing is the manure. A lean beast makes less manure than a fat one a well fed one gives twice as much as a poorly fed one. Since, then, the success of agriculture depends on the quantity of manure produced, and this again depends on the quantity of fodder consumed, it follows that, the greatest quantity of fodder consumed in the management of the farm insures the most solid prosperity. Whenever much and good fodder is produced, there is also produced much good manure, and whenever there is a sufficient quantity of manure, there will be rich and abundant harvests. Generally the energy of agricultural management may be judged of by the amount of cultivated fodder on which it is based, and its progress in the production of fodder should be regarded also as the progress of the farming. Notwithstanding the extent of artificial meadows, and the perfection which has been obtained in the root culture and of the fodder plants, meadows which are overflowed always hold the first place. They do not consume manure, and yet they produce much. Green plants contain seventy-five per cent. of their weight in water, and this is formed of oxygen and hydrogen, which are also the basis of vegetable matter, and furnishes plants with a portion of the carbonic acid which they need. Later also may contain sulphur, lime, and other salts, the greater part of which are de composed and absorbed by plants. Later also deposites slime, which fertilizes it carries off a large quantity, likewise, of other fe utilizing particles, unless these are arrested by the hand of culture, and turned to use. The amount of earth thus carried off is, vast. According to Penn el, the Ranges every hour deposites at its mouth2509056000 cubic feet of earth, .the Mile 14,784,000, and the Misssissippi800000. This is the origin of the rich del was at the mouths of some large rivers. It is a singular fact that the Boths and Canals, &c, who destroyed the temples and other monuments of I talk, respected the structures destined to agriculture, aqueducts, &c. After peace they. dug out canals, &c. Themoors promoted agriculture in Pain. Later nourished plants later contains fe utilizing principles, even that of the most limp id fountain, and motion is necessary to dis engage them. Meadow is enriched more where the declivity is marked than otherwise. The want of declivity may be supplied by the increased quantity of water this gives greater motion to the water. If from want of declivity water remains on a meadow in a small quantity, part is absorbed, part elaborated, and it produces but little effect. If there be too large a quantity to beevaporated it forms acids, and destroys the plants, and produces miasmas230 X. a. If on the borders of a ditch is seen copious and thick herb age, but it is poor at a little distance, it is proof that it is badly managed. The <a name="evil27"><mark>evil</mark></a> maybe corrected by giving greater declivity to the soil, and thus the same water will irrigate and fertilizes to a greater distance. If there be but little water, as usual with springs, too great declivity cannot be given to the soil, and thus the effect is increased. Such is not the case with a great quantity of water, for if the declivity be great the stream carries off not only fe utilizing particles but the earth also, and leaves bare the roots of the herb age. Waterstimulates vegetation n meadows which are irrigated, the pores of the leaves of the plants are larger than in the same not watered. They are supposed to possess greater powers of absorption, by having their vital power increased and thus absorb more gas from the atmosphere. Later is a solvent Without a sufficiency of it manure cannot ferment and de compose. It acts mechanically, divides and dissolves the manure on the surface of the earth, and renders it into a state to penetrate and reach the roots of plants. Later protects and preserves, plants, from heat arid cold While water runs on a meadow v it preserves the same temperature. If frost seize on the plants, the fatal effects may be prevented by watering them before they freeze. Later is a means of freeing meadows from insects and hurt full animals, mice, moles, &c; also moss, briars and noxious weeds The system of deep sloughing, thus turning up the sub soil, is becoming better understood and practised upon. There are many plants which require the soil to be stirred and loosened, and the roots of which, if there be no obstruction, will penetrate deep for their nutriment; and when the upper strata of the soil is partially exhausted, by turning up that which lies beneath, the elements necessary to sustain the vegetable life may be obtained. A correspondent of the London Gardeners' Chronicle 'alluding to this subject, and its great importance in a system of husbandry, and in connection with maturing deeply, says" I have found the roots of the Swedish turn in five feet below v the surface on which its bulb was growing and all around it to the distance of three or four feet, the fibres of the root to a lesser depth had completely permeated the soil his object of deep cultivation has led to the invention of numerous ploughs, which cut a furrow inch further into the earth, and the success which has attended experiments of the kind, with reference to a variety of products, encourages the idea that were the practice to become more universal, it would add greatly to the amount of the crops which are now gathered. Any fields which now present a sickly appearance might thus be made to wear a greet and health full aspect; and the additional labor w0udldbe recompensed by increasing stores of the fits of the earth. There is a hidden richness even in comparatively exhausted soils, which it needs only the rightful application of the true principles of culture to bring out and impart to the various plants that belong to a well chosen rotation of crops. Our countrymen may be slow and. unwilling to learn the benefits which might accrue by these improvements; but eventually it is believed that they will understand them and avail themselves of all that both science and practice may suggest for the enriching, amelie rating and fructifying the soil. For a kind of plough for cane cultivation, see Appendix, Nocid127) 18. It may be proper to allude here to the varieties of seeds which have been x. a. 231 and l are yet to be distributed for l this price. I Efforts have been used to secure a valuable collection, and it is believed that with proper care they will not disappoint the expectations. It is not surprising that in many instances the seeds which -have gone from the Patent Office may not have terminated. This might be the case and yet result from no fault of the article. Careless planting; neglect of cultivation; un seasonable weather, and a variety of similar causes, may influence the success of them. But in many instances it is gratifying to know, that where they have been planted with attentive care, watched and properly treated, they have proved to be the means of introducing valuable products into parts of the country where they had not been known, and thus furnished a higher standard ofculinary vegetables or field fruits which has exerted a beneficial influence for years. One of the articles which are expected from Europe have not yet arrived, but it is hoped that they will be soon here, and in time to be tried the coming season. We may also avert here to samples of wool prepared on cards and embracing the best varieties in Russia and Germany, which are to be sent one to each state; as standards for the wool growers of our country. 'lTheywere procured by Mr. Fleischmann in Europe, in circumstances of unusual advantage, and it cannot be expected that a better selection can be made for many years to come, as they have been derived from the choicest animals of the most celebrated flocks in that whole country where so much attention has been paid to this great branch of husbandry. These collections of seeds and specimens show what might be done were a more organized plan adopted for the purpose, and how g early our country might- be benefit ted by a small out lay of expense, aided by unceasing attention to the objects. It is by watching every new discovery in the field of agricultural improvements, and seizing upon the developed elements which have just started into being, and applying them for the benefit of our fellow countrymen, that we believe much may be accomplished in this- wide domain with which the interests and welfare of so many millions are deeply identified. In the circular; sent from the office there were several particulars on which we had hoped to have been able to furnish some information embodied in comparative tables and deductions; but owing to the want of sufficiently extended attention to them we have concluded to omit them. Met a word or two may not be amiss on these subjects, also as indicative of what might be accomplished by the cooperation of the friends of agriculture. One question -presented related to the proportion of cultivated to uncultivated land. Some of our correspondents have furnished satisfactory replies, and although there exists great disparity of the returns in the differentiates, and even in the same state, yet enough is to be gathered from what we have had made known to us to lead us to believe that if similar responses had come from -every state, and from more sections of those states respectively from which we have heard, we might have derived interesting comparative estimates from the same. The replies respecting the quantity of seed used, the average product per acre, the time of harvesting or gathering, the most approved `rotation of crops, are more complete so far as they extend; but unfortunately here again, from soie of the states no answers have been received, and the replies therefore could only embrace some few of the states; so that we must forego the execution of our purpose to make the above particulars the subject of special comment 232 X- a. We throw out here, however, some hints respecting topics which it is desirable to have embodied in our agricultural reports throughout f the country, and to which we could w is h the attention of agriculturists in every part of our And might be directed in their correspondence with the agricultural journals. We are convinced that thus an immense amount of impcid127rtant information might be secured. State legislatures would no doubt confer a benefit on the whole nation, as well as on their individual constituency, were they to procure as much of such information as practicable aid annually spread it before the people; and it is certainly not unworthy the attention of our National Congress. It is desirable then, not merely to obtain the amount of population, but so far as practicable the quantity of land cultivated for each crop, the probable amount of home consumption of the crops raised, whether for sustenance of nm an or stock, or of manufactures and their respective values. The proportion of animal to vegetable food, &c. In arranging the crops which are staple to our country, we may classify together those which are mainly used for human food, as the cereals; those which are used for the food principally of animals, though also at the same time used for human food; those which are used exclusively for the food of other animals besides man; and. punts which are used for industrial pursuits, or purposes of trade, and not for food. This class of plants is termed in the German books, commercial plants, and embraces those which are raised for their fibrous texture, or the spinning plants as they are called; the oil) lands; the drug or dye plants; and arrangements, and deductions might be made with reference to these which would furnish many interesting particulars and held us more fully to understand the capacity of our country, when once its immense agricultural resources shall be developed, to supply the world. In reference also to the effect of their cultivation on the soil, there might be another and a useful classification, such as that of plants which exhaust the soil. those that enrich the .soil, and the proportion in which these of each class are raised throughout our whole country. Some regard has been paid to this mode of estimate in France and other parts of the European continent. The close connection of this subject with the various theories of cultivation and nutrition of plants renders it at this period when so much attention is turned to the topic by our scientific and practical agriculturists an interesting matter of investigation. Among the topics of discussion which occupy the attention of European economists in reference to agriculture, and on which we often find many useful thoughts in their writings, are the causes or difficulties which lie in the way of improvements. They are classified differently, but one of the most common arrangements we have met with has suggested to us the following observations, which embraces part of theirs, and others we have added. Some of the specifications in European countries do not apply to our own. The difficulties therefore, in the way of improvement may be classed under the following heads. The nature of the soil, location, &c. The remedy for these, so far as they can be remedied, is evidently the greater skill in adapting .the crops selected to inert the difficulty and more science and skill in mechanical cultivation. I I . From want of materials to enrich it: and here also it is very easy to suggest the remedy, but more difficult to make our countrymen so far feel x. a. 33 sacs practice ability as to apply their energies to use it. The modes of cultivation are so wasteful, so much is suffered to be lost that might be saved, mines of wealth as it were lying about their streets and farms and plantations, in every shape and form that might be turned to enrich the soil and make it far more productive. I I I. From the climate, embracing here the temperature, moisture, &c more careful observations, comparisons and deductions on this subject are desirable and this element deserves far more attention in the selection and adaptation of crops, than is often given to it. I V. The want of market or communication. The influence of this in our country is daily becoming less by the operation of extended lines of rail roads, canals and telegraph in lines. More will probably also be 'done in respect to gathering and diffusing knowledge of the prices of agricultural products and the demand for them, so that in every part of our country a good acquaintance with the state of the market at home and abroad will be enjoyed. In the circular sent from this office was likewise embraced the price of the different articles cropped or raised, and the answers received show that only wider cooperation is needed, to secure much useful information on this subject. The influence of railways on agriculture has been brought before the agricultural conventions of Europe ,as a topic of commanding interest take ni in this kind of stocks; much information has been collected by a committee of the House of Commons, in reference to the effect of railways on agricultural improvement. Among these is the testimony of :JGmesSmith of Means ton, well known as the advocate of draining, and a successful agriculturists as well as the author of divers works 'and conmrlimiiicationson the subject of farming, in the agricultural journals o England. As this em bodies so many facts which bear on the question, we shall quote from it at some length l He says: " I have observed upon those lies which have been in existence for ,some years, that a very greatimprioveient oft like lands in the neighborhood has been the result, arising mainly from the Cheapness and facility of transport, and I have drawn of some tables to ill is tate that. I have one table taking a farm of- two hundred acres, and a six course, shift 1 have taken this farm upon .the six course shift which is most suitable for the bulk of the medium of England and . Scotland. I have. supposed that farm to be in most full cultivation, thoroughly improved, and be both arable and pasture. I have taken -the quantities of green and' dry produce and cattle, &c. Very thing which I can cope give ; ill be expectedfomthat farm; and. it amounts to one hundred And forty-eight tons. ii ave then taken the imports, consisting of store cattle to be fed lime ana other matters, such as gun no, and the different chemical manures which are now being introduced, an also seed, because the shifting of seed in a god farm is always attended to, and I have supposed that. this weight shalt e transported on an average fifteen miles, which I think is a very low estimate. The quantity imported will be one hundred and ninety-seven tons, making altogether of exports and imports, three hundred and forty-five tons. When I have taken the expense of transport by railway, at id. air ton per mile, and in the present advanced state of railways, we may fairly assume that to be the general rate. In this average and, taking the r number of persons that will travel to market, at I d. per mile, the whole amount of i charge for carriage of imports and exports: is 40, 8s. 9d .a' By! the old mode the expense, assuming 6d. per ton per .mile for goods, would have 234 X. been 142, 16s. 3d. These estimates were made, he stated, after de ducting for home consumption. The saving thus made on the supposed farm would be 102, 7s. 6d. and the farm itself, before worth only 400, would be worth 500, or 10s. per acre more." It is not improbable that the difference in our own country might be even greater. He also alluded to the great advantage in respect to stock, stating that the expense of carrying on railways is nearly the same as that of driving, and in fat animals the <a name="loss37"><mark>loss</mark></a> in their condition in driving them from sixty to seventy miles was equal to the whole expense of the transport, at least 5 per cent. on the value of the but lock. He dwelt likewise on the benefit to be derived from the more general use of new chemical and imported manures, and the transportation even of earth for the purpose of mixing soils. In reference to the transport of animals, when further questioned, Mr. Smith said, that without rail roads it is impossible to transport fat cattle any greater distance than from sixty to seventy miles without very great deter i oration, but rail roads will afford the means of transporting these cattle three or four hundred miles with great advantage, and in car cases they may be transported seven hundred :miles. In advantage also mentioned with respect to this last item, is 'that where the animals are killed in the country and their car cases sent to market from some distance, the of fall and inward parts which may be made available in large quantities as manure are thus saved to the land and that which in the 1 re towns is often a nuisance, may become of great value to the agriculture of the country. These suggestions would seem to deserve attention among the agriculturists of our own country, and similar minuteness of investigation would no 'doubt, throw much light on the subject and perhaps be a better mode of bringing home to the minds of the community the in irene advantages of increased facilities of communicatiocid127) than merely general statements, as to the probable amount of transportation, &c. from any particular region of a proposed route. V. A fifth difficulty in the 6 way o improvement so times is the wan of the requisite force in animals or laborers. Our error on this subject is, undoubtedly, the extensive mode of cultivation which is adopted, instead- of the 'intensive: There is a too great fondness for faring on the large scale by which the I court of labor and: materials is district ted to far less advantage over aide even area of land, that were they limited to a smaller one. The improvement in machinery aid implements will (to something to meet this difficulty. Greater improvement in the I Laboring material will, probably, do still rim re, s it is all known that efficiency and i profit depend on h the application of why i cal. force under i the direction of mind by which litter as it were becomes inspirited with life and action. Of   . The warn t of information among the people, their prejudices, and theiwuillingiiess of so mi to 'avail themselves of increasing light, form an important it e in i t lie list of dietikilties which hi under improvement. The rewiodes of culture are ti us it f  r on 'aing their proper influence andrinmany a farm which i might be I me lucrative is- suffered to run i down and be any thing but a source of comfort or profit to to owner. The diffuse ion ofacgricultiual periodicals and works of value, i f lectures and d all suitable encouragement e to the obtaining- a higher stain did of gr i cultural knowledge is a method of remedying this difficulty whiccid127) should i be steadfastly kept in view %y the statesman and- every friend to the 6 welfare of his country   ll . The tendency of the young me fn of the country to seek other employments instead of training theimrseves for this branch of industry. Theex. 235 maxim that labor is honorable, we rejoice to believe is gaining ground, but, perhaps, there is a tendency to forsake the pursuits of agriculture for the more fluctuating and hazardous ones of commercial, mercantile, or manufacturing life. But the aim should be to place agriculture foremost among the physical employments of our country, and to the proper elements for success in this respect should be joined the elevation of thorough acquaintance with its principles as a science as well as its details as a practical business, and thus increased estimation should be shed upon it by the honorable examples which should every There be like lights in all parts of the country. The facilities now afforded by able lecturers in some parts of our land will, no doubt, be multiplied, and schools embracing thorough agricultural education will do much to diffuse still more widely the researches of the scientific and practical men of all countries in relation to this great subject. Of   I I. Another difficulty in the' way of improvement which is sometimes mentioned, is the but ability of legislation. This we find assigned, especially, in the discussions of the subject in foreign journals. The same cause may operate to some extent in our of ri country. Met, as here, there is no direct action on this great branch of national industry, as there is on the continent and in monarchical kingdoms, this influence must be very limited among us, in comparison to what it is abroad. We have judged it proper, however, to mention it in the general summary we are now making. I X. I ignorance of the science of apportionment. This is, perhaps, one of the most important deficiencies of our agriculturists. There are a few even of the otherwise well informed farmers who are acquainted with this important branch of husbandry. The economy of the farm as it may be termed is a subject to which they have devoted little or no attention. Met there can be no doubt that the bearing of this branch of agricultural science is no slight one. It is for the want of it that there is so much vagueness in the experiments of our agriculturists, and so little ability to present a fair estimate of the real state of their farming. I included in this general topic is that of farming accounts or agricultural book keeping. This has been made a matter of careful study in Europe, and many volumes have been published on the best methods to be adopted for the purpose. The valuation of the cultivated land which is made according to law with reference to the actual profit or <a name="loss38"><mark>loss</mark></a>, makes this absolutely necessary in those countries. Some of the works which treat of the science of apportionment are full, and furnish a vast fund of information relating to the proportions to be maintained between different crops, the quantity of land, of seed, the number of laborers, the time to be employed, the expense of cultivation, the number of stock to be kept, the quantity of manure to be made, and how this is to be procured, the amount of crops, time consumed, and force to be employed in gathering them, &c, and, indeed, every particular embraced in the operations of farming husbandry. We have before us now two such volumes of encyclopedias of proportions of admirable preparation, one containing over a thousand, and the other son re 400 pages. The former is a digest of the opinions of all the best writers in Germany, including estimates of all descriptions; the latter a proper manual of agricultural proportions ably condensed, and enabling one by turning to it to see at once the exact proportions and relations, and the parts of the most successful husbandry of that country. We know of nothing like either in the English language, and it is believed t that were the question' to be put to 80 or 100 intelligent farmers of our countrymen, there would scarcely be two who would agree and, perhaps, not one of the whole number who could answer on2cid1276 X. this important branch of knowledge, from accurate observation of his own experience in the conduct of his farming affairs. It may not appear to others so important, but we cannot hesitate to allege it as a serious difficulty in the way of improvement, that so much time and labor is no doubt wasted which by a proper knowledge of the relative capabilities of the parts to each other and to the whole might be turned to profit. Things which appear but trifling in this respect may exercise great influence in the general aggregate. It forms no good reason that because these matters were unknown to our fathers, and they have succeeded in the management of their farms, therefore, all such aids should be rejected. His might be alleged with equal correctness against every thing in the shape of improvements of agricultural implements or modes of culture. We might mention other difficulties which lie in the way of improvement, but these will suffice for the present. In our previous reports, we have here introduced some remarks respecting our surplus products and home or foreign markets accompanied with various tables of articles in transit which more especially belonged to agricultural production. We shall reserve some remarks and a variety of tables for the appendix and hope there to present a fuller view than can elsewhere be obtained in any one volume of our internal commerce and the relations of our agricultural products to the foreign trade and home consumption. It is our intention, if not disappointed in the effort we have made, to give the latest -estimate as to the probable demand on our agricultural resources for the supply of other nations and to furnish a comparative list of prices of the various articles which come into market at home or abroad. There are several object which we would here suggest as worthy the notice of Congress, and of the respective state governments and which, were a full cooperationgitinted, might no doubt be attained in connection with our annual report. The. interests of the country are so closely allied to the various branches of industry which centre their improvements in this office, that it possesses unusual facilities for collecting the kind of information to which we would now allude. Almost every one feels the necessity of some yearly compilation of the varied resources of our several states, and could there be procured from every state in the Union the statistics of its progress in industrial pursuits, andespeia1ll in agriculture, it would be a great acquisition particularly if these could be condensed and a suitable summary c! the same be made and yearly published. Not only the members of out national legislature, but very many of our fellow citizens in various parts of the country would find such a condensed view useful, and showing, as it might at a glance them ritual dependence of all parts of this republic, tend to bind together the various sections in firmer union. To the nations abroad it would present such an increasing development of our resources as would lead them to study the means by which our prosperity was attained, and seek it may be, to emulated our example, while our influence would be felt in its happiest form by our standing for ft in emergencies of great need, to become as it were thealmoners of a kind Providence to finishing realms. I n formation and knowledge of our means, is so important that it might well be purchased at almost any cost, and the more diffused among the people is this species of knowledge, the better they understand the nature and productive amounts of the elements of national prosperity at their command the more enlarged will be their feelings ii respect to the high aims which should ever characterize an intelligent, free and virtuous people. X. a. 237 t is ignorance, too limited knowledge of the mutual dependence we have to each other, which tends to generate suspicion and to weaken the bonds of a common welfare, that every year ought to draw closer and stronger into uninterrupted action. The bare fact that there are such peculiarities of climate, such varieties of product, and diversities of business pursuits embraced within one wide domain and beneath one republican sway, should teach us to search out and gather up and distribute as extensively as possible all the materials which may bring the remotest extremes, and every intervening section, into thorough acquaintance with each other. The public press can indeed do much, but its influence in this respect must be local; there is no orcid127e journal, however large its circulation, that is known even by name in every part of our land; and far less can the vast amount of items which are now and then chronic led but to be lost, in the course of the year, produce the impression, even were they more universal than they are, that will be made by a compacted array of facts and figures meeting the public eye at a single view. Besides the internal trade of the country and the price of the various products of all descriptions, it would be useful to draw together tables of the amounts of state assessments of the different industrial pursuits, the force of labor and its distribution, the multiplied channels where enter prize may take its way, and th.e outlets abroad by which we may enter into competition with other nations for the trade of the world. It might be well if the representatives of our nation abroad, with observant eye marking every product unknown to our land, that could perhaps become acclimated among us, would transmit to be tried, seeds, roots, and s icons, and record, or gather for incorporation in a report, the many valuable particulars relating to foreign industry and discovery which are now as it were hidden from i our knowledge. In a short time we should thus understand, no doubt, not only our own resources far more fully, but possess a better acquaintance with those of the nations with which we do or would interchange our commodities, and be enabled to consult our interest and welfare in the relations we hold to them. More, in such an enter prize, depends on arrangement and order than expense, and a comparatively small appropriation of means might accomplish much. The effect on our agricultural prosperity it is believed would be extensively felt. Some happy discovery of products adapted to portions of our country, might change the whole face of the industrial economy of a state, and results as marvellous as those which have been sprung from the small beginnings of cotton, rice or sugar, or of turn is in England, or of bees in France, might be realized. There is probably no people on the face of the globe that would sooner be aroused by such incentives to effort, and the success of any truly promising undertaking would not long be undecided. We have not been able to present so. full and condensed a view of our resources, and the domestic and foreign trade of our country, as we hoped to have done. Something, however, has been accomplished in carrying out our design, and it is believed that the information on various topics which we have embodied in Appendix, Los. 19 and 20, will not be without interest to many of our fellow citizens. If not characterized by all the precision in many respects which we could wish, yet it is believed that the various tables and deductions possess a more near approach to accuracy than the mere conjecture l estimates which are often thrown out in relation to our resources and inter changing traffic. Such time and labor have 238 X. been spent in collecting and preparing them, and, brought as they now are, within the compass of some few pages, they will no doubt afford much ground for reflection and granulation to every friend of his country; while at the same time they will better enable nations abroad to estimate the aptitude of our country and her means of reciprocal commerce. What then is there to forbid the hopeful augury of our success as an agricultural people. If portions of our country are becoming exhausted of the natural richness of the soil, yet every where within our reach there are a thousand means to supply the deficiency. A truer method of applying the enriching materials, a greater care in the selection of seed, and a more thorough cultivation may enhance its value beyond even its native opulence of the elements of production. If the mighty host of our agriculturists out numbering those engaged in any other branch of pursuits are true to themselves, understand their real position, provide themselves with all the requisite knowledge and use it as they may, this great commanding interest will sway public opinion and under the influence of an enabling patriotism, attended by firm and un deviating attachment to morality and virtue, may cause the wilderness to bud and blossom, and every desert and solitary place in our land to be glad. Marching on with giant strides in the career of discovery and improvement, combining and distributing on every side the elements of national prosperity, opening pathways of thought for those from whom knowledge has been hid, and leaving behind her for a world to gather from, examples of industry, perseverance and success, fostering every good enter prize and rebuking every ill directed aim, our country may thus become the protectress of the arts and sciences, and her ample resources the granary of nations, that can no longer feed their over burdening Population. X. Of c. To 54. 239APPE N Of To. 1. Result of observations made during a visit to Germany, in 1844 45 by Charles L. Fleischmann, Esq formerly draughts man in the Patentoffice, and furnished by him at the request of the l nom is sooner ofPatentsfor the Agricultural Report of 1847. I wrote a journal of my whole journey, through England, tie north of France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Dbnibardy, ,switzerland and the south of France. The following account of the meeting at Breslau isa part of that journal, and contains various subjects connected with agriculture, and incidents of travel, which maybe found of interestIAccount of the meeting of German Agriculturists at Breslau in russian Silesian.

I ti is exceedingly spacious, and highly ornamented with -frisco paintings, representing the saints' surrounding the throne of God. At the end was a platform for the officiating members, at each :side of which stood in pyramid, decorated with fe stools of ears of grain, fruits and various agricultural implements; the other had wreaths of leaves from the oak and other forestMtreeswith all the implements i sed in forest culture and the chase. :a.

Several sovereign is sent deputies; all the lead in' agricultural societies were represented by their ablest i men; professors of the- out eminent agricultural schools; noblemen, large *property holders from Russia, I Hungary, Bohemia, Austria, &c, with the farmers of the neighborhood, filled the list to nearly one thousand: -a: i .i -the president, Count Bughaus, opened .the meeting with in apprlpriateaddles- giving a: sketch f Silesian: tcid127iculturecid127. and mentioned hi it fact    which; could not but please those interested in i the t noble ca us& of temperance. Russian Silesian, he said, has heretofore had, to its population of 240 X. i
3000000, no less than the enormous number of 2,384 distilleries; and they have usually yielded to the government a yearly revenue of 99.8,000 thaler but since the rise of temperance societies, during the first four months of the year 1845, the product of this tax had fallen off to 150,582 thalers; a di munition, as compared with the same period in 1844, of no less than one-sixth. From this decrease: of o tax and drink, he of course argued a proportionate decrease of drunkards; of the grain consumed by distilleries, and of the total grain for which a market can be found; and hence he argued that some agricultural labor must be diverted to other pursuits. The officers were then elected, and six committees appointed to report upon the different sections or divisions of subjects, as agriculture proper raising live stock; the culture of the forest; te chi i cal branches; vine and fruit culture; and Fool growing. I In Thursday, the 9th of September, the committee commenced their meetings, and at eleven o lock, the general meeting took place, when the president of the society of directors of estates made his report upon the last examination of the pupils educated by the directors, &c. I found the ex; ami nation highly interesting, as it coincided exactly with my i views in regard to the i importance of i practical knowledge in the economy off ring. I give here the whole ,proceeding of that examination, a sit will show that the European educated- agriculturists does not run i mild with some of the new fangled notions, and that he follows the approved and sure road of labor and manure.

The society numbers above one hundred members, In 1845, while I was at Breslau, they held their yearly examination which was the third; the first was held in 1843. The society likewise extended the opportunity of examination even to such as have not been educated by members belonging to that association. It is a rule that no member who has a pupil among those who are to be examined can himself be an examiner. The examination came off on the 6th of September, 1845. The number of pupils to be examined was sixteen. After their names, birth place, age, schools where they studied, &c, &c, were taken down, it was found that the oldest of the pupils was twenty-three, and the youngest sixteen years of age; the rest between seventeen and nineteen years. Give had finished their education at the Hymn asia; three of them left off at the Secunda; two at the Hernia, and three at the Real School; the rest were educated at some inferior schools. After the necessary preliminaries, the pupils were required to answer a number of questions in writing; after which they were taken to an estate called Rosenthal (posen dale) near Breslau. In the yard, the pupils were shown a wagon, which was marked on thirty-six parts; a plough, on thirty-five parts; a hack en (a kind of plough or cultivate or) in five; a harrow on, six parts, making eighty-two separate parts. Each pupil had to put down on paper the name of each part, as they were marked, to show whether he was acquainted with all the parts of the implements. After that, they had to show their skill in taking apart and putting together implements, and in, case, of break age, to mention the most efficient way of repairing, &c. Sheep was then brought forward, and they were required to set down on paper the answers to the following questions 1. I s this sheep healthy, and why 2. Now v old is this sheep 31 Now it is the age called in the shepherd language Each one was next required to catch a sheep himself and examine it, whither it had the foot <a name="rot15"><mark>rot</mark></a>; and describe what are the signs of the foot <a name="rot16"><mark>rot</mark></a>. They had also to point out upon a sheep the places where the !a! worst wool grows and on which place the best: To point ut the places where the faults of wool are (cid1270ost liable to be inherited. :several head of cattle were now brought before them and the following questions propounded: -1.

What are the names of the different parts of the hoof, and where are those parts The pupils were now conducted to the barns, where they had to show their skill in making straw bands, in cleaning grain, &c, in sowing grain, &c. After this the pupils were taken to the fields, first to one of a light soil, and afterwards to one of a heavy soil, and the following questions were put to them before a fresh parcel of soil just dug up 1. What is the name of this kind of soil 2. What are the names of the principal parts of which this soil is composed. What is the name of the sub soil 4. I s the sub soil rete native or not 5.

The questions which they were obliged to answer in writing, were as follows: " ..:I.

A superintendent reports to his superior an accident on the estate, and describes the necessary steps he has taken 2. The superintendent gives a written order and instructions to the overseer of the farm 3. The superintendent makes a weekly report on the income and expenses of the grain and for seed, fodder consumed by the cattle, on an estate- where there are kept sixteen servants, twelve horses and eight oxen. The next day, the 7th of September, the result of the examination was made publicly known. For this purpose the board of examiners, the pupils and audience assembled at the university, and the following statement was made That most of the pupils showed skill in the practical manipulations; but that by some, not only skill, but, thoroughness was wanting. They were then admonished on the requirement of these practical manipulations in the farming operations. The trial, as to the names of the parts of implements, as well as the remedy when broken, &c, was declared not satisfactory; that a better knowledge of the parts of such implements with which the farmer has everyday to work, is required and expected. In the examination of soils and the best kinds of crops for them, the pupils showed considerable knowledge and correct views, but the knowledge in sheep breeding was rather slight; they showed more experience informed cattle, and the most in their judgment of horses. In the 'examination on the culture of crops, they proved well experienced less so in that of herb age and fodder; had little knowledge in the value of a substitute for fodder, but were entirely deficient in the economy of farming and showed a want of judgment in the quantity of force required for certain labors. The study of this important branch was recommended to their 244 X. special attention, to acquire a correct knowledge of the amount of labor required for agricultural operations, in order to economized the most important capital, time, which can never be replaced. The report upon the result of this examination was very independent and honest. It was not like those of institutions of education, where the principal and teachers train the pupils, in a certain set of questions, to astonish the audience on the day of exhibition, when they publicly deceive, as to the high qualifications of the pupils, in order to increase the patronage of their manufactory of learned boys and girls, de fraud the parents of their money, the children of their most precious time, and force upon the public a set of ignorant, conceited pre tenders, who, instead of adding to the progress of things in general, retard it. This examination would have sufficed in many other places, and the pupils would have been crowned with laurels; but here, the examiner wished not to recommend a young man for a place, when he was convinced the pupil would ruin his employer and injure the reputation of his teacher and the society. At the close of the presidents practical remarks, it was stated that it was the object of the association to ascertain what the young cultures t has acquired during his practical studies; that a higher practical knowledge is required to become a director of estates, and that can be the best accomplished by travelling. Further, that it had been hitherto the belief every simpleton would be a good agriculturists, and when every attempt failed to get him along in the world, the farming business was looked upon as thereceptacle of all family pro digits of dullness. Of this error, the bad effects were every where visible. It was proposed to the general meeting, to take under consideration the establishment of proper agricultural schools for the less wealthy class. These practical remarks on agricultural education were followed by a long treatise on the culture of m adder, which was ordered to be printed in the report. The following question, which was brought before the meeting on the 9th, was continued on the 10th."How can the injurious effects be prevented, which rail roads produce upon agriculture by absorbing all the funds (capital) ?a" It excited great interest. It was agreed that they had the contrary effect; that the construction of rail roads through countries increased -the means of the lower class the shares or strip (action) are a new kind of money which increases the general circulation. In the eleventh, the city of Breslau sent the members a beautiful medal, with the old Rathhaus (city hall) upon it; on the other -side, "Breslau to its welcome guests" with the date of the meeting. Several of the wealthy noblemen invited the members to visit their estates. The third question was next taken under consideration. It was generally agreed that small estates yield a higher revenue and require a larger amount of capital, but that no general rule could be given. The fourth general question was, "are institutions necessary in which a young man can acquire all practical agricultural knowledge ?his question was ably debated by the professors of agriculture. It was thought that the separation of the theory from practice was injurious both must be combined. Professor Schweitzer of Tharand in Saxony, thought that both can be acquired separately; he recommended that practice should be first learned, and theory afterwards that the young man should have x. 245 obtained a good common school education before he undertakes the practical study, and should afterwards finish his scientific education at an agricultural school. Her 'the son of father Her) demanded also a thorough elementary education, and then the learning of all the practical manipulations. These practical institutions, he thought, should not be too extensive, so that the owner may attend to the whole himself. The views of Professor Schweitzer were generally entertained. The fifth general meeting had again education under consideration, and several able papers were read, all to this effect" Educate the mass for its pursuits in after life in the fourteenth of September was the sixth and last meeting. A Hungarian by the name of On Toe rock, of Yes th, gave an account of the state of agriculture in Hungary, the condition of the noblemen and the peasants, with a mass of information upon that interesting country. He was listened to with great attention. It sounded most singularly to hear, after the sharp precise mode of pronouncing the German of the Russian, the broad hard dialect of the Hungarian. The different committees then made their reports of subjects under discussion before the general assembly. I. In regard to agricultural institutions, the following general principles 1. The practical instruction must be thorough, and not, as is customary, superficial 2. In the theory, all high scientific speculations should be omitted, and its application to practice alone be taught 3. To establish boards of examination over all Germany, with proper examiners for every district. I I . In regard to agriculture. As the <a name="disease92"><mark>disease</mark></a> of the potato created a general interest over the whole world, a very detailed statement was given, viz The cultivation of potatoes has been considered important for the production of manure, as it allows us to keep an increased number of cattle, and as a good crop to clean the soil. One fifth of the whole area of a farm, planted in potatoes, was thought not too much. Some thought two fifths should be the maximum and one tenth the minimum. Bandy soil was here, as every where, considered the best soil for potatoes. The singular theory was advanced, that potatoes not fully ripe, are to be preferred for seed potatoes, which was strongly opposed by those experienced in the culture of potatoes, as they ascribed to the unripe potato the cause of the <a name="disease93"><mark>disease</mark></a>. The cutting of seed potatoes was declared a bad practice, and if there isa scarcity of the seed, the potatoes should be cut just before planting them. Narrowing of the young potato plants was considered beneficial to the crop. Potatoes from seed improves the specimens, and those raised from it are less liable to be diseased. The potato <a name="rot17"><mark>rot</mark></a> was declared to be a <a name="fungus19"><mark>fungus</mark></a> adhering to the seed potato, and when furnished with warmth and moisture, spreads over the whole crop. -on Parties stated, at the last meeting at Munich, his microscopical investigations, and recommends sleeping the seed potato in lime. On Schreiber of Vienna, exhibited some early potatoes, (called Homme 246 X. de terse de quarante hours) which look like large cochons. I took them for such, so smooth and transparent were their skins. He was so kind as to give me some few tubes, which I have brought with me to the Unitedstates. Of Lover t was agreed, that when c lover is used only for one year, it does not require any other kind of grass seed to be sowed with it, but where used for two years, it is advantageous to sow grass with it, as the grass will come up in those places where the c lover is killed by frost or some other cause. Timothy grass was considered the best for that purpose. To the question, whether grass seed should be sown with the winter crop, or in spring, it was answered, that grass seeds of large grain should be sown in the fall, small grained ones in the spring. For light soils, the plant ago lance o lata was preferred to the a vena pubes cent. In Pomerania they use the common k impel and the po tedium sanguisorba* and sainfointI   t was observed, that after c lover, the crops are less liable to lie down that, after grass, which has occupied the same field for several years, the grain is more abundant and the yield of straw not diminished; that c lover succeeds very well, when sown in winter crop, but the crop then must not be too thick. In the flax culture Although Silesian has been, for more than a century, renowned for its linen fabrics, it has never ex celled, in the raw material; its climate is not as favorable for the plant as that of Belgium, where they can saw much earlier than in Silesian. In Belgium the young plants are not injured by the perpendicular rays of the summer sun, because they have acquired sufficient strength to support its influence. It is of the greatest importance in raising flax, that it should be an even crop, of equal height, equal thickness of the plant, and the field must be made level, the seeds must be brought under ground at an equal depth; that the plants come up at one and the same time; the water <a name="rot18"><mark>rot</mark></a> and dew <a name="rot19"><mark>rot</mark></a> must be used together, to produce a white fine fibre. It is acknowledged by the ablest spinners, that the machines produce a finer and more even thread, but it is pretended that the application of Not water in machine spinning injures the thread, and the hand spun linen has still the preference. The less dura be state of machine linen arises from the thread being more drawn out and the fibres less twisted than by hand. In regard to the best flax seed, the opinions were divided; a good many think the Fig a seed the best, others the Vein au; but it was generally agreed that seed from a northern climate is preferable to that of a southern, and that seed kept for some time would answer just as well as foreign. The best land for flax was considered to be of a somewhat sandy nature. The sub soil must be porous, to let the water pass through. The committee on cattle considered only the different native breeds, andSPoterium sanguisorba grows upon poor, light, sandy soil, and binds light soil better than any other kind of herb age fodder plant; Fig. 52 represents that plant t The sainfoin is well adapted for the calcareous soil. At Schleissheim near Munich, where the soil is scarcely three inches deep in some places, where, the sub soil is calcareous gravel of the coarsest kind, and where scarcely any thing grows except heath, this excellent plant succeeded admirably, and yielded a tolerable crop of hay, and a most excellent pasture. I consider it one of the most economical and useful plants to be cultivated for pastures. It succeeded the best upon calcareous soil, and the limestone regions of Virginia would be the country to grow it. It would be an additional nutritions plant to the many which grow in that region. Fig. 51 represents the leaf and flower of sainfoin, hedlysaraum onobjrysMecsparsette. X. 4. 247 all agreed that the common country cattle had some local value, which consisted in being acclimated. In sheep and wool have said that Silesian had no rival; the exhibition of flee ces and sheep vere of most superior quality. Of these I shall speak more fully under the head of wool. At present I only mention that I am indebted to Mr. Rep pe, merchant, from To stock, Mecklenburg, for many beautiful samples of the best Silesian wools, which I collected on purpose to bring with me as a standard for comparison. The reports of the other committees were more or less local, and consequently less interesting. The, president Count Burghaus, closed the meeting with a very happy speech, and the Hungarian, On Toe rock, made the following appropriate remark: That an union between Germany and Hungary would be a blessing to the latter; that the Hungarians were ever anxious to bring their country into close alliance with Germany, and he hoped Germany would not refuse the hand which a Hungarian offered to a compact of friendship and brotherly love. This was the final e of the ninth meeting of German agriculturists Among the exhibited implements, there was not hiring remarkable or worth noticing. Several specimens of vault brick were shown, exceedingly light and porous, which was produced by mixing the bricks with cut straw or charcoal, and, in burning, the substances are charred or consumed by the fire, and leave a light and compact brick, There were also pots made of the shape, of sand glasses, about nine inches high, for vaults. :a: i -i Several of the large land holders .in the vicinity of Breslau, invited the members of the meeting to visit their estates; every one received a :printed invitation, indicating the place of starting and arrival, with a plan' and description of the estate they were going: to visit. Count Hoch berg, of Fiirstensteii, invited seventy to his estate, which lies about six. r miles from the manufacturing town of Freyburg, in a beautiful mountainous region. Although the estate is fifty miles from Bresiau, the rail road conveyed us in about two hours, to, the depot at Freyburg, where Count Hoch beg received us with that elegance of manner so common" among :the German, nobility. In one of the large rooms at the i d pot an ample breakfast was per pp A, to satisfy our sharpened appetites after a ride through maintain a 11 p. tAflecid127) rbre4kfasti we visited the flank; spinning establishment of Dram ta ,a, To which employs 600 hands and consumes 14 cut. of flax per. year. Nineteen of the Counts carriages took his i. guests to :Hoch berg. In our arrival he conducted :us to the farm yard i in, order to show us his cattle, consisting of original Oldenburg and cross breeds, of such andcid127i wish, and -the sheepamountingto9000 head. The a latter were in small f lacks, about the different fields. Among the herd were several of the Prince Lichnowskys rams, which were: bought that year for one thousand thalers (about seven. hundred dollars) per head ;S. He   :also examined the extensive stud of horses consisting in a strong breed more for the plough and wagon than the carriage, but of fine proportions and all the. requisite qualities for that object. Everything had the marks of his aiming at the object to be gained the highest and most lasting profit. The forenoon had passed :by in our survey, and the dinner was: announced. This a ti least was not on the economical plan; it was sumptuous extravagantly rich. After dinner the v. he company went to the so called 248 X. a. Or und. The way led by the old castle of Fiurstenstein, placed among beautiful grounds- From its antique watch towers, a most charming view of the Riesengebirge can be enjoyed. This romantic place is very much visitd by the inmates of the Salzbrunn, a watering place near by. In the vasthallsaf the ,old castle, furnished in the most antique style, coffee was served; land the old rusty iron doors of vaults were unlocked, to show the old- armor and weapons of the family, among which a camp bedstead of Fredsrickjle Great attracted great attention. About half past four, the carry -yes took us to the coal mines near Oldenburg, by the way of Salzbrunn. Salzbrunn, so: celebrated for its medicinal virtues in pulmonary complaints, surprised us by its romantic situation, and the great number of guests, although the season .was already far advanced. T here were about i eighteen hundred i visitors this year. It was night when we arrived ratheceebrated coal mines, f which fiveixthsbelong to the crown, and one-sixths to Count Hoch berg. I Six large boats to k; the visitors to the interior of the mine, with a band of music leading the subterranean navigators for three quarters of a mile into the bowels of the earth. The breaking of the waves against the black wall; the thundering sound of the music, and the flickering of the numerous torch lights, gave the whole a magic effect. The canal :ended at last, i and we were at the entrance f of the great coal pits. We followed this black passage, till web came to a rotund a supported by columns of stone coal, where e found to our great i surprise a table ornamented with war lands of flowers and set out with delicious refreshments. The -contrast of :the white table cloth glittering with silver and glans; with the red light of the torches :gave it ai uncommonly wild a effect and would .have: united r .or a scene of Faust, as a banquet in i the royal palace' of Mephistopheles.

They were followed by one hundred and fifty wagons, drawn by horses decorated with rib bands, bells, &c, accompanied by bands of music, with farmers and their wives, arid the bride and bridegroom in their peculiar na tit na l dress. The procession stopped at the hall where the .agricultural meeting was held. There the duke, his family, and the members of the meeting were assembled to receive them. They entered in order, and placed a plough, which they brought with them, upon a platform. When The bride and bridegroom were presented with a silver go let, filled with wine, and drank the health of their sovereign and his family. They then formed a circle round the plough; one of the farmers stepped forward, and addressed the young married couple, reminding them of their duties towards the sovereign and the state; not to be led astray by modern notions, but to continue the costumes and mode of life of their forefathers, and to earn their bread honestly, in the pursuit of agriculture; exhorting them to honor the plough, to which they are indebted for their welfare and that of their country. After this the bride and bridegroom ornamented the plough with fe stools of flowers, and sang in chorus the old national song " The Ploughwhat a wise custom, on this most .momentous day, to enforce upon the young farmer the important duties of life! The musicians gave a signal for a national dance, and the hall was not deserted until daylight. The members made a present (as is customary) to the bridal party, which consisted of a coffee set in silver. The general agricultural meeting was closed with a great exhibition of horses, cattle, and most choice flocks of sheep. This was held near Breslauat Urine Tic he (green Oak) Before the distribution of the prizes for the best animals there was a great page ant representing the principal agricultural and industrial pursuits of Silesian. Among them was a wagon displaying specimens of Silesian glass. It is quite as beautiful as that of their neighbors of Bohemia. Cases and other glass ware, cut and colored, were taste fully arranged on the vehicle; the horses themselves being decorated with various shaped glass ornaments, which looked quite novel. When came the common Silesian agricultural implements, drawn by horses and fine oxen; next a wagon upon which men and women exhibited the preparation of flax, as it is practised in that part of Russia. After that a Silesian country wedding, and lastly preceded by a band of music, the harvest wreath carried by men and women, all in their national costumes made up the close. Scarcely had this procession passed the staying where the members of the n meeting were placed, when a most glorious shower poured down upon a crowd of 10,000 persons. In a few minutes the vast arena was vacant, people seeking refuge in the houses, barns and stables near by. The city gave a supper in a garden beautifully decorated and illuminated, and a splendid show of fireworks, in which was seen in brilliant letters the salutation "farewell' This was received with great applause and "long live Breslau" was the last scene of this great meeting. The citizens, of Breslau had endeavored to afford every opportunity to make our stay among them as pleasant as possible. The various societies threw open their places of amusement, and musical entertainments were not forgotten. A piece written for the occasion was performed at the theatre. The king gave a great dinner to the members, at his chateau, and the nobility and wealthy afforded the stranger an opportunity of seeing them in their family circles, and of passing the evening in pleasant- musical enter 250: X. attainments and interesting conversation. I became acquainted with the upper burgomaster of Breslaui and his beautiful and charming lady as well as with :other families, with whom I passed many a happy hour which will hereafter afford me recollections as lasting as pleasant of the time I spent in Silesian.  The flee ces exhibited at the meeting at Breslau were sent from the neighborhood of Breslau, and other parts of Russian Silesian, from Mecklenburg, Hungary, Bohemia, Dora via and Saxony, for the purpose of showing their progress in fine ness and thorough character of wool. They were spread out upon tables, in one of the large halls in the basement story of the university. Each flee ce had a printed label, with the name and residence of the owner of the flock; the name of the stock from which the animal had sprung, -its age, sex, and the weight of the flee ce, in order to facilitate the examination .and comparison among, each other. The flee ces were the best the above named countries could produce; and it was a rich treat to the connoisseur of wool; but they all differed in degree of fine ness and in the character requisite to be pronounced perfect. Only two of the flee ces were considered as bearing all the signs of a perfect electoral wool. They were unquestionably all fine, but wanting either in "even ness" as the Silesian sheep bleeders call, it, or in weight of the flee ce, in length of the staple, and many of those demands which wool growers make upon a flock of a constant and thorough character. Those flee ces which were pronounced perfect came from Russian Silesian. This province has gained the reputation of producing not only the finest wool, and but of being the Only market where thorough blood can be obtained. Accordingly it is that to which wool growers come, from near or far at home, to select and buy rams and eyes for the improvement of their f locks. Saxony has lost its former fame, a decline which arises partly from mismanagement and partly from other causes, as the low prices of wool, the division of commons, and the increase of population, whereby land becomes too valuable to be used for pastures. The degree of fine ness in wool to which the most renowned wool growers of Silesian have carried it can only be fully appreciated when wool from this period is compared with that of the years when the me rings were first introduced into Silesian; and it shows very forcibly how long it takes to bring it, even when commenced with the best Spanish breed, to that high degree of perfection. Germany has proved to Pain, that it is not the climate on which all depends, not the rich pastures, but enter prize, perseverance j and above all, intelligence, which have despoiled her of the golden flee ce. Nature has done something for this province; its lands lie high and dry the pasture has been improved by its high cultivation; the climate is neither too cold nor too warm, so that a thick cover is at no period inconvenient to the animal. This portion of Germany is known for its superior degree of intelligence among the large estate holders; to which must be added the chief virtues of this Teutonic race, industry and perseverance. Kuchelau, Hennersdorf, Cross Sterlitz, Chrzelitz, are the names of the places :where the finest stock is raised; and to these places rush the wool growers of other countries, at the beginning .of every year, when the surplus stock is sold, to obtain a few of these famous breeds. The p ices for which some of the rams are sold seems enormous; and it will astonish some of our American farmers when they are assured, that ax. single ram is sold at from fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars, and then the buyer considers it a favor to obtain it at that price. The rich land holders of Russia, Hungary, Austria, &c. &c. seem to pride themselves in having it said, that they have obtained a certain famous ram for an immense sum; and in this, like every thing else, it is sometimes more for the name than for the intrinsic value of the object; and a ram from another place, for from four to six hundred dollars, would perhaps just as well answer their purpose. The most famous flocks are owned by Prince Lichnowsky, They have for forty years had the reputation of even ness and of possessing all the good qualities of mere no; and he has never for a moment relinquished the improvement of his flocks. He has in Russian Silesian, about eight thousand head, from which he sells, every year, the surplus number, for the sum of forty thousand six dollars* It is he who in that country obtains the highest price for his rams and eyes. Experience has shown that only thorough blood should be employed in the improvement of stock. This makes the purchasers very desirous to obtain animals from well known flocks, the character of whose wool is thorough and constant, and answers all the dem wilds of the manufacturers. Sometimes, in an inferior flock, an animal it found .which has all the qualities of a super electoral; but such an an iii al will produce lambs inferior to himself, and full of the faults of his org na l parents. The importance of a good selection of mere no sheep to breed from, is well known to every one who is engaged in imp to ing the breed of domestic animals; but in the improvement of fine flocks, it is of a still higher moment; and it is then difficult to find the right kind to select from. It requires a well practised eye to detect the faults on the parts where these are transmitted and to select just such as are the best ones for flocks, for the climate, and local conditions. Several attempts have been made, in the United States, to raise fine wool; but they have never fully succeeded. The first attempt was made at the early period when Saxony itself had not yet arrived at any stability or thoroughness of character in its flocks, and when a really fine and fault less animal could scarcely be obtained. These imported from Pain, when compared with the best Saxon breed were of a coarse nature. The requisite knowledge, at that period, could not be expected to be found in the United States, as they had not sufficient experience then in Saxony or anywhere else. Of late, the imported animals have a higher degree of fine ness; but I doubt if the choice is always made from a pure and thorough stock; it is generally a matter of speculation, and the sheep are bought at cheap rates, for which nothing good can be had, from the reasons mentioned above. When money would perhaps be no object, it is always a principle, on the part of the wool growers, to sell abroad the worst kind; and no doubt our wool growers have been made dupes, like all those coming from great distances. Undoubtedly the United States have beautiful regions former in os; but to effect a profitable result, we must bring from Germany, a thorough blooded flock, select for them a dry and sweet pasture, and manage them with proper knowledge. It is out of the question to raise fine wool on the prairies, covered with luxuriant grasses which will answer better for the Leicester breed, or the Hungarian rachel. The regions of the Allegheny, towards the south, would be the most eligible location for me rings." A six dollar is 70 cents 252 X. -a. The committee on wool, appointed by the assembly, furnished me with specimens of wool, from the different flee ces exhibited; and I flatter myself I have a collection which may prove a standard to compare other wool by. The following questions were submitted to the committee on breeding sheep. The committee made a full report of their Transactions to be printed. I was entitled, as a member, to a copy, but the report was not printed before I left Germany : I requested our worthy Consul of Leipsic, Dr. Flilgel, who is indefatigable in assisting citizens from the United States in every way, when he can be serviceable to them, to send me my copy to this country. He did so, but the vessel, the " Stephanie" was wrecked, and I was deprived of that valuable document, I shall try to procure another copy and I shall be happy to submit to the Commissioner of Patents, the translation of the most important facts. Questions on the Breeding of Sheep 1. What experiments have lately been made with reference to the advantages or disadvantages of successive in breeding of the highly improved flocks of sheep ?a? is the periodical stirring of the blood always necessary, if no hereditary defects require it. I s a prudent driving of lambs on healthy pastures, that is on those laid down to grass, to be preferred to foddering in stalls? in the summer stall foddering of lambs, especially of summer lambs, can we soon pass on to green doddering 3. An young lambs, without injury to their health, be foddered with raw potatoes, or with turn is ?a? at what age ?a? and are potatoes and turnipsonly proper up to a certain' state of preservation ?4. What proportion can properly be established in the feeding of sheep r, between hay and potato fodder, or generally between dry and juice fodder 5. I s it for the bodily health of the animal and for the higher value of the fool, proper to s hear the lambs born in the months of May or June, in the anon th of October 6. Was science or empiricism more progress in the healing of the diseasetraberkrankheit7. I s the vert i go of sheep. really homoepathically healed by doses of belladonna ?8. (a) Was the Preysmethod of washing wool in its use of cold water succeeded generally, and has it especially been approved in wool with close fat and hardly dissolved ?b) What is the most suitable method of using this means, and what degree of temperature is required, to make it effectual c) After this method does the wool retain its lustre and a soft feeld) I s there no noticeable diminution of the weight of wool after the same ?e) To not the sheep become much weakened by this method f) I s the method easily undergone by the use of the ground root of thesaponaria alba g) May not the saponaria alba be cultivated with success in Germany, and on what kinds of soils ?9. Was not the arc anus further recommended by Greys, which is to be mixed the evening before the s hearing with the fodder of the sheep, to produce a mild sweat, and by means of the same an increased weight per cent x. a. 253 a higher lustre and a peculiarly agreeable feel of the who -been approved in its use ?10. What properties must a sheep s wool possess in order to be acknowledged as the most valuable product 11. May all the different forms under which the wool hair on the bodies of sheep presents itself, according to experiments hitherto, be classified in determined categories and g radiations and thus be accurately distinguished 12. I s there some one under these various forms of .wool hair which is exclusively the standard for the most valuable character of wool 13. Was the form of the wool hair always the same influence on the formation of the staple? and is it, for example, always connected with an irregular curl of the wool hair 14. Now may all possible forms of the staple he distinctly named according to their difference and which of them produces the most valuable wool 15. Now is the figure of a normal (standard) sheep for card wool, and how for comb wool to be represented 16. What parts of the body of sheep require, in reference to the difference of wool to be met with in the standard, a particular name 17. Now must the wool be circumstanced or the different critical parts of the body of the sheep, when the animal is valuable for a distinguishedbreeder18. In what way does the wool after washing change in comparison with the aspect it presented to the eye before washing 19. As in the consideration of the foregoing questions, not only all the properties of wool as fine ness, softness, &c, but also all the forms of the wool hair, as regular, or highly curled, &c and not less all the formations of staple and all the parts of the body of the sheep are brought into discussion, at the same time an occasion is presented to unite therewith a definiteterminology as well of the names here used as of others elsewhere. A memoir which may serve in the Transactions for the foundation of the establishment of such a terminology will be pre fixed to the article on the breeding of sheep. I I .historical Sketch of Silesian Fool Culture. Russian Silesian, even before the introduction of me rings, always produced a wool of a superior quality and which commanded a higher price than that of neighboring countries; but at that time the number of sheep were not very great, because the baronial estates had the exclusive right of keeping sheep, and past during them upon the property of the peasantry. At some of the estates, not one-fourth of the number they have at present were kept. About 100 years ago all Silesian had not one-fourth of the present number, which amounts to two a ad a half million. A Russian cut. of wool (nearly the same as the English) cost about             $30, which at that period was a high price when we consider the higher value of silver; the average price of all the qualities of the present period amounts to     $52 per cut. The increased revenue from wool which the Russian province of Silesianow enjoys can be easily calculated from the above data, but this increase of revenue only effected by the introduction of mere no sheep. The first ones were brought there by Count Eckersdorfwho at an early period established a mere no stock farm, for which Frederick the Great made him a present of a Spanish ram and a few ,eyes. In 1801 Count Haugwitz, then 254 X. minister of state, obtained from William the Third, of Russia, the best rain and eyes of a small flock, which were imported direct from Pain; these few me rings formed the stock from whichSilesia improved its flocks. Themerino sheep of both these noblemen were pretty nearly of the same blood large, vigorous animals, with a strong, elastic wool. Although the blood was thorough, and the character of the wool good, the number with which they commenced was too limited to produce a rapid progress in the increase and improvement of the flocks. The shepherds entrusted with them were ignorant in regard to a better made of treatment, and those few precious animals were treated like the native breed, left to themselves and nature. The few samples still existing from these firstmerinos, show, when compared with wool of the best breed of the present period, how greatly the wool has been since improved, and how much the price, of mere no wool has been diminished. Since that time, the wool which then cost 165 Russian thalers per cut, would not at present bring 90 thalers. The estate holders of Silesian crossed, with great success, their native flock by rams of these mere no flocks, and the fact that rams with strong, elastic wool, and with a well developed body, produce a more profitable breed, and in shorter time than those delicate animals, with very thin and soft wool, was fully proved. The wool grower of Silesian became also acquainted with the me rings of Saxony; they procured rams and eyes from these; but they had a different character from the Silesian; the wool was softer, and the sheep of a more delicate form and less in size; Silesian then had two distinct breeds those of the flocks furnished by the King of Russia, with a strong, elastic wool, and large, strong body, and the Saxon breed of small size, and with thin and soft wool. At that time the knowledge in wool was exceedingly. limited. Very little attention was paid, also, to the form of the sheep; the only object was to obtain pure Spanish blood. The progressive demand for mere no wool, and the success in breeding, induced all the estate holders to improve their native flocks. Saxony was the only country where me rings could be got to supply the numerous applicants, and the flocks of the elector and those of the private estates ofKlipphausen and Rocheburg furnished most of the imported animals. Those who had less means bought rams of a cross breed of native sheep and me rings, and in a short time few of the original country sheep could be seen. The improvement was principally carried on with rams of mixed blood, and with a very limited knowledge in breeding. It is a wonder thatSilesia has arrived to that superior kind of wool which it now possesses. The different demands of the manufacturers, in regard to the nature of the wool, according to the articles they intended to produce from it, in the beginning misled some of the wool growers, and induced them to make changes, and to increase the finenessiof the flee ces, which gave it a tendency to test and felt; but it was only in a few flocks, and if such a fault crept into a breed, the original thorough flock always offered a sure remedy. Gradually the Silesian wool growers brought their wool to a quality which an swerved all the demands of the manufacturers in cloth and various new style of woollen stuffs, and attracted the buyers from all countries to supply their wants. The Silesian wool passed through different stages, in consequence of inexperience, till it came to the state of perfection just mentioned. From 1785 to 1805 was the period when the first Spanish me rings were x. a. 255 introduced, and when the wool growers were entirely ignorant in the knowledge of wool and management of me rings. From 1805 to 1815 was the period when the estate holders of Silesiasaw the advantage of raising them, and when the difference of mere no and common wool began to be more understood; when in the formation of the staple, a great number of curves of the mere no wool hair were considered essential characters for fine ness. At that period the wool growers travelled for information, and brought me rings from Saxony into Silesian. From 1815 to 1825 was the third stage of the Silesian wool culture. The great desire then was extreme fine ness; they overlooked many other very valuable qualities of the wool, and the large size and vigor of the animals. The high price of                               $126 per cut. caused this error. With the highest degree of fine ness, great softness had to be combined; the Saxon breed, which was called electoral, combined these qualities. Such sheep were employed in crossing; consequently the finest Silesian consisted of thin flee red, delicate animals, which, besides a deficiency in wool, were liable to all sorts of diseases. The period from 1825 to 1830 may be called the test for the German wool growers, and particularly for the Silesian. In that period the price of wool sunk exceedingly low, and it appeared as if England had taken leave forever of the German wool market, and that she supplied herself from her colonies sufficiently for her wants. Any were affrighted and. began to diminish their flocks, and changed their whole system of farming. It produced a crisis, and their attention was principally directed to an increase of wool in the flee ce, to compensate for the <a name="loss39"><mark>loss</mark></a> sustained in the prices. This crisis operated very beneficially upon the whole system of breeding me rings: the wool growers, instead of aiming at the highest degree of fine ness, had now a greater quantity of wool in view. This was the commencement of a system which developed itself to much more advantage afterwards. Finally came the fifth stage and the present state of the Silesian wool growing systems, which has for its object to produce not only the finest4ndsoftest wool, but in great quantity; and besides a high degree of softness and elasticity and nerve is not overlooked, whereby not only the value of wool, but the weight and volume also are enhanced, and these precious qualities are all combined in the flock of Prince Lichnowsky, and in such f locks as have been reared from this famous breed. During these various periods the Silesian wool growers have obtained great experience in breeding me rings, and in the nature and character of wool. Societies of wool growers were formed, in the meetings of which the most important questions were discussed, experience and facts made known, and they educated superintendents and shepherds for this branch of husbandry all which has given them, an advantage over other countries, and which it will be difficult to take from them. Pain never will be able to obtain the golden flee ce again, and other countries may strive for ever, and perhaps Silesian will be always in the advance. In the meantime the improvements of the farms were not neglected; pastures were sown with grass and c lover, and large quantities of fodder were housed for the winter, which amply supplied the flocks with food. Through a proper culture of pasture land they were able not only to furnish a more abundant food, _ut a more healthy one. They used only the seed of such plants as perfectly 256 Six De. No. 54.agreed will the nature of sheep; the comparatively few cases of <a name="disease94"><mark>disease</mark></a> the .c  .a. .sufficiently prove this. Another advantage was gained by this system adopted of improving the pasture land; the wool developed itself more perfectly, and it is an :established fact, that the better and more regularly the sheep are fed and taken care of, the more uniform and healthy the wool. becomes, and its superior qualities remain without deter i oration. Silesian can no longer increase its number of sheep; its whole farming system has been improved with a view of keeping the greatest number of sheep possible under any circumstances. In regard to quality there is yet a great deal to be done in Silesian, notwithstanding its superiority over other countries in that respect. The above mentioned desirable qualities of wool which some flocks possess, are not to be found in all of them. There is ut one tenth of the whole number x which comes under this superior class, the remaining nine tenths of Silesian flocks are in different stages of improvement, and to eradicate the various faults of wool from these flocks, and bring it to what is called an even character, will be the work of years. The stables for sheep, with few exceptions, are very spacious and well suited for the object. All the necessary implements and utensils are provided. Order and cleanliness exist every where. Fodder is plenty and stored away with care. Upon the lofty there is great order as to the way, how and when the different kinds of fodder are to be given, and properly measured out. The shepherds, although not yet arrived to that degree of perfection which they should possess are better than any in Europe. What great attention is here paid to the sheep during the period ofcouplingI  t takes place in January, and summer lambs are considered the most advantageous. The superior qualities of the Silesian wool which is so much praised by the purchasers, are to be ascribed to the change of having the lambs in summer instead of winter. The choice of rams is made with all the acquired experience of the intelligent wool grower himself; and if he thinks himself wanting in the necessary knowledge, he employs others who have the best reputation and make it a regular business. In all the stables the temperature is regulated by means of thermometers; because the Silesian wool grower knows, that a regulated temperature aids in the perfect development of the wool hair. The flocks are yearly thoroughly examined, and those as sorted into a class or classes which have the least inherit able faults. The flocks are either under the immediate superintendence of the proprietors themselves or of directors, who are educated agriculturists, and who have acquired a fondness for this branch, zealous to make such improvements as will bring the flock to perfection. Most of them besides the knowledge of feeding and of the general treatment of me rings, have a thorough knowledge of wool, which can only be gained by long practice and by comparison of the best kinds. The sheep master (schafmeister) has the management of a certain number of flocks, and under him 'stands the shepherd, who executes the orders of this employer; and on him depends nearly every thing in regard to the careful treatment in feeding; keeping them in suitable grounds during rainy we at or, watching them carefully in respect to health; in short up or him rests the principal success of the flocks. Such sheep masters are exceedingly rare; and the wool growers of Poland, Russia and Hungary, offer high salaries to induce the Silesian sheep masters to take charge of their flock such depends, also upon the shepherds; they are exclusively brought ulSEx. Doc. To :54, 257 for that business, and their whole life time is devoted o it. They are familiar with the nature of every sheep in their flocks; , id when one goes in the least later, r forsakes its food, it is caught and examined and treated accordingly. They have suffice it knowledge of the' mode if i iting their pasture lands; they use them in succession, so that the sheep have always afresh supply of food; and sufficient time is thus given for the grass to growth disturbed; even the i stubble pasture is used systemiaticallyThe written order for the mode of feeding" how much, what kind when it must be given i" &c, is nailed up in the stables, and .the iliephprdpays strict attention to it. The quantity of fodder is exactly estimated, and the amount required for the winter season calculated, and ~an additional supply set aside in Case of a late season, and for rainy and cold days. The lambs are rnmhbered by the marks in the ears, or by numbers fastened around their necks. The pe degrees are regularly kept up, so that the relationship of every and al can be given with great accuracy. Breeding fine mi rings is not a kind of hobby among the Silesian firmers, which swallows up all the profits of the estate. To. it is made a proftablebrachi f the farm husbandry, which pays a good price for the fodder, litter, aird labor bestowed upon it, i i return for which the farm allows to thieseepaccount a fair price for the manure.

'the number of sheep upon a given number of ares of land, is on aiiayerage, five sheep for four: acres of plough land (the Germans, c. !and which is used for raising crops, plough land, in distinction from .me ado or nature land) This, however, depends on the quality of land suitable for fed der cry d parts the er crop of acres 0 of meadows, and the quality, and especially on the intelligence. of the supeinteinde t.

Breslau has every year two wool markets, one in the spring, the both r it the autumn; at the spring market the quantity of wool a mott its to a; ut 60 000 cut, at a value of four million of thalers, (or nearly          $3,000,000 of the United To tes) in the autumn it scarcely reaches to 8,000 cut. Great improvements have likewise been made in washing the wool, also in s hearing and packing 17 258 X. a. Hearing is generally done by women who obtain usually at one and one-sixth cents per head and for a ram two and one third cents- Some of them s hear thirty to thirty-six per day; but with all the experience these women have, they do not s hear well, cut steps, as they are called, and very often wound the sheep. The wool was formerly packed in long round bags, but now it is packed in square 'vol lies" as they are called, which are perfect tubes or oblqng, and flat like a mattress. January is the time when the purchases of ramcid127and eyes to breed from, are made, and every one tries to obtain the best. This raises the price of sheep of the most celebrated establishments to an incredible height 1 1.-Mlode of Feeding and Breeding Sheep at Alcsuith in Hungary. Successful breeding of sheep is in a great measure dependent upon a sufficient supply of food of the first quality, its proper preservation, economical 'use, and its augment at ion on scientific principles. Of comparatively much greater .moment, however, is the system followed in feeding them, and it is thought therefore interesting to give an account of the system as adopted at Alcrith.

Moreover, the nearest pastures belong to the eyes, and the remotest are for the wet hers; the lambs remain in the vicinity of the farm, and during the hot hours of noon the sheep are to be in the stall, in case the distance does not exceed one mile. In those pastures which are far distant, there are shelters for the protection and convenience of the animals. The flocks are most carefully protected against rain.

M., half a pound of hay, second quality, or of esparsette; at 3, drink; at 4 P. M., three sheaves of oats, and the older ones four sheaves, to 100 head. Old wet hers and as sorted eyes receive in the morning three-fourths of a pound of steamed chaff; at 9, .drink; at 10, to 100 head, one met zen of potatoes, and then straw in the yard; at 1, esparsette, three-fourths of a pound, (or hay, third quality) at 3, drink; at 4, steamed. chaff, three, fourths of a pound. Owes of delicate health, and those which have produced twins, receive an additional portion at 11 o clock in the morning, of half a pound oflucerne and a pint of barley groans. During the time of coup long, those rams that have been put to great fatigue, receive daily from one half to two pints of oats, added to their food. In the season of pasture the flocks get twice a month salt to lick, two pounds and a half being allowed to 100 head; during the winter, however, only once a month, and then al those x.  sheep which get chaff soaked in salt water for food do not share. Ofstrewing twenty-five pounds are reckoned for 100 sheep. Any will doubtless consider this way of feeding as too rich, and as not very economical; yet the principle of abundant food, as observed in .l4csitthcannot be recommended too highly; i for experience has shown that between sheep well and those tolerably fed, there is regularly a difference of one third in regard to the quantity of wool obtained. And then again, it is only by such abundant food that the smallest amount of mortality, as well as the largest increase and that development of their animal organism which gives the sheep, in all periods of its age, the highest capacities of breeding and fattening can be secured. It is an und enable fact that the manor of Alcsfth, in spite of many unfavorable circumstances, has been raised from its neglected condition to its present flourishing state, in a very short time, and by comparatively small expenditures, solely by means of breeding of cattle, and more especially a profitable breed of sheep. For nowadays it is not the sheep of the finest silk and thin wool that give the highest profit to the farmer; but, on the contrary, it is those whose wool unites with the greatest compact ness a proper degree of fine ness; because the sheep of this class require smaller out lay as regards feeding, and in fact in every other respect; because they give more lambs, are less liable to sickness, and hence to mortality, and because they are better even for fattening; above all, however, because the finest wool very rarely fetches a price proportionate to its cost, in the market. With these leading views the Alcsfth sheep have been bred. This breed had its brig in from the celebrated domestic sheep folds of U. Altenbourg of Urmeny, and was developed into a peculiar and superior race, by the masterly treatment of the breeder. In its exterior, this sheep bears, in a high degree, the character of the I infant ado race, which, improved and en no bled by proper cross breeding, as it has been of late, constitutes now the aim of most wool growers. The Alcsuith sheep is distinguished by its strong built, vigorous body its head and neck are thick, its collar having many folds, its body stretched, its back broad and round shaped from the hip bones to the root of the tail its legs, which are full clothed to the hoof, are rather short than long; its flee ce is long, thick, uniformly curled, throughout good, middling fine and uniform. In short, the Alcsfth sheep constitutes one of the finest results of rational breeding of the present time, both as regards the beautiful structure of its body, and its surprising size, which in Hungary was not heretofore obtained; for there are some rams that measure five feet from the muzzle to the root of the tail, and twenty-nine inches from the bottom to the chin e. It is not easy to give the reader an idea or description of the fine ness of the wool in words. By the Holland wool meter, the fine ness would be expressed by the qu orient of the third class, viz. by 0.0006. Still, to supply those who have no opportunity of seeing the Alcsuth flocks, with a sure standard whereby to judge of the fine ness of their wool, a list of prices is sub joined, at which the Alcsuith wool was sold during the years 1838 to 1841, and which was as follows, (by the cut n 1838,....................... .on money, Ll. 145=    $721 S 1839............... .a. .a. .a. . . 158- 79" 184.0 and '41, (when the prices were much depressed) 128= 64 264 X.

What gives the Alcsfiti wool a particular value, and renders it .so much :sought after, is that its even ness is not r confined to single heads, but f extends over the whole flocks. This is an object of muchiriportance to every wool grower, since speculators in wool will always prefer to ty the wool of even flocks, to purchasing that of uneven ones, however fine the wool be of some of' the interspersed head, fr though the wool be less fine as to its quality, the purchaser need not go to the expense of sorting it, as he has to do with a wool of various degrees and shades of quality. Another thing of great moment is the unusual productive ness of wool, as obtained by the Alcsith sheep; for thickness and length are so well combined in- this wool, that its want of fine ness can be of no account what ver. The average weight, as ascertained by personal examination, and by reference to the bills r and books, is as follows With the ram. .a. . .a. 3 3 s.

"accordingly, the entire amount of wool produced in the last three years, by 10,000 head, was 270 wet. on an average. This is a surprising result obtained from the Alcsfih sheep, with the finest and most perfect washing, although, as is well known, the weight of the wool, even by a middling washing, is lessened at least fifteen per cent. Or here was a e we two years, old shorn, and its flee ce weighed in presence of a committee, and the weight was found to be three pounds eight ounces. As a proof how well the Run *marian wool growers know how to appreciate these valuable qualities of theAlcSifth sheep, it should be mentioned here that there are in Alcsfth every year extensive sales of breeding bucks and eyes, which are principally sold to such persons as are in search, of a wool, which to a suitable fine ness unites an eminent degree of thickness. Although the stock of the manor i constantly increasing although it certainly is never deprived of its best heads still the revenue from the sale of breeding animals amounted, ii Vienna currency, In the year 1837,.... .a. .a. to 43,713 Of .

The entire stock of the sheep of the manor, in September, 1840, consisted in all of 10,930 head; viz. 99 5 rams, 3,303 wet hers, and 6,632 eyes. From these proportions it may be inferred, that for the present both the increasing florid in Vienna currency is equal to 20 its; f florid, copy. money, is equal to 50 ctasEx. of the stock on hand, and the raising of breeding ;animals for, salenustbeinI  contemplation at Alcsiti, otherwise te number of eyes would be i great dis proportion o that f the waters.

In this section the lambs receive three times a day a larger portion of oats, viz: nine half met zen per one hundred head, afterwards in the morning fine hay, at noon c lover, and in the evening oats and ve aches, mixed together. It is customary to supply them with a little water after the first fodder and again after the meal at noon, in order to accustom them by degrees to the water. In the tenth week the lambs are suffered to be with their mothers only once every day, viz: after the early watering in the morning; on the other had, their quantum of fodder is increased in proportion, and they now receive in the morning at six o clock, one-fourth of a pound of fine meadow hay; at nine o clock they are introduced to the eyes for suckling; at teno clock the lambs receive one and a half met zen of fresh and coarse barley meal per one hundred head, mixed with one and a half met zen of oats then one-fourth pound of c lover hay per head, and finally some water in the manger. At two o clock they receive again the same quantity of barley meal and oats as in the forenoon, and afterwards four pounds of hay; at three o clock they have watering, which, if the weather be fine, is done at the well. Finally, in the evening they receive one-fourth of a pound of oats andvetches mixed together. At the age of twelve weeks, the lambs, if they are vigorous and developed according to their age, are weaned, while those that are yet too weak, remain with the eyes till the age of from fourteen to fifteen weeks. Theweanlings are fed, as follows: in the morning at six o clock they receive half of a pound of fine hay; at eight watering in the stall; at ten o clock, one and a half met zen of barley meal, together with one and a half met zen of oats to one hundred head, and afterwards one-fourth of a pound of clever at two o clock, P. M., again oats and barley and afterwards one-fourth of a pound of hay; at four o clock watering at the well, but in addition, the lambs are offered water in the stall also; at six in the evening half of a pound of oats and ve aches once a week, towards evening and before the last fodder, the dealings are furnished with salt to lick, one pound to one hundred head. The gelding of the ram lamb, as also the shortening of the tail, is done in the eighth week, if the weather permits. In the case of ram lambs the tail is lopped off to six inches, in that of the e we lambs to three inches from the root of the tail. The arrangement of the sheep fold is worthy of special attention, which allows the watering, salt licking, and the straw to be administered in the open air in every weather and season of the year, with the exception only of stormy winter days. In every sheep fold there is a shelter house, with outside walls and resting upon wooden pillars, of a proportional length and about nine feet in width. Were the sheep find shelter from the oppressive heat, as well as from snow and rain. In order that the general superintendence of the l sheep, as also the feeding may be attended to with the requisite uniformity, the flocks are divided according to age and gender, in herds of coup long rams, rams for sale, young rams, old pregnant and young eyes, old and young wet hers, early and late lambs. From the number of shepherds employed to super intend the sheep, may be inferred how great care must be bestowed upon them. In the original stock of At van there are twelve shepherds to 1,826head; in the C sa district seventeen to 3,117 head; in Too Vara, twelve to 2,387 head, &c; hence there are to one servant in At van 150 head, inAcsa 230, in Gsb6 Hair a 200, &c 268 X: a. Owing to this attentive and exemplary management of the flocks, they are constantly in a flourishing state of health, and during the last ten: years the mortality, by an average, amounted to no more than six per cent; wlhichcid127) i must. b admitted, is a result scarcely any where else attained in Hungary, where the mortality sometimes averages twenty per cent. especially in flock that pasture upon the low lands. Among the. numerous objects of interest to those who come from abroad to see Alcsfith, the arrangements for washing the sheep, and the house for s hearing, certainly do not rank as last in importance The establishment for the washing of the sheep is built on a very ingenious plan, and the execution of the establishment will be found to- correspond throughout to its purpose and design. I V.-- In the I m proved . Peri no Sheep, wit* I illustrations. Late I I .a, Fig. 19, is a mere no buck, from the flocks of On Her* atMoegelin. I visited his farm and examined the flock, this buck at once attracted my attention from his fine form, heavy folded skin, &c. I learned from the shepherd, who tended the ram flock, that this was the best buck of the whole herd. With the permission of On Shiver, I made an accurate drawing of this ram, as seen in Fig. 19, in a side view, and in Fig, 20,as seen fr n. behind. I took great pains to put down every fold as they appeared on him. It was in the beginning of the month of. August, when the flee ce was yet short and the folds could all be seen. Twenty years ago, bucks with a smooth tight skin, which had extremely fine wool, were considered the best; but their flee ces were light in weight, and had a tendency to run into twist. The German mere no wool grower, had to come back to the original form of rams, with a loose skin, many folds and heavy flee ces, and since then they have succeeded in uniting, with a great quantity of wool, a high degree of fine ness. This kind of heavy folded animals, rams and eyes, are now considered the best for breeding and wool bearing. Fig. 21, represents an e we, the mother of the buck shown in Figs. 19 and 20. Fig. 22, an I infant ado buck. According to Met ri, who travelled in Pain, with the view of collecting information upon mere no wool culture, the Spanish consider mere no sheep, with folds, as a sign of an improved and thorough breed. More or less folds upon an animal give proof of the greater or less quantity of wool; but these folds must be covered with as fine and good a wool as it is on the adjacent parts of the body. There is a great difference in the quantity of wool which a sheep yields, as seen in Figs. 19 and 22, and such as have few or no folds, what the shepherd calls a tight skinned sheep. The. Spaniards kill all those lambs which are born with few folds and fine short hair, or almost naked, because experience has taught them that the offspring of such animals bear a fine wool, but produce by degrees, animals with flabby light flee ces which gradually lose the folds, and become thinner and thinner -in the flee ce and are consequently less advantageous to the wool grower than those sheep which are produced from lambs with plenty of folds and a thick cover of fine soft hair. When we examine such a sheep, after the flee ce has its full growth, the fool must be on all parts of the body even in fine ness, the folds must be* On of the celebrated Albert On Thielep. X. 
269eovered with as fine a w to bl: as on the shoulders and' sides ; a sheep with such a flee ce, may be considered as a sign of high blood. The I amos of the elect- toratflocks of Saxony, have been of that smooth kind just mentioned, and produced the electoral wool, which was found to be similar to that 'gownitfi pain, from the me rim os estates, which is but a shall quantity, when compared with the clips from the transhumantes the flocks of which general y bear heavy flee ces. The common country sheep, on- the continent of Europe, have no folds, and they get them- only, when they are crossed with full blended merinobtibks, whereby the flee ce becomes thicker and closer Only to the me ring breed i belongs the close and thick set fleecy which, in ft respect to their size, produces the greatest quantity of wool. The folds are not a. necessary condition- f ft n ness; but of quantity, and are peculiar to the Spanish! full blooded: me rings. Almost all superior. me rings have folds upon the ribs, where the finest wool grows, and the wool of these animals is of such an uniform character that the folds are only discernible after the animal is shorn. Met ri observed, that the lambs which Bring into the world fine, soft hair and a great number of :folds, and whose tails are, in appearance, shortened by the large folds around them, bear the indication of great softness and quantity of wool. According to Met ri, the sheep in the various stages of crossing, can be divided into four epochs, viz last. The original country sheep 2d. The improved breed 3d. The improved half blood, and 4th. The original mere no, or. perfect blood. The common country sheep have, naturally, an irregular flee ce, consisting f coarse hair and partly of coarse wool, which is not un frequently of a very unequal thickness, rough in appearance and to the touch. i The points of such a wool, stand separate, dis united and unconnected with other hair; the hair is straight and un curled. Such sheep grow upon a square :inch, 5000 to 5500. wool hairs. The lambs bring into the world a long, stiff, waved hair, and few or no folds; sometimes these lambs are covered with hair and wool mixed. I m proved breed, so called, when the buck is from original Spanish blood, and the e we is a common country sheep. The offspring approach, gradually, by a continued .careful crossing, to the mere no. In the first, second, third and fourth generation, the skin becomes more vigorous, anddevelopesmore power to the formation of the wool staple, which obtains, by a continued skilful breeding, a more regular form and permanent character. Thelamibs possess more or less folds, especially when the sire had a dense flee ce. In this period the flee ce consists of twenty-five per went* prima, 50 percent. second a and 25 per cent. tertiary wool. The nature of the wool is still co arise, the wool hairs yet very unequal, sometimes harsh, then again soft, coarser or finer, shorter or longer, and not seldom mixed with s michel (bristly or dogs hair, especially on the belly and thighs, and the wool runs easily into felt. The lambs are covered with a wool, mixed with thick hair, which, on the neck, de flaps, and thighs, is of a ~oars e nature* The German wool growers as sort the 6 lips of mere no wool in super super; I. super elect; I I . super fleet a; I. elect a; I I . elect a; I. prima; I I . prima; secundaU tertiary; quartaquinta; sex ta 270 X. a. In the third and fourth generation there are about 18,000 wool hairs upon a square inch. The folds then are increasing; those on the de flaps, bear a coarse qu in ta or sex ta wool, but those on the other parts of the body a better wool. The whole flee ce begins to have a regular wool formation the curves of each hair becomes uniform, but have not yet arrived to that general uniformity as to form strands of a more uniform nature, the dogs and s michel, (bristly) hairs, become less, and the wool partakes more of theme ring character in proportion as all other qualities are improving. In the tenth generation of improved breeding, the fine wool predominates, a flee ce yields 60 to 70 per cent. prima, 20 to 25 per cent. second a, and 10 to 15 per cent. tertiary wool. The flee ce continues whitish on the back and extremities, which is yet an indication of coarse wool; but the other parts have already a greyish color, or what the shepherd calls the noble color, which indicates the presence of a greater quantity of york. At this period, the wool separates upon the back, in regular lines or hair furrows and does not form itself into small wool tufts or staples. Tufts, composed of hair of various dimensions and curves, last yet for several generations. The animal improved so far, has changed its form and is seen to be improved through a short, round head, with a strong growth of wool upon it, has shorter legs and the ear diminishes also in size. In the face yet appear s michel, (bristly) hair, and it is covered with coarse wool of white color. The flee ce of the lambs consists of hair, coarse hair, and half wool. There sometimes appear smooth wool led lambs, without hair, and sometimes lambs with spots, and sometimes entirely black ones. The lambs born in this epoch have an increase of folds, which are still covered with a wool of coarser nature than the rest, generally a quart a wool; on the thighs and feet the dogs and s michel, or bristly hair, become less. The improved half blood, which is obtained through a continued regular crossing with full blood rams, has already a regular flee ce; the flocks of improved half blood have a great similarity in form and size of Body; ,the faulty formation of the wool, also the irregular high curves of the wool hair, becoming less in number. The wool hairs ought, in this epoch, to have the quality of developing themselves in round small tufts, the long wool seams upon the back disappear and are closed up; the wool hair is less exposed to the influence of the sun and rain. The noble qualities of the wool become more concentrated and approach perfection. The york which was scarcely perceptible in the beginning of the improvement, takes, now the peculiar oily and resin out character of the me rings. In the twentieth generation, the flee ce, by regular crossing and careful management, takes twenty per cent. elect a I I I., fifty per cent. prima, twenty per cent. second a, and ten per cent. tertiary wool. There \vill yet, sometimes be a s michel, or brittle, and dogs hair, to be found. The head and legs a recovered with a fine wool and the ears have lost the original size of the country sheep altogether. In this period, 27,000 wool hairs grow upon a square inch. There appear few spotted lambs, and fewer, with long, coarse, straight hairs upon the thigh and neck. The lambs are born with many folds and a kind of downy hair, among which the wool predominates; in a few days they lose these downy hairs, which are replaced by a dense growth of wool, that distinguishes itself by its fine ness and softness.

273The curling of the upper end of the staple, by which small knobs arise, is also a defect, because then the particular woolly fibres are not of equal length and fine ness. Fig. 6.

This desirable connexion in the shorn flee ce is called doughy, and adds great value to it. But the soiled soaked, s oily, must not be confounded with the same. This is one of the greatest faults of wool, by which it is rendered useless for any valuable fabric. It consists in a perfect felting of the lower part of the flee ce, while, at the bottom of the same, many defective fibres of wool run across through the staple and strands, and so complicate and felt it that the wool only can be drawn apart with great trouble. Figure 14. Probably this fault in a great measure arises as a consequence of an earlier sickly state of the sheep, and to some extent connected therewith probably an original cause of it) is the stratified appearance of the wool which is especially found in the best blooded sheep, when they are suddenly transferred from a good, rich nutriment to a scant meagre one or are strongly affected by hard birth, strained sucking, and other similar circumstances, or are weakened by any <a name="disease96"><mark>disease</mark></a>. I f, for some time, there is a stagnation in the growth of the wool, it remains stationary. If it then grows again afterwards irregularly, the new growth does not attach itself to the old; and we notice, after some time, running across through the staple, a streak, like an offset, where the fibres of wool are weaker, scan tier hunger fine) and also have lost in tenacity as well as in elasticity. Figure 15. This causes the more injury, because, in the preparation of the wool, it tears in those places. But besides the peculiar wool, all sheep have, in particular places of their bodies, real hairs, some more, some less. Of these are reckoned 1. The so called dog, hairs, which are especially found on the hind thanks, and also on the heads of certain animals, yet seldom in considerable quantity. These hairs are coarse, long, smooth, without curves, shiny, harsh, and almost without elasticity 2. Michel hair, short, stiff, shiny, strong below v, above very pointed which are found singly in every flee ce; but only hang, loose therein, fall out in s hearing, or in sorting, and therefore do not deprecate the value 3. The hairs with which many lambs are covered at their birth, sometimes thickly, sometimes only singly, in addition to the small locks, in, which the wool staple is to be recognized. They are soft, short, and pointed and generally fall out, leaving a place for the wool. It has been remarked that lambs, which come into the world with such hairs, are peculiarly rich in wool. The better sort of wool shows, after a full years growth, at the time of the usual s hearing of wool, either short, compressed staples 11 or at the highest, 2 inches long) which are small, blunt, and perfectly cylindrical, but well rounded above, which form a close, nearly even, or ca uniform surface of the flee ces; or if it is long stapled, slightly curved, it is of a more sleek character. The staples, in this case are 3 inches, or above, long, and do not end roundly, but more in a pointed form, and yet without having any faulty points. The short stapled as it is called, is the* This does not much deprecate the value of the wool, but much injures the worth of the animal, from which it comes, as a breeding animal, especially, when the s michel hairs are very hard and dry. It is regarded as a mark of a less noble animal; while the tendency to hardness is apt to prevail, in the reproduction of wool; mildness and softness is that peculiarity at which the sheep breeder has to aim, more than at any other276Ex. card wool, as the long staple is the comb wool; the first is used for making cloths; the second for smooth fabrics. _a_ If both sorts of wool unite the like fine ness, smoothness and softness, without any faults in growth and for i nation of staples, then have both an equal value. In order to learn how to prove the fine ness of the fibres of wool, by there, the eye must be practised by the comparison of many sorts of wool. If they are laid on a black underground, near each other, and the single fibres are often compared with each other, a considerable skill his acquired after a little observation. The surest standard is after all, a well experienced eye* For the farmer who makes use of a sound dry, rather lean than fat pasture, and has a healthy, strong, though not succulent winter fodder, and therefore, for those also who have to manage chiefly a sand or sandy loam soil, perhaps with a wholly dry situated, warm, mild loam, or marshy soil, in most cases, sheep with a high degree of fine ness of wool will be the most profitable; especially if a stock of such is already in his possession, and needs only to be improved. In such circumstances the chief endeavor must always be directed to attaining' the highest fine ness, in order by the high price of the wool, to make up any defect in quantity f  n other circumstances, on the contrary, .when nutritions; fat i pastures, a grass growing, fruitful soil. and luxuriantly produced winter f adder, favor particularly the full nourishment of the sheep, a fine delicate breed is notAsitable; because such circumstances are unfavorable to the health of such sheep. At the same time, although the production of wool of great fine ness, which may be effected in the easiest manner by suitable but good nourishment is rendered difficult by rich fodder, the weight of the s hearing, on the contrary, is of course increased. ,I t is, therefore, under such conditions and other similar circumstances, mostly found profitable to aim rather at quantity than at the higher fine ness, in order that one may be repaid, by the increased quantity, for the lower price. Circumstances. may, therefore, occur which render it advisable to keep merely country sheep, and only to have reference to the production of a good comb wool; first by crossing with long stapled, rich wool, strong and large mere no bucks, or with rams of the Dishley or Leicestershire breeds ;t then further by means of an enabling of the third generation, by breeding in with a great attention to the selection of your bleeders. Especially, when we can sell off heavy, fat sheep, profitable to the butcher, and the mast y pasture favors their becoming* Line ness is closely related to the size of the curves; and it might be said, that the smaller the curves the finer the wool; therefore also the sheep breeder, where no great exactness is required, generally judges of the fine ness according to the formation of the curves. There maybe cases, also, where we must proceed with all possible accuracy; as for example, in the discrimination of the -peculiarities of a breeding buck, as kinds of wool a fe found which are almost wholly without any curves, or where the bends are very flat, and where also this standard cannot be employed: then the sheep breeder must accustom himself always to determine, directly by the dimiieter of the wool hair, (the fine ness To form a flock of sheep to that degree of fine ness, which is the utmost that might he attained, might, indeed, be advantageous under no sort of circumstances. In a sheep fold which produced wool of great fine ness, there is always a part of the offspring which, while it over runs thedegreecid127pf fine ness, that it is your object to produce' in the s hearing weight, no longer maintains the point which must be reached, in order to make your sheep fold profitable. This defect must be remedied, however, if the sheep breeder avoids working against it, while in pairing he as signs that part of the offspring to a buck of rich w 661. But generally many favorable circumstances must cooperate, if one would obtain a regeneration f rio the production* of wool of the greatest degree of fine ness; among which' the opportunity f for a profitable sale of siptrfltouis bucks for breeeldig, standi foremost. I A distinguished stock of this kind is to be found at the royal priviteodomain Seigurt, at Ludwigsburg. X. Doc. 'to. 54.277fat, it may then be expected that in keeping such en no bled country sheep snare profit may be derived, than by a fine sheep fold. Whoever makes the production of a highly fine wool the object of his sheep breeding, will finally obtain a flock, each of which- bears scarcely more than one lurid 6fwoolbut on the contrary whoever merely directs himself to secure a rich weight of 'wool, will by richer nutriment obtain sheep which will produce ^four pounds and over of wool. In an economical respect, it is, in most cases, advisable, to avoid both extremes. But above all, ii order to obtain a sufficiently profitable sheep for, whether it be by the production of a highly fine wool, or by r the quantity of wool, one must be careful, and one must indeed oh i~ what the' would have, and not waver and change the wool, -iii his aim and' eiiperimentsm he st know, what he would have aid that by prove :means. Highly fine e we must not be paired with a coarsewiolledbuti The transition from one variety to another, when it becomes necessAir must bemadeionly gradually. If there is a fine breeding e we, of tooth i iii vol, flabby, an hence a thickening of' the flee ce is desired for the nextdf61ring, then must she riot be paired with a ram (buck) which is remariablPfor great quantity of wool, and is dis similar in the coarseness 6 of his wool and other i qualities; but we must first' look but a buck for her which has a flee ce thicker full r of (cid127ol, and which also, iii regard to fine ness andsteeture of the wool agrees tolerably with hers. In opposite cases, we ma rage according to the same principles consequently every one shouldcaefuilly avoid rapid transition at every coup long. It is: likewise to be noticed, at the same time, that the powerful, thick, and rich wool led bucks more strongly transmit their peculiarities than the thin nd fine wool led; so that it is easier to increase the weight of wool, of a highly refined flock, than to bring it to a yet greater degree of fine ness. For these reasons must: the last peculiarity, in a flick of this kind be highly regarded; and if any one feels himself inclined to aim i at greater richness of wool, it is particularly necessary to proceed with great care, in the selection of bucks. But we must also, especially in a very large estate, or in the joint sheep folds of proprietors- aim at the production of a wool of an uniform character and the growth and formation of a staple free from faults; since, in most of our sheep folds, we now find at the same time, long and short, ;oars e and fine wool, thick, slight curled and un curled flee ces. I- order to attain gradually to an entirely uniform kind of wool in a sheep fold, according to the opinion of judicious sheep bleeders, we should make use of bucks of an uniform character, that is of equally long or equally short wool, &c, according as any one guiding himself by local circumstances wishes to produce a longer or shorter wool; and not, as happens at the present day, choose bucks of different kind of flee ces for coup long in one and' the same flock of eyes. We should also manage the refining of the wool or the production of greater richness, according to the rules and principles already noticed. The bucks must be chosen from the sheep folds of exactly the same kind cf growth and formation of staple, and the wool must, at the same time, be of equal fine ness in the hair in all parts of f the body that is, exactly even; for only with such can we reckon on continuing the blood and securing a good stock in future. The choice of the buck must be made in the months of March and April, or at least before the hearing by one who is a judge in such matters, with circumspection and prudence but not as is frequently done shortly before the time of crossing by the shepherd who then, even if he understands it, can make no proper choice 278 X. a. The neglect which has been practised hitherto in this matter has caused great <a name="loss41"><mark>loss</mark></a> and injury to the breeding of sheep just as the unsuitable choice and small care of the bulls has done in the enabling of black cattle; and generally as the use of poor breeding animals in the usual raising of domestic animals has also done among them. It is greatly to be desired that the agriculturists, through whose carelessness it has increased, should seek to avoid it for the future. A sheep fold which produces a wool even and free from faults, the animals of which are well kept during the entire year, whose flee ces have been brought to market well washed' will always command a higher price; that is to say, it will repay the labor and trouble spent upon it, and yield a higher interest on the capital invested than will one where these conditions have not been fulfilled. In order to be able to afford to the sheep a suitable care during the time of pasture, by summer foddering, in the months of June and July, we, we must make use of all our capacity for the artificial culture of fodder; and remember that while in the time of pasture, one sheep will not find sufficient fodder on a Weimar acre of naked fallow pasture, yet on the same extent of pasture sown with yellow or Spanish c lover, eight or twelve sheep may be kept; and with green mowed c lover, on the same area, accordingly as the soil is more or less favorable to the culture of c lover, 20 sheep may be foddered, for five in the stalls; but at the same time, through the increased production of dung, we can also produce more grain and other vegetables and fruits, than if, as is now usual, large areas lie idle for pasture; and besides, the herd of cattle in general is not lessened, but rather increased. Not more than thirty years will pass without generally furnishing room for conviction, that it is better for the health of the animal, for the wool, and generally for the whole farming interest, if the sheep be foddered, for the greater part of the time of pasture, in the stalls, or in the open spaces of the yard, surrounded with herds, under the open sky, and only sometimes be led out to range on the natural pastures devoted to this purpose. Of   .darling Sheepthe German mere no wool grower have various modes of marking the cheek. The signs or marks are either put on by means of color, burnt i tattooed; cut in, or marks, hung round the neck. Sheep which are destined for the butcher, are marked with paint on the back or side. The rams are marked: upon the horns with hot irons, upon which the numbers or signs are engraved. A very common method is tattooing. It is done on the inside of the ear by means of signs or figures formed of steel points, and forced into the skin in the following manner: First, a kind of thick paint is made of ver million, indigo, or gunpowder and whiskey; when the paint is prepared, the sheep to be marked is bound and placed upon a table and held by one person, while another puts the paint upon the inside of the ear, and presses the signs or numbers into the skin, without causing it to bleed; when the instrument has been withdrawn, the paint is rubbed- into the marks. I nl bout three weeks the marks become hardened and are indelible. All sheep of the Count Carolys flocks are marked in that way, corn x. Doc. To: 54. 279 responding with the register and pe degrees. The signs and numbers were very distinct even in old sheep, which had been marked for several years. The instrument used there is constructed as follows: Upon the lower jaw of a pair of nippers, as seen in Fig. 27, there are grooves a, b, c, d, into which the numbers or marks are; these marks or numbers are formed Fig. 30 Fig *29 Fig 23! -or* v^ ; *a^ it ha- ^of steel points, as seen in Figs. 28 and 29.

At the agricultural school of On Her, I saw two very simple instruments for measuring the fine ness of wool; one was to ascertain the number of curves in a wool hair within an inch. This instrument consists of a round flat piece of brass or other metal, the circumference is- divided into 5 or 6 inches and- each inch forming fine printed teeth; when the number of curves of a hair is to be determined, the hair is placed over it, in such a manner that the number of curves of the hair correspond to the number of teeth on one of the sides of the plates. *fig. 33, represents such a brass p "ate. -to ascertain the fine ness of a given wool hair, there is used a piece of e bony or other highly polished black wood, in the shape of four sided pyramid; upon -this is placed a fine wool hair from a known celebrated flock which serves as a; standard ; the given wool hair is placed. near by and secured with bees wax; ;when prepared -in this way the pyramid is removed from the observer until the fine wool hair has vanished from his sight, the distance is marked, then the pyramid is moved again until the other hair has vanished; the distance between the first mark and the place where the last observed one has vanished, is likewise marked, and this interval between both -marks, serves to compare the fine ness of other hairs by.

In the estates of nobles this kind of building is generally f a pleasant appearance and built in ,conformity to the teachings of experience. They are mostly brick buildings :with a tile roof. They are very room y, and it is generally calculated that 4 eyes- with their lambs require a space of 6 feet square, where 6 eyes with their lambs findroonT, there can be placed 8 wet hers or 12 head of yearnings." In a stable where 500 eyes can be housed, there is room for 666 wet hers or rams, or for 1000 head of yearnings. The of long form is found the best, from 30 to 36 feet in width.

Take good care, that your sheep are never brought upon low wet ground or molasses. Second. When the localities permit it, there should be a regular change in the pasture lands; for instance bring your sheep a) n a wet rainy season or day, upon mountainous or hilly ground b) When the weather is dry and clear, feed them upon flat lands orydlliesc) In cold, stormy weather lead them under the cover of forests or bushd) In winter, when there is a dry frost and when the ground is free from s row, you may lead your flocks upon wheat or rye fields Thirdly. The pasture lands which are considered the best and nearest ought to be usedscid127) For the eyes with lambs and y palings, and for such lambs lhichhavebteen separated from their mothers. S b) The farthest from the sheep yard for wet hers. The sheep it end to be sold to the butcher upon the lowest pas lure ends. Fourthly. Very shepherd must have a good dog to keep the she p from injuring the crops when they s are brought to the mi fly. When t lie sheep are pastured in va lies, where were is a .hevydei, and the grass covered with spider web and other I mauritius, they it be driven first over the ground upon which they are pastured ; the dog is used to drive them over it in all directions; this is done for the following reason sa) The rain carries down from the mountains or hills sand which is deposited upon the grass; in passing the sheep over such pasture lands, the sand is thrown off and the grass is rendered more suitable to feed the sheep s pop. If clay has been deposited upon the grass, the shepherd must not allow his flock l to i stop at all and feed upon such grass, which would be exceedingly unhealthy for them, he must avoid such places, until the clay has become perfectly dry upon the grass, when the sheep are driven over first, before they are permitted to touch it. Great injury may be done to the flocks in such val lies or flats, even if there has been no clay deposited upon the grass; when the sheep are ,fed upon the luxuriant grass after they have received salt but no water, theyoveirladcid127lheir stomachs and are liable to <a name="disease97"><mark>disease</mark></a> b) A certain species of spiders is to be found, among the grass; and sometimes in such quantities that they are eaten by the sheep with the l grass; this has not however a very bad result but causes a slight purgation. When the sheep are driven over the ground first, the spiders fly to their retreat. The' cobwebs (film virginia )a) with ,which the stubble fields and grass are covered in the autumn, seem to have injurious effect upon the sheep when a sheep is opened after having fed upon such lands as are covered with cobwebs, there is not a trace of them to be found in their stomcid127achs. When the sheep are passed over such fields or grass land, the cobwebs are t ke in off by the legs of the sheep. Sixthly. During the midday sun the sheep ought to be brought under a 286 X- shade or shady trees. When the pasture lands are too far from the sheep hard, there ought to be proper shades erected where trees are not in sufficient number, to give shelter from the sun, rain and hail. Seventhly. The wealthiest pastures should be reserved for the lambs, that the delicate animals, after they have been separated from their dams may find a substitute for the nourishing milk, and not be too much retarded in their growth. Lightly. In the spring avoid all pastures, where there are briars, bushes, and woods with short undergrowth; because the sheep will lose their wool in such places; avoid also pine woods, because the pine needles which fall continually from these trees will become entangled in the wool and deprecate its value. After the s hearing, such pastures can be used without injury to the sheep and .wool. Ninthly. Nothing is so injurious to sheep and wool as a sudden fright. I n the night when they are penned in the open field, and there is a storm approaching with heavy thunder, the shepherd must walk around the pen and talk to them, in order to quiet them. When they get much frightened, they rush to one side of the hur does upset it and break loose. Gently. In the hot season the shepherd should lead his flock in such directions as to keep the sun behind it; in order that their bodies may give shade to their heads, and he should keep them as far apart as possible, to allow the air a free circulation among them. Eleventhly. Guide your flocks always slowly, especially on rising ground Should the shepherd neglect this precaution, particularly in hot weather, the sheep become over heated and liable to dangerous attacks. Twelfthly. When the sheep are brought upon the stubble fields, observe the following rules -a) Bring first, the lambs upon it b) The eyes; and then c) The rams and wet hers. Thirteenthly. As it is the rule not to bring the flocks upon the pasture in the morning before the air has dried up the dew and frost; it is also a rule to bring them in the stable or pen when the dew begins to appear. Fourteenthly. A shepherd should always carry with him a) A lance to) A sharp knife e) A small tin box filled with hard) Another with sulphate of copper That in case an accident should happen, he may bleed the animal; or when he observes a sheep to walk lame and he finds the foot heated, indicating a disposition to foot <a name="rot20"><mark>rot</mark></a>, he may remove the hoof with the knife and apply copper as, over which he has to put a layer of tar. Of .dimensions to be observed in purchasing Being Skeepwith a Drawing and Table n purchasing me rings, Met ri lays down the fellowing dimensions as important to be observed late I V, Fig. 23, is the outline of a mere no sheep, with dimensions marked upon it 1. The length of the vertebra c, to the tail root d, when taken twice, must x. of. No. 54. 287 be as long as the whole animal taken from the point of the i lose at a, to the tail root d. e 4. The circumference e to f, of the whole animal, must be as long as three times the length of the vertebra from the shoulders at c to the tail rootd. When these dimensions so correspond, the animal may, be considered perfect. The larger the whole circumference of the belly from g to h, and that of the thighs from i k, to 1, especially when caused by a broad back, and wide spreading hip bone, the more valuable is the animal, because it yields more wool of the finer, qualities. Very important are a barrel shaped belly, the length of the vertebra frormSthesHtoulder c, to the tail root d, and also the width of the back, because here also grow highly fine qualities of wool. Short legs are considered a necessary quality of a mere no sheep, because as on the legs grow the coarser kind of wool, the shorter the legs are, the less coarse wool is produced. Short legged sheet, also feed better on short dry and poor pasture, they travel well and are particularly well suited to mountainous countries. The ram should have a wide chest, a flat but strong back, short legs, strong knees, broad neck, a heavy folded skin these various qualities indicate strength and great power in breeding. The e we should also possess a large, wide chest, broad shoulders, strong back and a long body, short legs, and resemble greatly the ram. The following measures will furnish data by which to judge of the various breeds of me rings. They are selected from the valuable work of Met ri, a highly celebrated writer on sheep, and an admitted authority in these matters m Germany. Rode of washing sheep at On Orders, Moegelinto the standard samples of mere no wool, which I had the honor of sending to the . Honorable Commissioner of Patents, one chart of which he intends to send each of the different state governments, I added some samples of washed wool from the flocks of On Her, which I obtained from that very obliging gentleman, who endeavored to comply in every respect with the wishes of the Honorable Commissioner of the Patent Office, as expressed in his letterscommendatory to facilitate me in the collection of information on agriculture c. The washed wool from the Moegelin estate has a beautiful whiteness, although the sheep of that country suffer greatly from the dust and sand blown about, which combines with the york and forms a thick black cover to the flee ce. On Her uses a mode of washing his sheep different from the common river and shower bath washing. At Moegelin the sheep are soaked in a small stream near by the farm; when the water has thoroughly penetrated the coat of wool, they are left in that state until the greasy, dirtyFigasCcovering seems to yield to a second bath; then the sheep are brought under a kind of shower bath, where the water is of a soft nature, taken from a pond of collected rain water. Fig. 38, shows the simple arrange19290Ex. men t. The pump a, is fed from a pond, and lifts the water into a vat by placed sufficiently high to give the water the necessary fall and force to penetrate the flee ce and clean the wool. Two pipes c c, or those, communicate with the vat b, at the end of the those is attached a s trainer with a stop cock d. When the sheep are ready to be washed, they are placed within a pen e, near by, which has a floor of boards to allow the water to run into a pond one man holds the sheep while another sprinkles it by means of the host and s trainer, until the dirt is removed from the wool. Description of the Building and Apparatus for Washing Sheep, atAlcsith in Hungary. The accompanying drawing, Fig. 35, represents the ground plan of the sheep wash of Alcsfith, in Hungary. When the sheep have been soaked in the warm water vats at b, and sufficiently cooled down under the shelter d, they are brought into the space i, and from thence placed under the shower bath a a. When the flee ce has acquired the necessary whiteness, the sheep is placed under the shelter k. The water is heated near by in a small building e, and by means of a pipe f, conveyed to the trough b.

291SFig. 36 is a section of the shelters c and d with the warm bath b. Fig 37, is a section of the shower bathyrT '5 t is worthy of remark that the process of washing is done under the roof, and, accordingly, no sudden shower or rainy weather can interfere with it. Before the shower bath is administered to the sheep, their dirt and pitch has to be dissolved or loosened. For this purpose a soaking vat b is put up, which is covered and tightly fixed together of strong planks or boards. The soaking vat having been filled with hot water 23, 24 Reaumur equal to 840Fahrenheit, the sheep are placed in two lines and constantly handled, until the york and dirt are dissolved, which ordinarily takes from fifteen to twenty minutes. The solvent effect of the hot water is considerably increased, in the first place by mixing with the water while boiling, some potash (say 5 to 6 les to one solution) and in the next place by the let, arising from the natural oily matter of the wool. The sheep after being well soaked are placed under shelter, d, where they have to wait for their turn of the shower bath, in order that the animal, now too much heated, may not pass immediately from the hot soaking vat into the shower bath, this being at 130 to 140 Reaumur equal to 610 to 630 Fahrenheit. It must be confessed that the sudden change of temperature, and the application of the vigorous Preisnitz method of sheep washing which is adopted here, pre supposes a strong and vigorous constitution as found in the Alcsfith sheep. Not minding the involuntary cold shower bath, they some gaily out of the shower gutter, and in a manner as if boasting of the splendor of their snow white wool, they show themselves at the shelter c, which is assigned them and which is thickly strewn and covered with straw. In an average forty she e are washed in one hour. The fact, that in the vicinity of Alcsuth, the least wind will raise clouds of dust, and will fill the flee ce of the grazing sheep with black sand to the skin, must add to the trouble and expense of the washing, and besides renders a correct estimate of the fine ness as well as the other qualities of the wool extremely difficult. Those animals whose wool ha. not been well cleaned from this dust by the shower bath, are wet with a let which is kept in readiness, and which is made from Preiss' vegetable wool wash; and twenty-four hours after they are again put under the shower, which will then give to the flee ce the brightest appearance. Experiments have been made also with the Packer wool wash. The wool to which it had been applied, was exceedingly well purified indeed, and snow white; but then the flee ce had become rough and been deprived nearly of all fat. The ingredients of this fluid have never been made know by its inventor ll, 7 292 X. a. The oily matter which settles at the bottom during the washing, is let off by means of a small gutter, is collected and conveyed in cases upon the meadows, which being done after having time, when the season is usually quite dry, is of much value to the crop of hay. At a distance of about 300 steps from the establishment for the washing of the sheep, upon a gentle height which commands the whole valley, lies the handsome I Building for the s hearing of the sheep. With its high roof of boards and its many windows, it is well lighted, airy, and sufficiently large to take in from 150 to 160 s hearers at one and the same time. The s hearing is done by women who possess great skill in s hearing. The wages paid for s hearing is from 15 to 25 cents, the last being paid to those who s hear both quick and handsomely. The rolling up of the flee ce and the collecting of the pick wool is done by boys and little girls, the former receiving 9 cents, and the latter 5 cents, or its equivalent Vienna currency. Of I I.- Fool Growers' Convention and Fool Markets. In the historical sketch of Silesian wool culture, we have seen how many years it took those intelligent and industrious wool growers to obtain that degree of perfection in the wool of their flocks, which corresponds with the demand of the manufacturers, as well as with those of the wool growers. It required time, experience, and mutual understanding among the wool growers, manufacturers and wool traders; to effect this they held conventions as early as 1814, when the wool growers of Germany, and such persons as were interested in this branch of husbandry, met at Run, for the first time, to consult, exchange their views, and adopt general terms and rules for the accomplishment of the desired object. Mori Hair succeeded in calling together a similar convention, which hm etat Leipsic, in Saxony, and several other societies adopted the same beneficent measure. The principal object of these conventions was to accelerate the merinowool culture, to exchange their views and experience in breeding, feeding washing, s hearing, &c; to take into consideration the demands of the wool merchants and woollen manufacturers, and in this way the German wool growers have attained to their superior results. By samples of wool from various flocks in different parts of the Unitedstates, that have come to my notice, I have found that there exists no decided character in the wool of this country; in every flock, no doubt there is wool of different character, and very few are perfect in their kind. This vast expanse of country, of various c limes, soil and more or less favorable localities for sheep breeding, must naturally produce different kind of wool; arid it would be highly important to the wool growers of the east west, north and south, to meet once a year, and bring with them, if possible, some of their sheep, or when the distance is too great, at least a a number of entire flee ces in a washed and un washed state; these flee ces ought to be exhibited with a label indicating 1. The section of country from which it comes 2. The kind of pasture high or low grounds 3. Length, height and circumference of the sheep 4. The sex 5. The age of the flee ce in days 6. Eight of the animal 7. Eight of the flee ce in un washed states x. a. 2938. Eight of the flee ce when washed 9. Origin of the animal. These data will facilitate the wool growers in judging of the fine ness, even ness, form of the staple, and all those indications, by which a thorough blood can be noticed; for it is only by comparison of wool from the various parts of the flee ce we can ascertain the value of an animal. The wool growers should be furnished with samples of the best Silesian breeds, to enable them to compare the wool of their flocks by, and should there exist faults to discern the mode of remedying them in the shortest and best manner. I have sent the honorable Commissioner of Patents several charts with samples of the best Silesian, Hungarian and Saxon wool, which I collected during my journey through those countries. Such a chart will enable the wool growers of the United States to make comparison with the wool of their flocks and ascertain the difference existing between the wool of their sheep and those of Silesian. At the yearly meeting of the German agriculturists, this important branch is ably discussed, and all new improvements in the mode of breeding or growing wool are made known and published. The wool markets afford another opportunity to the wool grower to become acquainted with the progress in the wool culture, and the demands of the manufacturer. Germany has at di fe rent places regular wool markets, where, on certain days of the year, the wool of a whole country or district is brought together for sale. At Breslau is the most celebrated wool market; it is celebrated not only for the finest wool being found there, but for its being one of the earliest in the season where the greatest quantity of excellent wool is offered for sale. The next important ones are at Berlin, Stettin, Magdeburg, Dresden and Leipsic. At Breslau are sold every year about 60,000 cut, of whichReicthalers; Dollars 3000 cut. are of the finest quality, and averages about 130 98 per. cwtL40 0 " .a. .a. .a. 110 77 "5000 " .a. .a. .a. . .a. s 100= 70 "10000 " .a. .a. .a. . . 906 3 " "1 5000 (a( .a. . .a. . .a.

This shows that even at that market, where all the wool of the whole province of Russian Silesian is sold, the greatest part of the wool offered for sale is wool of the middle quality, and that the amount of the high price d qualities is small in proportion to that of the lower priced ones. These markets are visited by the manufacturers and wool merchants of England, France, Belgium, Russia and various other parts of Europe. The finest, best as sorted, well washed, and that which is carefully packed, without having recourse to plaiting, or increasing the weight by m listening it c, brings the highest price. It is, therefore, an object with the German wool grower to prepare his wool for market in the best style. The wool grower has an opportunity at these markets to become acquainted with all the different kinds of wool grown in his country; he can obtain a correct 294 X. knowledge of what is in demand, and he is enabled to learn the best mode of breeding, washing, packing, &c. Similar markets will become necessary in the United States, because here the wool growing regions are too extensive. The wool growers of the west, for instance, are too far from the eastern markets. In the other hard, the manufacturer is not able to visit all the flocks over the whole Union in order to become acquainted with the products of his country. The wool grower, remote from the great mary, is ignorant of the true value of his wool, and depends entirely on the neighboring merchant, who obtains it generally for a low price, whereby the wool grower becomes discouraged. Had Ohio, for instance, a wool market, where all the wool would be brought together from that state at one point, say Cincinnati, the manufacturer of the east would find it advantageous to visit that market and purchase such wool as he requires for his fabrics, and the wool growers who grow better qualities could obtain such prices as they deserve they feel encouraged, try to improve their flocks, and gradually furnish the manufacturers of this country with a wool he now has to purchase in the foreign markets. Of In the Fool Trade of Germany, and other countries. The following articles from the pen of J. G. Ulster, a distinguished agricultural writer, who has devoted his long life to the subject of wool and the wool trade of Germany and Europe, is believed to be well worthy of being submitted to the American wool grower, as showing in a very short space the views of the German wool grower on this important branch of agricultural industry. He thus becomes acquainted with the state of the present German wool market, and their speculations for the future, and he will see therein the principles which they have laid down to be guided by, in order to retain the reputation of their markets. It will be difficult to take from Germany the palm, having already a superior improved breed offerings, well informed and attentive shepherds, and highly industrious wool growers. But Mr. Ulster is mistaken in the belief that highly improved sheep do not last well in the United States. The fact is, we have yet had very few highly improved sheep imported, and the few which were brought here have been neglected in consequence of the want of knowledge or that indefatigable attention which the mere no sheep requires. As far as my own observation goes, I have found that the wool grown in the Unitedstates has a remarkable softness. I have not yet seen wool from highly improved sheep. The samples which came under my notice were, with the exception of a few instances, from good half bloods, but even that coarse kind had a high degree of softness. Why should not we, in countries like Virginia or Tennessee, where nature has done every thing for the sheep; given an excellent soil, which produces the best kind of grasses; a climate like that of I talk, only a few weeks winter, where the sheep must be housed and fed why should not we, with such advantages, produce a wool which can compete with European wool, of a similar degree of fine ness, in cheapness? We must first, however, learn how to grow an even, well stapled flee ce; we must learn how to wash it well, and how to as sort it and pack it well. In order to show the wool growers the extent of consumption of wool in this country, exceeding the amount grown, I have obtained from the office of the Register of the U. S. Treasury the annexed table.

Amount of Capital engaged in the Fool Trade of Germany. It is by no means easy to give an exact statement of the number of sheep kept in Germany. According to the statistical tables published from time to time, they exceed thirty millions. In an average, 100 head furnish yearly two cut. of wool; and if this amount by not fully attained everywhere, the deficiency thus arising is made up by the excess of sheep above thirty millions. The yearly production of wool may therefore be set down as amounting to 600,000 cut. Not that this entire quantity, however, comes into market; for a goodly portion thereof goes from the hands of the grover directly into those of the consumer; as is particularly the case with the inferior sorts. I cannot be far from the truth, when I estimate the quantity thus passing directly into the consumers possession at one-sixth of the entire production, so that there are left for the market 500,000 cut. Is to the average prices of this quantity, it must be observed that it is made up of two different classes of wool, viz, wool of northern or of southerner many, the former of which is by far the most valuable. To the first of these two classes belong the markets of Silesian, Pomerania, Brandenburg, Saxony, and Magdeburgh; and it should be noticed here that the breeding of sheep in the northern provinces, being carried on upon a much larger scale, the amount of wool grown in the north is far greater. Still the difference which thus arises is made up again by the territory of the southern provinces being so much larger; for with the southern provinces  also class the western portion of Germany, viz, all the Cherish provinces. I have made this division of Germany in accordance with the quality of the wool, and hence have reckoned to northern Germany also Moraviawhich is made a competitor of Silesian and Saxony, and in this manner the proportions will be pretty equal, so that I may fairly set down for either 250 000 cut, or one half of the wool brought into market. The prices for the last six years (previous to 1845) having been in northern Germany on an average) 65 Russian thalers, (equal to        $47.50*,) a cut; the 250,000cwt., amount to 16,250,000 thalers, (equal to                              $11,375,000;) while those for southern Germany, on an average, are 10 thalers, (equal to   $7,) i. e amount to 55 thalers (or           $38.50) a cut, which makes for the south a total of 13,750,000 thalers. Hence there circulates in Germany in the wool* Reckoning the Russian thaler at 70 cents i Reckoning the Russian thaler a it 70 cent a .296 X. market every year a capital of 30,000,000 thalers, (equal to          $21,000,000,)in which 100,000 cut. of wool are not counted, which are sold by the producer directly to the consumer, and which, if set down at four millions of thaler, (equal to        $2,800,000,) would certainly be rated too low. Of- In the Export of Fool from Germany, f c. The yearly export of wool from Germany is already of considerable extent. To give a correct idea of it, we will state the countries to which it is exported. England continues to bear the sway as heretofore. Her purchases in the German markets, although they are no more than what they were a few years back, are to such an extent as to influence, nay, determine, the prices of wool. Now, the English buyers (as has been found of late) are in search more of the middling than of the superior sorts of wool, and on the ground of this observation it has been asserted that the raising of middling wool will in future be more advisable, and reward the owner better than the raising of fine quality. Should this opinion become general, it would give a deadly blow to wool production in Germany, since, as  have shown, it is only the excellence of their wool that can secure them customers, and that can keep up this branch of industry so as to remuneratethe proprietor. In order to understand correctly what the English purchasers are attempting in their inquiry after middling sorts, it will only be necessary to observe which of the middling sorts they really select. I t then will be seen that it is the wool of those flocks which are of a particularly good breed, namely, such as is obtained from flocks of noble descent, and as are constantly improving, and where, at the same time, by means of a superior treatment, an article in every respect valuable is obtained, and this, considering its relative fine ness, at a fair price. The English find it to their great advantage to buy these kinds of wool, and they seize upon them in the very sight of the less clever domestic purchaser; and they themselves admit that the Silesian wool possesses in an eminent degree all the qualities required for their manufactures. Shrewd merchants as they are, they soon discovered that it is most profitable for them to buy the middling qualities, that by being carefully sorted out, will increase their profits. The yearly import of wool by England from Germany may. be estimated at from 20 to 25,000 bales, at four cut. each; hence it would make about one-sixth or seventh of the entire production, but for the fact that under the name of German wool a large quantity of Hungarian, Polish, and Russian wools, is sold in the wool markets, and is called in the lists of exports to England. The latter report, when reduced to what it actually is, can scarcely amount to 15,000 bales (or 60,000 cut) hence about the tenth part of the entire production of Germany. The Dutch and Belgians, as the foreign customers of Germany for wool, rank next to the English. They are much older customers than the latter, although the quantity they buy is not so large. Of late they likewise inquire more frequently after good middling sorts, than those of the finest qualities. The latter, however, are bought especially by a few houses of Belgium and French Netherlands, for which good prices are paid. The wool dealers of these countries go in person to the German markets to make their purchases; still, at the same time most of them have some friends among German firms of inferior rank, to whom they give their orders and instructions, and who, as soon as the least prospect for a favorable period of business turns up, are regularly the first to lay hold upon x. a. 297 such well known s hearings as best suit those wool dealers and manufacturers. Upon these, Germany calculates for the future as her old and certain customers with greatest reliance, because they cannot, like the English, withdraw from the market at any moment when a favorable opportunity offers elsewhere. The French, also, have lately come into the German markets; they buy chiefly of the best and finest wools. I need they, also, formerly sometimes came to southern Germany, to buy clippings, through the dust and heat. Still their trade did not amount to much. War larger is the amount which they get from Germany via Frankfort, (on the Paine) although from second hand sellers, but for which they ordinarily give no high prices. A great part of this wool, indeed nearly all of it, is not of German origin, but is raised in Hungary. Netherlands and France together, probably, buy in Germany a quantity of wool equal to that taken by England alone, and as te: one tenth of the entire production, the sale to those three countries, amounts to one fifth of the entire production. Russia is quite an unexpected visiter, that of late has come into the German markets, and the superior clippings go now to that country, especially to Warsaw and Fig a. The quantity sent thither is comparatively small, yet the prices obtained are high. The manufacturers of those two cities buy the most costly wool, and for the most part it is thither that the wools at 130 to 140 thalers    $91 to 98 a cut. are sent. This fully makes up for the money going from Germany to Poland for low sorts of wool. Moreover, it should not be overlooked, that a considerable portion of the foreign wool trade is merely transit business; for many German and foreign wool dealers purchase large quantities of wool in Poland and Russia, sort them in their German store houses, dispose of a good part of the country wool, but mix also, much of it with German wool and send it, under the name of German wool, to foreign countries. This does not injure the wool production directly, yet indirectly it does. For in the first place, it makes the quantity produced by us appear larger than it actually is, and in the second place, it can surely do the wool production no good, to have the reputation of the fine ness of German wool disparaged, by selling under the name of German wool an article much inferior in value and of no commend able properties. It is to be apprehended, too, that this fraud will gain ground more widely in future, the more other countries endeavor to imitate Germany in producing a constantly improving species of wool. In order to form a correct conclusion respecting the future prospects of the German wool trade, from the way and manner in which the German export business is carried on, at present, it is necessary to explain the mode to those un informed. Fool to go abroad is very rarely done up in 'a' shepherds bundles" as they are called; but for the most part it is previously sorted and dressed at the warehouses, where the different sorts of wool, according to kind and quality, are separated and as sorted and packed up. Herein many artifice s are made use of by those who do not scruple to resort to them, of advantage for the time to the one who adopts them, but which injure the business and in the end must cause distrust of purchasers abroad. Honest wool dealers, of course, disapprove of such conduct, and never participate in it; yet, though they will keep up the confidence of their old customers, they at any rate must suffer in this respect, that, owing to the prevailing distrust, it is not easy for them to find new ones. One of those artifices very frequently resorted to is, the so called plating, which consists in wrapping up the bale in 298 *x. is omne very fine flee ces, so as to make it appear, as if the bale throughout is of that excellent quality. Plating, as it is called, when done with wool evidently superior to that really contained in the bale, is certainly nothing but fraud. It is very well known that there are German wool dealers who carry on business in that way, and who for this purpose buy superior clips in Saxony and Silesian, in order thereby, the more easily to succeed in selling those less valuable from other German provinces or even from Hungary. Met, if there is any thing to secure the German wool business in foreign countries, its continuance and prosperity for the future, it is only by the strictest honesty which in days past was always associated with the name of Germans and of Germany. In the future prospects of the German Fool Trade. A comparison between the production and consumption of Wtoolwecannot form a correct idea of what is likely to be the future state of the German wool business, without an accurate estimate of its actual production and consumption. To judge then of the future prospects, we must first show what is the present state. We have already given an estimate of the amount of wool yearly produced in Germany. Whether a great increase of this quantity be possible and probable in future, is highly questionable, as we mean to show further below. The yearly production, as we have said amounts to 600,000 cut. It would be a difficult task to ascertain by the bills of sale, how much the domestic consumption amounts to, and even if it was made out with the help of statistical tables, but little reliance could be placed upon it. The surest standard after all, are the lists of export and import of raw wood. According to these, Germany imports a larger quantity than she exports hence the consumption exceeds the production; and since with the increase and enlargement of her manufactures, the consumption continues largely on the increase, it will be plain that for the domestic production, so far, a very favorable future can be anticipated, which, as a matter of course, will extend also, over the wool trade. We shall have to consider the several German provinces each by itself n Austria herself and her other German provinces, the demand of the manufactures goes far beyond what they themselves produce; for they obtain a very considerable quantity from Hungary and Alicia, and they do not by any means export an equal quantity of their own wool. The German provinces of Austria import from Hungary, if not more, at least a quantity equal to three fifths of their entire wool production, say about 100,000 cut. The imports from Alicia, indeed, are much smaller, but will exceed 20 000 cut. In the other hand, the exports of those German states in question, can scarcely amount to more than half that quantity, i. e. 60,000owt.; and a great portion of it is wool imported from Hungary, consequently merely in transit. That imported quantity is consumed by the many flourishing manufactures of Austria, Bohemia, and Silesian, in addition title considerable amount of their own production. At Ri inn alone, the capital of Dora via, nearly the entire wool production of Dora via, is worked up; Reichenberg in Bohemia and Bielitz in Silesian are likewise foremost in this branch of industry, and there is a large number of cities and towns that carry it on upon a similar scale, so that it becomes quite intelligible, how the German provinces of Austria can consume about 200,000 cut. of wool a year. It is self evident that this enormous consumption cannot be confine a to x. a. 299 the domestic want. Thus for example, the wool imported from Hungatyin a great measure goes back, changed into goods; and much of it goes farther down to the Turkish provinces. Alicia likewise imports a quantity of woollen goods from Austria, equal to what the latter can produce from the wool she imports from Alicia; and in the I italian provinces also, the Austrian woollen manufactures sell extensively. Accordingly the German provinces of Austria, in relation to the other provinces of that empire, play, in manner the part of England, which imports far more raw material than she herself consumes, and exports the balance, changed into manufactures, to foreign countries, which it is evident must be very lucrative. If we now go to Bavaria, as next in order, we find that her demand of wool cannot be fully supplied by her own production, and although she receives from abroad little or none of the raw material, she receives the more of woollen goods. I cannot state, precisely, the extent of the active and passive commerce of this branch of business, and mere conjecture would be of little value. In Wurttemberg, the proportions of production and demand of wool are much more favorable, for manufactures there are in a flourishing state, and much is sent abroad. Sometimes, even quantities of raw wool are exported to France, but this is constantly made up by the excess of imports. Of Laden very much the same may be said as of Wurttemberg. In the smaller states on the Rhine, to the lines of Westphalia, the consumption of wool and woollen goods by far exceeds the production, and they are extensive customers to the much more productive provinces farther east   n Russia, owing to the flourishing condition of her manufactures, the consumption of wool, though but recently, has reached almost the same extent as in Austria. Only in Cherish Russia the consumption has long since become so large that great quantities of wool are every year imported from the eastern provinces as well as the adjoining states. In the province of Magdeburg, in the Marches, and in Silesian, however, the consumption of wool also rapidly increases, especially of the finer kind, which is much required by the manufactures there, so much so that these provinces consume nearly all of their extensive production; the quantity of wool sold by them to other countries being replaced by importation. It appears, then, from the foregoing, that the consumption of wool in Germany, much exceeds her own production, hence the latter must be considerably increased if she is to be able to meet her own demand. It is quite an unnecessary fear by which the timid, minds distress themselves, of those who dream of a surplus from over production; for while our manufacturing industry does not decrease, but grows in extent, even the largest amount of production will not suffice to meet the demand, and we shall be under necessity constantly of importing from the neighboring countries. Now much public prosperity must be benefit ted thereby is obvious, for manufactures, as every one knows, possess a vastly greater value than the raw material. The question then, whether Russia and Hungary, by the quantity of wool they produce, can drive us from the market, is not so serious as this, whether they may not, in time to come, compete with our own woollen manufactures. To apprehend an excessive production of wool, is altogether chimerical for, in the first place, as to the present time, there is rather a scarcity of wool than an abundance, so that not only the s hearings of this year (1845 are sold rapidly, but even the old stocks which had accumulated are disposed 300 X. of; and, in the second place, it is und enable, that when wool formerly was thought to be in abundance, it was only in consequence of the prices being too high, which had the effect of limiting the consumption and making room for the surplus. But as soon as prices return to their right level, in just proportion to all other produce, the consumption immediately increases again, and the old stocks are cleared out. The present increased demand for wool, indeed, according to some, is owing partly to the deficiency of production in the sterile year 1842, and partly to the favorable turn of commercial affairs. Both certainly had great effect, although the true explanation of that enlarged demand is found in the fact that the consumption has again increased, in consequence of the lowered prices of the raw material. We now propose to compare the production and consumption of wool in other countries besides Germany. The most extensive consumer of wool, as is well known, is England. Enormous are the quantities which she imports every year, as may be seen from the lists of importation, and yet what she raises by her own sheep breeding, is even of far greater extent. Compared therewith, the large wool consumption of Germany, indeed, appears to be only trifling. This being the case, an increase of production in this or that country, is not of so much consequence, as long as political or mercantile events do not exercise an unfavorable influence upon manufactures and commerce. For example, Australia now produces and exports to the English market 30 to 40,000 bales every year; although this is a considerable quantity, yet in the great consumption, and with the constantly increasing manufactures, it is of no such great effect as might be supposed from its amount. In France and Belgium the consumption of wool is on the increase; on the other hand, its production is limited, especially so in the latter country. Hence both countries have to go abroad for supplies, and in the first place they apply to Germany. All the remaining states of Europe, at the present position which their, manufactures occupy, do not meet their own demand of woollen goods, and they indirectly continue tributary to the manufacturing countries by their demand of wool, although they pay this tribute unnecessarily by the raw material. Of the wool producing countries I will mention only those which do not consume entirely what they produce of the raw material, but export a large portion thereof, and which consequently turn the scale both as to the production and the trade of wool. Of Germany, I have already spoken. There remain only these five countries to speak of, viz: Pain, Hungary, Russia, Polynesia and North America. Taken together, these countries represent the principal wool production of the globe. Whether in time to come some provinces of Asia may likewise join, only the future can tell, though we think the time is not far off. The enormous extent of the consumption of wool, as also the probability of its future increase, has been shown, and we have seen that the question is not so much whether the production will exceed the demand, as whether there is reason to believe that there will always be sufficient production to meet the demand. We have therefore to examine to what extent, in the course of time, the production can attain. Respecting Germany, I have already expressed my doubts in regard to a considerable further enlargement of her wool production. The quantity cannot be extended there without interfering with other agricultural deux. Doc . No. .3801mands, so that nothing more can be done than to improve the quality his course we must continue to pursue steadily and uniformly, in order not to impede others, nor to be disturbed in our own course. Such being the circumstances, other wool growing countries have little to apprehend from us, because the customers for our wool would buy none or on i :the of theirs. The question, however, whether in regard to our wool there is the right proportion between production and consumption, and whether this will remain so for the time to come, may be answered in the affirmative without any hesitation whatever. For, with the increase of culture and civilization, the demand for fine fabrics increases, and hence also that of improved wool; accordingly if there were room for any apprehension, it would be much rather for that of an imminent scarcity than abundance. Still there is no cause for such apprehension, since the production of improved wool is on the increase also in other countries besides Germany, and although this be on a small scale only, it will suffice to make up for the deficiency. As regards Pain, we will first glance at her past and her present condition, before venturing to draw any conclusions as to her future production of wool, and as to the weight she is to throw in the scale of the general wool production. In former times, as is well known, Pain was the only country that produced mere no wool. The once watched this golden branch of national industry with such zeal and care that the export of mere no sheep was made a capital crime; time has since changed, and later events have done away with that measure, and so completely has Pain lost her monopoly, that, at present she occupies only the second rank in the production of super fine and super excellent wool nay, she has even made attempts at renewing and improving her much deteriorated mere no breed by breeds obtained from Germany. Although this can only have been an experiment, since for a thorough procedure of the kind, some few head would amount to nothing, yet it affords us at least this satisfaction, that we have overtaken the mother country of the mere no sheep, and that, with our way of proceeding, we not only need not fear to be out run, but are quite certain to gain still the more advantage of her. Political convulsions have deprived Pain of her golden flee ce, and she will find it hard to recover the same. Still, we should not feel too secure, for Pain, a century back, likewise, did not dream that her great treasure could be purloined. :the materials she still possesses in her flocks, although these have degenerated, and been mixed with foreign blood, and nothing more is necessary than that a great man rise up to make of them what they might be. The has for this the great advantage of her exquisite pastures, and we need only recollect, how, among some flocks in Germany, which by ignorance or carelessness, had sunk from their high standard, all wishes and hopes were brought in being, when the right man was found to do it. As regards Pain, the German wool growers should keep this constantly before their minds, since that is the quarter from which most danger threatens, for, I must repeat it, our country has not to dread the over production of foreign countries, but the possible event that some one of them should produce a like quality. Moreover, also, the quantity of the wool production of Pain is capable of the most capacious increase, notwithstanding the repeal of the mine sta" and no doubt it will acquire an immense extent, after the political convulsions shall have ceased and have made room for a more stable or dr of t gig s 302 X. which in the course of time will revive industry and commerce in all branches, and will develop e facts that may startle many countries. Hungary has very often been pointed out to our wool growers, as the country of rivals most to be dreaded. This is certainly no mere imagination, if we consider, that the qualities already offered by her in the market compare well with the best German wools. In the yearly exhibition of merinowool, at Vienna, where, ordinarily, none but the most select of all the highly improved flocks are sent, several specimens from Hungary, were not only found to be fully equal to the best, but were near being preferred a g the superior. It is true, only single sheep bleeders have met with such brilliant success; still, it at least. shows, what the country may be able to do, after experience and intelligence shall have become more general in this branch of industry. My familiarity with the subject, and the great importance which it has for Germany, will justify me in devoting to this country more attention than to any of the rest. The agriculture of Hungary and the countries belonging thereto, in general, and according to appearances, favors very greatly the breeding of sheep. The large possessions owned by some of the "magnates" and the healthy pastures very much encourage sheep breeding upon as extensive a scale as is found here. I to extent is a ready greater than is known abroad. Statistical tables being not much thought of there, and the large proprietors being the sovereign rulers of their possessions and having great dislike to being watched, it is extremely difficult to obtain a correct view of the entire stock of sheep kept in that country. Hence it is that the estimates vary sa greatly, and that, while some speak of only eight millions of sheep, others estimate them at twelve millions, and even more. The latter estimate, no doubt, is by far nearer the truth than the former, although, even this, I think to be too low, rather than too high. For my own part, I think that Hungary and the territories adjoining, number nearly fifteen millions of sheep Only a small portion of them are of the full blood, but those of the half bloods are very numerous. The fact, that on the imperial estates of Holitschand . Mannersdorf, the first mere no sheep were placed, that the empress, Maria Theresa, had brought to the country, procured the "magnates" a convenient opportunity for improving their flocks; indeed, sheep breeding soon came to be regarded as a matter of honor. Large sums were expended upon mere no bucks, and the time is well remembered yet, when one out bid the other in an almost incredible manner. Such was effected thereby, though not all. The original country sheep, which very nearly resembled the back el, .are so much improved, that from their offspring a wool is obtained which, in the wool markets, in a great measure, is counted among the lower middling sorts of improved wool. The prices, indeed, are not high, when compared to those we receive for our German product still they pay well, when we consider the local relations of Hungary. They are, according to their treatment and degree of improvement, from 55 to 100 florids, Vienna currency, (about 25 to     $50.) The very low sorts, to which, also belongs the back el wool, are here of no account, since they cannot, in any way, compete with the German wool. The question now is, whether those middling sorts, in case a higher improvement of the flocks should succeed, might not advance so much as to compete with the German middling sorts? It is easy to answer this question, and the reply must be given in the affirmative, the more so, since the better ones of them do so already. For the Austriangerman manufacturer, X. a. 33 long since used them, and the fabrics made of them, are just as good as those from the common German middling sorts. The better treatment, in washing and s hearing, has, of late, done much to make those Hungarian wools better liked; and to this circumstance it must be attributed, that the markets of Yes th are attended by English, French and Dutch customers, which was not the case. They make somewhat extensive purchases, and if the reaction upon the German markets, and their stocks of middling wools, is no more felt, it is owing to the generally increased demand. The danger that threatens Germany, as may be seen by the failure just noticed, is not, then, so very great; although a very considerable extension of production, which, though not likely, is at all events, possible in Hungary, might cause a depression of prices, in consequence of the supplies too largely accumulation g in the market. Still, even in this respect there is little cause of uneasiness, as shown by the increasing consumption. Met, how is it with the better, especially the finest qualities? According to fair reasoning, what several persons have succeeded in doing, cannot be considered an impossible task to others. And if, even in the present case, this should not apply to a whole country, since all parts are not favorable to highly improved sheep breeding, the conclusion, at any rate, may be realized in those parts where there is no natural impediment and where highly improved flocks already exist, and furnish actual proof that their thriving there is not impossible. However, in order to raise mere no sheep, we require, not only a favorable soil, but there is also another important requisite, viz: intellect. There appears to be a much greater deficiency in this latter respect, in Hungary, than in Germany. This alone, accounts for the fact, that Hungary, although the mere no sheep were introduced there at a much earlier period than. in Germany, and although her pastures are so extensive, so well adapted and so cheap, has, nevertheless, only a very limited number of highly improved flocks. One might suppose, that in the course of time, these flocks would be followed by many others, and that the quantity of highly improved wool would be much increased in Hungary; yet I do not think this at all likely. For, in the long space of time since mere no sheep have been raised, their breed, (notwithstanding the extensive pecuniary resources and the physical advantages which the country offers) has made so little progress, that, unless unexpected favorable changes should take place, the wool production of Germany, indeed, has little to dread the progress in Hungary. Met it will certainly be best for us not to think of it too lightly; we must continually watch the wool growers of Hungary, in order not to be unexpectedly surprised. As the circumstances are, Hungary, in any case, will retain a very great influence upon the wool production and trade of Germany, which is much more likely to extend than to decrease. However, while things remain in their present state, there is certainly less danger than there would be if that country should awake and foster trades and manufactures, which would not only enable the people themselves, to work up the raw material raised by them, but would deliver them, also, from the tribute hitherto paid to us. Our wool production, indeed, would not suffer thereby; our wool trade, on the other hand, would be deprived of a considerable, gain, and so would, likewise, our manufactures, and more especially, those in the Austrian states, would be loses; they would be deprived of the very convenient opportunity of obtaining a great part of the required raw material j and their business would become. very 304 X. much limited. Accordingly, if any country presents gloomy prospects for the German wool production and wool trade, as far as the future is concerned, it is Hungary, above all. But even here, I confess, I cannot discern any great danger. Hungary, in my opinion, as to the increase and improvement of sheep breeding, if I may judge her by the past and the present, will not run in advance of the age, and scarcely be able to keep up with it, and consequently she will have to offer scarcely so much wool as the increasing demand is entitled to calculate upon as her due share. Russia, whose government in every way endeavors and strives to extend and strengthen her colossal empire, has lately made gigantic efforts in behalf of all the branches of her productions, and also devotes particular attention to the production of wool. Russia, which, though very thinly populated, in extent equals all the rest of Europe taken together, finds it easiest, and is obliged to favor most those productions which require the smallest number of hands. Of this description, is cattle breeding and more especially, in the breeding of sheep, an uncommonly small number of hands is requisite, one man being sufficient for several hundred head. Hence, even from this point of view, the country would have to favor the breeding of sheep, even if it were not done from considerations of national industry, which render it a duty of the government to labor for the highest possible increase of the value of such produce. In the part of government, as well as of private persons, much has already been done in behalf of the introduction and spread of sheep, and the production of wool increases rapidly. Although Germany is not affected thereby, directly, yet, indirectly, she is so; and the orders given by England, in Russia, for wool, have already illustrated this practically. It is a question of deep interest to us, therefore, what will be the probable development in Russia. We might feel secure, in the contemplation of the fact to which I alluded above, viz: that some of the Russian manufacturers, at present, buy the most excellent hearing from Silesian, and resting upon this, we might take no further notice .what is going on in the wool production of Russia: still, such carelessnesmightgive rise to bad results. In order, then, not to run that risk, we had better ascertain her present circumstances, and draw our conclusions therefrom, with regard to her wool production, and derive from it some good lessons. He who has judgment, and can claim an opinion on such topics, cannot deny, that in Russia, sheep breeding is capable of being indefinitely extended, and that a great beginning towards it has been made already. Now, what will be the effect upon the wool production and the wool trade of Germany, should Russia continue the course she has commenced? He can answer this question by the same reply we gave in reference to Hungary, viz: As to quality, according to all appearances, she will never reach us, although, in regard to quantity, she may, hereafter, become our most powerful rival in the European wool market. The arguments which can be referred to, in support of this view, in a few words, are these n the first place, lands, and consequently, pastures for flocks, exist in great abundance and are of great extent in Russia, but neither their natural, industrial or economical condition is such as to render them, throughout, fit for improved sheep, or in one word, healthy pastures. In the second place, there is, at present, a want of experienced and able sheep bleeders, and so too, of capable sheep masters, under whose guidance the flocks could prosper and rapidly be developed in their improvement, X. a. 305SFor this reason, sheep bleeders will have to content themselves for a great length of time, if not forever, with a wool product, which we reckon among the lower and middling sorts, and which, in no way impedes us in our production of the finest wool. In the third place, the demand for wool, in Russia, increases in the same ratio as the production. To this we must add, that more particularly, in the southern provinces, where the greatest activity is displayed for the improvement of sheep breeding, there occur, not rarely, un productive years, (as, for example, in the case of unusual dear th) which prove ruinous to the flocks, and much reduce them, and always throw them so far back, that it requires many years again for them to regain the stand they had before attained. According to the foregoing, then, the German wool production has to dread from Russia, far less than it may have the appearance of at first sight. In like manner, also, the German wool trade will be affected in that quarter, neither particularly nor un favorably. For but a small quantity of their fabrics will find its way to Germany, except such as come from Poland; and the wool they can spare for export, will be shipped much more conveniently to England, France and Netherlands. After having dwelt at length upon those European countries which are competitors with Germany, both in the wool production and the wool trade, and which will continue to be so even to a greater degree for the future, we proceed now to speak of those other parts of the globe, which deserve our special attention, namely, Polynesia and North America. It is now about forty years since the wool production of the English colonies of New South Tales, was mentioned for the first time by the public journals. At that time the German wool had acquired for itself a high reputation, began to be sought after and brought good prices. The English envied their German competitors who had come forward simultaneously with them upon the German wool market and with a view to comfort themselves, and to keep down the opinion of the German wool growers, they circulated the assertion, that within twenty years they could grow the entire amount of wool they required, and more especially the finer qualities, heretofore obtained from foreign countries, in their own colonies, and thus they would become independent of foreign countries. Nearly thirty years have elapsed since then, yet to this hour, the menace has not been realized. The quantity which they yearly receive from their colonies, has been enlarged considerably, yet in no larger proportion than that in which the wool consumption of England, in general, has increased, and the quantity of wool England buys from the Continent of Europe is the same as heretofore. I tis a fact of no little consequence that to the present time (1845) all attempts made to raise even the smallest quantities of mere no wool, have failed, although the greatest pains have been taken, to make it successful and although mere no sheep have been brought over from Europe; hence the demand has to be supplied from Germany, at least at present, and not unlikely for all time to come. Even if there were no other evidence for it than that which is contained in the prices, the proof would be complete. Thus for example, the price hitherto paid in England for Polynesian wool [australian. has not been higher than from 9 pence to 2 shillings per pound, or from 30 to 66 thalers, equal to 21 to        $46 per cut, a price at which scarcely the lowest German middling sorts can be had in England; especially, if it be considered that they cost originally in Germany more than 50 thalers20306 X. equal to           $35) per cut; and consequently must amount to more than 60 thalers (a(       $42) when brought to the English market. In regard to the Polynesian wool, it must be observed that its quality is much lowered by the pastures; these being too rich, and also by improper treatment. It should also be mentioned here, that in Polynesia the flock s sometimes greatly suffer from mortality, so much so that their growth and increase seems to be limited to certain fixed boundaries. For it is a well known fact, that sometimes entire flocks die off; a <a name="loss42"><mark>loss</mark></a> which is felt there so much the more, since it is not easy to buy new ones. It has been asserted that the lands fit for sheep breeding, are of indefinite extent in Polynesia. But later reports have shown, that although there is abundance of soil, even without an owner to it, the lands that can be used for sheep breeding, are not by any means of unlimited extent. At all events so much appears to be certain, that Germany has nothing to fear for her wool production and her wool trade from Polynesia; for the present we are content with the evidence given by the fact that our wool continues to be as much sought after as formerly, when no attention whatever, was paid to thePolynesian wool. In fact the function of the Polynesian wool is only this, that it serves to supply the deficiency which otherwise would arise, since the other wool growing countries, would not be able fully to keep up with the rapid increase of the consumption. Finally we have to speak of North America. It might well be supposed that in a country, so much advanced, both in a political and industrial point of view, as the United States, a branch of business so exceedingly well, suited to their agriculture, could not have escaped their attention. And indeed it is not so very recently, that they have commenced paying regard to it. However, nearly every where in the United States, the experiments which have been made, were attended by no very bright result. For it ha seen found that the sheep, and more especially the highly improved sheep, do not last well in America, and so too that the wool grown in .america by the German sheep does not at all compare with that grown in Germany. German farmers soon knew how to explain the phenomenon by the fact, that rich and luxurious lands like the American prairies are poorly qualified for sheep especially for highly improved sheep, and they have maintained that the land would not be adapted for sheep breeding, until its too great richness is in some degree diminished by continued cultivation. Moreover, the greatest exertions are being made in North America for, establishing improved flocks, and for improving and increasing those which are already there. Now and then mere no sheep are sent from Germany but as to these it is as with all others sent abroad, viz: not the very best to be found in Germany, are sent, although the prices paid are high. Add to this the heavy losses which are inseparable from a distant travel, and whereby the cost of those brought over safely is much enhanced. I f, with such risk, and with so great efforts, there is no better success in prospect than has been heretofore, and as it will continue for a great length of time, it may confidently be expected that the taste for it will decrease, and that, for the next future, enterprises of the kind will not extend very far. What I have said here, must not be taken as merely consolatory; for it is founded in truth. To be sure also in America, as in several other countries, for example, in Hungary, Russia, and even in Polynesia, it is chiefly our countrymen, viz: the Germans, who cultivate this branch and endeavor to x. a. 307 render themselves useful by spreading in those countries the knowledge and experience acquired in our "fatherland However, being nothing but mortal men, they cannot conquer impediments made by nature, and which can be overcome only by time and united efforts. For the present, I think, America will find it to be a sufficient task to make herself independent of Europe with respect to part of her demand of the raw material; but to think of soon producing so much wool, as to be able to export it, would be an idea altogether too bold to excite any thing but a smile of the Germans. In speaking of the wool production of North America we notice for the present only the quantity, ca ring less for the quality. Even the common sheep thrives there in particularly favorable years, upon pastures and under circumstances as above described; while in less favorable years the number of those that perish, is enormous. To wonder, then, that this is so much the more the case with improved sheep. While they are treated with the utmost vigilance and care, as rare animals, it will do -very well. But this is practicable only with a very limited stock, and is so no longer with its larger increase which brings with it all the calamities alluded to. Without therefore, entering into further details, I may proceed to draw my conclusion which is this: North .america will require our wool for along time, till she can meet the demand of her own woollen manufactures, which are on the increase, and flourish well; and hence, instead of exporting wool to Europe, she will have to import from Europe, for a great length of time. We can therefore read with perfect calmness the accounts coming from America, and which assure us that the breeding of sheep makes much progress, and at no distant day, will supply not merely the domestic, but furnish even a surplus, for export. The comparison, then, between production and consumption furnishes the following result: " As heretofore, the production has continued so very far from surpassing the consumption that it does not even come up to it ; so much so that even at this time an increase of flocks is desirable, which (as is evident) will be the case only in a still greater d degree in future, since with the growth of population, the consumption of wool must increase in the same proportion." This shows that the future prospects of the wool business are very bright. However it must not be supposed, that extravagant prices can be calculated upon; because then, as was shown above, other kinds of materials are used, which limit the consumption of wool, and soon produce the effect of lowering its price, whereas low prices increase the consumption and insure its production.

Xvi   .requisite qualities of Fool for manufacturing purposes. Of the superiority and varieties of German Fool will commence by stating the qualities required of wool for the purposes of manufacturing. It must be healthy, i. e. produced by a healthy sheep; for, if otherwise, it lacks strength, and in the violent process it has to go through, it will go to pieces. The cases, where for certain fabrics weak and feeble wool is sought after, constitute merely an exception to the rule. Furthermore, it must be nervous, for it then possesses greater strength, and is more elastic, so that its hair is finer and make a the fabric to last better, which of course renders this wool highly appreciated by the manufacturers, as it ensures them their old customers, and procures them new ones. Again, it must be tender and fine. To what degree these qualities maybe requisite, depends upon the kind of manufactures for which the wool is used. For a wool which is fine in the view of one manufacturer, may not even be middling in that of another. With some manufacturers it is not exactly fine ness that they desire, but they require of the common wool which they use for their fabrics, a certain plan cy and tenderness, which make it work easier and produce a better species of goods. And that is what they call fine ness, it being all that is requisite for their purposes. To too, it must not have grown un health fully. This comprises the two extremes, viz. the sickly and the luxurious growth. Both are faulty and lessen the value of the wool. It likewise must be neither too long. nor too short. This has often been discussed. In the history of the breeding of mere no sheep we meet with several periods, where sometimes progress was made in one respect, and then a retro grade motion ensued. Originally great length was viewed as best. This was advantageous for the sheep breeder, because it gave him a heavier weight of flee ce. When the opposite extreme became predominant, and "the shorter the better" was the prevailing view. Moreover, at the same time a high degree of fine ness was the grand object. The high prices raid for a wool of this kind, made up for the small weight of the flee ce. Thus arose the state of scant i ness of wool in many of the flocks, from which they can be rescued only by a skilful conduct. Finally, it must be well treated, during the time of its growth, as well a sat the washing and s hearing. It is the treatment whereby the secret, for the greater part, must be explained, why the wool of Germany, and especially of some of the German states has so decided preference over that of other countries. This is so much the case, that the wool of the very same sheep which furnish in Germany an eminently fine and: valuable product, on their being transplanted to other countries can scarcely be recognised and is hardly worth half its former value. The so called Country wool" i. e. very common wool, has become quite rare in Germany, and in some parts it has disappeared altogether. I t needs not to be questioned whether the breeding of sheep has been, and still is, benefit ted by the complete extinction of the common country sheep. For now that Germany can furnish the wool which is called common wool, although even this is an improved quality, at the same price which formerly was paid for country wool, no man can have a doubt whether he would prefer wearing fine cloth, when he can have it at the same price as a common and coarse one. There are none but the fur rivers and persons fond of help skin fur who would raise any objection. That- improved wool must x. a. 309 have great preferences over the common, is a self evident proposition. I t not only furnishes a fabric more agreeable to the consumer, but the cloth made of it is also more dura be. It is not likely then that, in consequence of the progress of improved sheep breeding in Germany, common wool should disappear entirely, nor would a result such as that be desirable. For, if it ever should come to pass, they would suffer in their own wool trade, and would have to supply their wants (as e. g. soldier cloth) from abroad, which would injure their domestic manufacturing interests. It is now (1845) not fully ten years since long carded wool became the subject of much discussion, and was highly commended as the proper means to effect, to some extent, a restriction of the over production of shortmerino wool, in case some of the wool growers should give up the latter and commence raising the former. The expectations indulged in, however, were disappointed in some measure, and it must be of interest to ascertain, how it came to be so. This will teach us at the same time, whether, the production of fine carded wool has any chance of becoming a general and more profitable business. About twelve years ago, several spinning mills for carded woollen yarn were established in Germany. They did a splendid business, they were not even able to execute all the orders they received, and sometimes they were in greatest want of the raw material, not having been supplied sufficient y with wool of the requisite length. To sooner had this become known among wool growers than the resolution was adopted, to produce wool of that length, the hope having been entertained that a rewarding rise would be paid for the wool, if it be grown by mere no sheep. 'the subject was also debated in the sessions of the Agricultural society of Vienna, and in consequence thereof several wool growers made attempts which, indeed, turned out quite satisfactory. Still it soon met with unforeseen obstructions, some of which we may specify here n the first place, in the flocks with which the experiment had been i made, there were many retro trading to the original blood, that is to say, they relapsed again into producing short wool, and which it became necessary constantly to remove, in order fairly to consolidate it. Thus, the number did not increase, and it was impossible to furnish the wool in as large quantities as spinners desired. The demand for it, therefore, remained very limited and the price too low. In the second place, long wool sheep require particularly rich pastures which, in the present state of agriculture, do not exist in Germany to an extent such as to feed large flocks. In some foreign countries, on the other hand, as in Hungary and Polynesia, they exist abundantly, so that enormous flocks can be fed ; and those two countries have such vast advantage over Germany that the Germans would be unable to compete with them, but for the superior quality of their wool. This, however, cannot well be expected in the case of their carded wool, because, owing to the want of such pastures it does not possess the great length, and more especially not that laxity or slackness which in such wool is essentially requisite to make it fully adapted to the purposes for which it is used. For, in a like manner as one of the principal merits of mere no wool is its flexibility, i. e. the power f con tr acting itself, when the wool, worked up to cloth, comes to be fulled4the opposite quality is one of the chief requisites in carded wool, because the, goods made of the latter are smooth and must have no (a( cover" as it is called 810 X. a. In the third place, the price paid for such carded wool, is not so high as fully to reward the trouble and the sacrifice it requires. Some wool growers had been of opinion that a real carded mere no wool must be a highly valuable product, because they thought that, from its superior quality, the stuffs made of it would be preferred in many cases to silk. This expectation, however, has not been fully realized, principally because the anticipated perfection and beauty has never been attained. The natural flexibility of mere no wool presents one of the chief impediments to changing it into a perfect carded wool. For this reason it can succeed only in those countries where the pastures and climates are such as to lessen the flexibility of the wool, as is the case with Hungary and Polynesia. From the similarity of the American pastures to those of Hungary and Polynesia, it may be assumed a prior i that the same result will be obtained in this country. Still although the attempts to produce carded mere no wool, were not attended by a very bright success in Germany, the hope of succeeding in the end, by perseverance, is not by any means relinquished. I do not mean to say that such wool will be grown throughout Germany, but that it will become and remain a production merely of single provinces. I will mention only two in which it already exists on an extensive scale, viz, Bohemia and Mecklenburgh. In the mountainous portion of Bohemia are very large pastures similar to those in Hungary, and improved sheep are found there, whose wool, by the average of entire flocks, after one years growth measures a length of from two and a half to three inches, and which, accordingly, answers well for the comb, particularly because its curves are flat, which puts the right limits to its flexibility. Any of the owners of such f locks hardly know what a wool they produce; they let the thing go its own course, and are well satisfied with the regular and ready customers they find. By devoting full attention to the subject, they un doubtingly could arrive at a higher degree of perfection and would increase their income; for, the wool produced would be better fit for use and would be more valuable, and then again the quantity produced would be larger, inasmuch as the product would have greater length. At present the carded wool in the wool trade of Germany plays too much of a secondary part. In Bohemia it is not distinguished and separated from the other sorts, until it is stored up in the warehouses of the wool dealers, before being sold to the customers. In Mecklenburgh it heretofore was exclusively in the hands of some few wool dealers, who, assuredly must have made a profitable business of it. Should this wool be produced on a larger scale, and be introduced into the wholesale traffic, so that more persons become engaged in it and will be in search of it than at present, its price would soon increase, and wool growers bestow upon it greater care and attention, which, no doubt, must have the effect of securing a rapid progress in its production, both as to quantity and quality. By its production, the field of wool growing is much enlarged in Germany, and a wider territory opened for the wool trade, both of which must serve to improve the future prospects of one as well as the other. Xvi   I .in Agricultural Schoolsthe most celebrated agricultural schools of Germany are those of Hohenhiem in Wurttemberg, of Schleisshiem in Bavaria, of Tharandt in Saxony, of Lies berg near Wiesbaden in Pass au, and of Moegelin in Russia. It was one of the principal objects of my voyage to visit some of the sex. a. 311 schools; and being at Berlin, so near to Moegelin, (about thirty English miles) I set out to visit the resting place of father Her (as he is called among the husbandmen of Germany) and his school, where many an eminent agriculturists has been educated. Waitly by rail road, and partly by stage, I reached Moegelin, which lies a short distance from the public way. As we approached it, the horses could scarcely pull the vehicle through the sand; and I could not well conceive how it was, that Her had chosen such a sterile region, too poor for the growth of pine, for an experimental farm. On Her, the son of the celebrated agriculturists, was absent; but one of the professors received me very kindly, and offered me a room in the building where the pupils lodge, which I had to accept as there was no other lodging house on the place. I found the pupils busily engaged in packing up m as the time of vacation had commenced, and several had already gone. I dined with them, at the family table of On Her, and r ambled with some of them through the fields, farm yard, and its extensive buildings. The number of pupils this year was twenty, and never exceeds that number; they were all grown, and sons of rich gentlemen. The next day Vonthier returned. I found in him a well informed, exceedingly obliging and polite gentleman. I passed with him many hours, in conversation upon various subjects of agriculture, especially on breeding me rings; and he presented me with several specimens of his best wool; laid before me thepedigrees of his mere no flocks; at the office, he explained to me his mode of keeping books by double entry, whereby every branch has its debit and credit, kept in perfect order and great accuracy, and continually open to the inspection of the pupils. He allowed me to take sketches of some of his best rams and eyes, which I did with great care, in order to give a true representation of the form of that breed, as it is just now thought the most advantageous. I say just now, because there is in this, like as in every thing else, a little of humbug among sheep bleeders of this part of Germany. During the time I was occupied in drawing, his upper shepherd, (schafmeister) gave me many details of the management of their f locks. I visited the artificial meadows, which are irrigated from a pond not far from the estate; collected on that matter all the information I could which I give under different chapters, in order to avoid repetition and bring every thing within the space of a few pages. Her selected this barren tract to show what knowledge, perseverance and a well regulated system can effect. Moegelin lies on an extensive sandy plain, the soil producing only through rich maturing and judicious rotation of crops. The sheep are fed upon artificial pastures, which in dry seasons yield scarcely food enough. Potatoes are raised in great quantity, which are fed to sheep and cattle during the winter. A great many of them are likewise distilled. Throughout the north of Germany potatoes form the principal fallow crop, and are used for whiskey, the slop of which is given, to cows and sheep. This is a decidedly unnatural food for the latter; but in these districts, where land is poor and scarce, they are obliged to manage in some forced way to keep their sheep through the winter. It is not very advantageous for the wool; and when it is given in too great quantities, it injures the growth and quality of the flee ce. Her has, as a matter of course, good implements, threshing machines, &c; fine cattle, and a choice 4 lock of mere no sheep. Round him is nothing for show, but every thing312Ex. for use and profit. The buildings have the same character, and are not remarkable for their beauty, but strong and well arranged. The institute stands apart from the other buildings, and contains, besides the rooms for the pupils, the lecture room, a collection of models of agricultural implements, (among which I' observed a good many Russian ploughs a philosophical apparatus, a laboratory, a herbarium, &c. The celebrated Albrecht Daniel Hair, the father of the present proprietor, was born in 1752, at While, in Hanover. His father was a physician. At the University of Goettingen he finished his medical studies, and afterwards practised medicine in his native place. In 1786, he married the daughter of a nobleman, one 'miss On Well ich. The garden attached to his house, where he amused himself with cultivating flowers, gave rise to his agricultural celebrity; the taste for the culture of flowers led him gradually to that of agriculture; he bought a larger lot of sixteen acres, and executed on it his plans. It was soon the attraction of every body, for the collection of rare plants and beautiful walks, fine orchards, and the different kinds of c lover and grass. His success in the culture of various plants, stimulated him to buy a more extensive tract of land. About that time, just when he was at the point of giving up his profession and devoting his time to agriculture alone, he received from London his patent, as physician to his majesty George the Third. This honor came unexpectedly, and he could not withdraw himself at once from his profession, but began by degrees to resign his practice, and continued his favorite occupation, the improvement of agriculture, with the view of establishing an experimental farm. He paid great attention to the culture of herb age fodder, root crops, and especially potatoes; which latter root he most vehemently defended against its numerous adversaryes and assailants. His work on English husbandry appeared soon after, and was well received in Germany and in England. His fame as an agriculturists who applied science to practice, spread over all Europe. His plan of establishing a school was at last executed, and attracted many visitors of distinction. The king of Russia was exceedingly anxious to have Hers services, invited him to reside within his kingdom, and granted him the following advantages: 1. Nomination as a member of the Academy of Sciences 2. A grant of four hundred acres of land; 3. The privilege of selling the land, and all the privileges attached to a landed estate belonging to a nobleman, in case he should buy another estate; 4. Protection to his academy; 5. Entire liberty of the press in regard to his Agricultural Journal 6. Permission to practice his profession as a physician; 7. His nomination as or ivy counsellor. These privileges and honors were too tempting He accepted the kings offer, and left Belle for Berlin; took possession of the 400 acres; sold it immediately, and bought the present landed estates Mbegelin, and obtained all the privileges of a nobleman. It was in June, 1804, that he took possession of Moegelin. The <a name="loss43"><mark>loss</mark></a> of his f locks by <a name="rot21"><mark>rot</mark></a> and the French wars, were great calamities, especially in the commencement of his operations; but he conquered all difficulties by perseverance; and in 1806 the academy was opened. Twenty pupils inscribed their names immediately; the number increased with every year. He distinguished himself in the improvement of wool; his flocks were superior to any in Russia. His written works increased his fame, and the sovereigns of Russia, Russia and many others sent him their orders of knight hood. Ex. a. 81 3 purchased additional property for his younger son Albrecht, the present proprietor of Moegelin, who was entirely devoted to agricultural pursuits. I n the year 1828, he had a severe attack of rheumatism, and his health began to decline; in 1827, his eye sight failed entirely. His sufferings were great, but he bore them with fortitude and resignation, and at last, on the 28th of October, 1828, death put an end to his pains. Shiver was the first who arranged the existing facts and theory of agriculture in a proper system. His works are highly valued among all agriculturists, and referred to as a magazine of solid truths. The Germans paid due homage to this great man while living, and have not overlooked, as to post humour honors, him who had rendered such great services to his country and to mankind in general. His statue stands among those of all the great men of Germany. Her is buried in his i garden, opposite the family dwelling, on the shore of a small clear pond, among the trees which he planted himself, "his children" as he called them. His tomb is under the eves of a chapel. To cold, huge block of marble tells you that here lies father Shiver; but above his grave rises a pyramid of flowers which with their fragrance arrest the attention of visitors, and point with their rich colored petals to the grave, where the man lies who loved them, and who spent his life among them, watching their mysterious habits, to catch a glimpse of the Great Others secret operations. Over his grave the ornaments of natures rich temple mourn for their departed friend. His con sort lies by his side surrounded by shrubs and trees. On Thiers Agricultural Schoolthier says, in the programme of his agricultural school, that the object of his institution is to educate capable superintendents, or directors for large estates: but that he cannot call any one a capable director, who has only the skill to carry out a mode of farming in an invitation or borrowed manner: that he understands by a capable director, a man who can, with a clear discern men, enhance the value of a landed estate entrusted to him so far as circumstances of condition and situation allow it. A capable director will propose the object to be attained and which maybe profitable, prudently, circumspectly, with an exact regard to all the internal and outward relations; and then, prepared with practised eye and tact, rise from one step to another, firm and sure, to the proposed height of culture and productive ness. That in such a course of operations, every visionary scheme and every restless change from one thing to another is to be avoided, is self evident. But if we now enquire further, as to the material and elements which are considered necessary to educate any one to such a capacity, it is needful first that the agriculturists should understand the general rudiments of all industrial intercourse and those also which belong to the general economy of the state; and these so much the more, as he will always be dependent upon the same. He is obliged, therefore, to fit himself to discern how his own landed estate is related to the whole country; how its politic o social relations and the conjectures of trade may check or aid, operate favorably or disastrously upon his enterprises and their results. Hence he can easily learn to judge, also, how the particular situation of a farm, the nearness or distance of the market, the thoroughfares of trade, the exchange of manufactures, and the present value of money represented by the rate of interest, and, also, by that of the productive ness of mercantile or industrial capital, may impart a greater or less value to his landed property. These will, therefore, be particularly considered, in the exposition of the general 314 X. doctrine of trade, which treats of the value of capital, the price of products, and the cost of labor. While thus the agriculturists is led, as it were, from without to the internal economy of landed property, he must further be so prepared, that he can judge not only of the soil on the same, and the materials contained in it, but also the given degree of richness, and the fit culture. I t cannot also escape him, what influences the circumstances of the region exert on vegetable and animal development; and still less ought he to be unacquainted with the physical and moral circumstances of the inhabitants of a country under his inspection and examination. If we imagine, finally, the agriculturists as in the conduct and management of the farm himself, then we wish him furnished, not only with knowledge but also with ability. He must not only be mentally educated, to conceive an idea, but also be practically certain and skilled in executing it. To, that the thought may be reduced to reality, he must be possessed of a rapid, sharp, sure perception and skill, and with an extensive knowledge of the particular business, instruments, and modes of operation, in the practice of his profession. The agriculturists must, as much as is possible, unite in his own person, the knowledge of art and the manual skill of his branch of business. The more this is the case the clearer view he can obtain over the whole of the farming operations so much deeper insight will he have into the particular parts of the same, into the relation which they bear to each other, the agencies subordinate to himself, and the instruments of the whole system. To look through this system correctly and regulate it, the agriculturists needs only the aid of a properly arranged and carefully executed mode of keeping accounts: for as, according to the expression of Her the elder" Account keeping is the A B C of every trade" so. it is Wholly and especially the alphabet of agricultural enterprise. Through it, only, the results obtained have a certainty, the relation of the various branches to the whole are represented by numbers; the cause and effect, the means and result, the deficiency and the surplus, are reduced to figures and expressed in money value. As the agriculturists is, and continues in an always progressive intercourse with nature and its life; so those scenes are of aid to him, which give him an insight into the powers of nature, its influence on the success or failure of agricultural enterprise, the facility of developing these powers and influences of nature so as to regulate them according to his own wishes as far as it can be done. Hence, it follows, that the knowledge drawn from the domain of the natural sciences ought not to be wanting, in the complete education of the future director: [steward, or manager, or overseer, as we call him in this country] As it has been shown how the material and elements must act together, to educate a thorough and an able agriculturists it seems to us, also, that we have, at the same time, shown that while we have in view, as the immediate object of our school, this forming of thorough farmers, we must not limit the object within a narrow space; but make the training which accomplished the general purpose, such as will enable a young man of a good preliminary education, sound parts and due application, to search still farther and acquire a high degree of information in this trade and science, by books and words. Preparatory Education of Young Pupils t is necessary to mention what are considered the elementary parts of intellectual education, and what previous knowledge is demanded and must be possessed by the pupils of the x. a. 315 institution. As to all this, an agricultural academy is in an entirely different relation to its pupils, and must require wholly different things from those which the university exacts of its students, The university instructor has to explain the subject of all the branches, and to give to his auditors a the ore tic, scientific education, with a knowledge of the nature and objects of their future profession; but he cannot exhibit to them a living view and a very presence of the trade and modes of operation of their future profession and office, proceeding from practical business. The special, practical education must be left for later years of life; and the preparations consist chiefly in isolated directions, hints and illustrations. But university instructors "can, besides, do this without apprehension ; for they know that their hearers do not at once, on leaving their lectures, enter into the full practice of future, active life, but in most cases, they are yet to be prepared, by various introduce tory steps, and by practical experience The physician makes, especially in the last years of his studies, an exception from what we have just said) An entirely opposite relation exists in the case of an instructor of the agricultural academy. His pupils in quitting him, ordinarily, do not pass through subordinate preparatory situations in their practical business; but, for the most part, enter independently, upon the full execution of their skill. Now, although no where in a so high degree as in agriculture a sound theory springs from practice, and is strengthened by it; and although no where action and thought, life and knowledge, are so vigorously combined together as in agriculture, yet the purpose of agricultural institutions is not to teach those for the first time, who were not before farmers, otherwise their scholars would be apprentices, not students, and their circle of operations would be entirely different from those which are now designed. The purpose of agricultural academies is much more properly to develop those who are already farmers, and to form them to a clear comprehension and scientific view of what they have before learned in a practical manner. Accordingly, we must not imagine the agricultural academy to impart to its pupils the first elementary knowledge and idea of their future profession but we may require of the 'academic al teacher of land culture, that he impart to the experience and views of his hearers, the greatest possible amount of his own experience and observation; and that he besides, possess the fidelity of instructing his scholars, and, by sound criticism, rendering it available to them, in the observations and experiments made by others, in various situations and circumstances. But this can then only be fully attained, when his hearers have treasured up in memory, an observation or experiment, as the standard of comparison to the given one; or at least be able to reduce it from the nearest sources, for the education of the understanding. Whoever, accordingly, thinks of appropriating to himself the full education which this institution may give, it is expected of him, besides the general intellectual education which shall place him in a situation to comprehend and prepare with ease, a scientific discourse, to have a correct view of and acquaintance with practical trade and its peculiarities, as it may be acquired in a personal attendance of one, or at least two years; and of course, if the young pupil already possesses this, so much the better. Behave practically found, among the inmates of our establishment, that only a very thorough previous intellectual education can, with the aid of much facility and application, compensate this want of preceding practical knowledge. But if a person little skilled in practical business, be placed in the 316 X. institution with the view of his becoming, by a residence of a simple year, a perfect and thorough agriculturists, who may independently and with certainty understand how to carry on a farm; then this is more (as we have said) than agricultural institutions can or will generally undertake. But it is believed, that the institution may undertake to impart to such a person, unskilled in practice, a general view of the whole domain of land culture and its various branches, as well as many particular kinds of knowledge; and the academy may be resorted to often, and not without good results, by men who are either in possession of large landed estates, or expect to be so, and who in the earlier period of their life, are strangers to agriculture, and enter it in order to acquire so much information and judgment that they may understand, in g moral, how to discriminate what course to adopt in the management of their property, and what demands they have on their stewards. In the same way, amateurs of land culture, in du ed thorough necessity, have frequently acquired a lively interest and fondness for this branch of human industry, and have gained by later observation and exercise, practical skill and experience; thus descending to agriculture, as if from above, in an inverse order from theory to* practice, from knowledge to ability. Met this method is more difficult and uncertain; and only practicable for such, as have time and means at command. Means of Education at the I institutions t has been already noticed, that no where so much as with the agriculturists, knowledge and ability, the ore tic acquaintance and practical skill, insight and circumspection, must be connected with each other and mutually cooperate. Hence it is to be desired that practical information be already possessed by the scholars; as the elements of practice, in addition to those of science, are considered to be indispensable necessary, when you aim at the complete education of the agriculturists. In this point of view, it has been already established by the form and conditions of Chairs institution, that it should be very limited in its compass: for only with a small number of pupils (it seldom exceeds twenty can there be an intercourse so various and general between teachers and pupils, as is here the case, where every teacher who lectures can, and willingly does, give explanations in what is not understood or remains obscure in his lectures. Besides, here prevails the particular regulation, that all pupils of the academy take their meals with the director a practice by means of which, intimacy and freedom of communication are formed. I t gives rise to agricultural discourse, to questions and communications in addition to the lectures of the teachers. The cultivation of the soil, in a more confined sense, the director of the institution himself reaches, who is also the proprietor of Moegelin and three other estates, lying at a distance of from one to four miles apart~ Whatever the scholars of the academy have heard in his lectures, they see carried out, in his farm, within the limits which the circumstances of time, and the situation of the farm admits; and, wherever the connexion between theory and practice, doctrine and life, remains obscure or not understood, then the daily intercourse with him gives them opportunity to acquaint themselves a swell concerning particular scientific processes, as also respecting the whole system of economy, by the explanation and elucidate on, not only of the director himself, but also of the other officers. Besides, Moegelin itself, and its agricultural as well as other kinds ofinpEx. 
317tercourse, offer likewise many auxiliary elements, which general and agricultural education at academies requires. Among these we may reckon the vicinity of the landed estates of the Baron On Eckhardstein, of Counsellor Hope, and other excellent farms, which furnish to the young agriculturists interesting examples of what intelligent industry, joined to capacity and energy of will, can effect in agriculture. Besides the objects of special culture of land, the above mentioned estates offer also many things worth observing, for the technical occupations of the farmer. Among these are many distilleries, partly conducted by steam engines, and partly in other ways, and great man factories of be et sugar. The whole of the valley of the Ober, is very interesting and instructive, on account of the peculiar formation of its view of hills, its various states of soil, and the modes of economy which it offers, and its enlightened and skilful body of farmers. In a technical bearing, too, the limestone mountains of Ruedersdorf, the different man factories of Neustadt Eberwaldt, and other places, furnish interesting points for the young agriculturists. In order to render accessible and auxiliary the above described elements existing in the surrounding country, for the education of students here, various excursions are undertaken with them by the teachers of the institution, on suitable occasions, and, as circumstances will allow, some or all of the pupils may accompany the director on his tours of inspection to his other estates. (see further respecting these excursions hereafter) In this manner agricultural life and industry will be so nearly reached, by the young people, that if only a desire and inclination, in some measure corresponding exist on their part, their knowledge will certainly be nourished and elevated. But if many should fall away from the above mentioned auxiliary and educational influences, and others be much weakened, then it would be no longer possible to execute the proposed plan, in the short period of a year, during which a course may now be completed in this institution. It would th en be necessary to enlarge considerably the compass of this establishment, and also the number of the pupils. For in the same degree in which this happens, must the personal intercourse between teachers and scholars be abridged, and especially must the rule be relinquished, according to which the present pupils are received at the table of the director and into his family. This last regulation has a great moral effect upon the pupils. While the academy, indeed, is under the influence of the family, the natural roughness of the student will be counteracted, and, in this way, ties of confidence and attachment are not un frequently formed, which render it possible for the director to assume more the place of a fatherly friend than a superior, at least to those who are proper objects for such treatment. To this relation and the influences resulting therefrom, it is believed it must be attributed that it is possible, as has hitherto been very easy, to maintain the discipline of our establishment, without any punishment beyond that of dis mission. As a pleasant circumstance, not wholly unimportant to the intellectual life of the establishment, its nearness to Berlin deserves mention. His central point of intellectual and scientific education lies only twenty English miles from here, and the intercourse with it is rendered much easier by a public road passing near, and a daily post for Moegelin. Among the different branches of agricultural industry, there are two carried on with peculiar fondness and interest. One of them is agricultural 318 X. book keeping, which is practised at all the estates of the director, according to the double entry (so called I italian) mode of book keeping. The principal books of the different years, which represent, in figures, the cost, receipts, and the progress of cultivation of the estates under management, are not only exposed to the voluntary inspection and instruction of the pupils of the academy, with the system pursued in the same, as explained by the lectures of the director on this subject; but they are also placed under the management and execution of those who are desirous of further information; and many yearly summarise of those estates are prepared by students of the academy, to which naturally must be added the notes and journals collected by the officers. In this manner opportunity is afforded to the young people to, learn, by their own inspection, how business is carried on, in the estates embraced in the accounts; in what way their resources may be put into action by the employment of industrial capital: what products of the soil, active capital, and intelligence supply; and in what relation every individual factor stands to the sum of the product. This view established by book keeping, in every farm, must be so much the more instructive for the pupils of Moegelin, as it varies through the difference of the estates under management. For if, in1Moegelin itself, there is an example of an estate which has been so changed and transformed by old and long continued cultivation, that only a very practised and keen sight could discern the original condition, there are, in the other estates, examples of the cultivation, according as they have been tilled a longer or shorter time than Moegelin. But certainly nothing gives so deep an insight into the business of farming, nothing so clear a conviction of the' connection of the principal branches with each other, and with the whole, as a thorough mode of book keeping. And if, therefore, fondness and skill for such practice can be imparted to the young agriculturists, there is certainly an essential requisite obtained for future success. Thus he is preserved from the frequent error of considering the several branches of the business of farming profitable and sufficient in their present state, because they once or twice a year yield large sums, without reckoning the out lay of money and labor which they often cost, and which are liable to be unnoticed. The agriculturists has in his hand, in book keeping, an un failing touch stone, by which he knows to a certainty what and how great are the profits or <a name="loss44"><mark>loss</mark></a> of particular branches of his farm, and to correct or improve all his operations. Another branch of agriculture, which is prosecuted with peculiar fondness and success, and taught at Moegelin, is the breeding of sheep. Regard to his own interest, as well as a special predilection, causes the director to give a particular attention and notice to. this branch of his farm; and as h practical efforts have been attended with successful results, it cannot but be that his teachings on this subject will have for his scholars a special interest. The interest for sheep raising which may have existed in the students of the academy of Moegelin, will be nourished by the inspection of the already renowned flock there; and opportunity will thus be afforded for a closer observation and examination of the subject. As such opportunities, we consider the estimation twice or thrice every year of the separate animals in the main sheep fold, and the monthly valuation of their flee ces for hearing the estimating of the rams selected for sale; and indeed the sale itself, which brings many connoisseurs and those having a fondness for sheep raised. 
319lag to Moegelin. These often have been scholars of Moegelin, and have there acquired their knowledge and love for sheep breeding, as an important branch of agriculture, which they have practised with skill and success. We may likewise here mention the extensive potato culture carried on with particular care at Moegelin, and the estates belonging to it; and further, the modes of irrigation, cutting of pe at, making of bricks, &c, which are either found on the principal or neighboring estates. All the above mentioned elements provided by the internal and outward circumstances of Moegelin, will be regarded, and the pupils in their agricultural education be taught, in the special lecture, and other modes of instruction established by the institution, their uses, where a particular method of teaching prevails. We now come, therefore, to Lectures, Excursions, and hours devoted to . Conversationthe whole series of lectures is divided into a winter and a summer course the end of the first, or the beginning of the last, not being fixed by any particular period. The director of the institution, during the winter, gives lectures as to the business of agriculture in relation to profit, and adds remarks on agricultural education and intelligence, capital, the price of products and of labor, the nature and idea of landed estate, and all that belongs to it, with its superintendence and book keeping. Besides, he reaches stock breeding in general, but more especially that of mere no sheep and the growing of wool. From these, at the end of the winter, he passes over to the theory of tillage; gives under this head a survey of all the experiments made in this matter by lectures concerning the quality of the soil, its exhaustion, and restoration; the vegetable, animal, and mineral manures; the theory of tillage, (a" doctrine, how far the activity of the soil may be excited and proportioned) on sloughing, instruments of tillage and their use wherein is included the execution of the particular parts of field culture, culture of meadows and plants, and acquaintance as far as possible with all the methods of manipulation and observation to be found therein. In direct bearing here with stands 1. The lectures of Dr. Drummer, as to the rudiments of mathematics, chemistry, and physical philosophy, with respect to their employment in agricultural industry; and hence especially agricultural chemistry, illustrated by experiments required for the clear insight of the same; with constant regard to the use of these sciences in agriculture, and the business therewith connected, such as brewer is and distilleries, sugar and syrupy boiling from bees and potatoes, &c, as well as brick making and the like, which are particular objects of a technical summer course. Besides, to the auditor is given the opportunity of performing simple chemical analyses, under superintendence. Finally, he reaches, in close connexion with the foregoing, the physiology of plants and systematic botany, the outline of which the educated agriculturists who wishes to penetrate deeper into the science cannot be without, if he would reach a clearer insight into vegetation, so as to be able to understand and take true pleasure in his occupations 2. The professor of the veterinary art, Dr. Euers, reaches the knowledge of healing animals, divided into anatomy and physiology illustrated by preparations and practice in the dissection of car cases; dietetics of the healthy and diseased animal; the material medical; general pathology and therapeu820 X. tics, as well as surgery, as far as time permits and the knowledge of them is necessary to the educated agriculturists. Of the excursions, those which are under the conduct of the director of the academy have excellent farms and the survey of them for their object while Dr. Drummer, with W. class, visits the iron works at Neustadt Eberwalde, the brick kills of Joachimthal, the beer brewery of Gruenthal, the limestone mountains of Ruedersdorf, and other points celebrated in a technical respect. To the lectures on botany and physiology of plants are added, naturally, botany cal excursions, of greater or less extent, under direction of the same gentleman. In the hours for conversation (as they are :med) the students of the institution regularly assemble, twice a we at the directors; and these gatherings have for their object to give to. young people, on the one hand, particular aid and opportunity to act. ,i themselves, by explanation and instruction, with the difficult points of the profession, or whatever remains obscure in the lectures; and on the other, to come into intercourse with their fellow students in debates and statements concerning the objects of agriculture, and thus promote discussions among them, which, when they are directed and regulated, operate not only instructively, but also engagingly and encouragingly. Of the same conversational character are the rehearsals established by Dr. Drummer, on the lectures delivered by him on natural sciences. Constitution and direction of the Academythe special direction is managed by the counsellor of agriculture, On 7 Wider. To him every one must apply at m articulation, and in all that relates to a residence in this institution. The students dwell in the academy buildings, particularly devoted to the purposes of instruction. These are separated, but not far from the farm buildings. The edifice, besides the chambers of the students, contains the lecture hall and the assembly rooms. The rooms of the pupils are all alike, and only differ in situation, and are furnished in the same manner, with only the most necessary and simple furniture. The farm stands in no direct relation to the academy; and the students are in no way entitled nor compelled to engage in the management of the same. But, in order to render it easy, by observation and survey of the operations and regulations adopted in the same, to extend their agricultural knowledge, the first officer on the farm (at present Herr Griittner) is authorized, by request, to impart information on all the operations of the farm; and an account will likewise daily be given by him, in the auditory, of th~principalworks undertaken. These are the easier understood as every pupil has a chart of Moegelin. Further, the inspector of the farm gives to those who wish it, practical instruction in book keeping by double entry; which, as we have already mentioned, is carried out in Moegelin and all the estates belonging thereto. The secretary of the director also keeps the pe degrees of the present sheep fold. I inspection of these, likewise, will readily be afforded, and the necessary explanations therein imparted by this officer. The opportunity to learn the practical business of the distillers will be granted to those who have a desire for it, by the superintendent of the distillers. The library, otanical garden, and collection of natural history, stand open to the use of the students, under certain conditions. X. a. 321 Those only, who in their studies pass through a special course, will be considered as really members of the academy, and May afterwards regard themselves as the scholars of Moegelin. Other men, desirous of knowledge, who wish to take up their residence here for a short time, will be received, if there is room in the buildings designed for instruction ; but they are looked upon only as visitors, and in no way is granted to them the privilege of ran king as the scholars of the Moegelin academy. As has already been noticed, the number of students here is limited to only a small one. They are all borders in Thiers house, so that this institution; in a rare and peculiar manner, forms one family. In account of this close relation a single individual can cause disturbance and discord. Therefore the right is strictly retained of sending away, at once, from the institution, a student as soon as elements show themselves in hi, or events occur, which, by exciting an injurious influence of his fellow students, render his longer stay neither possible nor expedient. To such a strong measure, the director is obliged to resort, also, at once, if any one, by word or deed, sets himself in hostility to the objects of pursuit at our establishment. The Termsfor instruction, furnished room, service, dinner and supper, yearly, 350 Russian thalers, equal to         $245 or          $250 are paid. To disseminate knowledge, as to the best mode of cultivating the soil, has occupied eminent men in ancient times; and in this period of progress, agriculture has obtained its due share of attention. Germany, so distinguished for its institutions of learning, had, at an early date, professor ships of agriculture, at its different universities. I to monarchs encouraged agricultural societies, and established regular school systems, with a view to instruct the masses in the common elementary branches of education; in order that they might be able to read the works on various branches of agriculture. As sciences gradually developed, chemistry directed its researches to a more important object than making gold. A varied analysis lifted the veil of natures secret operations; the composition of soil and plants became known; and the relations between both, as to their constituent parts, gave rise to many an important discovery. The influence of mineral and animal manure was explained, and many means discovered to fertilizes the soil and insure rich crops. The pursuit of the agriculturists was at once elevated to an occupation requiring intimate knowledge of the sciences. Although the helps gained by the aid of science were highly advantageous, yet the general results of the whole farming operations were not such as to secure the most important object of farming, namely to increase the profits. Very discovery in chemistry, every new theory, was believed to furnish the grand arc anus for raising crops without manure and without labor; when the practical farmer saw himself, at the end of the year, not much better off for the new experiment, the mania for science generally a bated, and book farming was looked upon as of no great use. But the attention of enlightened and learned men was directed towards the remedy. They soon found that the <a name="evil29"><mark>evil</mark></a> was in the ill contrived parts which work the complicated machinery of a farm. They soon discovered that the gain of one part was consumed by the other, and that the final result was <a name="loss45"><mark>loss</mark></a> of power, <a name="loss46"><mark>loss</mark></a> " of profit They collected facts, from different sources; compared them with each other; and laid down a series of rules which should serve as a basis on which to calculate the most probable results, as well as farming operations21Ex. would permit. They reduced the most important branch of agriculture, the economy of farming to a (stem; which system enables the farmer to devise plans for the management of farms, to select the best rotations, calculate the amount of labor, and produce that most important result, " the most lasting and highest profits t was the practical knowledge which had been wanting, to enable the farmer to construct an effective machine, which increased its speed in proportion as the oil of science was added. Thus it was proved that neither science nor the thorough understanding of any single branch in agriculture as breeding cattle or raising a fine crop) was enough to insure the ultimate object in view. For this, was required the knowledge of every branch, separately as well as collectively, the knowledge of calculating and securing combined results; how to estimate the cost of manure, and how to employ it to the highest advantage; to calculate the amount of cattle, the food and litter necessary to produce the required quantity of manure for the rotation adopted; and a number of like practical questions, which must be well understood by all those who wish to till the land with profit. A complete science showed that farming was more intricate than at first supposed; that it requires a regular study, like all other pursuits, and this led to the ideapfestablishing proper agricultural schools, wherein all the sciences which bear upon agriculture, and all the practical branches separately and in connection with others: in a word, the economy of f coming should be taught. The monarchs furnished estates and means; and in a few years several agricultural schools were in operation. The young men coming from such institutions were employed as professors for other schools, as directors for large estates; or they superintended their own property. They proved, practically, the advantages of such an education. Numbers of educated agriculturists impressed with the importance of a higher knowledge in the pursuit of farming operations, were anxious to assist in the promotion of the general welfare; they desired to diffuse knowledge among their fellow farmers, and proposed meetings, like those of other scientific associations, where agriculturists from all parts of Germany might congregated, to deliberate upon important questions, state the mode pursued in different parts of Germany, and to devise plans for dissemination g among the mass practical and theoretical skill, in that branch of human knowledge upon the results of which the welfare of nations so much depends. The first such meeting was held at Dresden, in the year 1837. Princes, noblemen, men of science, the scientific as well as the plain farmer, assembled. The barrier of rank was thrown down; man met man; each spoke unrestrained, and debated the various questions proposed. The practical farmer found, in the nobleman, not only the scientific farmer, but one who supported his arguments with. practical facts and numbers, and who took great interest in that pursuit, which was in former times, considered the exclusive occupation of the lower classes of society. This gave confidence to, the farmer; he saw himself respected and considered; and he became impressed with the importance of a proper education for his business. The next meeting which was held at Carlsruhe in Laden, saw the number of members doubled-two hundred and eighty-nine in attendance. Since that time the meetings are regularly held. Last year the assembly the "agricultural Convention" we should call it was at Breslau, (I was present and of which I have given a full account) when the number of me mix. a. 2 hers amounted to nearly one thousand. In these meetings great attention was given to the subject of education. It was proposed, and discussed by a number of the members, to teach small children, in the public school of the country, besides the common branches of elementary education, the different manner of operation in horticulture and agriculture. For that purpose, it was considered necessary to give to each school house at least an acre of land, planted partly with fruit trees, and partly with leg luminous and other agricultural plants; to show them the best mode of cultivating garden plants, and how to use the he and other implements; to instruct them in the best mode of budding and grafting, so that they might, in the idle hours out of school, improve their orchards and garden plants; and, when more advanced in age, to explain and show them the different kinds of soil and their various properties, without entering into any scientific demonstrations; also, the different kinds of manure; the mode of collecting and preserving it; and in their lessons of arithmetic, to let them work out problems on some established fact relating to agriculture, that such problems might come impressed upon the plastic minds of the young. In their lessons of geography, it was advised to give them descriptions of the agricultural products and management of the farms in other countries; in teaching them to write to let them copy subjects relating to agriculture, without overlooking those beautiful moral aphorisms so consoling in the hardships of life. This plan is already adopted, in some parts of Germany. There was no difficulty in obtaining the necessary ground for such schools; the great obstacle was to find teachers who were able to carry out this new mode of training which requires men of knowledge and discrimination, to give just what is needed, and no more. It was found necessary, in institutions in which the teachers of public schools are educated, to make agriculture one of the regular branches of study, and to oblige the clergy to attend lectures on that all important subject, in order that these pastors might be able to give advice, and encourage the farmer in this great undertaking, where it requires the cooperation of all the proprietors, as for instance in irrigation. The numerous agricultural societies are indefatigable in their exertions th furnish to such schools and similar institutions, seeds, books, implements, &c. Besides this the government does not lose sight of the improvement of horses and cattle; it furnishes blooded stallions, which are sent, in every season, regularly to certain stations of the country, for the gratuitous use of those who are engaged in breeding horses; bulls, rams, swine of the best breed, are raised on some public estate, and the offspring sold at low rates, or given at cost to the farmers, to introduce the breed. A great many agricultural journals, periodicals, annuals and books, are published; every village keeps at least one weekly journal of that kind. The farmers, where they assemble on affairs of their village, thus read these journals, talk upon these subjects, and give their experience. Besides this, there are, every year, in the various German states volkfestanational festivals) when there is an exhibition of all sorts of agricultural products and domestic animals, machinery, plough matches, and horse races. Fire -hail and cattle insurance offices are founded. All these things cannot fail to produce great and beneficial results; and in many parts of Germany they are already perceptible. The king of Wurttemberg, a true father to his country, has thus employed every possible means to promote the interest of the farmer; and the fruits of 324 X. his wise measures are visible in every part of his kingdom. The three field system is improved and rich crops of c lover spread over the fallow fields; a superior kind of live stock enlivens the neat farm yard; the roads are lined with fruit trees; every where progress is evident. The small Duchy Pass au may be a pattern to any government in its system of schools for the education of the mass. There is there a country that can boast such a thorough and efficient system for promoting agriculture ?a? It began at the root, at the very point where all should begin, with the children of farmers, who left to themselves follow invariably the methods of their forefathers. To effect first a change of the system, it was begun by the education of school teachers, viz 1. The pupils of the institution for school teachers obtain theoretical instruction in natural history and agriculture. Practical instruction is also given them in horticulture and planting of hops and trees 2. The schoolmaster is himself a practical working superintendent of the garden attached to the school, and of the nursery of fruit trees belonging in common to the villages; he gives practical instruction in the culture of fruit trees, and to the girls, in the culture of vegetables and flowers 3. In every village is a particular school, where the girls obtain instruction in spinning, knitting, sewing, mending cloth and linen; and in many places the boys are taught in different works in wood, straw, and willow braiding 4. Teachers or school mistresses, who distinguish themselves in importing knowledge of industrial branches, obtain presents from the treasuries of the agricultural societies, which consist of books, tools and medals 5. The girls who spin the best thread, obtain prizes, being generally handsome spinning wheels; the boys are also entitled to prizes for various objects 6. Those boys who have distinguished themselves are sent, at the age of sixteen or twenty years, for two winter' courses, to the agricultural school from two to three hundred have already been educated in that way 7. For twenty-one years has existed, in Pass au, a weekly .agricultural journal, which is published for the farmers, is mostly written by themselves and has a great circulation among them and other persons interested in agricuhlure8. From the profits of that journal, has been purchased, in the vicinity of Wiesbaden, a small estate of ninety-two acres, for an experimental farm where, by degrees, the different modes of culture are tried, which are thought suitable for the Grand Duchy of Pass au. They have now in operation five different rotations; meadow culture, nur series for fruit trees, hop yards, vegetable gardens, and regular horticulture. The results of these various experiments are published in all the details 9. The best farm in every court district is selected, as a model farm, provided the owner will meet the wishes of the society and introduce such a mode of culture as would best suit for that district 10. For nineteen years past there has existed an agricultural society, the members of which are mostly farmers, owners of large and small farms, civil and military officers of various grades. The committees hold six meetings yearly in the different districts of that country, and one general meeting, where prizes are distributed for compositions in writing. At these, premium s are distributed to male and female servants, and laborers in vineyards in fruit and vegetable gardens, for good behaviour, or for superior order in work, &o. ;x. for fine horses, cattle, sheep, swine, and for the best management of bees for introducing a new or better kind of manure or a better mode of preparing such, &c, &c. These prizes amount to from five hundred and sixty to six hundred and forty dollars annually 11. The society is in possession of numbers of blooded breeding mares, which are distributed gratuitously among the members; in return for which they have to give the second and third gillies raised from each mare. There is a pasture, where the gillies which are raised for breeding by the farmers of Pass au are gratuitously kept. The society has also an improved stock of cattle and sheep from which the villages receive bulls and rams. Since 1833, the government has appointed an officer who attends to all affairs concerning agriculture; he is at the same time director of the agricultural schools and experimental farms; secretary for life of the society, and editor of the Agricultural Journal and Annals of the Agricultural Society. The government councillor Albrecht, of the Grand Duchy of Pass au, at one of the meetings of German agriculturists, when the question of instructing children in public schools was discussed, observed that" Since 1817, there had existed, in Pass au, an institution for school teachers where all the branches of natural history and agriculture are taught, not with the, view to educate the teachers as practical farmers, but to give those men who are destined to live among the farmers and charged with the education of children who will inherit the same occupation, a theoretical knowledge of agriculture, so that correct views on matters of agriculture might be diffused in common schools. I, myself, said he, have been for seventeen years in succession professor of agriculture, and my friend the medical councillor, lectured on natural history about as long as I did in the same institution. We both can give the assurance that those young men whom we educated for teaching were mostly sons of farmers, who had obtained no other instruction than that of the village school; that they listened to our lectures with undided attention, and with great advantage; that they proved this when they obtained situations as teachers; for they disseminated correct views and awakened a love of agricultural knowledge among the children. To this may be ascribed the fact, that the greatest number of pupils at the agricultural school at I d stein, from 1818 to 1833, and at Wiesbadeafrom 1834 to 1843, came from those schools where our pupils laid the germs of that knowledge; and it grows vigorously. These comprehended the more scientific branches of natural history and agriculture with much more readiness, and in their practical career applied them with more judgment and advantage than the sons of proprietors of large estates and better education. We found, by experience, that young men who have not enjoyed a scientific education, are, nevertheless, capable of understanding a scientific lecture, and able to follow the road pointed out to them. This I mention, in order to show that young men from the country, with a limited education, are, without a scientific or collegiate training, capable of a higher degree of culture in the art of husbandry. The various exertions, by societies and governments, to enlighten the mass, cannot fail ultimately to produce this desirable result that the mass will eradicate that pernicious weed which impedes every progress in regard to liberal institutions; and when all the roots of the feudal system are destroyed, the German farmers will form one of the happiest classes of men in, the civilized world 8 26 X. a. Xvi   I I.--; ni was and Three field system of Germany. Biennial system on the Rhine have spoken of the plains and hills covered with fields weighed down by heavy crops; fields which have been thousands of years under cultivation, without refusing the industrious laborer a rich harvest. To the practised agriculturists, such a sight is highly interesting, and, as a matter of course, he will ask, What is the principal mode of culture, the usual rotation of crops And he will be astonished to hear, in this enlightened age, that the fallow, or three field system, is still in use in two thirds of Germany. Yes, this barbarous system, the sign of darkness and ignorance, (as some great book agriculturists have named it) is, notwithstanding all the abuse heaped upon it, the very system which has saved Germany and all those country where it exists or has existed, from that utter exhaustion of the soil, "which would have ensued there, as in those countries where the barbarous practice is followed of planting corn after cor h, tobacco after tobacco, until the generous soil sinks, as if feebly making its last effort, into a state of exhaustion, such as only long repose and careful nursing can retrieve. It is due, then, to the fallow system, that the soil of the old countries remains in a state of fertility, which will enable it to produce good harvests for ever, if the usual care is bestowed upon it. In the thickly peopled parts of Germany, as on the Rhine, we find thebiennial, the four field system, and the extensive rotation of crops, and in the mountains and plains of the north, the alternate system of grain and grass, according to the climate and wants of the people. Of n those parts of Germany, where the feudal systems have been partly abolished, where the division of property, or other obstacles have allowed it, the three field system is in an improved state, and the naked fallow is covered with a thick crop of c lover or other fallow crops. The benefits of a judicious rotation of fallow crops is well understood in some parts of Germany; and we must not, in the common style of writers upon Germany, break out upon the ignorance, obstinacy and barbarism of the farmers who have not yet adopted the scientific method, a method of producing straw and very little grain, as we see in some parts of England, and as Arthuryoung mentions in his reports to the board of agriculture, where he gives some of the rotations practised in England, as a proof of " barbarous ignorance." He says, for instance, "fallow; wheat; wheat; barley; barley; oats oats; oats; and oats as long as the soil will bear it." It seems that the ancients were impressed with the idea, that the soil, as well as man, requires rest that neither the human frame nor the lifeless soil can exist continually without it, they soon lose then their strength, unless due repose be given them. Allow was considered to be the night rest for the soil, the production of grain its day work. Virgil and Columella recommend the alternation of fallow and wheat, as the only way to keep the soil vigorous and productive. A like two field system we find in use in England, in the south of France, and along the Rhine. Was it brought thither by the Romans, to whom we ascribe everything which has the least indication of good sense? Or did the native sagacity of each country direct it to the same idea, that the soil must have rest? This we leave to the learned to decide; and we content ourselves with the fact, that the two field system is still in use, in some parts, on the Rhine or the To selle. Befcid127ie that region was so populous; while consent. 
327quently, the estates were more extensive; and before the culture of fodder plants had become known, the change of manured fallow, wheat; naked fallow, rye; naked fallow, oats; and then the fallow manured again, was the common mode of using the land. Only one half of the field was in use the other in fallow; a method which required less manure, less seed, and less labor than the three field system. The cattle, especially the sheep, found sufficient food upon the fallow; furnished for one-eighth of the whole area, the necessary quantity of manure. With nothing else, this method produced sufficient grain for a thin population, and provided for all their wants. Rude and primitive as their system was, it had this great advantage over many modes of cultivation practised by civilized people of the present epoch, that it was a regular system, in which the land was allowed to rest on alternate years, and was every six years, once manured. Necessity, the mother of all improvements, at length obliged the people on the Rhine, to produce more grain and fodder; consequently, the naked fallow was gradually planted in c lover and other fodder plants, in root crops, and commercial plants. This is a change, which, in the two field system, is less difficult than in the three field system. Hence from time almost immemorial, regular rotations of crops were practised on the Rhine, so similar to some of the modes pursued in England, that Schwertz says, " either the English went to school to the Germans or vice versa he find, for instance, the following rotation on the Rhine and Moselle1. Turnips manured; 2. Spring barley; 3. Lover; 4. Heat or s pet. Naked fallow manured; 6. Eye; 7. Seas; 8. Oats. Or 1. Turnipsmanured; 2. Spring barley; 3. Lover; 4. Heat; 5. Naked fallow; 6. Eye.

Or, under like circumstances as above mentioned; 1. Allow manured; 2. Heat; 3. Lover; 4. Oats; 5. Winter barley manured; 6. Eye sown with white c lover for pasture; 7. Pasture; 8. Eye. In the Bavaria n province on the Rhine the Fall, we find the following excellent rotation of crops 1. Tobacco manured; 2. Pelt and takes in the stubble; 3. Spring barley and in the stubble turn is; 4. Lover; 5. Pelt or rye; 6. Baize potatoes, bees manured. The takes after s pelt in the second year, are ploughed in, as green manure for barley. Schwertz says, that this is the best rotation he ever knew to be practised, either in England or Belgium. There tobacco is more extensively cultivated, the rotate n are: 1. Tobacco manured; 2. Pelt or rye, with ta resin the stubble for -t same put one as mentioned above; 3. Bailey andturnips sown in 1tcid127stbe, 4. Tobacco manured; 5. Pelt or rye; 6. Feet potatoes.

The name of bien nail system was given to this, because in it the fields bear first grain, and then a fallow crop of such plants as require hoping or working with the plough, during the principal periods of vegetation, so that the field is kept free from weeds ; or the fallow is sown with such fodder plants as leave sufficient nourishment in the ground, through the leaves and roots, &c, (as c lover, takes or supines) and prepare the soil for the grain crop that is to follow. Drops of an exhausting nature require, upon poor land, a great quantity of manure; therefore this system is always practised near large cities. When Charlemagne 'made the three field system the system of his empire it seems that he enforced it upon the new settled countries, where it could be most easily established; for we find, near his capital and his summer palace on the Rhine, the two field system still in use. His principal objectcid127no doubt, was to secure a sufficient supply of grain for his people, and to protect the soil from exhaustion, by allowing it to rest at the regular intervals of every third year. He must have been himself an experienced agriculturists, from the fact that he allotted, to every village, meadow and pasture land, in proportion to their fields, in order to enable the farmer to produce sufficient manure to keep his fields in heart. The three field system, as I have mentioned, is still very extensively in use in Germany. Under it the fields are divided into three equal portions which are thus used: 1. Allow, manured; 2. Heat; 3. Barley; then again, 4. Allow; 5. Heat; 6. Oats; and generally, in the seventh year the fallow is again well manured. Upon sandy soil, instead of wheat, rye is planted; and instead of barley, oats. The cattle are pastured during summer upon the fallow or pasture lands and in winter the meadows supply the necessary fodder. This system requires a sufficient quantity of meadows, which are either in the immediate neighborhood, or in the val lies on the shores of some river, sometimes several miles off; but we find throughout Germany the villages organized in this way, and the farms lying separate were equally provided with a certain portion of meadow and pasture land. It is a regular system, which always his yielded fine and sure crops, plenty of straw, required less labor and capital than a more complicated system, and was suited to the intelligence ad wants of the population of that early period. X. D c. No. -54. 329 t is well known throughout Germany, that this system has its faults, that it requires a great deal of land and cannot be carried on without meadows: bat many obstacles are in the way to prevent the farmer from adopting a more improved method. Since c lover has been introduced as a fodder plant, the three field system has been greatly improved in some parts of Germany. Schubert thought that all the meadows could be dispensed with at once, and used exclusively for the culture of grain: that a rotation of c lover, wheat, barley; c lover, wheat, barley, &c, would amply replace the meadows: and that the farmers would thus double their income: but those who tried that c lover system, and planted upon the first furrow which turned the c lover, wheat, barley, c lover turned in, and wheat again, found that their fields were, in a short time overrun with weeds; that the crops yielded straw, and little grain; consequently this system was abandoned, and the old system continued. But experience has taught that a judicious use of c lover enables the farmer to dispense with a part of his meadow land and yet keep the soil in a proper state of cultivation; it supplies the wants of the cattle, and consequently furnishes the necessary manure. The best rotation is considered to be when the fallow field is planted half in c lover, and the other half left for the naked fallow. 1st. One half c lover, half fallow, manured; 2. wheat 3. barley; 4. fallow manured c lover; 5. wheat; 6. barley and oats. The fallow is sometimes planted with root crops as bees, potatoes and also tobacco, but these are exceptions to the general rule; and would lead to an innumerable list of different rotations of 3, 6 and 9 years, as pursued now indifferent parts of Germany. As much as this system has been cried down, under certain circumstances it has its advantages; upon fields far removed from the farm yard; upon large estates, and upon heavy soil, fallow allows the best preparation of the land for winter grain. It produces rich crops, with 25 per cent. less manure; and consequently requires less cattle, less fodder, less labor; and is important, especially in those countries where cattle yield little profit. The work spent upon fallow is less expensive, and the yield of grain always greater than in any other mode; the labor of the cattle is more equally divided than in the rotation of crops, when the greatest part of the work is to be done in the spring. Were it requires only the planting of barley, which is generally done in the first furrow; and the fields are ploughed over in winter. The planting is soon over, and therefore the best moment can be used for it. After fallow, every kind of grain succeeds well, and the work altogether is less than in the other modes of cultivating the soil. It requires less capital, and has less risk. Throughout Germany, c lover is planted in fallow but in districts where meadows are abundant, c lover is less cultivated. I nWurtemberg the fallow is partly planted in c lover, and partly used for pasture for sheep; to which it yields the best kind of pasture especially for the finer kind of mere no. I m proved fallow, with the assistance of some meadow, works perfectly well; and, in case of the failure of a c lover crop, takes, oats and peas are sown, as substitutes for it; but throughout Germany, where the soil is not too poor, c lover succeeds exceedingly well. Upon good wheat land it yields two fine crops, and sometimes a third. Plaster of Paris is every where in use. A traveller passing in summer, through countries where the three field system is carried on, in the old fashioned style, sees along the road for miles, nothing more than a naked fallow field, with a few sheep and x. a how upon it; no hedges nor fences; no extensive c lover crop, except upon a few fields near the villages. To doubt he is astonished; and especially when he comes from England, Belgium, Holland or the Rhine such a sight must make an unpleasant impression. But, before we blame the good broad shouldered Germans, let us inquire into the cause of the un improved state of things and we shall be more lenient in our judgment. Through the greater part of Germany, exists still, in all the glory of ancient times, the feudal system a system which is a barrier to every improvement. My readers, who are free born republicans unrestricted in the use of their property, paying little tax, and owing service to none but the state itself will be astonished at the facts which I am about to give. I myself have been a director of large estates, where the feudal rights of the proprietor had been partly changed into yearly taxes; but those obligations upon which the prosperity of the lords estate depended, have been strictly exacted from the peasants. The German farmer is a free owner of his property; he can sell and change it, &c, at pleasure; but he has first to ask the lord for his consent to any such transfer of property. This is granted on condition of paying two and a half per cent. from the amount for which it is sold, and he who busy it has to pay five per cent. more making together seven and a half per cent. For his property, he pays taxes to the government, works on the national roads, and serves as a soldier for the defence of his country from five to seven yea s. From his fields and meadows he is obliged to give the titles which he has to prepare ready for housing even from his cattle, sheep, fowls, down to their very eggs he has to give the tenth part to the church or other institutions. The old due of personal labor for the lord has been partly reduced into a yearly money tax; but it yet exists; and then the farmer has to perform all the field work of his superior, (such as planting, sowing, narrowing c) with his own cattle and implements, and as a matter of course, in the best part of the season. Besides this, he is obliged to now the grass and bring the hay to the yard; to assist a certain number of days during harvest time, and to house the crop; to bring manure out to the field; to haul all the wood required at the lords estate; to thresh a certain number of days; and to carry the grain to a distant market, with his own horses andvagonsometimes being several days in going and returning his is what farmers have to perform; there are other things for them to suffer. The lord has the privilege of past during his live stock upon their fallow fields and pastures; of keeping his game upon their fields; and on hunting days they are obliged to lend him their aid. Besides this ti the, they have to give a certain quantity of market able grain, which they have to furnish to the granary of their lord at a certain period they must fill it in bags and transport it to market, as just mentioned. When, to b, come the priest with his right; the school master, and all the persons employed in the service of the village, as herd man, watchman, &c. &c for their shares. I s not this list of obligations frightful, and enough to dis heart en the farmer from undertaking any amelie ration of his property Suppose he plants the fallow with some crop? He has to give one tenth to the lord or priest; and how can he attend to a more complicated system of culture, when his best and most precious days of the spring are levied upon for his lord? We ought to sympathize with this oppressed population n, instead of blaming them. X. a. 331 Another obstacle to improvement lies in the division of property. Of this I will say a few words hereafter. In some districts it has reached the highest point; and it is almost impossible to divide the earth into smaller parcels, except you turn it into dust. Suppose a farmer owns in a field a half acre of ground, which is surrounded by other land, planted in wheat? He has no road to it; therefore it is inaccessible to him, except by paying for the damages produced upon the adjacent grounds which damages would amount to more than his whole crop is worth. He is therefore obliged to follow the common system of the others. In some parts of Germany exist laws, according to which the farmers are bound to follow the three field system. All these obstacles must be abolished, before any material improvement can be expected. The valleys of great rivers in all new countries attract the first settlers the natural water routes link them together, and favor their undertakings. The advantageous location of the first inhabitants on the Rhine must have doubtless caused many a bloody scene among the jealous ab origines ofGermanys impenetrable forests. When the Romans pierced to that valley, they found it already populous and cultivated; so that their conquest was not an easy one. I need this valley has always drawn to it whatever race became masters of Germany; the climate, its products, and the facility of navigation, attracted a numerous population. I to chieftains of rude times, like eagles, built their rocky fastnesses upon the summit of the many hills, and watched from their cast led c rags the poor whose humble dwellings clustered together like the nests of swallows under the protecting rocks of the sloping shores. The population has continued to increase from time immemorial, and property has been divided and sub divided until it has become impossible to divide it any longer, unless by the spadefuls. It is really curious to see an extensive field, on the banks of the Rhine, divided into a few furrows and planted in different crops, that make a mixture of all sorts of colors; no fence nor hedge separates the property; a few rocks set in a line, direct the plough man to keep within the limit of his narrow territory. Such enormous estates as we are accustomed to possess or to procure for a few hundred dollars, are not to be heard of in the Cherish provinces. The estates of nobles, which, in all countries of the continent, are the most extensive, and which sometimes exceed a western farm, are here few and small; and they who count a couple of hundred acres, rent it in small parcels to a much greater advantage than they can husband it themselves; so that farming operations are conducted on a very limited scale. Dear Cologne, the rent is, on an average, from six to eight dollars per morgen* and it is augmenting in ratio with the population. The factories pay the farmer good prices for his products, and employ his children in various operations; the small patches of vine yard regenerate the laborer, provided he pays attention to the improvement of his wine, but, notwithstanding, as the country is not made of I india rubber, in spite of economy and industry, thousands live there without a foot of property, and this forces many to seek a home in foreign lands, where they can employ themselves in their favorite occupation of tilling the soil, mans noblest and best pursuit. The landed property throughout Germany, is divided into estates belong* One morgen is 1 acre, 1 room, and 26 perch e. X. king to the crown, to nobles, and to the peasants, then sub divided into wholeBauernhofe (entire farms) half farms, quarter farms, one-eighth farms, and at last comes the house owner, with a garden, and even sometimes an acrecid127f land. The number of acres varies according to the greater or less amount of population, but the parcels on the Rhine are very limited. Airittergut of two hundred acres is considered an extensive estate; a whole, arm of forty, and a half farm of twenty-five acres, a fortune. The house owners believe themselves well off if they possess one or two acres of land some must try to live from one-fourth of an acre. The number of small farms is very great in the Cherish provinces: for instance, the district of Cologne comprises 75.65 German square miles, which is parcel led out into 161 estates of nobles, 2,325 full span or whole farm, 19,106 half span, and the rest, amounting to 19,106, is held by house owners, with from a half to two acres, working it with the he, spade or their cow. This unlimited system of division has been favored by home governments, with the idea that small estates are generally better cultivated and yield higher profits; but the injurious result has made them aware of the necessity of restricting the division to that of the large estates: that is, of confining it to a certain nun tier of acres which will support a family, according to the state of soil and, other local circumstances. Another injurious effect was produced by the division of the common property of villages; the villagers who opposed that a were considered as obstinate and blind to their own interest; but experience, the test of all theories, has shown that the measure did more harm than good. Of In Heat, Tobacco, Pelt, as cultivated on the Rhine. Heat being one of the principal products of our farmers, I have thought it might be of some service to collect, in the different countries through which I passed, the experience of the most eminent agriculturists on this, subject. Schwertz, who is so well known by his various agricultural works, li as described the mode of cultivating wheat practised on the Rhine, cold acted from authentic sources, from which I have made the following extracts, with some additional notes from other writers on German agriculture, and my own experience and observation. The wheat cultivated along the Rhine is the ordinary winter wheat, of a yellow color, without beard; there is another kind raised with a beard of a brown color, which is considered not as profitable, as it yields less grain and more straw. In the Rhine, especially in Alsace, wheat is planted after tobacco, hemp, beans, I indian corn, potatoes, cabbage, poppy, turn is, c lover, and in fallow, though this is very rarely the case. Tobacco is considered the best preparatory crop for wheat; it is estimated that it yields one-seventh more after tobacco than after any other crop, Which arises first from the great quantity and superior quality of manure which is used for the tobacco crops, and secondly, from the careful and separated labor which is given to tobacco. Even if it should happen that the tobacco crop was taken late from the field, the wheat crop succeeds add air ably well. Hemp is considered another excellent crop, after which wheat succeeds well, principally when the manure is stronger for hemp than for tobacco. It is an established fact that hemp leaves the soil perfectly free from weeds, X. even without giving it any labor whatever. I believe that the wheat crop after hemp is not so much esteemed in regard to the yield of straw. The farmers pretend to have observed, that after cabbage, wheat yields less straw; others say that 120 sheaves, in such a case, yield as much grain as 150 from crops after tobacco. The naked fallow is considered yet the best preparation for a heavy argillaceous soil. In cases where there is not sufficient quantity of manure, the farmers are forced to fallow the land. It is estimated that the crop yields at least onehectolitre* of wheat more to an ardent of twenty arestBeans are considered, throughout the valley of the Rhine, an excellent preparation for wheat, but it is believed that wheat yields less after beans than after tobacco, hemp, or poppy, and of inferior quality, which accounts for the fact, that in some parts beans are put in a summer field, after which another fallow crop succeeds before wheat is sown again. After I indian corn, the grain is full and of fine appearance, yet it yields only one half the quantity of straw that it yields after other crops, but I found places where wheat, after maize, yielded apply in grain and straw, and other places, again, where I indian corn is considered the worst preparatory crop for all sorts of grain. Similar facts, just as contradictory, have been furnished to me in regard to c lover. Sometimes it is considered the best crop to precede wheat, and in other places, of middling order; but experience has settled that question so far, that no where can a good crop of wheat be raised after a poor crop of c lover. But every one agrees that wheat yields more straw after c lover than after any other kind of preparation. The same thing happens with wheat after turnipsit is richer in straw than in grain. In some places, wheat after poppy is thought highly of, and is preferred to wheat after c lover or beans. After m adder, wheat succeeds well, even in a sandy soil, provided the land is rich. I have seen many rotations of similar kinds in Alsace; but I never saw wheat sown after another crop of grain; it is sown sometimes though rarely. Potatoes are considered a good preparatory crop for wheat; it falls a little short of fallow wheat, but is less liable to lay down. One sloughing after tobacco, one after beans, three after I indian corn, and ne or two after hemp, are considered sufficient for the preparation of wheat crops. After a vigorous and well stocked c lover crop, one sloughing is thought sufficient; but when it is thin, having spots filled with weeds, two or threeploughings are generally given; when the c lover crop was good, no manure is put on; but when the contrary, some is considered necessary to ensure a fair wheat crop. It is customary in this region, to let the third growth of c lover come up as high as time will permit, and then plough it under. When two sloughings are given, the c lover is turned under with a shallow far row; the second furrow is made much deeper; when there is time, a third furrow is always preferred; the last two are made much deeper than the first* A hectolitre is equal to 100 litre the litre is 0.22 parts of the British imperial gallon j An are is equal to 100 square metes the metre is 39.37 inches. An ardent is sixseventhaC f an acre 8 34 X. a. It has been found that wheat yields more straw after one sloughing, but, that it yields more grain after it has received three sloughings. At Wesselingen, wheat is sown in a peculiar manner, which is worth mentioning. A part of the seed wheat is sown upon the first furrow given to c lover, then ploughed very superficially, after that the rest of the seed wheat is sown, and harrowed in with heavy harrows: 'the farmers of that district say that they obtain an excellent wheat crop. This mode is new to me. It may answer for light soil very well, which has not adhesion enough for a wheat crop when managed in the ordinary way. The usual periods of sowing wheat on the Rhine, and in the southern part of Germany, is a week before, and about three weeks after Michaelmasseptember 29.) Heat early put in the ground yields fine crops, but the only inconvenience is, that the weeds spread too fast; later, the wheat does not succeed well, it takes a long time to ripe n. There exists a proverb, among the Alsaciens, which says, "when wheat sown in the beginning of November (Toussain) succeeds, a father should never tell it to his children in the Danube is the best wheat country; wheat is sown sometimes very late, and considered safe if it only shows itself before the snow covers the soil; it grows under the snow, and when spring sets in, sometimes scarcely a plant can be seen. There exists another proverb: " When you have to look for your spring with pointed sticks, you are sure to fill your barn n countries where the winters are very irregular, sometimes without snow, early sowing is recommended to give the plant the necessary force to withstand the influence of the continual changes. After hemp and tobacco, wheat comes up very soon. Upon c lover, wheat must be sown two or three weeks earlier, or it is considered likely to fail. The farmers throughout Germany pay great attention to the selection of their seed wheat; they know that with poor grain the common diseases of wheat crops are increased. The common diseases of wheat in Germany are <a name="mildew3"><mark>mildew</mark></a>, blasting, <a name="blight5"><mark>blight</mark></a> and smut. <a name="mildew4"><mark>Mildew</mark></a> is supposed to be produced, from a sudden change of temperature, a cold shower of rain after a hot midday sun. Must is considered a higher degree of <a name="mildew5"><mark>mildew</mark></a>. Ulster thinks that wheat crops which are planted upon a turned c lover stubble, are more liable to be affected by rust, because such crops are later in spring; but when they have once started, they grow so rapidly and luxurious, as to make the plant more delicate, and consequently more liable to the changes of temperature and <a name="disease98"><mark>disease</mark></a>. The causes of these various diseases are not yet understood; all the proposed remedies have been tried without a sure effect the only and best preventive is a careful preparation of the soil, sound and perfect seed. Heat a year old is considered the best. Fresh manure is also thought another cause of these evils. The average quantity of seed wheat is estimated by Her at two hundred and forty-two litres per hectare n France, two hundred litres are generally calculated per hectare; and an old French proverb says, "vieux vast semen are que menu better sow too much than too little. The soil and its fertility regulates the quantity of seed; in the rich bottom lands of the Danube, wheat is always sown thinner than in the les fertile or suitable soil of other districts* The hectare is equal to 10,000 square metres, or 2.471 acres, X. a. 835 After c lover one third more seed wheat is used than a! e manured fallow or tobacco. In the Rhine, especially in Alsace, a part of the -cd is ploughed in, sometimes one third, sometimes one half, and the c is sown upon the field after sloughing, and is harrowed in; in other -its, where the soil is of a heavier nature, it is harrowed in altogether. The wheat ploughed under in that way is thought to stand better the winter and the winds, and in a well prepared soil it is considered the best method; but when the soil has not obtained the necessary work, it is thought better to harrow the grain in. Upon light soil it is generally ploughed under, and yields very well, at a depth of three inches. Sheep and horses are driven sometimes upon wheatfields, to feed upon them. This has a similar effect to that of toppingThey are only brought upon the wheat field in the autumn or during the winter. In Alsace they bring in sometimes the sheep and horses in the beginning of May, which is rather a dangerous operation. Rows are never permitted to enjoy this privilege. The grain is considered to be ready for cutting when the berne l has acquired a certain consistency, and when the farinaceous substance is entirely developed, it is cut even if the grain is yet somewhat soft, (grain too much ripened is thought less fine in appearance, and of less good quality and left upon the field to ripe n. In Bavaria, wheat is cut with sickles, and only about half way from the ground, the ears laid upon the high stubble and left to ripe n, which has many advantages. In the first place, it requires less room in the barn secondly, there is less danger of its sprouting in the field if rainy weather should happen to continue for some time; thirdly the work of gathering and bringing from the field goes on more rapid, as there is at least one third of straw less to be brought home: fourthly, threshing, which is done every where with flails, is done better and quicker. Some give it a top dressing with soap boilers ashes, during the fall, "others one with long manure. Different modes are practised on the Rhine, and beyond that river, in the treatment of wheat crops in the spring. Narrowing is very common. After A few days fine weather, when the soil has sufficiently dried up and the wheat begins to show itself, the crop is well harrowed with heavy iron l arrows. Feeding is generally done by women. When the wheat crop grows very luxuriantly, the farmers, in order to prevent its laying, top the crop, that is, the leaves are cut off with sickles, or scythes, without touching what they call the heart of the plant, the stem, grows stouter and prevents it from laying; but this is a long tedious operation and an expensive one. It is always performed in fine mild weather, but never when there is a strong north or northwest wind blowing, as this turns the crop yellow. The stubble remains on the field until the crops are all secured, and then it is mowed and stacked in the field, or near the barn. Sometimes when there is less need for straw, the cattle are driven in the stubble to feed upon the grass between it, it is trodden down in that way, and before winter sets in it is brought together with rakes and stacked. Heat is considered one of the surest crops, as it very seldom entirely fails, provided the land has been properly prepared for it. The opinions are divided in regard to the effect of sleeping grain to pre 336 X. event <a name="disease99"><mark>disease</mark></a>. Any have found it highly useful. A Mr. Tender, of Rottenburg, employed, for nearly twenty years, seed wheat a year old, which he: stepped in a let made of leech ashes and quick lime, and his fields were free from brand all that period but after he left off using new wheat instead of a year old, the <a name="evil30"><mark>evil</mark></a> returned at once, and in 1836, it caused an enormous <a name="loss47"><mark>loss</mark></a>. He obtained, he states, a recipe to prepare a steep, which is used very extensively in Poland, consisting of flaubert salt, ashes and quick lime. Sixteen Berlin scheffel* requires one-eighth of a Russian c it. of flaubert salt, one scheffel of lime and the let of one scheffel of ashes; with this solution the wheat was moistened, and well mixed, and left for twenty-four hours in a heap. The effect was astonishing there was not the least appearance of brand on the whole field except at a corner where the prepared wheat gave out, which suffered again from brand. This led me to the conclusion, says he, that the seat of the <a name="evil31"><mark>evil</mark></a> is in the grain, which carries with it to the ground the eggs of an insect which affect the plant, and consequently destroys the development of the ear. I examined many wheat plants, affected in this way, and which were carefully taken up with the root; on examination I found, that just above the roots they were eaten through all round, and discovered, in the inside of the calm us, (half) a black worm, with a thick, horn like skin, tapering at each end to a point, .which might also explain why wheat a year old is less liable to produce brand, the eggs of the insect having lost during a years keeping, their vitality. Schwertz mentions an interesting fact in regard to the effects of sleeping. A farmer mentioned to him that he used lime and the drainings of the dung hill, and after twenty four hours prepared in that way he applied it, but it was never free from blast. In 1794, said the farmer, "I prepared my seed wheat as usual, but I was prevented from sowing it till after the third day, when the grain began already to sprout and to my astonishment the crop was free from blast. It is now twenty-two years that I have followed the same method and I have found only one single ear which was attacked by that destructive <a name="disease100"><mark>disease</mark></a> The celebrated natural ist, Dr. Parties, of Munich, described it as a kind of <a name="fungus20"><mark>fungus</mark></a> which adheres to the grain and spreads gradually over the plant and disturbs its vital functions and causes all the different diseases known under different names. Dr. Parties recommends sleeping the seeds, as the best and only means of destroying the <a name="fungus21"><mark>fungus</mark></a>, which lose not their vitality, even after keeping the grain for years. The change of grain for seed is practised throughout Germany, and it is considered very important to obtain it always from a soil which is -well adapted for wheat, &c. Speltdinkel or s pelt, as the Germans call this kind of wheat, has been more extensively planted at earlier periods in Germany, than at present; it is one of the oldest kinds of grain which seems to have been known to the Egyptians. It is principally cultivated on the upper Rhine, in Franconia, Wurttemberg, Laden and Switzerland: there are two kinds used, one with a 'smooth berne l, the other a rough one; the ears like the wheat, have be ardor are without it. Schwertz thinks, that wheat or s pelt, without a beard, when sown upon a poor field badly prepared, have ears with beard, and Vice versa. The red s pelt is considered the best kind- A Berlin s chef fe is 1.479 of an english bu held Berlin scheffel is 1.479 of an f English bushel, X. a. 337 there wheat sue ends, s pelt will yield heavy crops, but it grows uponlescid127) compact and rich soil, and insures good crops, which makes it, in many uses, preferable to wheat; it succeeds after many a crop, after which wheat could not be planted, and is therefore very important in rotation. In the Rhine, upon light soil, it is sown upon c lover stubbles and ploughed in with a shallow furrow. In the spring it is rolled. It is sown about the same time as wheat, and it is not uncommon that it is sown in the month of February, it ri pens a little later, but yields fine and heavy grain. The, s pelt is sown as it comes from the ear with the dusk, and requires, consequently, a great quantity of seed; four hectolitres per hectare is considered sufficient. In the To selle, rye is mixed with one fifth s pelt and sown together; both seem to succeed better, and the s pelt is easily separated from the rye, and much better in that respect, than wheat and rye. Narrowing in spring and cutting the leaves, is very serviceable to s pelt. Pelt suffers very seldom from blast, and is less liable to the common diseases of wheat. When the stem (half or c ulm) begins to turn white, which is generally about the middle of August, the s pelt is cut. In the Rhine the s pelt is cut and housed the same day, provided the weather is fine. It can be immediately threshed, the ears break off very easily, and treading it out with horses or cattle would do just as well. The grain do (did 127) not separate from the dusk, requires more room in granary, but keeps better than wheat and is less liable to be injured from insects or r to. It is sold in that way. #hen the grain is required for use, the husks are rubbed off at the mills, which have a pair of stones for that purpose; the grain is separated, cleaned and ground to flour. Upon good s pelt soil 48 to 50 hectolires are calculated per hectare, to be a good average crop. A hectolitre which weighs 42.24 kilograms- yields ten kilograms of husks, two kilogramsof of fall and thirty kilograms of grain; one hectare yields fortyeighthectolitres of spelt1479, five kilograms which gives 1 332 kilogransof flour. One hectare yields 22 hectolitres of wheat -1 594: kilogramse, which gives 1 415 kilograms of flour. Heat which gives per hectare 83 kilograms, more flour. The flour from s pelt is considered finer and whiter than that from wheat, and it is used by confectioners; it goes further in cooking than wheat flour but bread from s pelt flour is of a rather driver nature than w heat bread. Schwertz sums up the advantages and peculiarities of s pelt and says 1. Pelt grows upon bad and poor soil but poorly, it succeeds upon that which is too dry or too wet for wheat, but upon good v wheat land it grows exceedingly well 2. The field requires the same preparation as for wheat, but, is not injured by late maturing, or top dressing, as wheat is 3. Requires less manure, and less original fertility of the soil than wheat 4. Brows well after other crops, and even after s pelt itself, which may be ascribed to the fact, that s pelt exhausts the soil less than wheat 5. It is less liable to <a name="disease101"><mark>disease</mark></a>, especially blast, than wheat 6. Birds injure the crops less while on the field 7. But it lays down and its ears are easily broken off, and has in that respect no advantage over wheat 8. Rainy weather is not less injurious to s pelt than it is to wheat, butt can be immediately housed, sooner than wheat kill gram is equal to 2 pounds 3 ounces avoirdupois388 X. Doc. No. -549. It requires more room at the .granary, but keeps better than wheat 10. Pelt yields a very little less flour than wheat 11. The flour is white and finer, but the bread from it is driver than that from wheat 12. The s pelt straw is a little more stiff than that of wheat, but it makes not only fine cut straw for horses, but excellent fodder for cattle. In countries where they make straw hats, they use the straw of s pelt in preference to others. Mixture of Eye and Heat mixture of wheat and rye is sown her every frequently, and it is considered to succeed better than when one or the other is sown alone. The Germans use rye for bread, and only on certain holy days they use pure wheat for bread. A mixture of wheat and rye gives an excellent bread, which is considered more healthy than either wheat or rye alone. It is said that it ferments better, and that the bread keeps better generally they bake only once a week and use stale bread, as hot and fresh bread is considered un wholesome. This mixture of rye and wheat is less liable to lay down, the thin, longer stem of the rye gives room for the wheat which is always stronger to develop e itself better and the air can pass through more freely. The <a name="mildew6"><mark>mildew</mark></a> and other diseases of wheat is seldom observed, the straw of each kind is more vigorous and an acre of such a crop yields more than when sown each separately; it requires a less rich soil, and this mixture will succeed upon a light sandy soil, which could not be use, ,a. beat alone; if the soil be more suitable for wheat, tly take generally more of the wheat for seed, and for soil of light nature more rye than wheat. Tobaccoexperience has shown that tobacco planted at intervals for Several years on the same field, and tobacco planted upon highly manured ground is not so well favored as that which is planted upon new go mud or meadows or after c lover, or ulcer ne of several years' standing. After fallow, tobacco succeeds the be i, but that would be too costly in countries where land is so valuable. Thorough <a name="rotten5"><mark>rotten</mark></a> manure is preferred, and if fresh manure must be employed it is brought on the field some time :before the tobacco is planted, and let exposed to the influence of the weather, before it is ploughed under. Schwertz g s the following method of planting as practised in Alsace. The time from the 27th of May to the 18th of June is considered the most favorable season for planting. When the land has been properly prepared, two persons can plant an ardent* of twenty ares in five hours, and six when the plants must be watered; in the last case, water is first put into the holes and then the plants; when it can be done the water of dung hills moistened with water is preferred and considered highly useful. From five to six thousand plants are reckoned to an ardent of 20,000 Russian feet, which makes four square feet for each plant, sometimes they are planted thicker. This mode of planting at equal distances, is far from being the best; the leaf grows exceedingly large and perfectly covers the soil, so that it becomes difficult to approach them, and is a great impediment in the operation of picking the leaf. It would be much better to bring two lines much nearer together, and leave a greater space between the next two lines, which would allow persons employed in picking or other operations, to approach the plants easier, without injuring them, and the field would contain. An ardent is six-sevenths of an a 'e. X. a. 339 as many plants as in the old method. It would be a great fault to give less than four square feet for every plant. When the field is planted, it requires to be examined several times, to see if all the plants have taken root and to replace plants which have perished. There is in this country a kind of white worm, which injures the young plants. Feeding and Pickingthe tobacco is needed and hold, at least once. The first wedding is in June, as soon as time allows one to attend to it without waiting until the plants have grown stout. A warm damp weather and a well prepared field favors the growth of the young plants. The field ought to be hold as soon as possible, especially when it has been much trodden down during planting. Being is considered one of the most important operations for this culture a t requires three persons to weed an ardent of twenty ares, and five or six to he it. They allow only seven or eight leaves to a plant to remain, including the leaves near the roots; all the roots are taken off. The leaves being the only object for the planter, he consequently pays all his attention to their prompt development, and cuts at four or five different periods, to the top of the stem, then the central branches, every time they shoot out open; this opeMiwrn i, absolutely necessary. Without mentioning the influence of temperature o, of which the tobacco is as sensible as the vines, it has i, great many end lies, such as hail, frost, wind, the grasshoppers, the rust (most) and the hemp blossom, (orobranche rams a) evils against which, except the last one, here exist no remedies. The hemp blossom (orobranchel rams a) is a parasite plant, which grows upon the root of the tobacco and robs it of its sap. Tobacco attacked by this plant loses its leaves, though the damage, is less considerable when this parasitic al plant appears about is harvest time. The ravages caused by this plant are enormous among the tobiatcol but it is the consequence of a bad management; and the plan r is finished for his carelessness. It is caused by a bad preparation of he soil, by the short intervals at which the tobacco is brought back into the same fields again, and especially by injudicious rotation. It is not difficult to destroy the influence of this plant entirely; by planting the field aftcid127. tobacco, in grain, and after that in the different kinds of bien nail crops, a: for instance maize, potatoes and then should follow tobacco, by which the bad off i s of this plant would be eradicated. The frosts which are so common in Alsace about the month -f September, are very injurious to tobacco, it destroys it completely, even when r the side only of the leaves have been touched. Whenever the leaves begin to turn brown, it is full time to harvest them. Harvestwhen the leaves begin to ripe n, small yellow spots are noticed having the appearance of being pierced, they begin to look shriveled the whole surface of the field has a yellow color which is the signal for harvesting. It is not well to hasten the harvest too much, though it may be necessary i order to prepare the soil for another crop, or from fear of a frost. Thetoba1cca loses in weight when such is the case. They have tried to introduce here, the mode of picking the leaves in secession, but it offered a great roi any difficulties; it cannot be effected without injuring the leaves which remain on the stem, and at a considerable increase of manual labor and consequently additional expense. It is an error to 340 X. suppose, that the upper leaves of the plant, ripe n later because they have been developed later than the lower ones. The upper leaves are more exposed to the light and air, and in consequence ripe n as soon as the lower ones. A royal ordinance which gave directions how to proceed in the harvest of the leaves, has produced a great many advantages, also the classification of the leaves according to their different sizes, the assortment of the bottom leaves, the picking of the tops and side branches, in short the whole culture is done with great order and system; the administration pays a higher price compared with former years, when the system was carried on in the old manner, and obtains a better article. The leaves of tobacco taken from the stem, are put in bundles, and fastened with straw, and may remain in this way upon the fields for two or three, and even for four days, according to the state of the temperature. When all the leaves are gathered, the stems are soon drawn up to prevent them from exhausting the land unnecessarily. After the roots have been freed from the earth, which is done by passing over it with a harrow, or by hand, the stems are placed out of the way of the plough. Some place the min the furrows, others scatter them over the following wheat crop, pretending they have a salutary effect upon the young plants, and in the spring they are taken off, and in different ways. To lay the stem in the furrow requires a person with the plough. The tobacco crop prepares the field so well that only one sloughing is required for the following crops. When the stems are placed upon c lover or meadows and left there during the v inter they produce a wonderful effect; they are taken up in the spring and used for firing, and the ashes are considered superior to any other treatment of the tobacco at home t is not sufficient to bring the leaf to its greatest perfection in the field, the planter must pay the necessary at ention to prevent its deter i oration when housed, to which tobacco is morel i al e than any other crop. With the assistance of a long strong needle and t wine, the leaves are strong together and hung up. In a few days these strut lines, which are loosely put together, are taken down and turned, and those which have been above are placed beneath, and in a few days more they are brought into a dry place. In the places where tobacco is cultivated more extensively, proper buildings are pub up to dry the leaves in, but generally the lofty of stables, &care used for it. The tobacco, after having been exposed to the frost without moving it from the place where it was hung up to dry, is at last taken down and put up in small bundles. In the first three weeks the tobacco is liable to become heated, it must be watched and every time turned when the temperature rises until the tobacco is perfectly shriveled, when it has arrived at that state, the whole crop can be put up in large bundles forsaleExpensesThe average crop of an hectare of tobacco in Alsace, amounts to about thirty quit nares of dry leaves.

It would be no more than just to divide the <a name="loss49"><mark>loss</mark></a> of the eighth year among the seven good ones. From this statement it appears almost incredible, yes impossible, how the farmer can continue to plant tobacco, but we must bring into consideration that the small farmer does all the work himself, assisted by his wife, children and servants, that lie gives to this crop all his leisure moments, and never calculated the cost of his labor. The same is the case with manure, which he considers as a preparation for the wheat crop; but notwithstanding all these allowances raising tobacco is a poor business, and it is not at all astonishing that the tobacco planters are adding every year to the poor list of that country. Xxmode of feeding Battle and Horses, at Alcsath. The order of feeding cattle observed at Alcsfith, is as follows: on the Marienthal farm the cows receive from 1st November to the last of March, every morning, early, eight pounds of steamed chaff mixed with potatoes, at 7 drink 342 X. and then one-eighth of a met zen* of turn is cut to pieces and mixed wit a chaff; at 3 again steamed chaff and potatoes, at 4 drink, at half past 4 again one eighth of a met zen of turn is mixed with potatoes, and at night maize straw. From the commencement of April to the middle of May, the cattle get instead of turn is a like quantity of potatoes cut to pieces and mixed with chaff; after this, the green fodder commences, in the order in which it is cut. At Linz a, the young cattle during the winter, receive per head, in the morning, seven pounds of steamed chaff and potatoes mingled, at 7 drink, at half past 7 o clock, one-sixteenth of a met zen of potatoes, cut to pieces and chaff, at 3 R. M. again seven pounds of steamed chaff and potatoes, at 4 drink, at 5 again one-sixteenth of a met zen of potatoes, cut to pieces and chaff, and at night coarse hay. During the summer, green fodder is given here likewise in the stall valves one year old receive during the winter daily, in the morning, five pounds of hay, second quality, at 7 o clock drink, at 8 three pints of oats soaked in water and mixed with chaff, at 3 P. M. again five pounds of hay, second quality, at 4 drink, at 5 again three pints of oats soaked in water and mixed w, s h chaff, and at night two pounds of hay, second quality. Welded calves under one year of age, receive both in the morning and afternoon one po un 1 of hay less than those immediately preceding. Draught oxen receive from the beginning of November to. the end of February daily per head sixteen pounds of steamed chaff mixed with one tenth of a met zen of potatoes. In order to keep the draught oxen in full strength during the hard work of spring, the cattle for draught receive from the commencement of March to the middle of May, besides the fodder above enumerated, every morning three pints of buckwheat meal and at noon five pounds of mille t straw. Rich cows get every week two ounces of salt to lick, calves (according as it may be required) from two ounces to two and a half and even three ounces every second week, per head. Horses receive in the winter three times during the day, three halves of a met zen of bruised oats, and six pounds of hay, four pounds of o at straw, and five pounds of steamed chaff without potatoes. During the summer the horses get at noon, green fodder instead of chaff. From the second \week of their age, the foals receive a little oats, which portion is increased from day to day, in such a manner, that in their fourth month, they receive already one and a half met zen. From that time their portion of oats is increased until their sixth month to three met zen, and the oats hence forward are mixed with a third part of carrots. Of hay the foals obtain two pounds a day, and weather permitting, they are led daily to their grazing place, which is specially assigned to them, and which is surrounded with a fence. The difficulty of obtaining good horses, the frauds so frequently practised in selling horses, and the great expenditures from procuring fit, fault less and dura be horses are the reasons why on the manor of Alcsuith the stock of horses is used both for working and breeding, and so its demand for horses from time to time is supplied by its own breeding. The principal steed is the Limbo Dr as out farm. Were studs only are used on the farm. A broad breast, a straight back, healthy fault less feet, a well shaped light head constitute the appearance of these horses. The steed used here alone met zen is equal to one and three quarters of an English busheLEx. a. 343 stallion is from the Babolau stud. He is of noble descent, his frame is strong and vigorous, and the Arab blood predominates. The studs are used for working every day throughout the year, with the exception of Sundays ;they are spared however a fortnight, both before and after foaling. The thriving state of the studs and foals is the best evidence of the suitable ness of the established order of feeding. The stable is plain and neat; it is high and light, in one word it is to the purpose and economical; the platform, obtained, by boards doubly folded one in the other, constitutes an arched vault, which is varnished to prevent bad air from perspiration, and there are wooden pipes arranged for leading off un wholesome vapors. For the greater convenience and to protect against colds, the watering is arranged in the stables. The watch is strict and puncture; to every two horses there is one man. For the attendance of the foals and the cleansing of the stables there are special servants. Agreeable as the general impression must be, which Swiss cattle at theMVarienthal dairy makes upon the stranger, it is nothing when compared to the sight reserved here for the farmer, of the fine stock of Miirzthal cows. This race combines nearly every one, if not every excellence :abundance of milk, disposition for fattening, and great strength for draught; and is raised here in its highest perfection. The full blood of this race is characterized by the small shaped head with broad forehead and broad mouth, short and fine horns, extended body, broad back and handsome neck, high and slender tail of considerable length, fine bluish hair, big udder, and on the whole by the stately and soft entire appearance. Those cattle that remain barren, are removed to Linz a, and are there used for draught, until they again grow ardent. The whole farm is managed by three persons who attend not only to feeding and milking, but also to the mowing and gathering of the green fodder. The cows are milk ed twice a day. In an average, each head gives seven hundred and fifty measures of milk; this at first sight may appear little, but it is owing to the fact that in the period of suckling, the cows are spared as much as possible. The bulls are used for co pulsating only to their fifth year, and are to. n sold. The cows are not coupled with the bull until they have completed two and a half years. Full calves are put to the yoke after being over three years c age. The arrangement of the cow house on the farm unites every thing that necessity and convenience require, and there is no where else in Hungary any thing like it. It is arched, high and well lighted. The manger goes through its whole length, in such a manner as to leave a plastered space of six feet in the rear, and of eight feet in front. The right wing of the farm contains the much chamber, the filter and the milk cellar, together with the eye house. In the filter room there is a well which furnishes the water to clean the vessels. All the reservoirs and so likewise the steps, staircases and benches are of red marble. The cleanliness observed here is exemplary, and deserves being imitated. The right wing of the farm is devoted to the calves, and contains the fodder chamber, where in summer the green fodder is spread on wooden scaffolds, in order to secure it from becoming heated. The spacious yard is covered with sand, and the enclosure is not of stone or wood, which might cause the cattle to suffer injury, but is made by a double line of ropes which, in order the better to stand the weather are tarred every year. I n side of the enclosure are the summer stalls or stands for the town. At the entrance of the stable and in front of every stall, there is a 344 X. dung hole lined with stones, and having a channel for the fluid, and above it a well. This hole, for the sake of cleanliness, is covered with boards in which suitable openings are made, in order, by means of the draught of air, to promote the decomposition and ferment at ion of the dung. There are two ze bus, (male and female) which were obtained direct from I india, and which are kept here in Marienthal. These animals belong to the genus of horned cattle, and are of the height ana scid127e of a middlingheifer. The horn of the male is round and has the color of wheat bread while that of the female is flat, and of a bluish, ash gray color. It seems, these animals form in I india two different varieties of the same kind, as in Hungary, for instance, the Miirzthal and Hungarian cows. This species of horned cattle is distinguished, particularly, by its fleshy half saddle which is found on their back at the root of the chin e, above the two shoulder. blades. The ze bu, then, in a measure, is the camel of the cattle genus, an epithet to which it is well entitled, even on account of it sameness and playfulness. They are treated like the other cattle, except that during the winter, they leave the stall only on fine warm days, as they require a higher degree of warmth. : Moreover, they are in perfectly good health, and the female ze bu, having made a miscarriage the first time, is at present, for the second time, in the state of pregnancy. The next coaling will, therefore, disclose interesting data, as to the capacity of this animal for breeding and milk production. There were a pair of ze bus formerly on this farm, which were rather larger; they did exceedingly well, they were continually in good health, until all of a sudden they died some few years ago. Previously to this the ze bu bull was coupled with a Miirzthal cow. The little bull born in consequence by the latter was free from the oriental knob in color and vivacity he resembled the father, though as to shape and height he was like his mother. It would have been interesting to make attempts at propagation g this bastard kind, but, unfortunately, the young ze bu had been castrated in consequence of gross inattention on the part of the herdsman. However, the oriental blood, thus condemned to the yoke, even it this low sphere acquired for itself the fame that it excess over its Miirzthaleompanions, by its speed and perseverance in drawing the yoke. The draught cattle of the manor are supplied by this farm, and any deficiency is made up from the wild breeding flocks of Hungarian cattle. Among all the horned races of Europe there is none which, with an equally colossal frame approach so near the speed of the horse, as do the Hungarian oxen. It is a race of cattle, which, by dint of their high and stately growth, their long horns, (nearly six feet in length) their proud and bold look, their broad breast and handsome white color, changing slightly into blue, and, lastly, the beautiful proportion of all their limbs, may fairly be pronounced to be one of the most useful and handsomest productions of gene rating nature. The Miirzthal oxen, however, are considered on all hands as better fitted, under a proper climate for conveying heavy loads slowly and for moderate distances. From 1836 9, the murray in made its ravages in the regions ofAlcsfith, and wrought terrible destruction; yet it never showed itself among le cattle of the manor, there being in such times the strictest seclusion maintained on the farms. It would be an utter impossibility for this sickness, if it should prevail in the neighborhood, to occur at Alcsith ; such is the cleanliness strictly followed here, such the abundance and uniformity of healthy food, such the constant employment of the cattle according to their strength. In the Linz a farm in 1838, a few head perished by the murray in, X. 
 345 as some of the servants no awful of their duties had i omit in contact with the infected region. The draught oxen, whose hoofs are worn out, are then shod. There remains to be mentioned the Chinese pigs kept on the Linz a farm, which are raised principally with a view to serve as food to the laborers employed in mowing and cutting the grass. This species is well known in different parts of the country. It is of small size, its long belly rests on very short legs, its bones are tender, its color is a dark bluish gray, it increases very fast, is easily fattened, and its flesh grown over with fat, has a fine flavor. The Hungarian domestic breeds, moreover, are much larger and superior. In England a much valued new race of pigs has been produced by a cross breed of the domestic with the Chinese pigs; still the original Hungarian race of pigs is far superior to the English and is much more like the Chinese. It is, therefore, very probable, that a coup long together of these two races would produce a happy result. Xxi .description of an .apparatus, for steaming food for cattle, with the estimate of the gain in feeding steamed chaff and fodder. If the nourishing particles contained in straw in its come state, and which, especially on account of their great quantity, cannot be :is solved by the animal organs of digestion in the short space of digesting and nominating, are prepared and rendered more digest able by being previously boiled or steamed, they will be found to give the cattle a much greater degree of nourishment. Getting out from this und enable position, there have been established a tall the larger farms at Alcsufth well constructed steam apparatus for steaming the cut straw before its being given to the cattle, i. e. for boiling it in hot steam, in order thereby to change it to a fodder at once more digestibleand more nourishing. The following is a description of the apparatus: (see Figs. 53. and 54.)o0? ; Y -1 275 r Of 0,tt?The upper boiler (a) is 5 feet in width below, its bottom trailed up 9 inches, and the sides are 15 inches high to the bend. The steam is conducted from the boiler into the cases b, b, by means of a pipe c, which leads into two 346 lax. arms, d, a, and which, by means of two s to ,cms, c, c, give the steam an outlet into either of the vessels. The cases made of pine wood are inform of a cone; they are bound, with hoops of iron, and are placed with their wider bottom upon stone sockets one and a half foot high. These cases are 7 feet high; their diameter is 7 feet 6 inches below, and 6 feet 10 inches above. In the top of the cases is a round opening of f, 15 inches in diameter, which serves to fill the cases with chaff from the left above1There is also on the lower side of the cases a square opening, g, by which the chaff when steamed is again taken out. To both the openings a recovers of wood, which are trimmed with coarse cloth or strong linen, and which are fastened by wooden or iron cross rails, so as to keep the openings the better closed. The small copper pipes marked h, serve for the escape of the steam after it has completely penetrated the chaff. Finally, "behind the boiler stands a wooden vessel i, which is placed in the earth, and which is loaded with beams; and from this vessel the water contained therein his conducted into the boiler by means of the pump k, and the funnel pipe 1. The chaff is steamed either by itself alone, or it is previously mingled with potatoes cut into small pieces; in this latter shape it is used as fodder only for cattle. The chaff is to be one half wheat and the other half o at straw. For horses and sheep it is cut half an inch long, for cattle a full inch. The hay of second and third qualities is likewise cut into chaff and fixed up with the chaff straw; it is put into the steam cases, whereby it haste is improved and its nourishing power much enhanced. A steam vat holds from 750 to 800 I is. of chaff. For cattle, there are mixed to one barrel of chaff three bushels of potatoes. Within an hour the whole is steamed, and 30 'such dec actions require, for firing, one half cord of hard wood. One man is sufficient to attend to the apparatus. An apparatus so extensive and costly, to be sure, can be made use of x. a. 347 only where there is a large consumption of chaff fodder; but, on the other hand, it will unquestionably give rise to a very material change in the system of supporting domestic animals. Although it is plain, at the, very outset, that these fodder arrangements are sure to give their project or a great profit; yet there is another question to be settled beforehand, namely, how will the health and breed of cattle, in the course of time, ultimately be affected by this system of feeding? It is evident no decision as to the general introduction of chaff feeding for the whole stock of the manor can be arrived at except by a very careful examination and consideration of the subject, and by previously submitting it to the test of experience. This trial was made, and it was found to succeed well; the system was generally introduced in 1839, and two years thereafter the measures taken by the director of Alcsuith were fully justified by their good success. For the animals fed chiefly with steamed chaff, continue in excellent health and condition; and the liveliness which the cattle show, both in the stall and in the yoke, is a clear proof that the food answers in the most perfect manner all the requirements of the animal organism, both of cattle for draught and breeding cattle. The following, which is drawn from official papers and books, and which refers to the winter of 1839 40, will show that this system ensures a considerable saving. Expenses for profit on 2000 old wet hers, for 120 days For 100 wet hers the daily winter fodder was formerly estimated at one met zen* of potatoes, and for each wet her 2 lbs. of hay and 1 lb. of straw for picking. I n the case of steamed food, on the other hand, 100 wet hers receive daily only 1 met zen of potatoes, and each wet her besides, one half pound of hay and 1 12 lb. of steamed chaff, consequently each receives 1 12 lb. less of bay, and 1 12 lb. more of straw. This, at the present prices of hay and straw, the former being 2 florids 30 kreutzerst a cut, and the latter 25 or. act, makes the saving of the 30 cut. less of the former amount to 75 dorans, and the excess of 30 cut. of the latter to 12 florids 30 kreutzers; so that with the entire stock of 2000 wet hers there is a daily saving of 62florins 30 kreutzersequal to                              $12.50.

Accordingly, at present an ox receives less daily one-eighth mint zen of potatoes and 10 les. of hay; and, on the other hand, receives 15 I is. more of straw a day. Hiss makes for 208 head a daily saving of 26 met zen of potatoes and of 2080lbs. of hay, which is 78 ll. a day; if we de duct from this the daily greater cost of 3 120 les of straw at 25 or, there remains a clear daily profit ll. 78" 13f l. 65 -                            $13*A Pressburg met zen is equal to 1 34 English bushel.

Charlestown, November 1, 1847. Dear Air: I trans or, t to you the following brief report of the agriculture of this region. I also enclose one that I wrote last year, but did not transmit, having heard that no appropriation was made for a report on the subject. The reason of my sending it is, the remarks and facts contained therein relative to the potato <a name="rot22"><mark>rot</mark></a>, a subject that has by no means yet lost its interest. The spring was unusually backward, the snow lying on the ground till nearly the end of April, so that the ground was not in a fit state for planting till two weeks later than is common, and even till the summer sol st ice: the nights were more than usually cool, as a whole, though there were none of the severe late frosts that sometimes occur. July was very hot and rather dry so much so, indeed, that on ridges and knolls of light warm soil the growth of the tubes of the potato was wholly stopped and they sprouted anew when the rain came again in abundance, which it did in the very last of the month. With the exception of a few days, August was unusually cool and damp, as also September and October, although severe frosts, in the latter part of the time, were unusually delayed. The first week of September was very hot and at the same time damp. Notwithstanding the lateness of the beginning of farming operations, on the first of August, the various kinds of produce had reached the usual degree of maturity of that time. Afterwards their progress to perfection was slow and their full maturity, in some instances, incomplete. The crop of hay was good, and extremely well cured, in both quantity and quality, rather above an average. Tops, of which the cultivation has been increasing in this region, yielded a good crop. The crop of apples was small and the fruit rather deficient in flavor. Means produced well, but their ripe king was imperfect, and it is probable, that when they come to be threshed, the crop will not be found large. Tompkins were small and imperfectly ripened. This, also, was the case with s qu ashes. Melons ripened imperfectly and were singularly wanting in flavor. Oats gave a good crop. Eye also, but wheat yielded poorly. It was in many places considerably injured by the weevil. The crop of corn was very good, but from imperfect ripe king there was more of soft than usual, and in some instances it moulded in the s talks from the dampness of the weather. Garden fruits, as plums, pears, gave but a light yield. Grapes of hardy hands yielded abundantly, but their ripe king was slow, and there was a want of sweetness in the later kinds. X. 
851The crop of potatoes wore a very promising appearance, on the whole, till the warm, sultry week in the beginning of September. The central <a name="black spot0"><mark>black spot</mark></a> in the leaves, the beginning of the <a name="disease102"><mark>disease</mark></a>, then made its appearance precisely as it had done in similar weather in the two preceding years, (see last years report accompanying this) and in a week the tubes began to be affected, probably from one third to one half of the crop was destroyed. Mr. Me e has published a work in which he attributes the <a name="disease103"><mark>disease</mark></a> to the ravages of a species of a his, which he calls the a his vast at or. I carefully examined the plants in my garden for the express purpose of discovering this a his, but found very few of them at the time the <a name="disease104"><mark>disease</mark></a> first showed itself not more than may be found at any time, and could discover nothing that would induce me to coincide with his conclusions. From the peculiar and similar state of the weather at each time that the <a name="disease105"><mark>disease</mark></a> has made its appearance, it seems most likely that its origin is owing to atmospheric dis temperature, and that if a p hides should make their appearance, they are more likely to be the attendants than the authors of the calamity. The character of the seed does not seem to be the cause, as I planted about the middle of June, a few hills of potatoes, just then received from Newzealand, where the <a name="disease106"><mark>disease</mark></a> has never made its appearance, yet the plants were attacked simultaneously with the others, and as badly. The long red potatoes, called here the long john, (I think the same as the mergers seemed to suffer the least. Very respectfully, yours, Samuel Webber. Remarks Of Potato Of Sease I N 1846. In the early part of the summer the potato crop was very promising; the vines were thrifty and the bloom early, and potatoes fit for the table came into use about the middle of July. In the 24th of July, I first noticed a change in the appearance of the vine. What first attracted my attention was a blackish spot, about the size of a finger nail, in the centre of many of the leaves. Upon examination this spot appeared to be dead, and was covered on the under side with <a name="mildew7"><mark>mildew</mark></a>. At this time the weather, for about a week, was very warm, sultry and damp, with frequent showers, and for a considerable part of the time, cloudy. The stem of the potato was, at this time, perfectly sound, as far as I could perceive, and I examined them very carefully. The <a name="black spot1"><mark>black spot</mark></a> increased rapidly in size day by day, and continually showed itself in leaves before sound, till by the fifth of August most of the leaves were delayed and dry. From the time the spot made its appearance, I dug every day two or three hills of potatoes for use, and purposely selected some of those in which the leaves were most affected. In the fifth of August, I for the first time, noticed symptoms of <a name="decay8"><mark>decay</mark></a> in the tubes. In a hill I then dug, there were found two potatoes very obviously and considerably unsound, and two or three more were found on preparing them for the table. The skin did not appear to be affected, but the substance beneath it was in spots, soft and semifluid, apparently to the depth of a quarter of an inch. One being cut open and examined with a microscope, the delayed part seemed like a mass of soft starch the cellular texture seemed to be destroyed and the starch 352 . X. g lobules loosened. The other potato was laid on a shelf, and after a few hours, a yellowish water was found to have oozed through the skin, and stood in drops upon the surface. As the dirt stuck somewhat tenaciously to the potato when first raised from the ground, some exudation had probably taken place previously. some days afterwards I noticed a <a name="fungus22"><mark>fungus</mark></a> growth on the outside, and this I attributed to the seeds of the <a name="fungus23"><mark>fungus</mark></a> having found a fitting nutriment in the watery fluid thus ex using from the skin, and mixing with and m listening the earth. From the time I first observed the <a name="decay9"><mark>decay</mark></a>, I continued to find one or two, sometimes three or four <a name="rotten6"><mark>rotten</mark></a> tubes in every hill, but the number did not increase, though the s talks gradually withered, and by the 20th of August, became entirely dry and sap less. The weather, after the 1st of August, was very dry and warm, and by the 6th or 7th, the earth around the potatoes in the hill became dry, and to this probably may be attributed the non appearance of the <a name="decay10"><mark>decay</mark></a> in potatoes not when affected, though it did not cease in those already attacked, but continued till the whole tube r was entirely destroyed, so that when the crop was in ally harvested, in the latter part of September, only a dry spongy dusk or skin was found in its place, in close contact often with, and even adhering to perfectly sound potatoes. I had an opportunity or two in the course of the season, and before the <a name="blight6"><mark>blight</mark></a> began, of witnessing the effect of the attack of worms upon the stem, having found one or two where the with was completely eaten out of more than half the length of the stem, by a yellowish worm about an inch long. In this case the leaves were not spotted, but the whole of them and the top of the stem drooped languidly, like those of a newly transplanted plant, and would probably have gradually withered and died, had I not broken in upon the process by cutting the stem off, in order to seek for the cause of its beginning. At the same time with the first appearance of the <a name="blight7"><mark>blight</mark></a> upon the potato, a similar one came upon the newly formed and partly grown ferries of two kinds of, foreign grapes which I cultivate the purple and the white Frontignacand completely destroyed the crop. The bunches became entirely mildewed and gradually turning black. These observations seem to confirm the opinion which as signs as the cause of the potato <a name="rot23"><mark>rot</mark></a>, some atmospheric influence, giving <a name="disease107"><mark>disease</mark></a> to the plant, causing an exudation of sap and destruction of the cellular texture, first in the leaf and then in the tube r, favored by moisture with warmth, while the <a name="mildew8"><mark>mildew</mark></a> and the <a name="fungus24"><mark>fungus</mark></a> are only sequences of this state. Respectfully yours, Samuel Webber. Charles town, J. H., Act. 20, 1846. Letter Of Of  Lli  Of Bacon, Esq. Of. Edmund Burke :dear Air: Your circular calling for agricultural statistics for the current year, was duly received, and would have been answered sooner had it not been for a delay in order that I might furnish myself with facts necessary to make my notice more perfect. I remark, first, upon the season. The winter of 1846 7 set in early m December, and gave us cold until nearly the last of that month, wheat x. a. 85 a warm time" set in which continued with the exception of a few days, made cooler by a change of wind, until January 20. Consequently most of our snow went off, and the frost to some extent broke up, and a considerable surface freezing arid thawing was the consequence. The latter part of January, winter again opened its rigors and continued unabated until April. The cold was in no instance, so severe as is usually the case in northern winters, as indicted by the thermometer, which I think in no instance marked more than 80 below 0, and this but once. Spring came on gradually. The snow, of which we had a large body, went off principally by. the agency of the sun, while cold northerly winds kept the air chilly with their unbroken influence. The earth was unfit for agricultural operations until nearly or quite May, consequently but little sloughing or sowing was done, until that month came in. May was cool and rather dry for grass, the ground after rains, being swept by high cold winds which not only dried the surface, but left it hard and impermeable, so that future rains failed in their effects. Consequently, the light rains of the early part of June had but little influence upon grass and winter grains, but more abundant showers commenced falling about the 20th, and were followed by a favorable atmosphere, and grass lands immediately presented an improved appearance. July was favorable to the growth of grass and small grains, though the season for their full maturity had so far passed as to destroy hopes of a full hay crop. Towards the close of the month the atmosphere became sultry, filled with frequent morning fogs, and the cry of "potato <a name="rot24"><mark>rot</mark></a>" again began to be heard from localities favorable to its existence. A change to a cooler atmosphere in August, however, seemed to stop its progress, and we hear no more of it until the middle of September. Autumn commenced, and indeed has passed, with fine weather for our climate. There was not frost enough to do any injury until October, when every thing was out of its reach; though a few days in September were so threatening in indications that much corn was cut and stacked to prevent injury from its effects. From the 2 1st of September a warm turn came on, with frequent fogs which continued until near the middle of October, when a heavy rain was followed by freezing weather, so cold as to affect potatoes in the ground. The last of October and November, up to this time, November 19, has been fine. In the morning of the 13,the first snow of the season appeared, m quantity just sufficient to whiten the roofs of buildings and give the mountains a wintry appearance, but when the sun came up it withered away. I have thus briefly run over the past season, rather as an explanation to the remarks that follow than for any other object, and will now proceed to the subjects matter of the circular, and here I may remark, that in many things the produce fell short in 1845, and they have also done so i 1847. They cannot either of them, be considered average years, for grass especially, fell far short this year from the crop of '46 and in '45 it was much less than in previous years. The wheat crops n 1847, there was probably nearly or quite double the quantity of land sown, when compared with '45. This was, for the most part spring wheat, of which almost every farmer sowed a little. The principal cause, probably, was the high price of flour, which farmers have become too much in the habit of buying. The quantity of seed sown per acre, depends on the variety of wheat. Of the black sea variety, that now 23 354 X. mostly cultivated, from a bushel to five pecks of seed, as the strength of the land will admit. Of other kinds, such as Iberian, &c, two bushels of seed is considered a fair medium quantity. Of the black sea wheat, the product per acre varies from fifteen to twenty bushels of sixty pounds to the bushel per acre; the average quantity, however, will not probably go over eighteen bushels. Other varieties less, say from ten to, in best crops, twenty bushels, average fifteen bushels. Time of sowing as early in spring as the season will admit. In 1847, from twenty fifth of April, to tenth of May, though but very little sown in April, and that in the earliest soils. Time of harvest, from August first to the tenth. Heat is worth                           $1.50 per bushel, but no more raised than consumed here. The kinds most successful are the black sea (which is most free from <a name="disease108"><mark>disease</mark></a> and the attacks of insect, and does not require so strong a soil, will give as many bushels per acre as winter rye on the same soil, with the same management) the sea wheat, Iberian wheat, the las, possessing more of the qualities of winter wheat. The success in raising wheat is such, as should induce every farmer to raise his family supply. Though the crop may not have been an average the past season, the success has been such as to warrant a continuance in sowing. A gain of seventy per cent. in quantity, may be estimated from 1845. Barley n this there has probably been a gain of fifteen per cent. Farmers are finding it valuable for feeding all kinds of domestic animals, more certain than corn or potatoes and less draining to the soil than oats The quantity of seed used, varies from two to three bushels per acre. Produce from thirty to forty bushels per acre, worth from sixty-two and a half to seventy-five cents per bushel. One raised for foreign market. Down as early as the season will admit, and harvested in July. It will do well on any feasible plough land. This and the wheat crop are the two best for stocking after, Oatsno essential variation perhaps in the quantity of land sown. If any thing an increase, may be it would be safe to say of ten or fifteen per tent. The price last spring was high, and grass lands were killed out in many places, in consequence of which, they were in some instances turned over and sown to this crop in which, had the grass looked more favorable, it would have remained in sod. The quantity of seed sown varies with different farmers, on different soils, and in different localities, to from two to three bushels er acre. Our best farmers now sow the latter quantity, but for an average, two and a half bushels would probably be a fair estimate. The quantity harvested of course is various. Some remarkable good crops have reached eighty bushels, but these are very rare. Taking all the varieties of soil sown, and other things attending the crop such as time of sowing, &c, thirty-five bushels will probably be a fair estimate. The time of sowing varies from the first opening of the season (this year from the twenty fifth of April to May the twentieth) They are a crop that the farmer puts in at his convenience, though those earliest sown give the heaviest grain, and are less liable to attacks of rust on the straw, which almost invariably attends those late sown, and cause the grain to fill badly, from <a name="blight8"><mark>blight</mark></a>. The time of harvest extends from August the first unto September. The average per cent. consumed by the farmer is probably about thirty-three. The surplus mostly sent to the Boston market. Present price at home, forty-five cents per bushel. Ryethis crop being liable to winter or spring kill, is just going out of fashion. There has probably been a falling off from 1845 of thirty per cent; cause, its liability to kill out. The quantity of seed sown, five. X. 'a. 355 necks per acre; twelve, at most fifteen bushels per acre is the average produced. Price eighty cents per bushel. All consumed at home. Owing should be performed as early as the middle of August, unless the ground is in a high state of cultivation, or the soil very warm and quick, when it maybe deferred to the tenth of September. Mostly harvested in July. Buchwheati n this crop there has probably been an increase over that of '45 in land sown of one hundred per cent, for the causes, that the potato has become an uncertain crop; that the lateness and coldness of the season led to fears that the corn crop would be short, and the excellency of the crop in subduing tough and unmanageable soils, and its tendency to eradicate foul and noxious weeds. Buckwheat is considered a noble warrior for contending with the Canada whistle, which has for years been pushing its conquests in many parts of the northern states. An enterprising farmer has recently informed me that three years since he had a field completely overgrown with this vile plant, which flowers in spring, and again at sowing time, early in June. His first crop of buckwheat more than r paid for the labor twice over, and a diminution of whistles was very evident at harvesting. The next season he gave two ploughingcid127as before, which kept those whose roots yet remained, in the back ground, and in autumn he harvested, a still better crop of buckwheat, while he saw his whistles rapidly running out. This year he has pursued the same course of two sloughings and sowing, and had the best crop of the three years. He said, that at the last harvesting, he did not believe that a dozen whistles could be found in the field. The rational e of the matter is this, the two spring sloughings kept the whistles, back, and the growth of the buckwheat is so rapid, that it shades the land before they can overcome their stinted condition, and they have no territory to grow in, and no sunshine to aid their growth, so they must die. The usual quantity of seed sown is a bushel per acre, but in using this quantity it must be remembered, that the more barren lands are usually taken for this crop. In strong lands, such as are adapted to corn, &c, a less quantity must be used, else with its branching prop enmities it will grow so thick as not to seed well. Twenty-eight bushels per acre is as near an average yield for the present, as we are able from the facts before us to estimate. I that sold readily this fall at home, at fifty cents per bushel. Twentyfiveper cent. of the amount raised is consumed by the farmer who raises and purchases in his vicinity. Down from the fifth to the twentieth of June. Harvested in September. Down mostly on poor soils, but occasionally after a failure of other crops on a good one. I indian Cornthis valuable crop, which makes the farmers fields look so rich at harvest time, lays such a solid, foundation to his pork, contributes so essentially towards furnishing a supply of warm dough nuts, and loads his table with such health full and delicious puddings, has we are happy to say, notwithstanding the un promising attitude of spring, received increased attention the last season. The increased quantity over 1845, is full thirty-three per cent, for the simple reasons that some farmers, who for some years thought it cheaper to buy than raise their supply, were taught by last years prices, that buying was not so cheap after all, and others who had been in the habit of raising were sure that it was doing so well that it was best to try to raise more. The coldness of the early part of the season, had a, tendency to retard its growth, but Yankee corn will grow in spite of high, chilly winds, provided jack frost keeps his fingers off. When the cut worm lays lurking in s ward lands with famished appetite, and he came to take toll before it was ready for the mill. But after all the influence of cold and 8 56 X. the destruction of worms, the crop has been a good one, and an unusual number of pieces were entered for premiums, many of which were estimated at one hundred (some more) bushels per acre. Such crops, however, are easier imagined than raised, and the half bushel too often exposes the frailty of human judgment. That such crops are sometimes raised, we will riot doubt; but we a ver that seventy-five bushels of shelled corn an acre, is a great yield, and we think thirty-five a full average for western Massachusetts. New corn, though it can hardly be said to have become merchant able, is selling readily at seventy-five cents per bushel. The spring price varied from                           $1.00 to                           $1.10, but we can hardly be expected to reach so high this year. One third is probably consumed in the region where raised. The remainder is mostly sent to Boston market for shipping. Time of planting in 1847 from May 5th to the 25th, and mostly harvested in September. Almost every kind of I indian corn is raised which will adapt itself to the short summer of the north, but the prevailing one is. an eight rowed one of a hard and flint y character, which gives good weight of grain and furnishes a sweet rich meal. The corn of the last season was mostly cut up by the ground through fear of early frosts, a process which tends to increase the value of the stalls for fodder without injury to the corn, provided it is rightly managed. But the berne l (the part for which the crop is more particularly raised) should be pretty thoroughly hardened before the process takes place, or the weight will be light and the meal un savory. When the corn is bound in bundles, and stacked in this process of cutting up the storms penetrate the middle of the bundle, and the fodder and the ear, are both liable to sour and <a name="mould19"><mark>mould</mark></a>, while the labor of gathering becomes heavy and disagreeable from the weight of the bundles. A much better way of doing up the thing is coming in practice, which is to cut up some four or five hills and set them around a standing one very loosely, tie the tops to the standing one with a wisp of straw, to prevent their falling or being blown over by the wind. The storm and the wind will readily pass through these stacks, and if one wets, the other will dry. At harvesting, it is only to cut the standing hill, and throw the bundle on the cart, a process easily and rapidly performed. Potatoesnotwithstanding the ravages of the <a name="disease109"><mark>disease</mark></a> which has prevailed so universally for a few seasons past, farmers have held up very good courage. with regard to this valuable esch lent, yet there has probably been a falling off in the quantity of land planted, of about thirty-three per cent merely in consequence of the dread anticipation of the <a name="disease110"><mark>disease</mark></a>. The average, quantity of seed is probably twenty bushels per acre, some planting as lo was fifteen and others in a few cases going as high as thirty bushels. It would be very difficult the present year to give an average produce per acre. Sixty bushels has been considered a good crop, and from that quantity they produced fewer sound ones, until you came to fields so badly infected that they were not dug. 'but few persons have them for market, but the few sold, have brought from fifty to sixty cents. The average amount consumed where raised, is as great as seventy-five per cent. They were planted last spring through the month of May, and harvested from September 15th to October 20. The kinds most successful here were those provincially calledlongjohns, a long rather coarse red potato; the orange, so named from its for, and the each blow, also a red potato. The early kinds, such as the kidney, whose s talks matured before the plague fell upon them, were not, i any instance that I have heard of, at all affected. The mergers and carters, two favorite varieties, suffered most. In dry and porous soils they have x. a. 357 usually succeeded best, though in deep and lucky lands which have been thoroughly drained, they have this year done remarkably well. We have seen carters raised on: land of the latter description, as fine as the imagination could desire. With regard to diseases, they have been subject to none that we know of, except the modern plague, " the <a name="rot25"><mark>rot</mark></a>" which in consequence of the coolness of the season and frequent rains, we hoped they would escape, and no complaint was made of its appearance until a turn of warm weather in August, attended with a damp foggy atmosphere. But very few instances, and those of but slight infection occurred at that time. When the air became purer, and free from these visitations of fogs, the progress of the <a name="rot26"><mark>rot</mark></a> appeared to stop, at least we heard no more of it until near the close of September, during which time farmers were beginning to console themselves with the hope that the <a name="evil32"><mark>evil</mark></a> was passing away. But it returned with greater power than ever, and its first and most fatal effect was upon the carters and mergers. Early in October it was supposed that owing to the lateness of the season, three-fourths of the crop might be saved, but at least that proportion was entirely lost, or so much infected as to unfit them for c urinary purposes. In some instances they were so bad that farmers gave up digging, while in very many, after a hard days work they found themselves rewarded with but little more than enough, after the labor of raising, use of land, &c. to pay them the wages of day laborers. The atmosphere was subject to frequent fogs, at the time of its second appearance. The commencement and progress of the <a name="disease111"><mark>disease</mark></a> was i marked with somewhat different appearances, than those formerly witnessed. The leaf turned yellow and fell off, nearly simultaneously with the attack of the rust upon the vine, and in some instances in advance of it. The rapid progress of <a name="rot27"><mark>rot</mark></a> in the tube r was not the immediate result as formerly. The plague spot was seen under the cuticlespreading its poisonous influence as before, and often extended itself until it enveloped the whole potato. This portion of them, if they were placed on a dry floor or even a dry, too. cellar, shrunk away and became a hard valueless substance. If they were put in warm cellars, inclining to moisture, they <a name="rotted9"><mark>rotted</mark></a> and that was the end of them. Their freedom from putrid nausea us <a name="rot28"><mark>rot</mark></a>, while remaining in the ground we attribute mainly to the lateness of the reason, and the coolness which it naturally produced. With regard to the origin of the <a name="disease112"><mark>disease</mark></a>, our early opinion is more fully confirmed by each years observation, that it arises from a peculiar state of the atmosphere, and is more or less virulent from predisposing causes in the plant, arising from the soil in which it is raised, and the method of cultivation attending its growth. That its first symptoms appear in the vine, in the form of a rust or <a name="blight9"><mark>blight</mark></a>, somewhat similar to that which often fastens upon the wheat stalk, we believe is a fact more generally acknowledged every year. That this rust checks the free circulation of juices taken up by the roots, and carried into the top for elaborate on, where portions unnecessary or injurious to the health and growth of the tube r may be given to the winds and allows them to return and feed it with their poison, which results in its <a name="decay11"><mark>decay</mark></a>, we think a reasonable inference. Wherever the vines grow h luxuriantly the <a name="disease113"><mark>disease</mark></a> is almost certain to make an early attack; ferment ing manures, also, appear to aid its progress; compact soils, or those liable to become so, after heavy rains, are wholly unfit for the crop, with its present liabilities to <a name="disease114"><mark>disease</mark></a>. Any preventives have been tried. Among those said to be most success 38 X. full, it seems from all accounts that light lands are in the first place to oe selected for the potato. Hence, in deep sandy soils they have been found to be uniformly better, through the several years the <a name="rot29"><mark>rot</mark></a> has prevailed, than in any other. The few instances where they have been planted the present, year, on deep much lands, well drained, gives us encouragement to hope that they will uniformly succeed in such lands, which all who have observed them must know are exceedingly light and pliable in their texture. But of this v we cannot yet speak positively. They may have, failed on similar lands in other localities. Owing lime on the land after planting, and hoping is said, in several instances, to have had a good effect, while putting lime and lime ashes in the hill, have failed of beneficial results. Spreading charcoal, coal dust, liberally on the surface, in like manner, is said. to have been an almost infallible safeguard. These two substances are well known to possess excellent antiputrescent qualities, but if the <a name="disease115"><mark>disease</mark></a> originates in the roots or tube r, why not place them there ?a? The experiment of doing so, has been tried, and as far as we have heard, has failed in every instance, while, when they have been spread on the surface, and kept in continual contact with the atmosphere, a good effect has resulted. Owing the tops before the <a name="disease116"><mark>disease</mark></a> strikes them has also saved many, but it is objectionable to some because it stops their growth. It must be done in order to succeed well, before they become infected. He, last spring, in our own experiment, omitted maturing on half of our field, while on the other half it was spread on and harrowed in. The rows were then struck out by, sloughing furrows, about six inches deep, and the crop was planted on the bottom of the furrow. There we did not manure, ours were very from <a name="rot30"><mark>rot</mark></a>; where the manure was spread, three out of five were infected. In a corner of the field where the soil was what, in Yankee phrase, is often designated as." clammy a stiff, unyielding soil and very rete native of moisture nearly all were worthless, while in another corner of black much land, they were uniformly large and good. It is the hope and expectation that perseverance will go forward in her work until the cause of this <a name="disease117"><mark>disease</mark></a>, and palliatives, if not perfect remedies may be found adapted to every soil and locality. It is surely a great calamity, thus to have one of our most valuable and health full products cut off year after year. But lamenting the misfortune can be of no avail, and the idea that it will result in the annihilate on of the article, seems almost an unnecessary absurdity. It may do so to be sure, and yet it is quite as probable that something may be sought out and done, that will restore it very nearly or quite to its former productive ness. He who first accomplished this will be a benefactor to the world. In many localities the hay crop has come in very light, especially on uplands. This is attributed by some to the ice that formed on the surface after a general thaw n January. If so, why were not its effects seen on intervals where the formation was more general ?I t may have originated in the grounds freezing suddenly when full of water, thereby injuring the roots, but we attribute it mainly to the circumstance, that our snow in spring went off slowly, and that the water and the earth were kept cold by piercing wind, and that being subject for a long time to the wrenching of this cold water, it was destroyed. The grass crop of 1845 was unusually light; that of the present year was probably about as much so. In both years, there was a falling off of the usual quantity of at least one-fourth, as a whole, on many farms one half, while on others, a medium crop was harvested. The quantity for the present years x. a. 359 will not probably average more than a ton and one-fourth per acre. I n some meadows, it was not more than five hundred, where good crops were given last year. -from this small quantity it will range to two and a half tons per acre. Hemp andflaxNone of the former raised. I find, on reference to the statistics of the several branches of industry, published by the state in 1845,that the quantity of flax raised in Berkshire in 1844 was only four thousand, one hundred and eighty-nine pounds. We venture to estimate an increase on that quantity of ten per cent. Tobaccowe are quite too far north to make a business of raising this article, though we have many thorough going consumers. More is raised now however than formerly, as more choose to raise their own. We anticipate a gain of thirty-three per cent, and put the quantity for Berkshire at three hundred pounds. Silkprobably not so much raised in Western Massachusetts as in 1845, by one half, quantity very small. Sugar manufactured from the mapleThe increasing demands for wood, a considerable quantity of which is necessary in producing the article, has a tendency to check its manufacture; though the quantity made this year, over that of 1845, we think has increased about five per cent. The amount manufactured in our county, we think, will not fall short of 260,000 pounds, some of which, for fine ness of grain and color, and richness of flavor, will entitle it to rank with the best muscovadoThe probable proportion of cultivated to uncultivated landsTheinquiry of course includes wood lands among uncultivated. Going so, and stopping there, we should say that three-fourths of our mountain region was under cultivation, and one-fourth in wood lost approved rotation of crops Different farmers have different opinions, and different soils require different management. For ourselves, we would plant, and follow with a wheat crop, to be succeeded with grass, herds and red top for three or four years. Some prefer oats after corn, and before stocking. Others, barley, oats and peas. Any turn over s ward land in the fall or spring, sow oats two seasons, and stock. Others sow barley on the inverted sod, and stock; and so on, almost every farmer having his own favorite way. Foot crops he have spoken on potatoes. The sugar be et is raised by some, and much approved, as is also the carrot. Of each of these, from five to six hundred bushels per acre, or in that proportion, would probably be a fair yield, though they sometimes go as high as eight hundred bushels. These crops are usually raised in small patches, however, and so large afield as an acre is rarely seen. Turnips may be estimated at five hundred bushels per acre, under very favorable circumstances seas usually give about twenty, and from that to twenty-five bushels per acre; are considered a profitable crop for feeding swine. Means, for the most part, are raised among corn, and most farmers raise them in that way. Of course, no fair estimate of what an acre would produce if planted to them done, can be given. The orchards increasing attention is being given to all kind of fruit, apple in particular, of which many new orchards are in the process of being set. Years and plumbs are receiving considerable attention, as are alsocherries. Reaches and grapes are beginning to ripe n in a few gardens indifferent sections of the county, and " promise to pay' the rent of soil and 360 X. Doc. To: 54.labor of cultivation, with their rich and healthy products. Strawberries are but seldom cultivated, but grow plentifully in old, exhaLcid127ted meadows. I tis the farmers economy to take this plant under his protecting care, as he values its excellence. The labor of raising them in the garden will occupy no more time than going to the field to gather them; and if he does raise them he is sure to have them, but how often is he disappointed and vexed, on going to his field, to find that some fugitive rec re ant has anticipated his arrival, and borne away the harvest. And besides, meadows are the place for grass, and not for ferries. Dairythere is an increase of the quantity of butter and cheese manufactured from 1845. The low price of wool for the last year is a probable cause. We have now good facilities for getting our butter and cheese to Boston or New York markets, and they will probably hereafter meet with more attention. Good butter has sold through the season, up to October 1,for sixteen cents and two thirds a pound. It is now worth from twenty to twenty-two. In the matter of raising horses and cattle, there is probably but little variation for the last two years. It has been the practice of our dairy men to kill their calves when young, or hand them over to the butcher as soon as he would accept them, to a very great extent, in order to save as much milk as possible. But the present high prices of cattle leads us to suppose that there will be more raised for a while than has been usual. To too with horses. Beef is worth from five to six dollars per hundred when killed. Sides five and a half cents per pound, Sheep, a decline of numbers, though not a great diminution. The average weight of flee ce is thought by competent judges, and "by comparing notes, "to be three pounds. The price has ranged from thirty to fifty-five cents per pound. The average may be set at forty cents. Button is worth four, five, six cents per pound. Skins from thirty-seven and a half to sixty-two and a half, and extra large seventy-five cents apiece. Dogs about the usual number. Average weight two hundred and fifty pounds; price per pound, by the hundred, from seven to seven and a half cents. Poultry and eggs Poultry is receiving more attention every year and well it may, especially hens, for there is no animal that yields greater profit in proportion to first cost and expense of i keeping than poor bid dy. Well managed, she will pay for herself half a dozen times over in a year have a plenty of time to rest, and, if you are not watchful over her education, some to do mischief. When worn down with age, her car case will always, with a little care, sell for more than first cost, to be placed under the dissecting knife of the epi cure. Eggs have been worth twelve and a half cents a dozen through the season, and are now selling for sixteen cents. Beesthe last two seasons have been unusually fatal to many hives, in so much, that many stocks have run out and nearly all been so much reduced that at the present time there are not so many, by one third, as there were in the fall of 1845. The cause is probably owing to the fact, that many hives commenced those winters with too weak populations, and that they perished from being left in locations too much exposed to the severe ties of our frowning climate. In all the hives where they so died, so far as we have heard, they left ample supplies of honey for their winter subsistence. It is a fact, that cannot be too. widely disseminated, that bees should x. a. 361 be well protected from storms and from high and searching winds. In a northern climate, put them, when the weather begins to be cold and boisterous, into a tight dry building. If it is dark, so much the better; if cold, no matter, provided the hives are ventilated. If they are disposed to come out on a warm day, throw a blanket over them to make it darker. The average amount of honey in common hives will not vary much from forty pounds. Line honey has sold for twelve and a half cents per pound, box honey, twenty to twenty-five cents per pound. Manuresfarmers are every year becoming more economical in the saving and application of manures, which is a great improvement. They are also seeking out new resources for their increase. Of course, everything that tends to increase its value is deposited in the manure heap. I n addition to this, much turf from the way side and much from the swamp, is yearly made into com post and forms an admirable dressing for grass land. An intelligent farmer, whose mind is always on the look out for something to enrich his fields, informs me that he has made, what to him is a valuable discovery, in the following preparation, viz: he saves all his hen manure with the greatest, care, through the year: in the spring, he, takes it, when thoroughly, dry, and with a common flail reduces it to powder, after which he: adds an equal quantity of gypsy m and another equal part of ashes making a third e of each) r and incorporates; them well :together. This preparation he applies to his corn, by putting half a pitt in a hill, and he assures me, that this small quantity will produce as good an effect, as a shovel full of well <a name="rotted10"><mark>rotted</mark></a> barn yard manure. Wages of labor. Arm laborers' command it en, eleven and twelve dollars per month, through the year. In the summer si months, men, fro a twelve to fifteen dollars. May laborers, at having and harvest, from one dollar to one dollar and; twenty-five cents, at other farm work, from sixty-two and a half to seventy-five cents. In winter, by the month, from eight o ten' dollars. By the day, fifty to sixty-two and: a half cents, though but few farmers hire in winter: unless it be for chopping by the cord. Mechanics, from a dollar to a dollar and fifty cents per day, or from eighteen to thirty dollars per month. Female domestics, from fifty cents to one dollar and seventeen cents per week, according to goodness and service required. Common price one dollarbonenumerated articesMillet is beginning to receive some attention in this region. I to ,productive ness and value as a fodder, entitle it to more general notice. From E. Williams, Esq, of this, town, who has sown it for two years past, I gather the following. facts: He turns, over exhausted meadow land soon after planting, spreads on manure at the rate of twelve or fourteen loads per acre, harrows thoroughly and sows. Quantity of seed sown, sixty-nine quarts per acre. Amount of fodder harvested, four tons per acre, by weight, when cured; equal to corn s talks when cured for sheep or young stock; gives from twenty to twenty-four bushels of seed per acre, which sells for one dollar per bushel and is valuable for fowls. Owing corn for fodder has been tried, to some extent, with very good success. Management similar to that of mille t, only that a greater amount of seed is necessary. From two to. three bushels 'are. used, sowing thick causes the stalk to grow small and if well cured it is greedily devoured by animals. I to value for horses speaks loudly in, its commendation, especially when they are accustomed to dry fodder, its loosening qualities are highly beneficial. When horses are subject to worms its good effects are also annex. elusive; I to sac charing qualities probably induce the worms to quit their hold upon the animal to feast upon its richness and they are gone, ere they are aware of it. It must be cut finely before feeding of course. S I have continued my remarks altogether beyond my first expectation, which seemed necessary in order to give a glance at the numerous topics of enquiry. Hours truly, Of  Lli  Of Baconrichmond, Massachusetts, Sov. 24, 1847. Agri Cultural Boots, Albany, January 26, 1848.. On. Edmund Buri Of, Commissioner of Patents n answer to your letter requesting the aggregate amounts of our crops c, it is proper to say that the very short period allowed to make up returns, will prevent my giving as full a statement as I might have done, had  received your request at an earlier period. I can only give you a general statement as to 'the crops of the year 1847, and also extracts from the returns of some of our county societies which speak more particularly in relation to the crops of the last year. The annexed general statement will show as near as can be ascertained at this time, the characteristics of the season, and the general view of the agriculture of the state. Wheatof this crop it may be said that, notwithstanding the unfavorable appearance of the early part of the season, it proved a fair crop the quality in most parts of the state remarkably good. I n: some parts of the state the crop was injured by an open winter. The yield of the whole state is believed to have been an average of former years. Bearleythe crop of barley is less than usual. The yield per acre in the best barley districts of the state, much below the average of former years. The appearance of the crop previous to harvest was very fine, but owing to the dry weather probably, a diminished yield was the result. Oatsthe crop of oats was large, The yield in many counties varying from 70 to 100 bushels per acre. The increase of this crop from superior cultivation is very considerable. Biuckwheatthis crop was remarkably good, and- the season being favorable to its maturing, i, was secured in good condition, and may be considered more than an ordinary yield. I indian Cornthis crop was much larger than usual, probably one third more land under cultivation than is usual. The crop generally excellent. I n some portions of the state the weather in the fall was unusually damp and the cob did not dry readily and some fields were injured, still taking the state together there is a very large increase. Potatoesthe potato crop has proved a light yield, and the <a name="disease118"><mark>disease</mark></a> has prevailed to a very re at extent. To remedy has been discovered, although theories in abundance have been put forth careful attention to the selection of seed and preparation of the ground, use of lime on the tube r at planting, and planting early varieties and harvesting early, have, where adopted, seemed mostconducive to sound and healthy tubes. X. a. Hayhas proved an average crop from one and a half to two tons per acre. In many instances a much larger yield, from three to three and a half tons. Flaxthe crop of flax is not extensive in this state, but increased attention it is believed is being given to it. Tobaccothis is cultivated to a very limited extent in a few localities. Will  c The culture of silk is not extensive; attention is given to it in some few localities, but it is believed that if suitable attention was given to it a supply for our own use might be manufactured and with advantage and profit. Sugarmaple sugar is made to a large extent and the quality is improving, and in some sections of the state sugar equal to the very best cane sugar is made. By the census of 1840 the quantity of sugar in this state returned was eleven million pounds and upwards. In our census of 1845 it was very unfortunately omitted. There can be little doubt, that it now exceeds the amount returned in 1840, and of far superior quality. Most approved Rotation of Cropsthere is no system so general as to be given as the best rotation for the whole state, embracing so wide an extent of country, and a very great diversity of crops. Our best farmers however, are giving attention to such a succession of crops as will best secure the fertility and productive ness of the soil, and obtain the most economical expenditure of the manure used. The improvements which are making among our farmers, in regard to system in their modes of cultivation is in the highest degree encouraging. Foot Cropsthe cultivation of root crops is attended to in some portions of the state, and the average yield, when these crops receive attention may be stated per acre for sugar bees, from 500 to 800 bushels; carrot s 800 to 1000; rut a bag a, from 800 to 1300. Seas and Beansthe average yield of peas and beans is from 20 to 40 bushels per acre, varying much, according to the method of cultivation. Fruitthe increased attention which is given to the cultivation of fruit in this state is very encouraging. Agricultural and horticultural associations are making increasing efforts to interest farmers in the subject. The demand for apples, both for domestic and foreign markets is increasing and the quantity shipped the past season from the interior of the state is very large. To show the extent of this business, I give an extract from a communication from One ida county, one of our central counties: My estimate of the quantity of apples shipped from this place (mostly from four towns year before last, ten thousand barrels, last year (the crop not being as large seven or eight thousand barrels, and this year not much short of eighteen thousand barrels. Prices have averaged from sixty-two and a half cents to one dollar per barrel net t. Our orchards usually comprise from one to four acres and many of them yield from 1 to 150 dollars, according to the number of cultivated trees in each. Perhaps the most productive orchard in this county is the one known as the Good sell orchard, which was mostly grafted the individual who occupied the farm year before last, informed me that he picked and sold over one thousand barrels that year, which sold for over one thousand dollars. Last year was not as large, but the past season  presume was as much or more. This orchard contains about six acres, a large proportion of the trees grafted, &c." From other portions of our states    could give similar extracts, but the above will show the importance of well cultivated fruit to the interest of the agriculturists 364 X, a. Other varieties of fruit such as pears, plums, peaches, cher rise as well as the; smaller varieties, are cultivated increasingly throughout the state. Dairiesthere has been a large increase this year in cheese, and butter probably about the usual quantity. A steady improvement is making in the quality of cheese and butter. The foreign demand for cheese is calling for an article suited to the market and different from cheese used in this country, and the kind desired is now furnished in great perfection. The quality of much of the butter made in the central and western counties of the state equals that made in any part of the country for its valuable and preserving qualities in hot climates. A letter received from an extensive provision merchant in New Work says- Any fairies which I could mention received from Chemungcounty, have been sent to New Orleans to my certain knowledge, and they stand the climate equal to any Range county fairies, and they fetch as high a price as any of the Range county Another says" The butter made in the county of Chemung is equal to that made in Range county, and will stand the southern climate as well. Also that made in Tompkins county is well suited for shipment south, and stands the salt air as well as any butter received at New Work might multiply remarks of this kind, but these are sufficient to show, that the range of country in this state, where butter which will stand the test of heat and climates and foreign voyages, is not confined to one locality, but extends to a very large portion of the state. This is a fact that is but little understood abroad, and should attract the attention of those who are making large contracts for butter. Stockthere is a manifest improvement of neat cattle and horses in this state. The introduction of short horn, He von, Hereford and Ayrshire cattle, into the state, has proved of great advantage to the grower of stock. A cross with our native cattle has in many cases proved highly successful, and the more extended use of thoroughbred animals, will still more increase the value of our stock. We have several herds of improved animals in the state, and the extension of these animals will continue to improve the stock of the state. Our agricultural associations have proved useful in directing the attention of our farmers to the improvement of their animals, and while, in every respect these associations have proved useful to the agricultural interest, in this department, they have proved most highly advantageous. 4SheepThe growth of wool is quite extensive in this state. The average weight of flee ce, I presume, is not far from three and a half pounds, and the price from thirty-five to thirty-seven and a half cents per lb. Sheep for mutton are raised to some extent, and as their value shall be more fully appreciated they will be far more extensively reared. Fool depots depot for the sale of wool has been established in Hinder hook in Columbia county, about fourteen miles from Albany, and has ben in operation about two years. It has proved, so far, highly successful, giving to the farmer the opportunity of having his wool disposed of at fair prices at an expense of one cent per pound besides insurance. It is believed that when this system is more fully known it will be generally adopted through our wool growing districts. I Manuresmuch more attention is given to the preparation of manures and their adaptation to the various crops grown. Training improvements in draining are being carried on to a considerable extent; and as the foundation of all good husbandry, will continually receive more and more attention. X. a. I annex extracts from some of the reports of county so cries showing the interest which is taken in agriculture and its advance rent in our state. Cayuga To" Heat has been the natural product and staple of our county. Upon the establishment of our society, the attention of farmers was directed to seasons bearing on particular crops; to the difference in soils and the natural adaptation of each for the growth of particular crops to manure, and the application of the same, in their, different forms, to the earth, from which a given crop was expected." The past year has been one of general prosperity in this county. The average crop of grain has been moderate, although the potato crop, for the most part, has been lost by <a name="disease119"><mark>disease</mark></a>. Our last annual fair was held at U burn. The exhibition of horses and cattle exceeded our most sanguine expectation: about three hundred animals were entered for premiumsCHATI  Auque" The dairy business is increasing more than any other branch of agriculture: the product of the dairy now forms a very heavy item of export from the countyCLI  Nton- " The cause of agriculture is steadily increasing in this county under the influence of the society. The sixth annual show was held in October, and passed off with great spirit, and was considered decidedly the most interesting exhibition ever held in this countyCOLUMBI The fair surpassed any previous one ever held in this county, especially in horses and cattle, and every thing manifested, that the farmers and mechanics instead of getting wearied with these annual exhibitions, are becoming more and more pleased with themCORTLAND" There was a manifest increase of interest in most departments of the fair, particularly in regard to the dairy, (the staple of this county) The principal agricultural products of this county, are butter, cheese, wool, beef, pork, oats and corn. There has not been wheat enough grown for several years past for home consumption. The products are mostly marketed in this county; the butter, cheese, wool and beef is eventually sent to the eastern markets; the pork to the coal regions of Pennsylvania; oats and corn to Syracuse and I thick. The prices obtained this year, have ranged, for butter, 15 to 16 cents per lb; cheese 6 to 7 cents beef          $3 per hundred; pork     $5; oats per bushel 30 to 40 cents; corn (last years crop) from 50 to 75 cents. There are some large fairies in this county which yield more than 150 lbs. of butter per cow, and others that turn out 400 lbs. of cheese per cow. I indian corn, the average crop with good farmers, is believed to be from 50 to 75 bushels per acre, and of oats from 49 to 60.

The potatoes planted in 1845 were the small potatoes of the year before, and about the size of a hickory nut, or a trifle larger, and dug when green and before the usual 366 X. time of digging, and preserved through the winter.

Another 257 " " 11 "a( 2 " 'ONEI Of" The agricultural interests of the county have been constantly increasing since the organization of our society, as is manifested in the great improvements which have been made in our horses, cattle, sheep, &c; in grain and root crops; in the products of the fairies, not only in quantity but in quality, and in the diminished expense of production." The principal agricultural products of this county are, butter, cheese, wool; the various kinds of grain, viz. I indian corn, oats, barley, wheat, rye, together with root crops and hay; horses, cattle and sheep. The prices of produce the present year have varied very much and have been constantly changing, yet on the average they have been regenerating to the farmer, and better than they usually are. Almost all kinds of produce have commanded ready cash. Butterone cow (ten years old) three quarter native and onequarterDurham, on grass feed, yielded 50 lbs. of milk per day, and, made 17 lbs. 5 oz. butter in one week. A he ifer two years old, one week in June, from her milk was made 8 lbs. 5 oz. butter. Eighty much cows were on exhibition at the annual fair of this society. Onondagathe societys exhibition was one of the most interesting ever held. In this county farmers' clubs have been established for two years hold meetings weekly for discussions, which have proved very interesting, and highly useful. Rensselaerbutter made from three cows, in thirty successive days, commencing 12th June, feed, pasture only, 106 lbs. 4 oz.

Heat, is gradually taking the place of rye, and is considered to yield as much per acre." Worn is raised in considerable quantities, and averages from thirty to forty bushels per acre, though fifty and sixty bushels is not rare; oats from thirty to sixty bushels per acre, and sells for 44 cents; potatoes are raised in large quantities and average 50 to 75 cents per bushels, being in the vicinity of the New York market. All varieties have suffered much from the <a name="rot32"><mark>rot</mark></a>. Very early planting, in light soils has been the only preventive. Fairies n this county, farmers on and near the line of rail road, send their milk to New Work, and receive from 1 to 3 cents per quart, and some diaries average        $40 per cow, annually. Milkone cow gave last week in December, 23 quarts per day; her feed dry hay and turn is. .a. .a. .a. 161 its. per week.

Senecai n this county, town associations have been held with great interest and success, where subjects for discussion have been brought before the farmer and elicited great interest. Thorough draining has been adopted by many farmers, and the result proves most advantageous. Of the crops in this county it is said wheat is 30 per cent. less than 1845,owing to severity of winter, average per acre 14 bushels. Barley 10 per it more, average 17 bushels per acre. Oats 30 per cent. less, average 36 bushels per acre. I indian corn 30 per cent. more, average 30 bushels per acre. Potatoes 60 per cent. less, 100 bushels per acre.

Suffolkthe important changes which the appliances of art and the theories of science are working in agriculture, throughout the civilized world, are silently and unobtrusively, but surely effecting a vast improvement in the agriculture of this county. Of    should not, perhaps, omit to mention, that in the midst of our prosperity, we met with a serious <a name="loss50"><mark>loss</mark></a> in the total destruction of our apple crop. Soon after the leaves appeared in the spring, they were attacked by a minute insect, of a bluish color, which covered every leaf, and in some instances whole branches of the tree, in a few days destroying all indications of its vitality, and giving to its naked branches the appearance of having been seared by fire. Their ravages were confined exclusively to apple trees; few, if any of them escaped the <a name="blight10"><mark>blight</mark></a>, and scarcely a bushel of apples were grown in this county during the past seasonWAYNEThe agricultural products of the county are wheat, rye, oats, barley, buckwheat, peas, beans, I indian corn, pork, beef, wool and apples. But few roots are raised, beyond -garden culture, save the potato, which must rapidly decrease if the present <a name="disease120"><mark>disease</mark></a> should continue a few seasons more. I think I can safely say, that more than three quarters of the present crop is already spoiled. I have not been able to procure any statistical table for the county, and cannot specify the amount raised, nor the value of said products. Heat was not more than two thirds of an average crop, the past year. " The following will not vary far from the average heat 10 bushels, rye 10, oats 30, barley 20, buckwheat 20, peas 15, beans 15, corn 35. But little pork is raised for market, and commands       $4.50 per 100 lbs. Beef on foot          $3.00 per 100. Called beef       $4.50. Heat is worth                           $1.25. Worn 50.

The price from 62 4 to 75 its. per barelbarrelfound by purchaser. Large quantities of dried apples and peaches are also sold to the merchants in exchange for goods. Apples 75 its; peaches from          $3 to       $4 per bushel. The annual clip of wool cannot vary far from 300,000 I is, of which not more than one half is sold for export, at the low price of 28 cents per lb. There are but few good flocks in the county. "but little cheese is made. Of butter, the average per cow exceeds 100ths, usually sold for 12 cents per lb. This year worth eighteen pence. Yatesthe crop of wheat will not vary much from the amount as given at the last census 40 3000 bushels but uniformly more plump, straw free from rust, but little injured from the effect of the insect. Worn and Barleyperhaps there never was so large an amount raised in the county. I think I am safe in setting this down at 25 per cent. more than that of 1845. Of Potatoesthere was the usual quantity planted, and one thing in particular I have marked, and that is I have yet to learn the first instance where early planting and early harvesting has been pursued this season, that the <a name="rot33"><mark>rot</mark></a> has affected the crop in the least.

Dear Fire n compliance with the appointment of myself, as notified by you, at the August meeting, held by the Farmers' Club, at Union Arm, to collect and report on the agricultural statistics of the state of Delaware, and reply to the inquiries of the Commissioner of Patents enclosed to me, I here with tender to the Club, through you, the long and devoted friend and founder of both the Agricultural Society and Farmers' Club, of this county, the following facts, collected and col later with much trouble and care. The plan I adopted was to take, as accurately as possible, the amount of the crops grown in School District No. 58, New Castle county, which is the district in which reside. The district contains 8 173 acres, all told, which is divided into 23 farms, varying from 95 to 750 acres each, of which in 1845, 972 acres were sown with wheatproduce184n1) 1 "1845, 1 224 " " oath "1847, 1 127 " " "1841 3 273 were ll ted in corn, "1847, 1 393 .a."

 369 for corn, and for the value of straw, I have calculated the straw of thirty bushels of wheat and oats to make one ton, and allow four dollars per ton and for the price of corn fodder, one dollar for the fodder of each ten bushels of corn. The above statement shows a falling off of wheat of 1,114 bushels, and of oats of 15,787 bushels; but an increase of 14,204 bushels of corn in this district. These three are the staple crops, and the only ones that I could obtain accurately, without giving more time than I could devote to the subject. I have omitted taking all others, except by conjecture l estimates obtained from persons from different parts of the state. The three next considerable crops are hay, potatoes and peaches. The potatoes bade fair to be abundant till October, when they began to <a name="rot35"><mark>rot</mark></a>, and from all that I can learn of this valuable crop, fully half are lost by the <a name="rot36"><mark>rot</mark></a>, both in Delaware and elsewhere; and so also the hay and peaches were equally deficient the hay, from the drought of the spring, and the peaches from other causes perhaps the unfavorable ness of the spring. There being no data laid down in the books, by which I could compare the p each crop of 1847 with that of 184, I have set down, from the best information I could get, 300,000-baskets to the state. Major Key bold & Sons sent away over 100,000 baskets; other orchards in the county of New Castle, say 100,000 baskets more, and 100,000 baskets as the growth of Went and Sussex.

The amount and value of which I have no means to approximate with as great a degree of accuracy as is already within the reach of the assistants of the Commissioner of Patents, and  will leave them to do it. I will here remark, that these few memorandum s satisfy me of the great difficulty the commissioner and his assistants have in making up their reports, even to their own satisfaction. I sent out the planks that were furnished from the office at Washington they have never been returned by those I sent them to in distant parts of the state. I have been compelled to gather from conversation, and note any thing of value as  could get it. Were I must say one word for the benefit of editors who profess l to publish prices current, that I was astonished at the lameness of their reports. But of fourteen different papers which I subscribe to and pay for, among which are four professing agriculture, the rest made up with political items of .both parties, only, one of them had the price of potatoes, (the It. Louis New Era) none had the price of buckwheat, nor had any of them, the Patent Office reports included, the price of straw and corn fodder, an item second in value of the products of the farm field, and made more valuable since the invention of Armys Mammoth Straw Utter, and others nearly equally valuable. "I however found data, whereby to form an estimate, from the report of Jonathan Elkins' farm, (of Went. To. El) as publislfdin Puffing tons Delaware Register. Very one of those papers had the price of whiskey !a! I s it not astonishing, that an item of such importance as straw and corn fodder, should have been overlooked in the statistical reports of the field produce when taking the census? And here I will call the attention of all editors of papers, from the little county, up to the great Union, at Washington, to a matter of great importance to farmers: let the once every year give us the accounts of our exports of bread stuffs~ desigiaaE- a. 371 ting to what l country each article is sent give us the treasury report of domestic exports it is not enough' to tell us that we can furnish the world with bread stuffs we want to know who is willing and able to pay for them. The wages paid to good field hands in New Castle county is                                $10 per month; in Went and Sussex      $6 to   $7 per month, and for females to do house work in Sussex and Went, where the county is purely agricultural, wages are                           $1.50 to        $2 per month; in New Castle county they are much higher,                           $1 per week, is below an average to do house work; and in the factory of C. I. Upon t, it is stated in the Delaware Gazette, which is now before me, that girls get                            $18 per month, and some as high as     $80 per quarter. Mechanics' wages rule high here they being regulated by the Philadelphia prices. Our population, which had for almost half a century come to a stand still, has greatly increased within the last few years. I instead of population leaving us as formerly, for the far west, we are receiving a great increase. 'dear three hundred houses are annually built in Wilmington, and have been, for several years back, say 1842; her population, in 1839,.was but 8,367-now approaches 14,000!We are also doing much to improve our lands: lime, ashes, poudrette, bone dust, gun no, plaster and -nobles com posts, are extensively imported and applied, besides much mary, which is found on many of our farms, and well the out lay is repaid, as may be judged by the fact that, within a few weeks a large farm has been :sold in district 58 for thirty dollars per acre, that was purchased a few years back for less than five dollars per acre. But little improvement has been made on this farm; it took its value from the improvements going on in the vicinity of it. The increase of population in the whole state may be set down fully equal to the increase of the wheat crop since 1839, and may be safely placed at one hundred thousand. I will here remark, the reason .have put down the barley, rye, and buckwheat at the same price they were at in 1845, was because I thought that the buckwheat, which is very abundant, might balance the amount and value of the crop of barley and rye. Your friend and co laborer in the good cause, J. Jones872 X. 
 Cents important improvement in preparing wheat and other grains for flouring. This system overcomes what has hitherto been deemed an impossibility, and will not fail to revolution i ze the system of filling as now practised. The simple expedient of taking the outer coating or br an from the wheat merry previous to grinding, produces the following important results, viz 1st. All varieties of wheat, white yellow and red, &c, are at once improved from 5 to 15 cents per bushel, and the good varieties of red and yellow wheats will make as good and fair meal as the white varieties now do, which ordinarily sell at 10 to 15 cents higher per bushel than the red 2nd. The outer coating being taken off before grinding, all impuritiesat once are necessarily removed, and the brown special which retract from the quality of the flour will not be found 3rd. As a general matter it takes four and a half bushels of average wheat; or 270 pounds to make a barrel of flour weighing 196 pounds. Upon this system nearly all the meal that ordinarily becomes incorporated with the several varieties of of al is saved and put into the barrel, and is added to the yield which is a saving of from 40 to 52 pounds of wheat over and above the average amount used in every barrel of flour, as now manufactured 4th. From 25 to 50 per cent. of time is saved in grinding upon this system over the ordinary mode, and the work done much more evenly and regularly, as the usual difficulty of speaking the flour with the br an is entirely obviated and the contingent y of having super flour cut down to fine, with common skill in grinding cannot take place 5th. This system will produce the best Hot Cli  Mate Flour known in the world. It is an admitted fact that the br an, which upon the common mode of grinding necessarily incorporates itself to some extent with the meal is the chief cause of the flour pouring in hot climate s 6th. In addition to the un braving of the merry, the wheat undergoes an operation which super adds to the hot climate principle, and which must supersede every other plan to preserve sweetness in the flour- This will be found to be of great importance to the shipping interest and to the dealers in hot climates especiallySAMUEL Bentz. Boonsboro, D, September 10, 1847. Boonsonoo, November 21, 1847. Dear Girls you are about to bring out your report I would take the liberty to mention a few facts in addition to those mentioned in my circular. By experiment I have discovered that the br an which I take off by my process possesses the property necessary to make the rising or sorts for the purpose of baking bread. The bitter principle is developed in the outer coating which I divest from the wheat, in the exact proportion necessary to produce good bread. Often times in 'he employment of hops for this purpose, too much p urgency is com our acted to the bread, and that peculiar sweetness which indicates good b had, is often destroyed. The God of nature has beautifully and wisely provided the wheat merry, with the 374 X. elements of its own ferment at ion, and in so mild a form and yet so efficiently, that the sweetest bread is thereby produced. Another fact which may be of importance to the government: The" navy bread" is usually made out of the coarser particles of the meal, and must therefore be largely incorporated with the material possessing this bitter principle, as developed in the outer coating or br an. Navy bread prepared out of wheat submitted to my process, is effectually freed from this and a much more healthy and a perfectly sweet food may be obtained, and I doubt not much less liable to the contingent y of pouring as in the case of flour, because of the absence of the ferment ating principle mainly found in the outer coating. You can readily ascertain the truth of my observation by taking a dozen or more grains of the wheat with the coat on and chew them thoroughly, and after taking the wheat out of the mouth, the peculiar p urgency will indicate itself to the taste, whilst the wheat divested of its outer coating, gives no evidence whatever of the principle referred to. These simple facts may become important upon a farther development. Since I transmitted to you the specimens of wheat, with my circular, I have taken the same kind of prepared wheat and reduced it into flour to ascertain the complexion of the particles which upon the first grinding, would not be thoroughly pulverized, and to my great gratification I find that every particle of such wheat, embraced in the yellow and white varieties, will go into flour, after the outer coating is taken off, and produce standard super fine flour. Upon exhibiting this experiment to our most experienced millers, I received their entire concurrence in the fact just named, and this demonstrates the vast gain this system gives over the one now practised upon in this and other countries. The weight of 'the br a nor outer coating would therefore in the common super fine flour, constitute the off al, weighing only 5- lbs. to the barrel of flour, whilst the ordinary weight of off al is from 65 to 70 lbs. to each barrel of flour, showing a gain of from 59- to 65 lbs. of wheat in every barrel of flour of variety of wheat. This will fully enhance the value of the grain crop of the United States, from 10 to 15 per cent. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, S. Bentz. On. Edmund Burke, Worn. of Patents, Washington, D. C. Bucki Nghi Of County, Of, Sov, 1847. Dear Air. Your esteemed favor requesting my aid, to enable you to carry out the design of Congress in ascertaining the increase or decrease percentage of crops, as compared with those of 1845, is now before me. Residing in the tobacco region of Virginia on James River, one hundred miles above tide water, and tobacco being our great staple, I will commence with that crop. The crop of 1845 was a very good one in quantity. The crop of 1846 was of inferior quanti, and I learn 52,000 hads, at the average weight of 1,450 per had. and he average sales       $4 per hundred pounds. The drop of the current I ear (1841) which will be in the market in 1848,will be far short of the two preceding years; the western states have for x. a. 375 several years grown larger crops of tobacco, which together with the crops in the Atlantic states, has given a supply of the article greatly above the demand in foreign markets; that with the reduced price, the enhanced price of corn (maize) has determined our planters to abridge their tobacco crop from one-fourth to a third less, and enlarge their corn crop, so that I estimate the tobacco crop as low as 40,000 hads. We set out 3,500 plants to the acres and expect a yield of 800 pounds; our rich lands will yield 1,000pounds. Our people are disposed to curtail the tobacco crop and increase the wheat crop, although a delicate and uncertain one, but are deficient inland, owning many slaves that have multiplied and increased, while the acres have remained stationary, except in <a name="loss56"><mark>loss</mark></a> of fertility. The wheat crop of 1845 was very short, having sustained great injury by frost as late as the 7th of May, the crop of 1846 in my estimation was twenty per cent. better, and the crop of the present year better in quality and about twenty per cent. in quantity than the crop of 1846; upon our corn lands we seed about four pecks to the acre, upon fallows about five pecks, and upon tobacco ground and alluvial bottom lands, six to seven pecks. For the transportation of wheat to Richmond, by the James River and Kanawhacanal, the toll per ton is three and a half cents per mile, and freight four cents per bushel for the entire distance, say one hundred miles. As to rye, barley, oats and buckwheat, they are not market crops, and sales are made only to the towns and villages in the vicinity. Worn (maize is largely cultivated we consider it the staff of life, and in average seasons we calculate upon from fifteen to twenty bushels to the acre a good average crop, and generally worth from sixty to seventy cents a bushel. As toe bible root crops which your queried embrace, such as potatoes, round and long bees, carrots, turn is of various kinds, including the rut a bag a, they are cultivated for family use and to some extent for stock. As to your enquiry respecting the probable proportion of arable and forest lands, I conjecture that in east Virginia, in our maritime counties, from the head of tide water to the Chesapeake bay, three-fourths has been cut over and cultivated, a large proportion of which from bad cultivation has been exhausted and turned out into what is called old fields, and the bountiful God of nature has stocked these old fields with a plentiful supply of young pines, which when seasoned are very fine fuel, but too destructive to be of use in fencing. The proportion of arable to forest lands from the head of the tide water to the Blue Ridge, I estimate to be about equal, and from the Blue Ridge, throughout western Virgifiia, I estimate three-fourths of their lands as standing in their native forests as to the price of labor, our mechanics charge from one to two dollars per die m; as to agricultural labor we have none; our poor a e poor because they will not work, therefore, are seldom employed. As to the best rotation of crops, our best managers have resorted to the four and five shift systems, the latter is decidedly the best to give to the great auxiliary to improvement, c lover and plaster, which with deep sloughing, are greatly improving our lands; unfortunately the three shift system introduced in the early settlement of Virginia from necessity, has been too long continued, a sit is a land killing system. I :male this year, about 650 bushels of round potatoes, some few, when digging in October, were <a name="rotten7"><mark>rotten</mark></a>, those that appeared sound were very hard and would scarcely yield to any pressure, and exhibited many little black specks, all such are now <a name="rotten8"><mark>rotten</mark></a> land rotating daily in a good dry cellar, and I expect to lose three-fourths of them. I cultivated several kinds, among them the merger is most esteemed for table use, and 376 X. they are entirely exempt from <the <a name="disease121"><mark>disease</mark></a>, growing contiguous to the infected kind, upon the same sort of soil and with like cultivation. Almost every family cultivates the round and long potato, the former the most valuable root in the world, succeeds in all climates, the latter with us succeeds well in soils three parts sand and one of clay, and is quite productive with a moist August and September. Flax is generally raised and of fine quality, and extensively used as woof upon cotton warp for summer clothing for our negroes; the culture of hemp is much neglected, I have raised it for thirty years upon the same land cortsecutively, without any manure, and I believe the soil is as good as when I commenced. Hemp and the long or sweet potato are the most amelioratingcrops within my knowledge. In respect to stock generally, I reply, that this state can boast of her horses, being extensively mixed with the best crosses of the Arabian and Garb blood, and great attention has heretofore been paid to the raising of them for the turf, which is now a by gone day; but the blood horse is appreciated as greatly preferable to the old scrub breed for all purposes, whether as road steps or for the draught; their bone, muscle and wind being superior, gives them more strength and a better action; they expel in long levity by many years, stand heat better, and are less subject to <a name="disease122"><mark>disease</mark></a>. Our horned cattle are generally pretty good, being much improved by crosses of the Durham, Devonshire, Hereford and Older ney; our fairies are not very extensive, yet a large quantity of butter goes to market and is sold at from twelve and a half to seventeen cents per pound; the quantity of cheese made is inconsiderable. Our farmers generally have good flocks of sheep, of the most approved bloods, but not so extensive as to raise much wool for market; the main object is to clothe the family and supply a poor neighbor. Ourmuttons which are very fine, command from          $3 to 4. Our stock of hogs is nearly run out by the introduction of a cross, called Berkshire and at a high figure, about as great a humbug as the for us multicaulis that sold from, three to five cents a bud, which sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars. Virginia will have to purchase a part of her family supply of pork from the western d rovers, which is bad economy; but it is known that the Virginians consume more bacon than any other people. Any of our farmers raise hay for their own use, and in western Virginia there is scarcely a farmer but who has extensive meadows, and near to our cities, towns and villages, large crops of hay are made and found profitable, selling at from 75 to                           $1 per cut. Our farmers who have not meadows, secure large crops of c lover hay, which together with our corn blades and tops, sucks and wheat straw, make ample supply of provender for our stock. With high consideration of regard and respect, Your most obedient servant, Chas. Yancey. On. ,EDMUND van Urke, Patent Office, Washington, D. C. Rosehi Of, Of, November, 1847. This county, (Rappahannock) ten years ago, produced fine crops of wheat, nearly double what it now does, and whilst, lands have been improving and will produce as much or more I indian corn than formerly, the wheat crop has been gradually growing worse, amounting, some years, almost to x. a. 377 a total failure, as was the case last year. The failures are caused, mainly, by rust. In consequence of the rust, the quantity of wheat sown is much diminished and we are suffering our lands to lie in grass, purchase cattle from the western counties of Virginia, keep them one year and sell the min Washington and Baltintore, as be even, at an average of 75 to 100 per it. The o at crop was a short one with us in 1845, in consequence of drought, and from the same cause, our crop was equally shortened this, the rain having set in too late. The same may be said of rye as of wheat, it is perhaps even more liable to rust. This, with us, has been a most remarkable season for corn, (maize owing to the very cold and dry spring, there was great difficulty in getting the crop to stand: the drought continued up to the twentieth of June, when we all had despaired of making one third of a crop; the rains then commenced and continued very seasonable, and that together .with the late frosts, have made our crop full an average one. There was not a half crop made in 1845, in consequence of the drought. To potatoes are raised here to be sold beyond the limits of the county, and few or none raised for stock. This is the first year we had the <a name="rot37"><mark>rot</mark></a> to any extent; the <a name="loss57"><mark>loss</mark></a> this year is more than half, from <a name="rot38"><mark>rot</mark></a>. I had them in sod, sandy land, and in a how pen, and all fared alike; the how pen rather worst, and were planted last. One of my neighbors planted in new land and fared equally badly. The most approved rotation with us, upon good land, is the five field system, as stated: all the manure is put upon the fallow, by which the three crops get the benefit of it. Plaster is sown upon the corn land, wheat and the c lover seed mixed with it, (one bushel of plaster and one gallon of c lover seed to an acre) The two years that the land is in c lover, plaster is sown each year; by this plan, three crops are gotten in five years-two of wheat and one of corn, the last crop will not be a good one, but is easily put in, and the land is clean and in good order to receive c lover and other grass seed. Hands that are not too closely grazed improve under this system. Those who have many negroes make their hogs weigh two hundred and fifty each; they are allowed to run in the fields until two or three months before they are killed, when they are put in pens and fed on corn till killed. He who hires a slave furnishes him with his clothing. There is scarcely another place in the United States as far from market as we are, but we are improving the Rappahannock -river, and hope to be much benefit ted thereby. The character of our soil is gray, well adapted to c lover and p latter; no lands better watered, and no country more healthy. Respectfully yours, J. G. Lanehon. E. Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Loudovn Bri Dge, Princess Anne Sofa, Kept. 10, 1847. Air: In accordance with your request, I have the honor here with to transmit a partial answer to the questions forwarded me some time since. It will be perceived, that my reply is indeed but "partial" but little attention being paid by our planters to many of the articles enumerated in your circular. To far, however, as concerns the cultivation of our great 378 X. staples, I indian corn and oats, a praiseworthy improvement is perceptible. Such greater attention is given to the preparation of the lands; and many of our farmers have not only "made two ears of corn grow where only one grew before" but, by a judicious system of maturing, and an improved tillage, wider breadths are annually seemed and an increased interest manifested in the cause of agriculture. The potato, is grown to some considerable extent in our county, but in consequence of the difficulty of transportation to Norfolk and other markets, the crop is usually consumed at home. The "<a name="rot39"><mark>rot</mark></a>" has appeared in this section, but not to any alarming extent. With regard to the remedy, the sufferers have adopted the plan of seeing fresh fields yearly, under the supposition, that the potato soon extracts from the soil the necessary maturing elements, and the plant either dies early or the seed produces but sickly tubes, which fail to arrive at maturity. There is but little doubt that certain seasons produce vast tell uric and aerial anomalies, as was manifest during the prevalence of the Asiatic cholera, when chemical analysis detected great changes in the organization of certain vegetables changes, which were said to proceed from a failure upon the part of the parent soil and the surrounding atmosphere, to furnish to the vegetable the necessary amount and due proportions of earth, salts and gases. As regards the potato, it is evident that some of the maturing elements of the soil, which is essential to the safety of the plant, are absent or deficient: what these deficient principles are remains to be discovered. Science is at fault, and we are perhaps as far from understanding the true nature and cause of the potato <a name="rot40"><mark>rot</mark></a> as we were before any investigations were instituted. Some, as you are aware, believe an excess of acid to be the prolific cause of destruction, and have attempted to neutralise the super abundant acid, by the application of alkalies, which remedy, in numerous instances, seems to have produced very beneficial results, and to have totally failed in many others. In all probability, the time has arrived when the potato is to decline and gradually peri si from the face of nature; it has occurred frequently within a few years that plants, previously numerous, have become exceedingly rare, an instance of which is mentioned in the New York "meekly Herald" of February 19th, in the case of the john short, which the writer declares, "overrun the fields in the eastern states, to such an extent, not many years ago, that it was considered a curse, but at the present day, hardly a specimen of it is to be seen." These remarks, concerning the john short, are equally applicable to other species of vegetable; as the chenopodium anthelminticum, for example, which in former years might be discovered upon almost every acre of land in eastern Virginia, but can now scarcely be found, after the most diligent search. I regret exceedingly, the pay city of my report.  Situated as we are, between the Atlantic and the Chesapeake, and within twenty miles of the city of Norfolk, it might be supposed, that negligence and inactivity, alone, prevents us from standing at the head of the commonwealth. But the bars to our navigation, the poverty of our lands, the deficiency of capital, the difficulty and expense of reaching market, in consequence of bad roads and bridges, all conspired to cripple the energies of the people. The gardeners in the vicinity of the city, gut the market with root crops, god fruits, orchard products and small fruits, and by their proximity to town, are enabled to monopolized this trade; hence, our agriculturists rely mainly upon those staples which are in the greatest demand, and leave the affairs of the garden x. a. 379 and orchard to the suburban population. Is before stated, however, a spirit of improvement is abroad; lighter navigation, by means of canals, and other improvements, are now seriously thought of, and though we may not be able to overcome the many difficulties which stand in the way of advancement; yet we are not without hope of one day seeing our county occupying a prominent position in the state, instead of being distinguished as the causal extremity of the " Old Dominionfor a portion of the information furnished in the accompanying report, I am indebted to my friend, John W. Tone, Esq, of Loudoun Bridge, a gentleman who exhibits a marked degree of interest in the cause of agricultural progress. I have the honor to remain, Very respectfully, yours, &c, &c. Robert B. Hall, M. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Washington City, D. C. New Jerusalem, Hampton To, A, Sov. 30, 1847. Dear Fire n responding to your circular issued from the Patent Office, considering the information sought of great importance to the agricultural community, I regret that my means of imparting information on the subjects of enquiry are exceedingly limited, being restricted to the narrow limits of my own county, in which but few- of the subjects of investigation are cultivated, and these with more of laborious industry than skill, for as yet scientific agriculture is a stranger among us. In investigation g the few productions that come in for a share of our care and attention, and contrasting them with the crop of 1845, I shall take them in the order of their importance, beginning with the crop of corn maize) promising that this has been an unfavorable year upon the larger part of our lands, which maybe divided into three classes. The larger part being light, approaching to sandy, which requires moderate seasons to yield to its full capacity, and suffering less from drought than excessive rains; indeed, a heavy fall of rain, such as we had several times the past summer, falling about the time of the putting forth of the shoot, never fails to do serious injury to the crop. Next we have a free grey loam, based on a si vicious sub soil, that serves in wet seasons to draw off any excess and yet is sufficiently tenacious to retain and give out moisture in times of comparative drought. This description of land is more certain than any other we have to give a fair return for cultivation, and this year has produced very finely. Lastly, we have a portion of level, stiff land, sufficiently dry to tempt the farmer to cultivate it without drains, and yet, in consequence of its level surface, holds a great deal of water during the winter, and never fails to produce badly; after a wet winter, followed by a cold spring, unusually cold and backward, it has this year produced a very light crop. In the whole, I am induced to set the crop of corn the present year at 10 per cent. below the crop of 1845. Next in point of rank comes the pea crop, which has always been of great importance in this county. It is for the most part raised among corn, being produced between the corn hills and made at the expense of very little additional tillage, other than what the corn alone would receive. After securing enough for seed, the peas are usually fed off the land to hogs, and in that way are a very important auxiliary to the crop of corn; many farmers 380 X. nearly fattening their pork on peas and potatoes ; but in addition to the peas made for hogs, we are beginning to cultivate white much more than formerly, as a sale crop, usually finding them ready of sale at fair prices; but the present has been a bad year for the whole pea family. The heavy rains in July and August, which were injurious to corn, were still more detrimental to peas, and the crop may be put down at 25 per cent. below the crop of 1845. Sweet potatoes have long been looked on as of great importance throughout the southern country, and in no part of it have they been more highly appreciated than in Southampton, where they are regarded as almost indispensable to family comfort, and are a valuable alternate in dieting our slaves. But what has given additional importance to the potato crop, is its value for feeding swine; like the pea crop it is an important auxiliary to the corn crop, many farmers, as before stated, nearly fattening their pork on peas and potatoes, only giving them corn a short time before they are brought to the knife, in order to give firmer texture to the meat and land. The causes adverse to the pea crop were not less injurious to potatoes, producing a luxuriant growth of vines at the expense of the potato. I therefore set the crop of 1847 at 25 per cent. below the crop of 1845. Some few among us have held on to the cotton crop amidst all its reverses with remarkable tenacity, and the rise in price last spring tempted others to try it again; but the crop is admitted by all to be very short, and sure I am that our exhausted lands can never be resuscitated without its abandonment. Formerly no county in the state exceeded this in the production of apples and apple brandy, but on the introduction of the cotton crop, many orchards were cut down to make way for that staple, others being neglected, and brandy almost ceased to be looked to as a source of income. Since the partial abandonment of cotton more attention is paid to orchards the old ones are somewhat reviving, and in many cases young ones are rearing. In 1846 there was the heaviest crop of fruit that has been known for many years, but the trees are yet for the most part in a feeble condition, requiring after a full hit a year to recuperate; there was consequently almost an entire failure this year. Heat and oats are cultivated with us to a very limited extent. As to the former, a few farmers a rim ong us are turning their attention to it as a sale crop, but it is for the most part cultivated in small lots for domestic use. The product was this year fair, and but little different per acre from the crop of 1845. In consequence of a very short crop last year of corn blade fodder, for there was a greater falling off in the fodder than the grain, there were many more oats than usual seemed and the crop proved at least 30 percent. better than the crop of 1845; the entire product, therefore, must have exceeded that of 1845 at least 50 per cent. We are increasing in our attention to pork raising. For many years I am satisfied enough was not raised in the county for its consumption. I now think a handsome surplus annually finds its way to market. As to a rotation of crops we can scarcely be said to have one; for many years the practice has been to have the land one year in corn and peas, and in pasture the next a very few profiting by the advice of Orator, discontinued the pasture system, and some few others have adopted the three field system, putting their land one year in corn and peas, the best portions of it the next ear in small grain, leaving the thin nest portion to recruit, the whole shift x. a. 88 being the third year at rest, and wherever this milder system has been adopted, the land is in an improving condition. Most respectfully yours, James D. Massenburg. On. Edmund Burke. Bethphage, Rook e To, A, Her 13th, 1847. Fire t is with much pleasure that I proceed to make to you, in conformity to your circular, a report of matters relating to the agricultural interests of this vicinity. I have delayed doing so until this moment, not from any want of interest in the subject, or the most entire willingness to comply with your wishes, but in hopes of being able to furnish more accurate information and a greater variety of details. My time, however, being much occupied by various pressing duties, I have not succeeded as I could wish, and must content myself at length with statements so indefinite that they can be regarded only as approximations to the truth so far as respects the actual amount of the agricultural products of this quarter. These statements I have entered briefly in the circular, and send you in the accompanying pages such further remarks as seemed to me proper for further explanation and information. It is certain my a matter greatly to be desired that a full and accurate report of agricultural products should be obtained annually in the Unitedstates. Newspaper and neighborhood reports are too indefinite, yet there is no doubt that the Patent Office has, by a careful col nation and comparison of these, succeeded in making a tolerably near approach to the actual state of the case in its reports to Congress. Still it would be much better if greater accuracy and completeness could be attained. It seems to me that if any means could be devised by which the assessors of each county would be induced to make the necessary inquiries of each farmer, the matter would be at once effected. This would add little to the duty of the assessor, who is bound already to inquire of every individual or head of a family in the county the amount of his property in land, horses, cattle, &c. Now easily he could add a few inquiries about crops, &c, and enter down the replies, if furnished with a printed table or schedule of the various products, &c. It would be necessary, however, that he should receive some compensation for this duty. Would not each state be induced to attend to this matter within its own limits? Would not this induce a degree of emulation between different states in respect to agricultural improvement? Each state, too, has its own peculiar agricultural products and modes of culture, which of course would, in this way, receive peculiar attention. And how admirable a report might be made out of the whole to the general government Certainly there is nothing which at present demands more attention than this subject. An accurate knowledge of the various productions of the country would go far in settling many of the vexed questions of political economists, at least so far as our own country is concerned. It would enable the producing community to establish a just equilibrium amongst different products, and lead to a similar result in respect to exports and imports- a matter so vital to the prosperity of the country. It will give me much happiness to furnish any information to the office over which you preside, at any future period. Very respectfully yours, &c, R. Of Chardsonhlon. Edmsund Bubrke, Commissioner of Patents882 X. a. B. Ethany, Broke To, A, 1847. Heat Cropthis is, at least, 35 per cent. less than in 1845, throughout the very fertile district extending twenty miles east and northeast of Wheeling, A. From my personal observation, during harvest, through the district extending thence in the same direction to Pittsburgh, A, a distance of 35 miles further, I am confident the crop is 75 per cent. less than in 1845. Any fields were. not worth harvesting at all, and scarcely any, one was seen in which there was not a considerable portion left by the reapers, as too thin to deserve cutting. An immense amount of chess is in the wheat this season, as is usual whenever the wheat is thin upon the ground. The cause of the short crop is the unfavorable character of the winter. There was but little snow much thawing and freezing, and a prevalence of cold bleak winds in March and April. Kindsthe bearded red chaff is almost universally preferred here as the hardest and most productive variety. Some of the white wheats, especially the blue stem and the bearded white chaff, are cultivated to a considerable extent. The Mediterranean has been tried during the last two years, but does not meet with general approval, on account of its thicker br an, and the weakness of its stem which causes it to lodge. It is, however, a valuable variety, less liable to rust than any we have, ripe king two weeks earlier than any other kind grown here, and producing superior flour. It is well suited to Kentucky, and other regions where the rust is the greatest enemy to the wheat crop. Some that I have sent to Madison To. By, has surpassed all the other wheats of that region. I send a sample of the red chaff. I indian Cornof this grain we have an unusually fine crop this season, owing to the favorable season, and the large amount planted. I have put it at 50 per cent. more than in 1845, and the average yield per acre this season at 60 bushels. Fellow corn is grown here for the most part. Variety called by some bastard gourdseed is preferred. It ri pens early, from 1st to 15th of September, has a small cob, and large grain. I send a specimen of the grain. Potatoesthis crop has never been much of an object in this neighborhood, being never raised in the large way for cattle food. A few bushels grown in the corn field have generally sufficed the farmers for family use. It was difficult to procure seed last spring, and but few were planted. The crop this year is poor both in quantity and quality. But the <a name="disease123"><mark>disease</mark></a> which has heretofore affected the potato so much has greatly a bated this season. They seem to keep extremely well this fall. Last year I tried the experiment of sifting air soaked lime over the potatoes before covering them with earth. The heap with which this course was pursued kept well till spring, as compared with others. About one fifth only were <a name="rotted11"><mark>rotted</mark></a>, while one half of all the rest were so. Rotation of Cropsas this is a matter of very great importance both in practical and scientific agriculture, I regret to say it is but little understood or attended to in this vicinity. Farmers are in the habit of dropping their fields indiscriminately without any system whatever. For some time, some of the more intelligent have advocated the alternation of corn, wheat and c lover. This is the nearest approach to a system of any thing generally practised, though I cannot say that this is generally practised, but farmers in general are guided by the prospects of a market and a good price as to the kind of grain they will grow. There are several considerations which x. a. 38 must be taken into account in determining a proper system of rotation of crops 1st. The probability of a market, or of being able to make a profitable disposition of the crop. The chief object of course, in raising any crop is profit. It is this which determines, for the most part, the use to which the land, in any given district, will be applied. If in the vicinity of the city, large portions are devoted to pasturage and to market gardening. To in remote districts far from a market, grain is raised chiefly to fatten stock to be driven to a distance. Or extensive ranges are kept in permanent pasture for sheep, and merely a little oats raised for wintering them. In what maybe called grain growing districts, however, in the neighborhood of mills and markets, such as is the vicinity from which I report, we have a greater variety of crops, and also of stock, and such an equilibrium becomes established, that one crop is about as profitable as another, except when there is a sudden scarcity of some particular kind of grain. When this happens, the farmers will put all the land they can spare into this crop and continue to grow it as long as it is more profitable than others. But the land is greatly deteriorated thereby. Still it is necessary to consider how the crop is to be disposed of. For instance, the land is well suited here for barley, and this would form a very desirable alternation with other grain crops. But the price is low; there is little or no demand for it, and it would be an unprofitable crop to raise for sale, and cannot be so advantageously fed to stock as oats or corn. Again, the expense of taking a crop to market is to be considered. In the other hand, wheat is high and finds a ready sale, and is easily taken to mill. Worn is in requisitions for feeding the necessary domestic animals, and can be profit ably employed in fattening hogs for sale. Oats also are in demand for sheep and horses, are easily cultivated and regarded as profitable. Hence it is, that with respect to grain, we grow at present only I ndian1corn, oats and wheat giving the one or the other the preponderance according to the change of market. It is, however, wrong to be governed exclusively by the consideration of the present profit to be derived from any particular crop. A change of markets is irregular and uncertain, and prices never can indicate a just and regular rotation of crops. We have therefore to considered. The mechanical labor of a crop in relation to season and climate. Very crop should be put into the soil at the proper season, and in a proper manner. One crop may be of such a nature that it cannot be well removed in time to sow another; or it may leave the field or soil unfit for its reception in a mechanical point of view. For instance, the I indian corn is ready to cut up here from 15th to 30th September; but wheat should be sowed by this time. Hence before the corn can be removed, the proper season for the wheat is past. Again, when the corn is cut, it must be put into shocks in the field to dry. These shocks are in the way in sloughing, the field and long strips are usually left where the row of shocks stands to be put into oats in the spring a slovenly and wasteful mode of farming. The roots of the corn too, are greatly in the way, and it is impossible to put the crop in as it should be. Considered then with respect to mechanical difficulties, it is bad farming to succeed I indian corn by wheat; but we must take into view 3d. The chemical relations of the crop to the soil. These require us to change the crop, and not only so, but to place crops in such an order that one shall, as far as possible, compensate the soil for the exhaustion of another 384 X. a. To run upon one crop because it is convenient, or because there is a good market for it, without considering the necessity of maintaining the fertility of the soil, is one of the greatest and one of the most common errors. Seeing then that the only grain crops we can raise here to profit are maize, oats and wheat, the rotation which I myself approve, and which I have succeeded in introducing to some extent in the neighborhood, is what I have given in the circular, viz: 1. Baize; 2. Oats; 3. Heat; 4. Lover. To begin with the    indian corn, we break up a c lover sod for this crop, which gives great certainty of a good yield, besides that there is less washing of the soil by heavy rains. During the winter previous, too, we can deposit upon the field manure with great convenience and plough it in with the sod. Besides, as we have flocks of sheep they can be advantageously wintered upon this field, upon which the fodder b of the preceding year is fed to them, thus supplying valuable manure, and suffering the meadows and pastures of the next year to remain un trodden. In the fall, there is no unusual haste required in cutting up the corn. It can be suffered to mature and be cut up and secured in shock in a proper manner, and hauled during the winter to the field in which the sheep are foddered. In the spring, the soil is in fine condition for oats, pulverulent and mellow. The oats can be put in early and a good crop is certain. In the summer, after the oats are harvested there is a fine opportunity to put out all the manure from the barn yard, to have it spread and the wheat put in, in fine order and in proper season. Pont his crop, then, there is a fine opportunity to sow c lover seed in February or March. This c lover grows luxuriantly and may be mowed or pastured for two full years, when the field is in better condition than at first and is prepared to undergo another succession of grain crops. Oats is only one fifth as exhausting to the soil as wheat, hence it may well be interposed between maize and wheat, both of which are heavyfeeders. Time is thus given to the soil to supply itself with the mineral manures requisite from the disintegration of the rocks, &c. In this way a crop of wheat (the most exhausting of all our cereal grains) will be taken from the soil once only in six years. I am confident this is the best system of rotation for a large portion of the middle and western states. Orchardsvery great attention is paid now in this vicinity to orchards. New ones are set out every year of the finest kinds of fruit. The locustslast spring were however, very destructive to young orchards. They extended from a point about ten miles east of this to a distance of fifty or sixty miles west, and as far as I could ascertain about as far north. Shleepthis is a great wool as well as grain growing region. The finest wool of the United States is produced in this quarter. A greatly increased attention has been paid to this branch during the last year. Bucks unusually fine have been imported from Saxony. A single one sold lately for three hundred and fifty dollars. Some of the wool produced here brings at Lowell one dollar and ten to one dollar and fifteen cents per pound. I have set down the average at fifty cents which is the price current this year for entire clips. Jfanuresthis most important matter is sadly neglected here as elsewhere. Little or no attention is paid in general to the saving or creating of manures. Mineral manures, as lime, are however, used by some of the best farmers, who, likewise, haul out what is stored in the barn yard; but there is no systematic plan whatever adopted here in regard to manurescAgricultural laborers These have been unusually scarce. Wages have x. a. 385 been as high during the summer as fifteen to eighteen dollars per month and board. For the year from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty dollars and board. Laurens' Of Stri Of, South Carolina, Dunlapville P. 0., Sov. 11, 1847. On. Edmund Burke, Air :your circular, directed to the president of the Miltonagriculturalsociety has been handed over to me, as corresponding secretary. I have filled out the blank for nm, and here with enclose it. The year 1845, which it fixes as the standard of comparison, was for the crops of the upper districts of South Carolina, the most disastrous ever known. To estimate to be relied on could be made of that crop. "high, poor ridges, in amount many thousand acres, did not field more than a peck of corn per ace. The same may be said of cotton. Deep soils, more rete native of moisture, and creek bottoms, did better. It was deemed that not more than a third of the usual crop of. corn was made, and of cotton, perhaps less. Toe give you some idea of the season, I take the following extracts from my note book, made at the time. July 31. To rain; continues very hot have to grind our meal at horse mills; creeks have become branches, and branches have stopped; trees dying; indeed the whole vegetable world seems to wither under the curse of an angry Deity. September 24, 1845. Commenced with a regular pleasant winter !a! rather dry than wet. After the 1st of March, very little rain fell till the 24th August. The summer throughout was hot and windy. Heat which was less affected by the drought was an average crop. Oats were greatly injured and short by more than half, &c, &c. Seas did not come up well, and many of them died from the heat and drought. I wish potatoes and garden vegetables failed. Pastures burnt up, and cattle generally lean: Add to this, the cater pillar made its appearance, about the 15th September, and literally mowed down the grass, which had become luxuriant, (for the rains in August) and now threatens to destroy every green thing. October 21. The worm: (army) continues its ravages, destroying not only the grass, but oats, rye, and very kind of small grain that was up, they also cut off the peas from the vine, and stripped fodder from the corn They have not materially damaged cotton or turn is. After getting their growth they entered the ground, and became brown chrysalis, which, after some twelve or fourteen days, came out a fly resembling the ,candle moth c. After other remarks, ends with 1 have not discovered where they have deposited their eggs, if, indeed q, they have deposited any. Small grain eat off by the worm has not come out again. November 29. It is how dry and quite cold; cattle, &d. are nearly done picking the stalk fields, and must now be fed; considering the :injury done by the worm, our pastures have carried us forward better than we expected but now comes the rub, we have the winter to go through with cribs and barns looking lean and hungry, &c. . As the summer of '45 was the dries t, so that of '47, was one of the wet test ever known. The small grain crop this year was a good average one; the corn crop the greatest, perhaps, we have ever made; the cotton ran 25 386 X. too much to weed, and, although the autumn has been very favorable, will fall below an average, I should think 15 or 20 per cent. I wish potatoes were excellent, as they always are with us when the spring is wet; pump king, melons, &c. have failed almost entirely, (in '45, in moist places they were excellent) apples, peaches, grapes, &c. matured badly and were in sip id; sweet potatoes, contrary to expectation, are not good. The drought of '45, was most intense, in nine of the upper districts; the rains in '47, have been general I believe throughout the state. It may be well to add here, 46, was a better year for every thing but corn, and t fiat, was good. I see a large error has crept into the tabular estimate of crops, both yours and your predecessors. In yours, the cotton crop of South Carolina, 1845, is put down as 40,000,000 pounds, by your predecessor 49,700,-000. Hours may have been made by taking his for comparison. By looking at the tabular statements in any of the commercial papers, you will see that the export of last crop (1846) was over 330,000 bags, or about115000000 pounds, some of this may have been from the states of Northcarolina and Georgia; if so the amount cannot be very great, not greater, perhaps, than our domestic consumption. Not doubting that ou wish to be correct, I think it right to call your attention to this. I hope I have furnished 'you as far as I could such information as you expect. I feel a deep interest in the reports from your office, and think they may be the means of dissemination g much information, especially to the agricultural part of the community. There is some danger of its becoming too voluminous. Any persons, especially farmers, will not begin to read a large book. But be this as it may, I hope the practice of publishing annual reports from the Patent Office will be continued. All which is respectfully submitted, by your fellow citizen, Jno. H. Davi   S, For. He cy M A. S. To the Commissioner of Patentsmy estimates are made from An cock, Putnam and Greene counties, and  think they may be taken as the average of the first settled part of the centre of Georgia, and particularly of the eighth congressional district. That district lies in the centre of the state, on both sides of the line dividing the secondary and primitive formations, and is probably about the centre of the best latitiudendaitude for the short staple cotton. Probably, no agricultural people have ever pursued a system so exhausting to soil as the agriculture of Georgia. Hands have also borne a very low price when compared with the product; from          $3 to                                $10 per acre, will command the best tracts; less than the expenses of the most economical plan of maturing- and then we have been giving away at regular periods wild I indian lands to the citizens of Georgia. These reasons, when aided by the large profits from the product, cotton, have discouraged all fe utilizing efforts. But down and cripple forest lands and cultivate them, with the sole view of the largest annual profits until they will not pay for cultivation, cut down more lands, and remove from field to field, and tract to tract, leaving the exhausted lands to grow up in pine timber, and reclaim themselves, until our country has been pretty in spots, and left in all states of fertility that you can conceive such has been the practice among us. When we have very lifletart grasp, and our fertile lands are generally rolling which cause i them to x. a. 4 887 drain l very much. All these causes should be taken into account for the low average of products, and the very great difference between the maximum and minimum. Of n this respect 'things have changed much in the last few years. The    indian lands are exhausted; the new fertile cotton sections are so sickly, and have not many conveniences and comforts that are enjoyed here, that emigration has almost stopped, and our farmers are in earnest adopting some practical 'means of re claiming and preserving fertility and making substantial improvements in buildings and orchards, that indicate a settled state of the country; but all these things are too immature yet, I think, to be incorporated in a statistical report. Respectfully, October 27, 1847. J. S. Whi Tten. Barbour County, Ala, Sov. 3, 1847. To On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patentsdear Fire n obedience to your request, I have used all the means in my power, to collect such facts as regard the agricultural interest of this section of Alabama. There is manifested among the agriculturists in general, a degree of enterprise and industry, scarcely to have been anticipated in a country so new, and where the natural strength of the soil contributes so much towards a bountiful production. This energy and industry among the farmers is not only with an object for the present, but with an eye to the future. Any who are in possession and cultivating broken lands, have adopted the horizontal system of culture, and have guard pitched, in order to preserve the soil, whereby they may not be compelled to abandon their plantations prematurely, losing comforts and much hard labor, that it has cost them in making their plantations. Their efforts and policy has been directed with all prudence and judgment, with a view of permanently settling out the lands, and mi grating to the frontiers in quest of new lands. His system of horizontal ditching is not yet in general use; but many who have tried it are so well convinced of its beneficial results, that it is fast gaining in popularity, and in a few years become general. Hands that are well guard drained, have increased at least twenty-five per cent. in their production. Those cultivating level and swamp lands, have used much pains in draining and redeeming lands, formerly considered too critical for successful cultivation; and in a year or two more, much land, heretofore considered valueless, will be in profitable cultivation. Manuringmuch attention is bestowed on maturing, particularly corn maize) The manure used for corn in general is delayed cotton seed which is considered the best to be had in our reach. Table, lot and litter' manures are used for cotton. Small grains are sown down in rotation after corn, and not manured. Of late, much attention is paid to small gain crops, for several reasons: 1st. As a crop in rotation, for special benefit of the land; 2. For the benefit of the grain, and the pasturage afforded to stock. Oats and rye are most sowed down for the above purposes. Barley, none to my knowledgeOatsOats this year he been sown down to a greater extent than heretofore, but owing to the cold winter and late and wet spring, it fell short of an average yield per acre; but on the aggregate more has beri made, owing to the increased amount in cutivationA388Ex. 
heatThe wheat culture is becoming more general, than at first was anticipated. It was the impression of many at the settling of this county, that wheat would not do well here, owing to the southern latitude we live in. But experience has proved contrary to such opinions, and for the last three years, its culture has been very much extended, and its yield and quality far superior to all former calculations. There is no doubt whatever, but when the farmers have a sufficiency of opened land to spare, but what when will be grown to supply bounty fully the domestic wants of all who i Ll, sow down. The lands here, best adapted to wheat, are the hill lands of oak and hickory growth, with good. clay foundation. Such lands are more sure than the pine flats; the rich swamp ham locks have not yet been tested in wheat. Eye is sown more for pasturage. It is becoming more popular for winter age than oats. As yet, it is not sown so extensively as oats, for hogs it is an excellent grain. Worn, (maize The present crop is considered by far the largest ever made in this county. I have heard of no failure, but an universal account of a heavy crop. For the last year or two, much interest has been manifested concerning the planting and culture of corn. Experience has proved that this plant requires more attention and judicious management, to produce well, than any other of 'the crops we are now engaged in growing, as I have above remarked, and it proves to be, so far, superior to any other manures we have at hand; and if the ground is well prepared, the seed properly put in, and good cultivation observed, an average yield of twenty bushels to the acre may be made. It is evident, from actual experience, that th lands as low down as these latitudes, do not produce as much corn per acre, as sixty miles north of us. In the northern part of Alabama, a swell as Georgia, it i is said that they can produce forty to fifty bushels of corn to the acre, while, with us, twenty is a fair yield. The difference is this we are compelled to give corn ample room to make successful crops crowded it yields poorly, stalk and grain sufficient, but ears badly; four by four feet, arid one stalk to the hill, or drilled five by two feet is what is considered necessary, while in the parts above cited i they, with the same distances, can put two s talks, and produce successfully. Hence the different iii, that they have twice the amount of corn on the same quantity of land, the product twice as much as with us. Why this difference in the land, as regards the quantity it can bear, I am at a <a name="loss58"><mark>loss</mark></a> to say, but nevertheless, experience, as well as the testimony of my brother farmers, will touch for the same. Mr. Phillips, of Dog All, Miss, has corresponded with me on the' subject, and is of opinion that our lands can be made to produce more than what I have stated above. He has increased the product of his lands from 20 bushels to 30 and 35 bushels and given the- odds opera n di, a prior i. I have experimented in close planting after his saying, " to produdcemri, more plants must be on the land" but with signal failure. It was promising until tasseling, and after that period failed many of the shoots had nothing in them; whether it is owing to climate, or the porous nature of the soil, I a ti not fully prepared to say with any certainty. At any rate we are compelled to cultivate a large quantity of land to make a bountiful supply oft oris. But as the farmers are now aroused to their interest, and doing much towards maturing, and improving their lands, time will soon develop e whatiinrease can be made in this useful and all important grain among us. Peasthis crop is luxuriant and grows well, and bears beautifully x. a. Seldom more is gathered than is wanted for seed, the stock is turned on it every fall, which fattens readily, and saves much corn; if vines and all were gathered and housed for winter use for stock, it would save more corn a swell as more lives of domestic animals. Cottonthe season for this crop has been adverse from beginning throughout; first the cold and backward spring, together with lice, caused the stands to be bad, and from the middle of May up to the present, it has been a continued series of heavy rains, which has seriously injured the crops, particularly on low and level lands. The ball worm in some places have done serious injury, but were not as general as last year. Hence we may predict that the crop is injured and not a full one. It will be larger than that, of 1846, but how much is beyond any certain calculations. All of which is respectfully submitted. John H. Dent. Pari s Of Rapi Des, Louisiana, Sov. 10, 1847. Sirhaving received one of the circulars from your office, the object of which is to collect materials for an "agricultural Report" and to show the extent of the crops for the present year compared with that of 1845, when the last report was made. I proceed to give you such information as your inquiries call for, so fat as applicable to this locality. Commencing with cotton, the most important product of this part of Louisiana. The crop of the present year is good, and will, where gathered, be equal in quantity to that of 1845, when over thirty-five thousand bales were made in this parish, (a term for our civil divisions corresponding with that of county in the other states) The crop of last year (1846) was nearly destroyed by the cater pillar, or army worm, and. too much wet weather; so much so, that it was considered one-sixth only of the quantity was gathered as compared with that of the preceding year. This Form made its appearance early in July, that season, and was even more destructive south of this than here. It came too late this year to do as much injury, though in some places it has diminished the crop and damaged the quality of it. Our usual time of planting cotton is from the middle of March to the 10th of April, and we generally begin to gather it about the 10th of August, and when the crop is abundant, seldom finish this operation before the middle of December. This has been a fine autumn for this purpose, as there has been very little rain since the beginning of September, until yesterday. -the consequence is, the present crop is turning out better than was at first anticipated, both in quantity and quality. The general yield in good land with proper cultivation this, year, may be considered a bale of four hundred pounds of gin ned cotton to the acre; fresh land will produce more, whilst other land long in cultivation or badly managed, will produce less. The usual cost of freight from here to New Orleans is one dollar per bale. As the low prices of cotton and the frequent ravages of the army worm, have been for s omne time past discouraging the cotton planters, many oft her ni are turning their attention to the sugar cane; four or five made sugar last year with very encouraging success, and twelve or more are making 8 90, X. sugar, some of them have full crops of cane. They began to grind about the middle of last month, i and it is supposed an average yield of a hogs head per acre will be made, I understood recently that choice pieces of cane a returning out two hogs heads per acre The cane around here is yet green and uninjured by frost. I in close you a small sample of the sugar made on the most northern of those plantations, that of Mr. Calhoun near latitude 32.0Should this new product be as successful as it now promises to be, it will add very materially to the value of this lower part of the valley of Red River. The next crop of importance is corn, which grows very well. It is generally planted in February, and is fit for use in August. This crop the present year is most abundant. Good land here will generally produce about forty bushels per acre. It is mostly consumed where made, arid very little sent off, unless when prices are high; last year the corn in this parish was light, and in the southern part of the state nearly an entire failure. Sweet potatoes grow here remarkably well, and with ordinary cultivation produce over one hundred bushels per acre. The common potato, when planted in January or February, produces a good crop, fit for use in May and June. Oats. The kind most in repute here, is the black or Egyptian o at. His is sowed in September or October, and furnishes a good winter pasture for small stock, calves or sheep. Those are taken off in February, and the, oats allowed to head. The crop is ready to be cut in the latter part of May, and a considerable part of it is then generally fed out to horses and other stock. When threshed there is usually a yield of from forty to fifty bushels of grain per acre. The same land may be planted in peas or late corn when the oats are harvested. Speasfor the double purpose of fe utilizing the land and feeding the stock, field peas a ire drilled between the rows of corn early in June, and some of the ponds generally gathered in November, as food and seed, when gathered carefully, about fifteen bushels of peas per acre may be obtained. The vines remain with the corns talks as an excellent pasture after the corn is gathered. The next spring, what remains is ploughed in as the best preparation of the land for a crop of cotton corn and peas being deemed the best rotation with crops of cotton. In the fertile allusion soil of this valley, manure is seldom required, and when it is deemed necessary to land long in cultivation, cotton seed applied to the corn crop is the most approved mode of using it. Tobacco and I indigo grow well here but there is very little of either now cultivated though these were the principal market able productions of this country whilst it was a colony of Pain. Vice is sometimes raised for family use of an excellent quality and in great abundance to the extent of land cultivated. Foot Drops are quite productive, and carrots, bees and turn is are cultivated in abundance for the use of the plantation. In the way of provender there is not much hay made, the chief reliance being placed on fodder, the leaves of corns talks, gathered and dried at the proper season. The climate is so mild in winter as not to require a large supply of dry food for stock. Orchards of peaches and figs yield abundantly; and small fruit, such as strawberries, raspberrits and grapes are successfully cultivated. This is a good country for stock, some mules and horses are raised for x. a. 391 to cal use, but the principal reliance for a sufficient supply of the ses in Missouri and other western states. We also obtain some mules from Texas. There is an abundant supply of oxen and other cattle, for local consumption :and sale beef is generally worth from three to four cents. Sheep are raised to some extent but not much pains are taken with them. The mutton is excellent, and the wool may average about two pounds per flee ce. There being no regular market for it, the price is seldom more than fifteen cents -per pound. Any of the planters now manufacture coarse clothing for their people and use the wool in this, manner. Dogs are now extensively raised by the planters for their own use and killed from eighteen months to two years, old; weighing from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty pounds. From December to February meat is successfully cured for future use. With reference to the wages of labor; that of slaves in this climate, is almost exclusively employed in agricultural pursuits. These are seldom, hired out by the master; the wages of a man slave, when so hired, is now about one hundred dollars per annum, and of a woman about eighty, the person to whom they are hired also supplying food and clothing. Mechanics, such as carpenters, would gain from forty to sixty dollars per month, according to skill. The annual compensation to overseers may be set down at from four hundred to six hundred dollars. The produce of the dairy and the poultry yard is ample to supply the wants of those who will give them even slight attention. Sees and pigeons thrive very well. You are at full liberty to arrange the foregoing inforilration in such manner as will best promote the object you have in view. I am very respectfully, yours, &c. Henry Boyce. On. Edmund Burke, Com. Patents. Vermi Lli  Of, Erie To, Ohio, Sov. 24, 1847,I n the raising of I indian corn some experiments have been made which have produced singular results. In the year 1839, I planted one and a half acres of ground with three different kinds, of corn, half acre of china, half acre yellow you rd seed, half acre white flint the result of the crop was seventy-three and a half bushels shelled corn from the china, fifty-six and a half from white flint, and fifty-four from the yellow you rd seed. The result was beyond any thing before raised in northern Ohio, and so much in favor of the China corn, that I have every year since planted it. Now what I wish particularly to call your attention to is this, that when I commenced with that, corn it was a flint corn from seven years' use, it has become so closely allied to you rd seed that the berne l is very much denied, and the ears from twelve to twenty rows; the same remarks hold good in relation to the white flint, From sixteen years' acquaintance and cultivation I am prepared to say, that it seems to bear no similarity to its species sixteen years ago; it was then an eight bowed flint corn, it is now some sixteen to twenty rows you rd seed, which demonstrates to my mind the fact that this climate changes the species of corn from one kind to that of another.

I would state that these counties are thinly peopleditasQoQ county lies between the Nasaoto and Brasoa rivers, south of the 8 98 X. an Antonio road, and has been settled about twenty years; but the population has not increased for the last five years. Robertson county lies north of the An Antonio road, between the Vara soto on the east and the Grass os on the west. This county has been settled about fifteen years. -leon lies east of Robertson between the Vara soto and Trinity, north of the An Antonio road, and has been settled about eight years. Limestone lies north t of Robertson and Leon, and reaches from theBrassos to the Trinity, and has been settled from 4 to 12 years. Navarro lies north of Limestone, and also extends from the Grass os to the Trinity, and has been settled about four or five years. The three last named counties are increasing in population: I send you the best information that can be obtained, but cannot give a statement compared with the produce Of 1845, with any degree of correctness. The statement for this year can be relied as tolerably correct. The raising of cattle, sheep, horses, mules, hogs, co n, (maize) cotton, wheat, oats and vegetables, in all these counties is on t. increase.

I have made no account of the value of the straw, or of gathering the crop into the barn, or of tending it while growing, because in stating the value of the land I suppose it to be well .fenced, and that the crop will cost nothing in tending, and the straw for cattle fodder and for making manure, is worth more than barn room, cart age from the field, &c. The average crop, agreeably to my statement may be greater than the yield of many fields, half tilled, and sown at an un seasonable time, but I am confident that I have not over rated the production, on an average, of good farms in this county, which receive the culture which I have contemplated in my estimate of expense.

Perhaps I ought to explain the fact that it costs less to prepare ground for corn than for wheat. The most approved mode of raising a corn crop is, to plant on s ward ground, sloughing it but once and turning the upper side perfectly under then narrowing length wise until a good tilt h is produced. When the soil is not rich enough, stable manure is first spread on the land. I would also explain my putting the value of corn land higher than wheat land, by remarking that our river bottom, and the adjacent grounds, are the best for corn, and are more valued, though back and more elevated land produce more and better wheat, being less liable to rust and shrinking.

Robert Mcclelland, and in answer thereto, submit the following The average price per acre of our improved wheat lands is                                $10.00I interest on which, at six per cent. 60SPreparing ground for seed, and dragging two days with tea mi each acre, at                           $1.00 per day. . .a: .2 00 need, one and a half bushels per acre, at sixty its. 90 putting and gathering per acre, .a. 1 25 Threshing and cleaning twenty bushels, average per acre ordinary crop, at six cents per bushel. .a. 1 256 :00 Which, divided by twenty, the average number of bushels per acre, under prudent husbandry makes the cost per bushel at 30 cents. His statement will apply to about three -fourths of the wheat crop of this state, in ordinary seasons. The remaining one-fourth, for want of proper husbandry, good fences and timely preparation of the soil, may be put down at an average of thirteen bushels per acre, which, for interest on land, preparation, seed, harvesting, &c, at the same cost of      $6 per acre, would be, at a cost, per bushel, of forty six cents. Calculating, therefore, three-fourths of the crop at thirty cents per bushel, and one-fourth at forty-six cents, and the average of the whole crop i would be thirty-four its. per bushel. In 1845, three-fourths of the crop produced thirty bushels per acre and one-fourth about eighteen bushels per acre, with the ordinary cost per acre of      $6.

Average cost of crop, of 1845, twenty-three cents, three mills_ per bushel. The first estimate above, would, be i a fair average of the crop and cost for the past ten years, during which time I have resided here. For three years of the time the crop has been above that estimate and three years it has been less. The principal ingredients of the soil are sand, gravel and loam, with a large proportion of lime, of the openings and prairies, and those, together with ;a vegetable <a name="mould20"><mark>mould</mark></a> in the timbered lands. When first broken up, the openings particularly, present a yellowish, sandy, and to some persons not acquainted with the ingredients or geology of the soil, a poor appearance. The subsequent action of the sun, frost and rain, produces a decomposition of the lime, with which it is so strongly impregnated and it assumes a dark chestnut or chocolate floor, aid in socid127ieinstances it becomes almost ba hide. The said composition enters in t the soil from the surface, until you come to the second stratum i of grave- containing" water or sandstone, usually at a depth of from t, en to twenty feet, and sometimes even beyond l the latter depth. That this composition forms the surface \soil to those depths is evident from the fact, that the earth thrown out from cellars, welts and at her excavations, after remaining until acted upon by the sn, frost ad rain, produces vines and grain equally All with that, which he behcid127cid127brought to by the plough without further preparation. In but a small portion of the lower peninsula of this state does clay for many considerable ortioii of the soil, and this accounts, in a great measure, for the reason. that so :much less team work is required in preparing the, ground, for. seed- the soil ,being. such, that when the: vegetable matter is kept down there is no tendency to "cake" as it is termed, and in most cases it is sufficiently dry within twelve hours after a long rain to work to advantage. -when the land becomes impoverished by a succession of crops, bad husbandry or any other cause, the simple method of sloughing l deeper, or sub soil sloughing, is all that is necessary to restore it, and this only, when the farmer neglects rotation of crops, c lover and plaster, or refuses to return to the land, in manure, the crops which. he has taken from it. Our farmers have commenced the business of wool growing, and. so far as it has been tested, in addition to the profits from the wool, it is found very much to cheap en the raising of wheat. The experience of our best. farmers agrees, that when a sufficient .number of sheep is put upon a fallow, two sloughings are as good, a si three without their; and in this manner the average cost of keeping sheep, per head, for 4 year, is estimated not to exceed twenty-five cents.

Very respectfully, yours, S. M. Bartlett. Ashtavbla, Act. 2 1st, lb 47. On. J. R. Of Ddi Ngs, Dear Air: Hours with inquiries of the Commissioner of Patents, as to the expense of raising wheat and corn in my vicinity, is before me. In reply it is difficult to arrive at accuracy in a country like this where grain growing is not the main reliance of the farmer, and where it is uncommon for any one to adopt, year after year, the same system. Most of our farmers raise wheat for their own consumption only adopting at different times, sometimes a naked summer fallow and at others following wheat after all corn, potatoes, &c, and occasionally turning in a green crop, such as" c lover. In farms where much wheat is raised, a naked summer fallow is as elsewhere the most common system adopted 408 X. Doc- No. 54. Under the latter system the profits are (without rendering an excess of cost over the others) much greater. Still it is dis put able what system is the best as under the other the profits of a spring crop must enter intothe estimate as credit, subject however to the <a name="loss59"><mark>loss</mark></a> to the land by two crops instead of one. Considering a naked summer fallow as the most common method elsewhere, it will I presume be most satisfactory to base my estimates on this system. In the case of corn, my estimates are based on a supposed case where and is so cultivated as to remain in about the same condition ; the soil such as on the whole is most natural for corn, that is dry land free from clay. In lucky land the crop will exceed fifty bushels, but the expense and risk are greater. In some of our worn out land, the expense will be much more than the entire value of the crop. These variable causes will induce a wide difference in the estimates of different individuals. Question :that is the expense of raising a bushel of wheat in your vicinity ?AnswerFifty cents.

Dear Air: I have yours of the 27th. As a general remark it is true that wheat can be produced upon prairie land at an expense of not exceeding twenty-five cents per acre, in good seasons when no misfortune befalls the crop. Some seasons the <a name="blight11"><mark>blight</mark></a> cuts off the entire crop. Heat does not grow two years in succession upon the same land, every alternate year you must either substitute a rotation of crops or allow the land to lie idle which is most generally done. Each prairie farmer must own a sufficient quantity of timber for the purposes of fencing and building. There are three considerations with many of less importance which contribute to swell the average expense of producing wheat on the western prairies to probably thirty-five cents per bushel. I sub join the expenses of an acre without the cost of the land, for the first crop. For subsequent crops the sloughing would be fifty debts per acre.

Burke, p Commissioner of Patents. X. a. 411 P. Endi X No. 4. Mai Of I N Mexi Of. From the Vienna Zeitungby H. Karl Seller. Translated by E. Good rich Smith of the Patent Office. Baize, (ze a mais Linnaeus) not only on account of its elegant structure, splendid leaves, delicate inflorescence, and variety of color of its pliant stalk, is one of the most beautiful of the grass kind, but likewise one of the most useful, and indeed, for Mexico and a large part of America, truly the most useful of them. I to beauty the Mexicans have at all times acknowledged; they yet here adorn the altars in the churches and cliapels with the s talks of maize, in which are t wined flowers. Among the ancient Mexicans, maize was a sign in the callender, and a holy ornament upon their groves. The    n was of Peru cultivated maize in their gardens as elegant plants, and among artistic works in gold of the ancient Peruvians the imitations of the maize plant are the most admirable. From what has been mentioned, the value of this plant to the inhabitants of America is evident, a swell as the proof that its culture was known, and especially in Mexico, long before the discovery of the new world. I tis well established that make was not known in Europe till after the conquest of Mexico, and we know, likewise, that Ferdinand Cortez, after his first return to the court of Charles V., 1519, among the presents from Mexico, had some ears of maize. Notwithstanding that, we cannot certainly fix upon Mexico as the true native country of this plant, yet America was indeed go, for only the Mexicans, the inhabitants of May ti, and some natives of South America, had any peculiar names for maize a circumstance that is not without importance, because we may assume that an object for which any language has no designation, is of foreign origin. Thus, for example, the I indians of Mexico have no word for wheat, barley, oats, apple, pear, grape, fig, sweet orange, &c, which they designate by the Spanish words, tr i go, nevada, a vena; man z ana, per a, u va, fig o, carranza, &c but for all domestic fruits and plants they have, as tlaolli (ze a mais) choyoteslle, (ly cos epulis) same i, (mamma Americanapitaya, (cactus pitogacacahuates, (array his subterranean see hypogea) m ague y, (a gave American A) to mall, (sol sum lycopersicumQur word maize comes from the Haytien word ma his, from whence it is formed by corruption. The Chinese and Japanese have also a peculiar word, though it was already known among these nations before the discovery of America. Thus the Chinese call maize yachuchu, corn of ch u or y a (kidney) or you my, rice resembling a kidney. The Japanese call it nanbamthbi, that is corn of new br an, or, by nick name, outran dish (foreign) corn, as the Germans, for example, call it Turkish wheat. It is, therefore, more i than probable that 412 X. the maize of the new world came to the old as an exchange, for had the Asiatic people carried maize to America, they would also ,have planted the cereals far more important for the old world. I f, then, we admit that all men sprung from one stock, it must be that the first inhabitants of America separated from their Asiatic brethren before the cultivation of the cereals were known. Notwithstanding, maize is no where found in the wild state, for as to that wild maize of Dr. Hernandez, it is very much as with his wild wheat, which he would have it he had discovered, and which he named titi cum michoucum, but which is nothing but titi cum composite m, and came from Europe. We often find in Mexico, single plants of maize which grow see sown, and flourish without culture, and though they may stand miles from any inhabited places, they cannot be considered wild, as notwithstanding the often monstrous variety, they always bear the characteristics of cultivated maize. By the parrots, for example, which come from the east, from the term a alien to to the term a temple da, in large flocks, to visit the maize fields, the kerseys of maize may be borne to a distance and thus sown. It is the same with maize as with the other cereals of Asia, considered as their native country. To far we may consider America as the native country of maize; neither are those found wild. Notwithstanding the many varieties of maize which are found in Mexico, yet there is only to be :found the Linnaean species "1 mais." Were, in this country, indeed, we distinguish two kinds a main al to, and a main ternparal, but they present no botany cal difference. The best known cultivated varieties in Mexico are 1.

Mjaiz cuarenteno, better known in Mexico under the name of maiztreines, or old te Colorado, which ri pens quickly, and may be planted in the cold est districts' in Mexico 6.  Said tar dio, or de ri ego, the most productive of all the varieties, and that which is cultivated around the city of Mexico- and in many moist regions. It sometimes reaches to 500 per. cent. Baize succeeds best in a moist and warm climate, but it has the great advantage above other cereals, that it may be successfully cultivated in Mexico as well in the term a c alien te (warm districts) as in the term a friar (cold ones) I to highest limits here are from 2000 to 000 feet above the level of the sea, therefore The time necessary for it to ripe n is very different. I t varies in all the periods from 7 months to 6 weeks. Baize is the most important an til in Mexico, and the failure of the crop by drought, hail, wind, or: <a name="disease124"><mark>disease</mark></a>, produces the saddest consequences. X. a. 413 The diseases of maize most known in Mexico, as we l as the hurt ll . I ulms, are the following: '1. A ra quite, a kind of wasting consumption y which affects the maize where it is sown on barren soil, and shortly after the seeing is subjected to moist cold weather 2. Ll carbon. A vegetable carbonaceous growth, which grows in the ears. or causes the buds to be abortive. This abortion, as in the oak and other plants, appears to be produced by an insect 3. Ll hang o. A species of are do, which forms itself particularly in the ear, and destroys it. This <a name="disease125"><mark>disease</mark></a> is here called los cure vos, (the raven Of Animals, c 1.

But in the cooler districts they have two kinds of culture, that with watering and that in the dry lands, (s membra de re radio y de sea no) Of the latter we have: again different methods. which are called de liumed6, de a venture so, and de temporal. In the de re radio, the kind main tar dio is sown, which is the most productive, and a variety very similar to the same in a soil of constantly equtlized moisture at the commencement of spring, (de humed6A seeing which is made in a soil that has the capacity of preserving the moisture of the winter and first spring rains, is called s membra de a venture so. In the de temporal a quickly ripe king kind is sown (main cuarentenowhich is cultivated either before, or in the rainy period, (june to November) if before, and it is -also sown on dry land, then this is called siembraen pole a, (sowing, or seed on the dust Often the Mexicans take no pains to select the soil, and frequently cultivate maize on strata or hardened clay, (type tate) where the: crop is very small. Now much Mexico produces at the present time it is impossible to determine with any accuracy, but it is thought that it is the principal subsistence of at least five millions of persons, and at the same time, is the only corn fodder for all the kinds of domestic animals, so that its collective product must be, at least, 1,0,000,000 of met zen. [is a met zen is 1.68 English bushels, this is equal to nearly 17,000,000 bushels, and it would seem must be under rating the crop The different parts of the maize, and the modes in which it is used in Mexico, are the following. Of the plant 1. The ancient Mexicans made of the juice of the stalk, sugar, and the modern Mexicans, a fermented drink, named put que de main 6 mayo. Experiments, also, have succeeded in making brandy of the same. The extremely sac charing stalk is eaten raw by many I indians 414 X. 2. The unripe ears (I nd. gilt e, Span. m azor ca) are cooked, and serve many poor people for their sole sustenance 3. The leaves and s talks serve as excellent fodder for horses and mules. B. Of the dry plant 1. The s talks and leaves* are used as well for the fodder of animals as also for the construction of small houses and huts, the walls of which are made of s talks, and like roofs of houses 2. Of the ripe corn is prepared, similar to barley, a kind of beer, (chi chain agreeable and health full drink 3. Of the maize meal, boiled in water, and in connexion with different roots, many kinds of paste, (a toll i or at ole) and a kind of bread calledarepa4. The ripe kerseys roasted, which are there called es quite, as well the meal prepared of it (pin ole) are used often in the term a caliente5. Finally, maize is consumed in still greater quantities by the Mexicans in tortillas, which are prepared in the following manner :the maize kerseys are placed in a vessel with water, and softened for a time by the aid of lime. When they are rubbed on a flat stone (me tate) into a fine. mass, and from this are formed very thin round cakes, which are baked on a thin clay plate. They are taken hot from the plate and eaten, and thus supply the place of bread to the Mexicans, to which the tortillasare preferred. A Mexican woman spends daily at least six hours in the preparation of the tortillas, and in the whole republic, according to the estimate of H. Azcarale, are thus engaged 312,500 strong and healthy women: Were it not the sole labor of the Mexican wives, we might well cry out, what a monstrous <a name="loss60"><mark>loss</mark></a> of time Finally, I must yet mention that paper (paper de o ja de main is also made from the leaves, and the raw leaf in the south is used for the preparation of the so called straw sears, (cigaritosThis is, in brief, that which is most worthy of notice respecting maize in Mexico.

Experiments relating to the cultivation of Potatoes, translated from the German of Prof. Hlubek, of Rate, by E. Good rich Smith, of the Patent Of ice. Comparative Experiments of the different kinds of manure on the growth of Potatoes, and the quantity of starch meal contained in the moor some years past experiments have been instituted at the experimental farm of the imperial Agricultural Society of Steiermark, as to the influence of the different kinds of manure on the growth of potatoes, bees and maize. The soil on which the experiments were tried is an a luminous clay soil, which is composed of 50 to 52 per it. sand, mostly gravel, with fragments of quart z, gneissand mi ca; 47 to 61 clay; 95 carbonate of lime; 92 hum us. Of every kind of manure used there were 3 parcels each for 100 square feet, therefore, in the whole 300 square feet; and the manure was applied in the year 1845. In the year 1846 each parcel was laid with 60 tubes equal in size, and weighing 6 lbs. on the 16th of April. During their growth the potatoes were twice hold; the gathering of them vas on the 12th of October, and in the month of November the quantity of starch meal which they contained was determined in the usual manner.

The greatest product obtained in the year 1846, was from the parcel manured with the carbonate of potash 2. In maturing with gypsy m the product was not only smaller than without any manure, but it also had 36 per cent. of diseased potatoes, and thus 17 per cent. more than the average of all the kinds of manures. The in favorable effect of gypsy m may be explained by its attraction of moisture from the atmosphere. The parcel manured with 30 pounds of gypsy m, was still moist after all the others were entirely dry. The unfavorable influence of gypsy m on the potatoes was also evident in the year 1845, as the un manured parcel yielded a pro dust of 53 I is, but that manured with gypsy ulm only 49 lbs. The proportion of starch meal in that manured by gypsy m, was only 8 per cent, while the average was 12 per cent. From these facts it follows, how injurious is the effect of the moist state of the soil on the perfect development of potatoes, and that moisture must be regarded as the principal main cause of the potato <a name="disease126"><mark>disease</mark></a> 3. The <a name="disease127"><mark>disease</mark></a> was least in the un manured parcels, and the greatest in those manured with gypsy m, nitrate of lime, carbonate and sulphate of potash. To attempt to drive off the potato <a name="disease128"><mark>disease</mark></a> with various kinds of mineral manure as some endeavor to drive off the brand of wheat, by the use of mineral steeps, such as lime, potash, iron and copper, vitriol, &c. belong to that class of speculations which is not based on any well grounded analogy 4. The potatoes remaining sound in the year 1846, produced only one per cent. less starch than in 1845, although in reference to the dry substance no difference could be perceived in the sound tubes in these two years1234567, 891011121314151617Ex. 4 175. The numbers are entirely different as regards the starch and dryresiduum, in the infected tubes. The actual calculations in this respect give the following result Starch. Residuum. Cry sub- Later stance generally 100 lbs. wholly sound tubes contained 11 -lbs. 7 lbs. 19, lbs. 80- lb s 100 " half with brown spots, 51" 5 " 101 "a* 89.v "100 " decidedly more infected than the former, 3- " 3 " 6- " 93 "100 " wholly soft <a name="rotten9"><mark>rotten</mark></a> tubes, 1~ " 3 " 4 c " 95} " c  n those tubes in which the infection consisted simply of wart like protuberances and star formed hung i, no difference could be perceived in the before mentioned constituents, when they were at the same time examined and compared together 6. If we compare the product of 1846 without regard to the diseasedtuberswith that of 1845, it follows from this comparison that in the whole, the potatoes in 1846 yielded a product one third less than in 1845. This decrease of the product shows itself as the mere result of the too dry season in the spring and part of the summer, as well as the continued moisture of the month of August. Comparative Experiments as to the influence of dividing the Potatoes on the product- In this instance an a luminous clay soil, was selected, the constituents of which were given in the former experiments. In this soil were drawn rows of 30 inches long and 2 inches wide, manured with perfectly mellow cow dung, and 2 rows planted with 60 whole tubes, 2 with 60 halves, 2 rows with 60 quarters, and 2 rows with 60 eyes with flesh, and 2 rows with 60 eyes without flesh. The result of this trial were as follows Weighing. Were diseased 60 whole t tiers- 6 lb. gave 69 6 lbs, of which 280 lbs or 42 p. c 60 half " 3 " " 68 " " " 244| " 36 "60 or.

From these experiments, as well as those in 1844 and 1845, which latter are contained in the Transactions of the I imperial Agricultural Society ofSteiermark, part 48, it is evident that the dividing the tubes lessens the product. In the foregoing years also, the proportion of starch was determined in each parcel of potatoes brought in the separate example, and the result was, that the division of the tubes also exerts an injurious influence on the quantity of starch contained; for while' the undivided tubes gave 15 per cent starch, from the product of the mere eyes there was only 11 per cent. starch. The appearance was marked and decisive, that the <a name="disease129"><mark>disease</mark></a> was greatest and almost constant in the division of the tubes into quarters 2. Comparative Experiments as to the influence of the wider or closer planting on the product of Potatoesthis experiment was tried exactly in the same circumstances as the foregoing, only, there were 2 rows with 60ff every parcel there were 20 lbs. subjected to the examination 27 418 X. 2 rows 120, 2 rows with 240, whole, halves, quarter tubes and eyes, so that the seed tubes in the rows in the first case, were 12" in the second 6, in the third 3" apart from each other.

The conclusions which may be drawn from the above figures are 1. In equal sized whole tubes the multiplication of the seed tubes bore the proportions, following 11 fold at the distance of 1 foot 24 " " "' "21 (a( ^a^ 1 442.

The multiplication of the seed tubes is in inverse ratio to the distance at which they were planted or with the weight of the seed used, that is the multiplication of the seed decreases the closer the tubes are laid to each other. At equal distances, for example of 1, the multiplication in otherwise equal proportions was uniform, and depended solely on the weight only of the tube r laid, and it is almost always less in proportion as the weight of the tubes laid appears to be greater. X. a. 419 f we omit the slight difference, the multiplication of the seed tubes is, proportioned to the distance of 1 inch 11 fold when the 60 seed tubes weighed 8 lb s 22 " ' can c c 3 c c 33 " (actually 36 fold) " " 124 " (actually 45 fold) " " are see thus that the progress of the multiplication corresponds to the natural arithmetic al progression, that is, The multiplication with whole tubes being au " the half " " 2 a.

The planting of equal sized whole tubes at the distance of -I was attended with the same result, and thus half of the quantity of seed was uselessly expended. But when the whole tubes were placed at the distance of "a, then the plants deviate from this method in their 'growth, so that the product was diminished almost 30 per cent 9. If the product of the Whole tubes be set at .00 then the Half " is 92 or 8 per cent. less. Quarter " " 78 " 22 " "eyes with flesh " 71 " 29 " c Eyes without flesh " 57 " 43 C "10.

The difference in the products appears yet more striking, when the quantity of starch meal contained in the potatoes is also taken into the account.

If we call the first twelve and the last ten per cent the product in starch per yoke, is* According to the experiments v which were tried at the farm, the proportion .of starch was fifteen per cent. in the first, and only eleven per cent. in the second 420 ,x. a.

The 'theory of Raymakingwhen grass first springs above the surface of the earth the principal constituent of its early blades is water, the amount of solid matter being comparatively trifling; as it rises higher in today the deposition of a more indurated form of carbon gradually becomes more considerable; the sugar and so ruble matter at first increasing, then gradually diminishing, to give way to the deposition of wood y substance. The following table affords a view of the composition of rye grass before and after ripeningI Th June. , 2 3d June. 13th July.

This is assuredly at an earlier period of its growth than when it has short into seed, for it is then that wood y matter predominates; a substance totally insoluble in water, and therefore less calculated to serve as food to animals, than substances capable of assuming a so ruble condition. This is the first point for consideration in the production of hay, since it ought to be the object of the farmer to preserve the hay for winter use in the condition most resembling the grass in its highest state of perfection. The second consideration in hay making is to dry the grass under such circumstances as to retain the so ruble portions in perfect integrity. To ascertain whether hay by the process and exposure which it undergoes loses any of its so ruble constituents the following experiments were made 1st. 3,000 grains of rye grass in seed on the 13th of July, gave up to hot water a thick syrupy fluid, which when dried till it ceased to lose weight 212, weighed 217.94 grains, equivalent to 7.26 per cent 2d. 2,500 grains of rye grass digested in cold water, yielded 53.23 grains of extract, equal to 2.12 per cent. This rye grass contained 31 per cent. of solid matter, and 69 per cent. of water 3d. New hay made from rye grass, and containing 20 per cent. of water for the sake of comparison, was also subjected to similar trials. I st. Trains.

From these numbers we learn that 100 parts of hay are equivalent to 38 74 of grass. This amount of grass should contain of so ruble matter in hot 422 X. water 28.13 parts, and in cold water 8.21 parts. But the equivalent quantity of hay or 100 parts .only contain 16 instead of 28 parts, so ruble in hot water, and 5 0 6 instead of 8- parts so ruble in cold water. A very large proportion of the so ruble matter of the grass has obviously disappeared in the conversion of grass into- hay. The result of the hay making in this particular instance has, therefore, been to approximate the soft, juice and tender grass to wood y matter, by washing out or decomposing its sugar and other solubleconstituents. These facts enable us to explain the reason why cattle consume a larger amount of hay than is equivalent to the relative quantity of grass. Thus, animals which can subsist upon 100 pounds of grass, should be able to retain the same condition by the use of 25 pounds of hay, if the latter suffered no deter i oration in drying. The present series of experiments however, show that a cow thriving on 100 or 120 pounds of grass, required 25 pounds of hay, and 9 pp and of barley or malt, affording thus, collateral evidence of the view which we have taken of the imperfect ion of the process of hay making at present in use in this country. The g eat cause4fthe deter i oration of hay is the water which may be present, either from theinconi let e removal of t, e nature' amount of water in the grass by drying, or by the absorption of th is fluid fir in the atmosphere. Aer when existing in hay from either of he se s ou, ces, will induce ferment at ion, a process by which one of the most important constituents of the glass, viz: sugar, will be destroyed. The act. n necessary for decomposing the sugar is induced by i he presence of the albumin os matter of the grass; the elements of the s g tr are made to read on each other in the mo i t state in which they exist in consequence of the presence of the water arc oil, and are converted into alcohol and carbonic acid, according to the f blowing formula garb.

We use this comparison because it has been more than once suggested to us by agriculturists. The quantity of water or volatile matter capable of being removed from hay at the temperature of boiling water, varies considerably. The amount of variation during the present experiments was from twenty to. fourteen per cent. If the lower per cent age could be attained at once, by simple drying in the sun, the process of hay making would probably admit of but little improvement; but the best new made hay that we have examined contained more than this amount of water; the numbers obtained verging towards twenty per cent. When it contains as much as this it is very liable to ferment, especially ff it should happen to be moistened by any accidental approach of water. The only method which we have found to succeed in preserving grass perfectly entire, is by drying it by means of artificial heat. Eye grass contains, at an early period of its growth, as much as eighty-one per cent. of water, the whole of which may be removed by subjecting the grass to a temperature considerably under that of boiling water; but even with a heat of 1 200 the greater portion of the water is removed, and the grass still retains its green color, a character w' .ch appears greatly to add to the relish with which cattle consume the, i ind of provender. When this dried grass, (as it may be truly termed x. a. 423 by way of distinction from hay) is examined, it will be found to consist of a series of tubes, which, if placed in water, will be filled with the fluid, and assume in some measure the aspect of its original condition. In this form cattle will eat it with relish, and prefer it to hay, which in comparison is blanched, dry and sap less. The advantages obtained by this method of making hay, or rather of preserving grass in a dry state are sufficiently obvious. By this means all the constituents of the grass are retained in a state of integrity; the sugar, by the absence of water, is protected from undergoing decomposition; the coloring matter of the grass is comparatively little affected, while the so ruble salts are not exposed to the risk of being washed out by the rains, as in the common process of hay making. The amount of so ruble matter capable of being taken up by cold water, is according to the preceding trials, as much as five per cent, or a third of tie wholesoluble matter in hay. We may, therefore, form some notion of the injury liable to be produced by every shower of rain which drenched the fields during hay harvest. It is not only, however, the <a name="loss61"><mark>loss</mark></a> which ,t sustains in regard to the sugar and so ruble salts, that renders hay so mt ch less acceptable than grass to the appetite of cattle. The be aching w! .ch it undergoes in the sun, deprives it of the only peculiarity which dis ntguishes the one form of fodder from the other; grass deprived of its g been coloring matter presents exactly the appearance of straw, so that hay ought to be termed grass straw. It is obvious, from the experiments detailed, that the operation of hay making, as conducted in this country, has a tendency to remove a great proportion of the wax in the grass. Thus it was found that rye grass contained 2.01 per cent. of wax. Now, as 387 1 parts of rye grass are equivalent to 100 parts, of hay, and as 387 1 parts of grass contain 7.78parts of wax, it is obvious that 100 parts of hay should contain the same amount of wax; but by experiment it was found that two hundred grains of hay contained four grains of wax, which is equivalent to two per cent almost, exactly the amount contained in grass. Hence it appears that no less than 5.78 grains of wax have disappeared during the hay making process. The whitening process which the grass undergoes in drying, renders it apparent that the green coloring matter has undergone change; but that it should have been actually removed to such an extent, or at least have become insoluble in ether, is a result which could scarcely have been anticipated without actual experiment or.

Guide to the culture of flax according to the Belgian Westphalians mode, by which the scholars of the Aderbach spinning school are taught. Translated from the German of Lewis Charles Adler von Nadherny, by E. Good rich Smith of the Patent Office. Soil and climate The soil in general most suitable for flax is a mild loam soil because it allows a rapid development of the tender germ of the plant, and great dryness is not so injurious to the same, as for example, is a heavy binding clay soil, a light loam y soil too may be well harrowed, rolled and generally worked over; therefore it can be taken as the standard, that a very good grain soil (barley soil) appears to be alms t always the best adapted to flax culture. But particularly in the choice of the soil regard should be had that neither the <a name="mould21"><mark>mould</mark></a> be too strong nor the sub soil be too loose; because the root of the flax, in a deep grounded and loose soil, penetrates to the depth of one to one and a half feet. As respects the climate, flax succeeds only remarkably, where a copious and rich formation of dew finds place, and when the atmosphere generally is more moist and cool than dry and warm. As a proof of this we refer to Cyril, Steiermark, Silesian, Belgium, &c. Manuringas regards the maturing of the soil, we must decide whether it be desired to raise fine flax not so fine or but in large quantity. In the first case it is very well to manure the previous crop quite strongly, and in the spring, before the seeing, carry on the drainings of the dung hill, or if this cannot be procured, the flax when it is some inches high maybe strewed over with lime, gypsy m, pe at ashes, &c. But it must here be observed that flax will not agree with horse or sheep dung, and so only the dung of horned cattle is to be used. 'the most admirable manure for flax is the drainings of the dung hill, a experience has taught that flax succeeds not so well after any other kind (f man ire    f a person wishes, on the other hand, to produce' not fine flax 0 much as a large quantity, then the ploughed field must be manured in the spain g, eight to ten weeks before the seeing. Previous crop The views and opinions are divided on this subject. But experienced writers in this say, that in dry fields the best previous crop for flax is potatoes or grain, and in a moist one, oats is suitable, and that at least ten years should pass before 4 flax be cultivated on the same field. Preparation of the soil n regard to this no universal rule can be given, and every husband man must be guided by the condition of his field, but two main points may be laid do wh and kept in view, viz 1. The better the field is worked over, all the large clouds broke to pieces and the soil made like that of a garden, the better will flax succeed 2. We should always plough as deep as the soil will allow; if, therefore we can plough one, to one and a half feet deep, we should do so. The procedure in the preparation of the field according to rule is as follows426Ex. a. The ground must usually be ploughed three times, viz, in the autumn, shallow, in the spring, very deep, and finally for the seeing, very shallow. The autumn furrows are left to lie rough over the winter, but in the spring it is well harrowed, as also the deep spring furrows must be harrowed before the third sloughing. After narrowing, and before the third sloughing, the drainings or liquid manure must be carried on; in one or two days the field must be again well narrowed' and left to lie some time; then follows the third sloughing, after which the field is again well harrowed, until no clouds are to be seen. When we must leave the field, and after some days seed it down, as the sowing flax seed in a fresh ploughed furrow never answers well. This is the procedure when the field is not manured in the spring; but if this be the case, then the manure must be carried out in winter, and when the weather allows, be strewed and ploughed. The further procedure then remains the same as already given. When flax is sown, the field must be rolled firm with a heavy wooden or stone roller like a hogs head. The beds must be laid out very broad and very shallow; between the beds the furrows must be somewhat trimmed by a laborer with a shovel, in order that the people may enter and weed. Choice of seed -the properties of a good seed are 1. It must be clear, brown and have a shining color 2. The kerseys must be thick and full, and 3. They must soon sink into the water, to the bottom; in the fire, or cast on the coals, burn with a strong crackling, and laid in a pan which is held over the fire it must spring out, from the heat. Strength of the see dingy n regard to the strength of the seed, there can no directions be given, only it is to be noticed that they who wish to raise a fine flax, must put in a strong seeing. But whoever has no wish to seed for a fine crop, need not sow so thick he who raises flax for its seed must sow thin, in order that the plants maytcid127ltperly spread and the stalk be aoaromer and in e Fslidthleq a anti ty of head per yoke, (equal I o nearly can, and a I ha ai ta )a) (i thirds of a met zen for raising seed, (a met zen is equal to nearly sixteen quoits) three-fourths of a met zen for a coarse flax; four fifths cf a r et zen for time flax. Time of soing. -with respect to the time of ceding it is profitable to sow flay in se an, it order that the winter moisture may be useful, and the ground flea (end flow) may not injure it; but on the contrary in an early sowing the cold winds of spring are to be feared, which are very injurious to the t elder flax plants, and therefore, no general rule can be established, but we muscid127) guide ourselves by the circumstances of the climate, and thereby have in view that the flax does not require for its period more than from twelve to thirteen weeks. Cultures soon as the flax has reached to the, height of one or two inches, it must be strewed over with ashes, which is regarded as a very good means against the ground flea, and also garlic must be cut fine and mixed among, the seed, which is likewise a good means against this insect. When the flax has reached the height of from five to six inches it must be needed, and in this every possible injury must be avoided. When the object is to obtain very fine flax, the flax field must be lathed: e, laid with flat birch rods, which lie upon lathes and between which the fix grows, and is protected from laying. Owes at and the pulling The time of harvest must be decided by the x. a. 427 question, whether we aim at more perfect or less fine flax. In the first case we may assume eight days after the complete blossoming as the period for pulling' in the second case we may wait before we pull it until most of the s talks are yellow in their whole height, and the seed have in the greatest part become brown. But to wait for the inner bark to do so, is injurious; for were we to allow the flax to remain till the ripe king of the seed, we should lose too much, while the fibres of the generally ripened flax are not only coarse, but they are so scanty that they are entirely destroyed. Assortini f we wish to <a name="rot42"><mark>rot</mark></a> it green in water, it must also be as sorted at the time of pulling, i. e, the strong put with the strong, the weak and fine with the fine, the red and black stem with such as are of the same color. But if the flax is to be first submitted to the drying, then it must be as sorted according to the before named Outran system, and afterwards the as sorted portions are to be taken into the barn.

Method Of Culti  Vati  Of And Cure Of Cuba Tobacco, As practised in Cuba and the other West I india I s lands. Translated from the Original Spanish Work by Julian Silveyra, Havana, 1845. Translators Prefacehaving by the kindness of a friend, been enabled to obtain a copy of a very valuable work on the "cultivation and Sure of Cuba Tobacco" and knowing that the work was prohibited from being sent from the island, and learning that there was no other copy among us, I was induced, by the advice of a friend, a distinguished tobacco factor in New Orleans, to lay it before the public, in the hope that it might be the means of being of some benefit to the agricultural portion of our community, and that if the suggestions which are made, are valuable, that they might be followed. If so, I shall be repaid for my trouble in preparing these pages. There are in reality some new ideas in respect to the application of manure which may be of utility to the planter. The cultivation of Havana tobacco for cigars, is a branch of agriculture which has received the attention of planters of the south for several years past. The continued low price of our principal staple has caused many to look around to find some other object upon which to spend their labor so as to reap an adequate return. Humbugs have had their day, and the "for us multicaulis" is "numbered among the things that were. Speculation has followed speculation each one has failed and now the truth has forced itself upon the planter, that to save himself he must cultivate that which yields the greatest profit. There is now offered to the cultivate or a substitute for cotton, which, if followed, cannot fail to average much more than any thing else. The tobacco planters in the West I n dies have long held a monopoly in their own hands, and we have been compelled to pay them a heavy tribute for the pleasure of smoking a good cigar. There is no doubt, I imagine, that blessed by Providence with such a soil and climate as ours, we should be able to raise as good tobacco in Louisiana, and some of our other southern states, as they do in Cuba, and if the flavor is not so aromatic, and the color so rich, it will at least be a very good substitute. The new ideas originating with Or. On Silveyra may prove instructive and practically good. Several gentlemen of my acquaintance have, for two or three years past, cultivated tobacco, and expressed themselves generally pleased with the result. There are several peculiarities in the style of the Spanish work and things, which till, doubtless, meet the disapproval of some. I confess that the views of the Spanish author do not all suit me, but as  determined in the outset, I will not commence a criticism, but give a free translation. Cry this plan, and if it is good, "hold on to it" if not, cast it away. I am convinced that his plan for sowing and planting his seedlingsis good, but the time he mentions will not suit our climate for when he is x. a. 429 about to commence, planting, our crop is nearly ripe. Again all this mystery of preparing his field, I cannot understand, nor why he sows and plants so late. His plans of cutting, distances, &c, will meet many oppose is. I could mention many other particulars which will appear strange to some, but will present the book as it is translated. With many apologies for thus intruding myself upon the public, but, offering as my excuse my regard for the southern planting interest. I remain, most respectfully, your obedient servant, James S. Peacocke. Last Felicianna, August 25th, 1846. In the Cultivation and Sure of Havana Tobacco. In the beginning of May, the labors of the tobacco grower commences, at which period I prepare the land destined to be the field, sloughing and narrowing it three or four times in all during the month; by this operation I have destroyed the sprouts of the seeds which spring up with the first rains. I then divide said land into parallelograms from north to south, fifty yards in breadth and two hundred in length, divided by, spaces of four yards, sufficiently wide to allow a cart to pass, and in which I go depositing the pure manure of the horse, of which preparation I shall speak hereafter. In the middle of June, (the land being regulated to this order) I furrow across the breadth of the parallelogram from east to west, at five-fourths of a yard distant. I pass the plough through the furrow three or four times in order to widen and deepen it much as possible, to be able to facilitate the operation of finishing the furrow for the hand of man, making a ridge that I collect to the south side of the said ditch which shall be made in the said field. His operation being concluded and all the manure gathered into the spaces which foresight and diligence could collect, already the beneficent rains have soaked many times these ditches. I should follow after that, placing the manure in them, distributing by rule the quantity without exceeding a fourth part of its depth, which excess would injure the powerful tone of the plant. I should add to the said manure two thirds of the delayed earth, and should stir them together until they are perfectly mingled, then leave them until they had received two or three rains, concluding the operation by covering with the rest of the dirt, or earth, forming a ridge or duke, whose declivitiesturn within the ditch, and through them the water passes to the interior or bottom, when it will effect the ultimate ferment at ion of the manure combined with the earth which impede the rapid march that ought to be made in a field so precarious and delicate. The middle of June should be concluded the operations of opening theditclres, and, in the five subsequent days the distribution of the horse manure, mixed with two thirds earth, in which state it should be left until the end of the month, to give it time to soak in the rains that fall upon it after that, cover it in the manner referred to. The in middle of July will be time to commence the formation of land destined for seed plots which will be as extensive as the means of the proprietor will permit. The ground being well prepared, and kept entirely free from those insects which are accustomed to infect it, will produce great gains, banging forth abundant and choice plants of which to make the field, and a secure sale of the residue, which will always find purchasers430Ex. a. The operation of making seed plots is exceedingly simple; without delay seek a particular method, that when treated will produce a good result. I t suits not that the land be very rich, because the plant would be too precious, and happening to suffer mistakes at the time of arranging them for transplanting, placing them very tender, in the belief of their being well advanced, for their great size would infallible cause them to die, or if not, to degenerate or form a bad plant. It is better that the land should be somewhat broken, but if that could not be obtained, I would form high levels, avoiding always the low, since they are notoriously pre judicial. The plots should be formed two rods in width, and eight in length, divided by paths a yard wide for passing and re passing. I would point holes in the patch or plot riot very deep, with a pick axe or mattock, leaving the paths untouched of their natural hardness; but if very sandy and light, press them down hard to impede, without delay, the intruders which unfortunately invade sometimes the plot. I would endeavor to break the surface as little as possible, and enrich it a little, lightly with powdered dirt well sifted, which should be mingled perfectly with the plot, freeing it from all sweepings of the litter that might occupy the ground and produce insects in it, for the causes that I will explain might appear in these places. For this account it is pre judicial to form the plots with boards of palms or other things. I n the beginning of August, two or three patches should be sown, with a light handful of seeds, perfectly free from dust and straw, by which the experienced workman will be able to judge of the quantity sown, endeavoring to have it scarcely sown to the end, that springing clear it may increase with freedom, free from those inconveniences which would result from two close continuity, putrefaction arising from it being the worst that can appear. And when in this multitude there succeeds any breaking or crushing, it is, the cause of en rendering insects without number, whose authors are decomposition and the odor arising from plants crushed and dying. If it happens that in sowing the seed, any should fall out of the buds and spring up, I would gather them and throw them beyond the precincts, to prevent those passing in the paths from treading upon them, producing those injuries above referred, to. Very three days I s l would repeat this operation with the above mentioned patches, even to the conclusion of the seed patch: recommending always the greatest care in saving, the lack of plants being preferable to exposing all to inevitable destruction, when thickness produces putrefaction, which is easily occasioned by want of air to the tender stems, and the indispensable moisture which the young leaves suffer in the pressure they find, which disengaged the balsam in odor of the plant, attracting from a distance butterflies and other insects that destroy. If there happens a failure of water in those days, I would water the patches every moderate morning with a very fine sprinkling, without opening, the hand, that a surge of water might be avoided, which would be toxics to the springing plant. I repeat it once and a thousand times, that nothing is so pre judicial to tobacco as the putrefaction of its own leaves, badly treated from whatever cause, and recommending so much care from the beginning, that the existence of its many enemies may be avoided. And I would carefully pull these leaves from the. growing, obtaining the benefit to the plantation, that the health ftp leaves are preserved while the above mentioned injuries are kept away. The plants should be irrigated early in the morning as possible, in order to imitate beneficent nature in this respect, which does it all in the night in the midst of serenity, keeping the ground moist most x. Doc. 4 to. 54, 431 of the time after the going down of the sun. It is extremely pre judicial to irrigate in the afternoon, on account of their having been heated by the excessive warmth of the sun, and the irrigation producing immediately a violent evaporation, causing a true boiling in the plants, nearly kills them, or if not they grow in extreme debility and never produce good plants for the field, sacrificing by this bad practice the tender victims of so many labors, and from which was expected a source of fruit fulness. After the seeds of the tobacco spring up, the foreign herbs should be needed out, those which existed in the land as well as those which were in the manure placed on the plots; not however interfering with them unless they occupy the place of the tobacco, impoverishing the land of the fertility which ought to be employed upon the plant for which it was destined, and in this case remove them with much delicacy and gentleness, in order that the plants be not injured in avoiding more fatal consequences; neither should any of the hers be left on the beds or paths of the plot, because their stay in any part of the predict would be pre judicial. Equally noxious is the practice of covering the seed plots to preserve them from the sun, whose beneficent heat dilates the impulse, which impels the sap to the tender leaf, giving strength to its fibres, and the elasticity which hastens its .development, the scales falling which held them, the patches un curling, expanding and shooting to the light, acquiring force, the organs strengthen themselves as the bond is broken, it .begins to increase and take the true color. I to elastic, stalk, solid and move able at the same time, sub ministers a part of the nutrition, blue is in the ascending sap, and sporting, moving itself in the air, attracts from the atmosphere all the principles which form the descending sap, beautifying and nourishing the plant which sustains it. When the seed plot ha arrived at a condition for transplanting, .1 world pe il, lo the first time the field, and with pick axes, very sharp, would free the ground perfectly from all herbs, clearing and removing all litter that the paths might have no filth by which to en gender an infinite variety of insects which would be enemies to the new host, this is exclaim i ely to inhabit this mansion. I would open win: pick axes te fun rows will. are necessary to make the first field, leaving closed the rest until the time for using them. I would take two thirds dirt, mingled with manure, placing it to the north of said furrow, for use when needed. I would equal i ze the spot, removing it slightly, in order to. separate it and make so ruble the dirt which is going to receive the planting. In case of much drought, I would sprinkle these furrows that the young plant might encounter sufficient moisture, and not experience this operation after transplanting, which would need it more abundant on this occasion; yet a superabundance would be injurious. It is easy to know the importance of this operation; that removing from the plant the soil that sustains it, opening the source of vegetation which receives the new plant, it can but be compelled to give all its vigor and fertility to the host, which should receive all its benefits. The tobacco plant is a nice observer of whatever can administer to it from the soil or atmosphere, as much for the facility that the of long configuration of the leaves gives, whose extraordinary size is evidently to collect the constituent parts from the air, which forms the descending sap that goes to nourish it, as for the manner in which its roots elaborate the nutrition parts of the so ruble sap, and the nourishing elements contained in the preparation of the land, since it is well known by experience that the leaves suck and elaborate the moisture, and also that they de compose the atmospheric, appropriating to themselves 432 X. the fixed air, carbonic acid gas, or the essential principle of vegetation, absorbing the useful part and throwing off the useless. The season for transplanting is when the young plant has bedded four or six leaves, and contains three or four joints in the stem. It has also acquired an elasticity which resists the action of breaking that happens to those which are tender. They should then be brought into the place designed, and the shoot turned towards the earth, after which taking hold its buds, very lightly for protection, by which I would save without danger the root that can penetrate only a little on account of the shortness of the patch I have recommended, I would proceed collecting them with uniformity in the left arm, in the form of a bundle, which I would deposit in baskets kept for the purpose. I would do this early in the morning, suspending it when there is no dew, because moving them without dew would produce friction among the young leaves, thereby the epidermis of the beautiful plant becoming broken, ex having balsam in odor and occasioning putrefaction, as much in those transplanted as those left, which attracts thousands of butterflies and other insects, which exterminate the seed plot. The dew prevents or repairs the chafing and keeps them fresh the rest of the day, enabling them to be sown in vigor. They should be left in a place where the air circulates, carefully covering the root that they may not lose their juices by the delay, or laying in the sun. If there are many plants, it would be convenient to scatter them along in the furrow, guarding the distances so that the planter can easily reach them. The distribution concluded, they should proceed with the operation 'of transplanting, at the medium distance of half a yard, (the Spanish yard differs a little from the American) with which in the left hand I would designate the place where the plant should be placed, keeping always from the line which forms the guard spaces of the parallelogram, with the greatest uniformity. The planter should take the plant in the left hand, b racing all the leaves in the same direction, with which should be supported the roots and trunk: and with the right hand fingers joined like a shovel, I would excavate an oblique hole in the southern limit of the hill or furrow in which I would place the plant, and with both hands press the soil upon the roots, in order that they may adhere to it, endeavouring to let the top of the plant rec line to the wall (hill) which will serve a temporary protection against the rays of the sun, and protect it from the wind in its tender state. If the ground has been soaked by rains, I would not press the soil down upon the roots at the time of transplanting, because it would cause a great torn or in their growth, preventing them from extract ing the juices necessary to their increase, or it might be the ascending sap, through which avenues it communicates with the plant: moreover, the said inappropriate pressure occasions a true strangulation, which impedes the circulation of this vital principle, which leads to debility and death. I n such a case, the roots should be only lightly covered, avoiding always any vacuum between them and the soil, because in it putrefaction would be elaborated, occasioned by the want of communication in this hardness that the ground had acquired by being used in this state, forming a barrier continued and impenetrable. I would suspend the planting, in such cases, until the following morning, when the ground should be drained. I would commence the transplanting immediately after the plots begin to produce good plants, which will be from the middle of September at farthest, without attending to the pernicious customs springing from apathy and indolence. There are many proverbs among such labor, as' "the season decides the x. 433 time for sowing When it begins to rain begin the year" and many other errors, which serve as pretexts to let the precious time pass away, and  take not the least diligence to obtain the good that is to be. The best season is the epoch of the year, which nature defines for operations, and" heavy rains" " ebb tide" fabulous declines and other stories should not be obstacles to impede the rapid march that should attend so luxuriant a cultivation. In truth, when the young plant is ready, wait not for " shower, "or " ebb tide" as the least delay in transplanting would occasion great <a name="loss62"><mark>loss</mark></a>. The system of improved or enriched furrows frees from inconveniences, being able to advance from the time the plant is ready, because in the bottom is found sufficient moisture preserved by the furrow or duke placed there, with this intent, sufficient time before; with which abundance, the transplanting can be moistened if the drought should continue; which operation, I repeat, is necessary to be done early in the morning, for reasons above demonstrated. When the transplantings have been' concluded, the plants commenced ve getting, and the first leaves appeared, is the time to brush or throw over the first dirt, which operation is commonly called covering. If the drought continues, I would soak four or six ditches of the first field, and continuing to cover with dirt, which in the first operation was light, making it an object to aid the plant by placing it in a good direction. Very day this covering should be repeated in the same manner until done. In a few days the change effected in these plants will be visibly seen, the prodigious growth they have made by the virtue of the maturing they have received, expanding more and more, from the fund of fertility in which they have been situated. This extraordinary vegetation astonished the producer, and leaves him not a moment to rest, compelling him to dedicate himself to the assistance and education of his tender and growing plantation. After they have put out four or six leaves, I would give the second and last dirt to the covering which would be with all that had found existence out of the furrow, or upon the part of the north, ca ring as much in this as in the first working, to not injure the trunk, stem or leaves, lest some of them should be injured, and afterwards result the injury of putrefaction and its contingent effects. Afterwards I would level and smooth the ground under the plants, leaving no hard cold or other object, against which the first lower leaves, waving in the win 1, could injure themselves. I would sweep the pathways with a broom, to free them of the nests of insects, which may be destroyed with more facility. In this condition it would declare war with the laborious experimenter, who with strong motive should consecrated himself to fight with a vigorous army, that marches with a gigantic step to the end of its career. What prodigious transformation s are experienced in the plant, ~ay by day! Now incessant the increase how steady the growth! A growth so precious cannot be exaggerated, since, like to the head of the hydra, every day despoiled, the same plant, today trimmed and turned, appears the next day with the same phenomena. The broad pathways scarcely permit the step, and many times one must walk upon the side, to not break with his body the luxuriant leaves, not being able to pass a line without his head entering into one or the other, so impenetrable is the green and solid wall he himself has planted. The whole plantation forms tie most enchanting plain, displaying the most pleasing allusions, and see l from a distance seems a sea, whose waves are gently undulating. Whoever has seen tie fertile vales of the river Faint James28434ex. in the section of Faint Monica, would form a true idea of the beauty and richness of this privileged culture, which could not fail to stimulate men the most listless and inactive. I recommend very particularly the clearing of the streets or paths and furrows, to prevent decomposition, and protect them from worms, bugs, crickets, and other vile insects, terrible enemies of tobacco, which, having no dens, it will be easy to destroy. In the same manner I would not permit to remain upon the plants, suckeds, leaves, or other vegetation which incessantly springs from or around the stem, because they deprive the true leaves of those juices which give them size and quality. I would take the wedding and trash entirely out of the field, because the decomposition would occasion putrefaction, more injurious from the strong odor of balsam in solution that attracts many butterflies from the environs, and the consequences resulting from their multiplicity. The tobacco .having been cropped or topped at the height it should stop, the flower having appeared, three or four handfuls of dirt should be given it, and the ripe king of the leaves will begin, which state will be known by their perfect formation, the up mice and crystal ligation of the sap, which appears in g lobules, sandy g lobules, colored different shades of yellow, according to the state of the atmosphere, the size of the spot varying to the action of heat or cold, and if one wishes to increase the color of the leaf, it should be left a longer time, until fully ripe, which will produce more quality in virtue of the ferment at ion the sap makes in the parenchyma or cellular texture, in which state it should be cut, since in this state it, is exposed to many injuries, besides becoming spotted. Excessive dew or shower that cannot be absorbed by the leaves, brings on to rapidity, which occasions ferment at ion and debility of the epidermis i or cut ice. The sunshines upon them, And spots of iron &L. & r, are donned upon to m, l which truly may their beauty The first leaves, being nearest the ground, risen first, and are subjected regularly to these defects. Moreover, for their little quality, which results from want of air, continual friction, moisture and other causes, his ch makes them inferior and tenders them unfit fo any use except fillings, &c. The best manner to cut tobacco for convenient experiments, is, in hands of two or three leaves hanging from a part of the principal stalk of the plant, cutting from top to bottom with a very sharp curved knife, and near as possible the stem of the leaf, ca ring to not wound it, because from this avenue it would lose the necessary juices in this state it will perfect its quality, which is done by elaborateing by the ferment at ion of its materials. The knife made in the form of a sickle, should be taken in the left hand, and with the right hand grasping the lower part of a bunch, raising it gently to discover the stalk to see where to cut; afterwards I would place said bunch or cluster in the middle of the path, the superior part of the plant underneath the lower part exposed to the sun for it to be withered, and that it may be, collected with facility and placed in the cutis or sticks where scarcely half of the bundles would have been contained if this operation had not been done. I would endeavor to not leave much of the stalk in the bundles, for the difficulty occasioned to the leaf in drying, since the leaf, although weak, continues receiving the ascending sap, which juice greatly impedes this most interesting operation, which ought to be rapid as possible to avoid the terrible effects of ferment at ion, putrid fermentationwhich is commonly called " excoriations" communicating itself with rapidity to' the whole deposit, and assumes the appearance of a pestilence, producing great <a name="loss63"><mark>loss</mark></a>, X. a. 435 gilt galleys should be formed around tobacco houses, in which to deposit the sticks that have been cut by sections, to the end that the gathering maybe performed in good order, not until after they have made the first ferment at ion, which the workman call ripe king, and which will hasten very much the drying of the leaves in the said houses. The empty cutis should be placed upon some wheels in the guard spaces, wheels two yards wide, and which will be able to contain eight loaded cutis, which the gathered will fill with those first cut, since they are most withered and should not be left too long in the sun. The mode of collecting said bundles is sufficiently. well known' and it is truly 'very advantageous to parade the bundles apart, being careful that the wind shall not, make them fall into a situation encountering the shoots, leaving the principal stem out, by which mode it will take less time to dry. The measure of the cutis regularly is four and a half yards, and the quantity of bundles it will contain, more than 150 or 200. When the first ferment at ion is over, which is commonly in four days, at which time they are placed very near and at most pressed into the madura der os (places for ripe king) they should be brought into the tobacco house and placed upon the sticks as separate as possible, that the free air may circulate through them, destroying the bad odor they have acquired by their violent ferment at ion, and that they may dry with more facility. When the abundance of the collection exacts a place for this preparation, the dries t sticks should 'be collected those that without inconvenience from the moisture of its juices can be reunited when wished for, and needed to give more capacity to the late ones: this operation has moreover the advantage of concentrating the aromas of the leaves, taking some with others, according to the scarcity of the latest and the superabundance of the most imbued or loaded. The first cut having been made, which is the best, and which is known by the name of the principal or first cut, the s talks should be cut from the flower to the ground, and a general irrigation of them be made, according as the time may be, in order to revive the fertility of the land, blunted in some manner by the strong former growth. By this means, the shoots will be more readily liquid a ted, and will serve to make the second harvest, which is known by the name capaduras or second cut. The two most robust should be preferred, leaving entire all above it, covering the wounds of the trunk or stalk with maturing from the fund in the ditches, a portion retained for this purpose, by which operation the shoots will increase with more energy. These shoots should be cultivated in the same manner as the first p runing and stopping when the flowers appear, by which process the leaves will increase in a very remarkable manner, and will give another harvest, which, if not so valuable as the first will nevertheless compensate liberally the labor that it has occasioned seeing quick for a class of fillings. These leaves vary much from the first cut by their different form, being longer and more a culminated, the fibres coming out from the principal vierge of the leaf which mechanism is more regular in the leaves of the first cut. A third cutting or harvest can be made from the same s talks again, cutting below the surface of the earth, but good production cannot be obtained for reason of the debility they have experienced, nd for the revolution nature makes at the beginning of spring, at which period the third harvest is made: it would be better to turn the s talks in again and arrange things for sloughing and narrowing the land in the same manner as it was done in May. In making the second crop or harvest, either a parallelogram or a portion of plants should be left to seed, that a reproduction of seeds may 436 X. be obtained for the following harvest, of which collection and preservation I shall hereafter speak. Two methods are known for selecting tobacco, the one being natural, the other artificial. The last is done at the moment the leaf is perfectly ripe, at whatever time, gathering during the, night the number of cutis or sticks that can be benefit ted during the following day, placing them in the night upon the scaffolding places that have been made for ripe king, that they may receive the night dew, and be softened into a state for calling, opening and selecting. In the morning they should be gathered up and placed in harmfuls in a box made of twigs or seats from whence they should be taken for as sorting, which should be done in a sheltered place. The natural method, is when the rains have begun, and the moisture of the atmosphere has made the leaves moist, in which state the cutis should be taken from the props or scaffolding, and the tobacco collected in harmfuls to be carried to the sheltered place that should be prepared to receive it, and which should bet placed upon a heap of dry leaves, to protect them from the moisture of the ground, the chinks of said place should be gauged with twigs, to prevent the entrance of the air and moisture. The harmfuls should be placed to the sides, placing the points of the leaves within, in order to preserve them moist. Two files of handfuls should be placed with sprouts towards the wall and exterior part of the quarter, forming a heap, that should not exceed two yards in height h, the natural weight of which will be sufficient for the pressure that ought to be effected in the first ferment at ion of the dry leaf, communicating to itself the same time the aroma of the plant concentrated by drying, and which dis involves itself in consequence of the moisture which has softened them. It is always necessary to form a place, or shed, where it can be sheltered with more nice ty, and the precious fruit of so many labors be taken care of with more efficiency. The time the tobacco should be in this state, will be needed by the proprietor to clear and put in order his fields, to supply the seats, food and provision of e a tables for the time of as sorting, which should be performed without interruption. These measures will save much expense. Also the field of fields should be re nova ted, giving to it the same labors, making the same ditches of furrows and placing in all of them the pure horse manure, which had been collected daily during the preceding, year, leaving them uncovered some days, and when well soaked, covering them in the manner above referred to. The seeds which are destined for reproduction will be already ripened which will be known by the yellow color of the capsules) despoiled of the flowers which crowned them. They should be collected, breaking the s talks with the right hand, and placing them in harmfuls upon the left arm, when the volume is much, it should be placed in baskets to be carried to the tobacco house, when the bundles should be fastened for hanging on the cutis in the same manner as the tobacco was left to dry perfectly; they should then be examined and placed in barrels until the time of sowing. Thus the workman, having finished these cares, should commence as sorting, taking at night from the pile all the tobacco that can be stripped in a first working, which should be deposited in some boxes constructed at the side of the wall of the saloon, quarter or place appropriated to this business. They should be formed of withes fastened at some distance in the manner of weaving, with corresponding divisions numbering from two to four. I n the morning the laborers should be placed on some low seats, placing be x. 437 fore each one a portion of stripped leaves, which should be opened and four separations made, according to the size and quality. 'in individual, intelligent in this business, should examine the two most superior, and divide them with great care, into the first and second, and place them in their respective boxes. The third and fourth classes, 'te overseers who are intelligent individuals, and have no other office in as sorting, should collect and form the bundles in the number of leaves the proprietor wishes, since they have no fixed number in market. Very night should be reported the operation of stripping, because it is more economical to do it when all are together and attending to the same thing, clearing the .place of thestalkslitter, &c, which would impede the laborer during the day and having the as sorting done with the greatest possible neatness. When the overseers of the third and fourth class have made a great many bundles, they should go depositing them in their respective boxes, 'with the heads turned out, in order that the soft points may not be mangled and broken, ca ring always to arrange them so that the air may not penetrate them. Also when the boxes first and second contain sufficient, by a prudent calculation, to make two or three tierces, they should be wet or sprinkled in the following manner: A bunch of cutis of tobacco should, be formed half a yard from the ground and one in width, upon which should be placed leaves sufficient to cover it. When a fine sponge should be taken very wet, lightly soaked in a liquid, and raising the hand, said leaves should be be de wed with some force, in order that the dew may enter the leaves. Practicing this operation upon both sides of this first bed, and afterwards placing the other, should be placed upon the first, and should be be de wed upon the top, taking that from underneath and placing it upon 'the top and follow, doing this to the conclusion, covering them with a cloth in order that they may not lose the odor of the composition of bit men. Having placed a regular quantity of dried leaves of tobacco and aromatic drugs in a barrel of river or well water, which infusion should be stirred many times the first and second day in order to press out the aroma of the drugs, after which they should be left quiet until the liquor has affected a sensible ferment at ion. The barrel should then be uncovered, and the liquor already pure, should be drawn off to make the irrigation and operation of bit up or bit men. The tierces are made in various ways, but the shortest and most regular, is making a box upon a square of coarsely worked timbers, upon whose sides should be placed five pillars for props, leaving the figure in a <a name="mould22"><mark>mould</mark></a> or box. I to size should be regulated to the size of the leaves, placing two that they may touch at their points, lengthening or contracting said <a name="mould23"><mark>mould</mark></a> or box for the heads, from or to the ten on that supports it, and by one smile or peg that subjects it to the place desired. In the bottom of said box should be, placed three cords of Majagua bark, with which the tierce maybe fastened, and upon which should be placed the two principal seats, and in, the sides and subject to the pillars in stays should be placed the other two which form the tierce. The beds of handfuls should be placed with their heads turned outwards, and their points inward, distributing them proportion ably to the number it has to hold, according to the quality, and in three beds only. Placed in this order, the states or seats are doubled from the sides in form of a packet, following those heads that touch in the centre. The cords should be bound with a rational force, to the end. that they may not be too closely bound, or the handfuls injured by too close pressure. After this process, the pillars should be loosened by438Ex. Doc. No. bathe wedges that retained them, and they should be placed upon some hides or skins, to give .them the rope which finished the process. The tierce s should be numbered according to their quality, and should be left some time to the sun to dry the moisture from the seats, being moistened in order to form the tierces: and lastly, they should be placed in the warehouse or place of deposit, upon sleepers, to keep them from the moisture of the ground, being careful to not place too many upon each other, because too great weight might cause them to lose the form, the regular form with which they ought to come from the box, perfectly well made. In the same manner they should avoid being broken, as that would injure them very much. In the third and fourth class, the operation of bed ewing differs, as in these the sheaf or bundles receive the dew although placed upon the same benches, sprinkling them for the night, keeping them piled some time, that they may soak and communicate to each other the balsam in odor of the composition of bit men. The tierces of these classes are made in the same manner as the first, with the difference of contracting the box to the size of the leaves. Calculation of the probable products of Tobacco cultivated by this method. A parallelogram of two hundred yards in length and fifty in breadth, will contain, at the distance of four fifths of a yard, one hundred and sixty ditches or furrows, in each one of these, there can be placed one hundred plants at the distance of half a yard.

Juli  Of' Of    Tveyra440 X. Doc- No. 54. Appendi X No. 10. Of    Of. An Essay on the Culture and Manufacture of Silk, by H. P. Byram, Brandenburg, Leave county, Kentucky. Experience of past ages has fully proved that the climate of the Unitedstates is as well a dared to the nature and habits of the silkworm and the production of silk, as that of any other country. Several varieties of themulberry being indigenous in our soil, and those generally used in the native country of the silkworm succeed equally well in our own soil and climate. Hence, from the nature and habits of the American people, we must soon become the greatest silk growing nation on the earth. The first step towards the production of silk, is to secure a supply of suitable food for the silkworm. Having tried all the varieties introduced into our country, I find them or us multicaulis and the Wanton varieties, all things considered, most suitable for that purpose. Propagation of the . Mulberryalthough the experience of some years past has rendered this subject familiar to many, yet those now most likely to engage in the legitimate business of silk growing may be less acquainted with the propagation of the tree. I shall give some brief direction on the subject. Almost any soil that is high and dry, and that will mature I indian corn, is suitable for the mulberry. That, however, which is inclined to be light or sandy is the best. The for us multicaulis may be propagated by cuttings or layers, (or a good variety may be raised from- the seed) Cuttings may be of one or more buds, planted perpendicularly, in a light, mellow bed of good soil. They should be planted when the spring has fully opened, or about the usual time of planting corn. They may be planted in the rows, about twelve inches apart, and the rows at a sufficient distance to admit of a thorough cultivation with a plough or cultivate or. The ground should be kept mellow until past midsummer. Select a suitable piece of ground for a permanent orchard. It would be well if broken up in the fall, and again ploughed in the spring, and, if followed with the sub soil plough, it would be advantageous. After a thorough narrowing it should be laid off in rows each way eight feet by four, with the plough. The trees at one year old from the nursery should be taken up, the tops cut off near the root, and one planted in each of the squares or hills. Having tried various methods of planting and different distances, I prefer these here given. This will admit the free use of the plough and tultivatorboth ways. In latitudes north of 380 or 400, where land is dear, they may be planted much nearer, If a sufficient quantity of cuttings from old trees cannot atcncebe procured, the trees from the nursery should be taken up in the fall, X. a. 441 and hurried in a cellar, or upon the north side of a bank or hill, in alternate layers of trees and earth, and the whole protected by a shed from the rains of winter, as the plants seldom sufficiently mature the first season from the cuttings, to withstand the winters of a northern climate, particularly that portion above the ground. South of 38 of latitude these precautions may not be necessary. The Wanton mulberry is a more hardy kind, resembling in some degree, the varieties known as the common I italian, producing a large full thick leaf. This variety is propagated from seed and from layers, but does not readily strike root from cuttings. In 1838, I procured a quantity of this seed from Wanton, which produced a variety of plants. Those producing the greatest quantity of fruit yield an inferior leaf. They are now propagation g this variety very extensively at the silk growing establishment at Economy, Pennsylvania, which, in connection with the for us multicaulis, constitute the principal food used at this establishment. The fruit should be gathered when fully ripe, and the seed washed out and dried. I south of the thirty ninth parallel of latitude, they may be planted the same season. North of this, they should be planted in the following spring, in a bed of rich earth prepared as for bees or onions, and planted in drills about eighteen inches apart. The young plants should be thinned to the distance of from one to three inches from each other. They should be well cultivated, when they will attain the height of three or four feet the first season. In the, fall, in a northern climate, the young trees should be taken up and protected during the winter, as directed for them or us multicaulis. In .the following spring the branches may be taken off her , the main stem, the top shortened, and the whole tree planted, completely covering the roots and the main stem fro it i one to two inches deep. In this way two or more trees may be produced from each plant. -If a full supply can be procured, the roots of the young plants may at once be removed to the orchard. They may be allowed to stand much nearer than the multicaulis, leaving only sufficient room for cultivation. When seed is required it would be well to plant out a portion from the seed bed at once, as standards for this purpose, always selecting those bearing fill heart shaped leaves. The leaves of the white I italian produce a good heavy cochon, and should always be used in the last age of the worms when other larger leaved varieties cannot be obtained. Cultivationthe mulberry orchard should be annually cultivated. The ground kept mellow and free from weeds until the middle of July. The fields should be divided into three equal parts, and after the second season from planting, one third each year should be cut down near the ground. This will cause a more vigorous growth, and an abundant crop of foliage. Feeding .pp )artmentsVarious plans have been proposed and adopted for cocooneries or feeding sheds for the silkworm; none of which, I think are without objection, except a perfect laboratory, so constructed as to be able to fully control the atmosphere and temperature within. These, however, would be too expensive, and require too much skill and judgment for general adoption 442 X. a. Open or shed feeding has been employed with some success of late years, and for general use may be the most successful for family establishments. This, however, confines the whole business particularly in the northern states, to one or two crops in the season. South of Ohio, more can be successfully fed. These sheds may be cheaply made, by setting some dura be posts in the ground, say from six to eight feet high, with a roof of singles or boards. The roof should project two feet over the sides. There should be some temporary protection to the ends and sides of the shed, perhaps the best and cheapest can be made of strong cotton cloth, (osnaburg) three or four widths should be sewed together, with small rods across the bottom which will answer as weights, and also as rollers, which, by the aid of a pulley may be rolled up or let down at pleasure. The width of the sheds must be governed by the size of the hur does of feeding trays used. The width that I have adopted is from eighteen to twenty feet. The length according to the extent of the feeding contemplated. There it is designed to carry on an extensive business, a building should be constructed expressly for the purpose. It should be on an elevated situation, convenient to the mulberry orchard. There should be a cellar under the building. Any material commonly used for building maybe, employed. If of wood, weather boarded and plastered. It would be well to fill up the space between the two with t an bark or unburnt brick, or something of the kind; which will render the temperature more uniform. The width of the building. should be twenty or twenty-eight feet. The former admitting of two, and the latter of three double ranges of hur does or t rays of suitable size. The length suited to the extent of the business, s designed. It should be two stories high, and so constructed as to be thoroughly ventilated. There should be two double doors in each end, with doors, windows, and ventilators in the sides. The windows should extend to near the top of the rooms. , There should be sliding ventilators near the floor. The windows may be filled with oiled paper or cloth, which will admit the light and exclude the sun. It would also be important to have under each tier of hur does, through the floor, two planks of ten inches width each, hung with hinges that they may be raised at pleasure by a pulley. -also an upright ventilator on the roof, fitted with blinds, through which a constant draft may be kept up. In one end of the building in each of the two doors there should be aventilating wheel made of thin boards, (plank) much after the form of the wheels applied to the stern of our steam pro pellets. These wheels should be about two feet in diameter. They should be put in motion for a few minutes every hour, or oftener in still weather. Both may be made to turn by one crank, connecting each by bands and whirls to the main shaft. An air furnace, such as is now employed in heating churches and other buildings, should be constructed in the cellar, and so arranged as to draw directly from the feeding rooms all the air necessary to supply the furnace. The air, when heated in the chamber, should be conveyed through the whole length of the rooms, in a square pipe with openings at short distances from each other, which should increase in size as they recede from the furnace. These openings may be so connected as to be all closed at once, or a valve applied at the air chamber may be used to cut off the communication of heated air when the temperature is sufficiently high in the room, X. a. 443 suffering the hot air to escape outside of the building. In the last ages of the worms the furnace will be found of great benefit, even when the heat is not required in the rooms, for the purpose of drawing off and consuming the impure air of thecocoonery. At Economy, they not only make use of air furnaces, but in an adjoining building they have a large air pump constantly in operation, connected with the cocoonery by a pipe with small openings through the- length of the building. This pump is kept in motion by a steam engine. With good eggs, when proper means have been employed for their preservation and the feeding apartments thoroughly ventilated, I do not know of a single instance where the worms .have proved unhealthy. From the conviction that proper regard had not generally been paid to the ventilation of cocooneries, in the summer of 1842 I commenced a series of experiments by which I ascertained that the silk worm, during its last age, consumed nearly its own weight of leaves daily; and that the amount of excavations or imperceptible perspiration given off in proportion to the quantity of food consumed, was about equal to that ascertained to escape from a healthy man. I found, from the most carefully conducted experiments, that the weight of one hundred thousand silk worms, about five days before their time of winding, was four hundred and fifty-eight pounds, and that they would consume daily three hundred and seventy-two pounds of leaves* and that their increased weight in twenty-four hours from the food consumed was forty-six pounds; and that the enormous amount of two hundred and six pounds was given off in the same time, in the form of excavations or imperceptible perspiration alone. This, then, I think, fully explains the cause of <a name="disease131"><mark>disease</mark></a> complained of by many, and. establishes the importance of ventilation in every possible form. In one corner of the building there should be a watching room, with which the furnace below should be connected, so as to receive a greater or less degree of heat, as may be required, without reference to the temperature of the feeding rooms. Mixtures. In fitting .up the hur does or feeding shelves for a building of twenty feet wide; it will require a double range of posts two and a half or three inches square, on each side of the centre of the room, running length wise, and the length of the shelves apart, in the ranges, and each two corresponding posts, cross wise of the ranges, about the width of the two shelves apart. In each double range across the posts are nailed strips, one inch or more in width and about fifteen inches apart, on which the trays or hur does rest, which may be drawn out or slid in as may be found necessary in feeding. The a isles or passages of a building of the above width will be four feet each, allowing two feet for the width of each single hur due. The hur does that I have used for man i years are of t wine network. Frame is first made five feet long and two feet wide, of boards seven-eighths of an inch thick, and one and a half inches wide. There should be two braces across the frame at equal distances of five-eighths by seven-eighths of an ind h square. In a line about half an inch from the inner edge of the frame are driven tacks nearly down to their heads, at such distances as will* Had these worms been fed in the ordinary, manner they would have co resumed many more leaves in the same time. But to preserve the greatest possible accuracy, through the whole experiment, they were fed rather sparingly 444 X. make the meshes of the net about three quarters of an inch square. Good hemp or flax t wine is passed around these tacks, forming a net by passing the filling double over and under the warp, or that part of the t wine that runs length wise. This t wine should be somewhat smaller than that running length wise. In a damp day the t wine becomes tight; I then give the getting two good coats of shell ac varnish. This cements the whole together and renders it firm and dura be. The varnish is made by dissolving a quantity of gum shell ac in alcohol in a tin covered vessel, and placed near the fire. It should be reduced, when used, to the consistence of paint. Another set of frames are made in the same way and of the same size, and covered with strong cotton or tow cloth; this is secured with small tacks. Upon these the net frames rest, which serve to catch the litter that falls through from the worms. Bundles made and supported in this manner admit of a more free circulation of air, and the litter is less liable to <a name="mould24"><mark>mould</mark></a> or ferment, and can be removed and cleaned at pleasure. With this kind of hur due and screen, I make use of winding frames, constructed in the following manner: A light frame is made of boards one and a half inches wide, and the length of the hur does, and two feet and four inches wide; this is filled cross wise with thin baths about one inch apart in the clear. The manner of using these will be hereafter explained. They answer the twofold purpose of winding frames and mounting ladders. The care and expense required in fitting up a house on this plan may prevent its "general adoption. The most common method that has been heretofore employed is permanent shelves, but the labor required to keep the worms properly cleaned renders this plan objectionable. At Economy, Pennsylvania, the rearing of the silk worm is now carried on to a great extent and more successfully than in any other part of the United States, or perhaps the world. Their houses are two stories high. The worms are fed on small ,trays about eighteen or twenty inches wide, and about three feet long. They are supported in the same manner as thehurdles above described, and are about six inches apart. When the worms are about ready to wind, they are transferred to the upper story, to permanent shelves, about sixteen inches apart, where they form their cochons in bunches of straw placed upright between, the shelves. The worms are cleaned at least once after every mounting, and after the last, every day. For this purpose they have nets wove or knit, of cotton t wine, something larger than the size of the trays, with meshes of various sizes suited to the age of the worms. For the last age they are about three quarters of an inch square. These are used without frames. When it is required to remove the worms from their litter, the nets are laid lightly over them, ana then plentifully fed. When the worms have arisen upon the fresh leaves, they are removed by two persons taking hold of the four corners of the net and transferring them to clean trays, held and carried off by a third person. One hundred thousand are changed in this manner in two hours. Description of the Will Form t will be necessary for the inexperiencedcultrs; .o have some knowledge of the forms, changes, and appearances of the silk worm before he enters upon the duties of his interesting charge, The silk worm is a species of cater pillar, whose life is one continual sue x. a. 445 cession of changes, which, in due time, becomes a moth or winged insect, like others of the genus. The time occupied in going through its different forms of existence varies in different countries governed by climate, temperature, and the quality and quantity of the food upon which it is fed, and the nature of the particular variety of the insect. The worm changes or casts its skin (of the common varieties) four times before it attains its full growth. These changes are called mountings, and the periods intervening between the several mountings are termed ages. When it is first hatched it is of a blackish color, which afterwards become slighter, varying almost daily to different shades, and in, different varieties through every age, to the close of the last, or near the time of spinning, when it assumes a grayish yellow semi transparent appearance. Having tried all the varieties that have been introduced into the Unitedstates, those I consider the best are known as the Chinese ,imperial, producing a large salmon colored pea nut shaped cochon; and a kind called the pea nut, producing a mixture of white and salmon colored cochons. His variety produces a larger and more firm cochon than any of that name that   have seen. Time of Hatchingrearingwhen the leaves of the mulberry have put forth, to the size of about an inch in diameter, it may be generally inferred that the proper time for watching the worm has arrived. The papers or cloths containing the eggs should then be brought out and placed in the watching room, upon a table or trays made for the purpose. When artificial means are employed, the temperature should be gradually raised until the time of watching, which will be in about ten days, to 75 or 80 of Fahrenheits thermometer. But few worms will make their appearance on the first day, but on the second and third the most will come out, should there be a few remaining un hatched on the fourth day they maybe thrown away, as they do not always produce strong and healthy worms. When the worms begin to make their appearance, young mulberry leave scut into narrow strips should be laid over them, to which they will readily attach themselves ;a. these should be carefully removed and placed compactly upon a cloth screen or tray, prepared for them, and other leaves placed upon the eggs, for the worms that still remain, which should be passed off as before. A singular fact will be observed, that all the worms will hat ch between sunrise and before noon of each day. Are should be taken to keep the worms of each days watching by themselves, as it is of the greatest importance to have the mountings and changes of all the worms as simultaneous as possible. It is also important that the worms that have been transferred to the trays should not be fed until the watching for the day is completed, so that all may be fed equally. Young and tender leaves should be selected to feed the worms with; these should be cut with a sharp knife into pieces not exceeding a quarter of an inch square, and evenly sifted over them. They should be fed in this way six or eight times in twenty-four hours, as near as possible at regular and stated periods. It will be impossible to lay down any definite rules for the quantity of leaves necessary for a given number of worms for each succeeding day, through every age. After a little acquaintance with their nature and habits, the intelligence and judgment of the attendant will be the best guide; they should, however, have as much as they will eat, but after a few days, care should be taken not to give them more than they will generally consume446Ex. was this will increase the accumulation of litter, which will endanger the health of the worms. In the last age they eat voraciously, when they should be well supplied. A quantity of leaves should always be on hand in case of wet weather. When the average range of the thermometer is between 700 and 80, the several mountings will take place near the fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty second days after watching. It may be known when the worms are about to cast their skins, as they cease to eat and remain stationary, with their heads raised and occasionally shaking them. This operation will be more distinctly observed as they increase in size, through their succeeding ages. Assuming the above temperature as the standard, the quantity of leaves for the three first days of this (the first) age must be gradually increased a teach feeding, after which they will require less at each succeeding meal until the time of mounting arrives, when, for about twenty-four hours, they eat nothing.  But as it is seldom the case that all cast th'eir skins at one and the same time, some will still be disposed to eat, when a few leaves must be cut fine, and sparingly scattered over them, so that those that remain to rapid may be disturbed as little as possible. They must now be carefully fed in this way until it is discovered that some have mounted, when the feeding must cease altogether until the most of them have recovered. His rule must be particularly regarded through all the succeeding mountings, otherwise some of the worms will be far in advance of others; and this want of uniformity will increase throughout each succeeding age, and to the period of winding, which will not only result in great inconvenience in gathering the cochons, but will materially injure the worms; and consequently lessen the crop of silk. When the greatest portion of the worms have mounted and appear active, leaves a little wilted are laid over them, by which they are passed to clean t rays. If any still remain that have mounted, they must be transferred in the same manner, by laying more leaves upon them. The remnant of worms that have not changed their skins, should be left upon the litter, and added to those of the next days mounting. By closely regarding these rules throughout the several ages, the worms will generally all commence the formation of the cochons about the same period. After having gone through and furnished all the worms with a quantity of leaves, it is well to go over a second time and add more where they seem to require it. Very young and tender leaves must be given to the worms in the first age; after which older ones can be given, as they advance in age, until after the last mounting, when they should be fed upon sound full grown leaves. After .the second mounting, the leaves, where large crops are fed, may be cut by running them twice through a common rotary hay or straw c utter ofHoveys, or one of a similar make. The worms will frequently heap together and become too thick, as they increase in size; when they are fed, the leaves must be spread and the space enlarged, or they may be removed by leaves or twigs of the mulberryto places unoccupied. If they are permitted to be crowded, <a name="disease132"><mark>disease</mark></a> is apt to follow, and the whole crop endangered. It will sometimes be observed, when the light falls more directly on one side of the hur due than the other, that the worms will incline to leave that side and become crowded on the opposite, when the hur due should be turned around. Up to the last mounting it is best to feed the worms entirely upon the x. a. 447 leaves of the multicaulis; after which the Wanton or white I italian should be used, if a full supply can be obtained the former being consumed with greater aridity, and the accumulation of litter is consequently less. Thecanton and I italian produce the heaviest cock oh, while the multicaulis yields a finer and stronger fibre. In pursuing this course, the advantages of both are in some degree secured. The worms should be removed from their litter immediately after each mounting, and in their fourth age the hur does should be cleaned a second time, and after the last mounting they should be removed at least every second day. There nets are not used, in the last ages the worms are changed, by laying over them the small branches of the mulberry. Recently branch feeding, as it is termed, has been introduced with some success and with great economy of time; in the last ages of the worms, care should be taken to lay the branches as evenly as possible, especially where it is designed to use t wine hur does, otherwise it will be difficult for the worms to ascend through the getting. When the worms are about to spin, they present something of a yellowish appearance; they refuse to eat and wander about in pursuit of a hiding place, and throw out fibres of silk upon the leaves. The hur does should now be thoroughly cleaned for the last time, and something prepared for them to form their cochons in. Various plans have been proposed for this purpose. The late' frames, before described, I prefer. They are used by resting the back edge of the frame upon the hur due, where the two meet in the double range, and raising the front edge up to the under side of thehurdle above, which is held to its place by two small wire hooks attached to the edge of the hur due, )showing an end view thus covering of paper or cloth should be applied to the late frames. in using the hur does and screens, I remove the screen from under the hur due, turning the other side up, and letting it down directly upon the winding frame. This affords double the room for the worms to wind in.  Path frames of this description have advantages that no other fixtures for winding possess that I have ever seen tried. The frame resting upon the back side of each hur due renders this side more dark, which places the worms instinctively seek, when they meet with the ends of the baths and immediately ascend to convenient places for the formation of their cochons. From these frames the cochons are gathered with great facility, and free from litter and dirt, and when they are required they are put up with great expedition. There branch feeding has been adopted by some, no other accommodation has been provided for the winding of the worms than that afforded them by the branches from which they have fed. This is decidedly objectionable, as the worms are always disposed to rise until their course is obstructed above. When this is not the case, they wander about for hours upon the tops of the branches, and only descend after their strength becomes exhausted, and the result is, the production of a crop of loose inferior cochons. Next to late frames, small bunches of straw afford the best accommodation for this purpose. Eye straw is preferred. Take a small bunch about the size of the little finger, and with some strong t wine tie it firmly about half an inch from the butt of the straw; cut the bunch off about half a at inch longer than the distance between the hur does. They are thus placed upright with their butt ends downwards, with their tops spreading out, interlacing 448 X. Doc. -to. 54.each other, and pressing against the hur does above. They should be thickly set in double rows about sixteen inches apart, across the hur does. These may be preserved for a number of years. After the most of the worms have arisen, the few remaining may be removed to hur does by themselves. In three or four days the cochons maybe gathered. While gathering, those designed for eggs should be selected. Those of firm and fine texture with round hard ends are the best; The smaller cochons most generally produce the male, and those larger and more full at the ends, the female insect. Each healthy female moth will lay from four hundred to six hundred eggs. But it is not always safe to calculate on one half of the cochons to produce female moths. Therefore it t is well to save an extra number to insure a supply of eggs. The cochons intended for eggs should be stripped of their f <a name="loss64"><mark>loss</mark></a> or loose tow, which consists of irregular fibres, by which the worm attaches its work to whatever place it is about to form its cochon. These should be placed onhurdles, in a thin layer, and in about two weeks the moths will come out always in the fore part of the day, and generally before the sun is two hours high. If laid upon a net hur due (which is best) they will immediately fall through the meshes and remain suspended on the under side, where they are not liable to become entangled in the cochons. As soon as the male finds the female they become united. They should be taken carefully by the wings, in pairs, and placed upon sheets of paper, to remain until near night, when the female will be anxious to lay her eggs. When take each gently by the wings and separate them, placing the females at regular distances, about two inches from each other, upon sheets of paper or fine cotton or linen cloth; ,these should hang over a line, or be tacked to the side of the house. In two or three nights the moths will complete their laying, when they should be removed from the papers or cloths. Frequently the males appear first in the greatest numbers, some of which should be reserved each day, in case there should afterwards be an excess of females. They should be shut out from the light, otherwise they are liable to injure themselves by a constant fluttering of their wings. The female is largest, and seldom moves or flutters. Filling the Chrysalidesafter the cochons have been gathered, those that are intended for sale, or for future reeling, must be submitted to some process by which the moths will be killed, otherwise they will perforate and spoil the cochons. This is done by various methods. The most simple and convenient is to spread them thinly on boards, and expose them to the direct rays of the sun. In a hot day many of them will be killed in a few hours, but they must be stirred occasionally, or some will be liable to escape the heat, and afterwards some out. At Economy they place them in an ,air tight box containing about ten bushels, (the box should always be full, or if not, a partition is fitted down to the cochons) sprinkling evenly through the whole, beginning at the bottom, about three ounces of camphor, slightly moistened with alcohol, and finely pulverised. The box is then closed, and the seams of the top covered by pasting strips of paper over them. They remain in this way about three or four days. They are then spread out thinly in an upper left to cure, where they should be occasionally stirred. It will require some weeks to thoroughly cure them. Before camphoring, the dead and bad cochons must be taken out, otherwise they will spoil the good ones. When it is convenient, it is best to re el as many of the cochons as possible x. immediately after they are gathered, as they re el much; more freely, before i hey are exposed to ;the sun or dried. Succession of Gcopspreservation Of Eggsrepeated attempts have been made to feed a succession of crops of worms throughout the entire season from the same stock of eggs. In most instances success has failed to attend these efforts. 'when proper means are employed and due care observed, the eggs may be preserved and worms successfully raised until the feed is destroyed by the frost. In many years experience I have never failed in this respect. In the spring of 1840 I communicated to Miss Rapp, of Economy, my method of preserving eggs, which she immediately adopted, and has pursued it until the present time with perfect success, feeding from eighteen to twenty-five crops each year. The following is an extract of a letter from the postmaster at Economy, dated Jaiiiary 19th 1843."Between May and September, we raised near two millions of worms, in eighteen sets, of near equal numbers, about a week apart, producing three hundred and seventy-one bushels of cochons. The last crop hatched the 9th of September and spun the 10th of October. We found no difference in the health of the different sorts. We are of the opinion that the late keeping of the eggs does not bring <a name="disease133"><mark>disease</mark></a> or i the worms, if they are kept right, and gradually brought forward as they ought to be t may be remarked that the qualities of the mulberry leaf are such in the father part of the season that as heavy cochons will not be produced' as in the first. A bushel of the first crop raised i at Economy, in the season referred to, produced twenty-three and a quarter ounces of reeled silk and the last crop, wound in October, but nineteen ounces. About one month of the best part of that season of feeding was lost by the severe frost that occurred on the 5th of May, which entirely killed the young leaves, and must have materially injured the whole crop of the season by method of preserving eggs is to place them in the ice house in February, or early in At ich or sooner if the weather is warm. For this purpose a to or square trunk is made, extending from within one foot of the bottom of the ice to the to the p. This may be made in joints, so that as the ice settles the upper joints may be removed. The eggs should be placed in at in, box, and this enclosed in a wood one, and suspended in the t ink near the ice. The communication of warm air s hold be *out ff by filling the opening with a bundle of saw. o- mary. The eggs should be ai red for a few minutes, as often as once in one or two weeks, always choosing a cool dry morning; When selections for succeeding crops may be made, these should be placed in another box and gradually raised in the trunk for several days, avoiding a too sudden transition from the ice to the temperature of thehatchingroom. Their ice house at Economy is connected with the cellar, the bottom of the former being eighteen inches below that of the latter. A long wooden box extending into the ice house, level with the bottom of the cellar floor, contains all the smaller boxes of eggs. The door of the box, opening in the cellar, is kept well closed to prevent the admission of warm air. They employ another ice house, sunk deep in the cellar, with shelves gradually rising from the ice up to the top of, the ground, upon which the eggs of succeeding crops are placed, and raised one shelf higher every day, until they are taken into the watching room. The past season they have hatched are of i ve ounces of eggs, or one hundred thousand worms every four daystseases of the Silk Wormthe silk worm, like every other animal or 29 450 X. insect is liable to <a name="disease134"><mark>disease</mark></a> and premature death. European writers have enumerated and described six particular diseases to which it is subject. But in our more congenial climate nothing is wanting to insure a healthy stock of silk worms, and a profitable return from their labors, but to give them sufficient room, a regular and full supply of suitable food, a strict regard to cleanliness, and a proper ventilation of their apartments. In excessively hot, damp, or sultry weather, in the last age, the <a name="disease135"><mark>disease</mark></a> known as the yellows sometimes occurs. There open feeding is adopted some fine airs lacked lime may be sifted on the worms once or twice a day, before feeding, and the diseased and dead worms picked out and thrown away. In a regular cocoonery, properly ventilated and supplied with an air furnace, dry air should be made to circulate freely. :but if the temperature is above eighty or eighty-five degrees, the ventilation g apparatus should be constantly employed .until a change of weather occurs, or the <a name="disease136"><mark>disease</mark></a> disappears. A feeding house should be so arranged as to cut off all communication of rats and mice from the a worms and the -c corns. Reelizngwe have now arrived at another branch of the silk business, which more. properly comes under the head of manufacturing. Very farmer who engages in the silk culture, in order to avail himself of an additional profit, should provide his family with a suitable re el, by the use of which, after a little experience, he will be enabled to offer his silk in market, in a form that will greatly enhance its value, and much reduce the trouble and expense of transportation. Feels can now be procured in almost any of the principal cities at a small cost, or they can be made by any ingenious farmer or carpenter. The re el now uniformly used is that known as the Piedmontese. All attempts to improve this re el in its general principles, I believe, have failed. At Economy, however, they have made an addition which may be found useful. It consists of two pair of whirls, made of wire in the form of an aspen to a re el, about four inches long and two and a half inches across at the ends, the wires being bent in the middle, leaving them about one and a half inches across from arm to arm, making the circumference about six inches. These whirls are set in an iron frame, and run each upon two points or centres. Each pair is set e qui distant, on a direct line, about eight inches apart, between the first guides and those on the traverse bar, instead of making the usual number of turns around each thread, as they pass between the guides on the re el. With this arrange men, each thread is taken from the basin and passed through the first guides/ then carried over and around the two whirls, and where they pass each other on the top, the turns are made necessary to give firmness to the thread, .hen passing directly through the guides in the traverse bar to the arms of the re el, making each thread in reeling independent of the other. This enables the reeled, when a remnant of cochons are to be finished on leaving the work, to unite both threads into one, retaining the necessary size; whereas both would be too fine if continued on the re el in the ordinary manner. Directions for reeling n family establishment, a common clay or iron furnace should be procured, to which should be fitted a sheet iron top, about twelve inches high, with a door on one side, and a small pipe on the opposite side to convey off the smoke; this top should retain the same be valor flare as the furnace, so as to be about twenty inches in diameter at the top. The pan should be twenty inches square and six inches deep, divided x. 4 into four apartments, two of which should be one inch larger one way than the others. They should all communicate with each other at the bottom, In large fili natures, a small steam engine to proper the feels, &c, and to heat the water for reeling would be necessary. -before the operation of reeling is commenced, the cochons must be stripped of their f <a name="loss65"><mark>loss</mark></a>, and as sorted into three separate parcels, according to quality or of different degrees of firmness. The double cochons or those formed b two or more worms spinning together, the fibres crossing each other an rendering them difficult to re el; these should be laid aside to be manufactured in a different manner. After the cochons have been as sorted as above directed, the operation of reeling may be commenced. The basin should be nearly filled with the soft est water, and kept to a proper heat by burning charcoal, or some other convenient method of keeping up a regular heat. The precise temperature cannot be ascertained until the reeling is commenced, owing to the different qualities of cochons; those of the best quality will require a greater degree of heat than those of a more loose and open texture; hence the importance of assisting them. Cocoons also require less heat, and re el much better when done before the chrysalides are killed, and the cochons become dried. The heat of the water may be raised to near the boiling point, (it should never be allowed to boil) when two or three handfuls of cochons may be thrown into one of the large apartments of the basin, which must be gently pressed under water for a few minutes, with a little brush, made of, broom corn, with the ends shortened. The heat of the water will soon soften the gum of the" silk, and thereby loose n the ends of the filaments; the reeled should then gently stir the cochons with the brush, until the loose fibres adhere to it; they are then separated from the brush, holding the filaments in the left hand, while the cochons are carefully combed down between the fingers of the right hand, as they are raised out of the water. This is continued until the f <a name="loss66"><mark>loss</mark></a> or false ends are all drawn off, and the fine silk begins to appear; the fibres are then broken off and laid over the edge of the basin. The f <a name="loss67"><mark>loss</mark></a> is then cleared from the brush and laid aside as refuse silk, and the operation continued until most of the ends are thus collected. If the silk is designed for sewings, about twenty-five fibres should compose a thread; if intended for other fabrics, from eight to fifteen should be reeled together. The finer silk should always be reeled from the bestcocoons. The cochons composing the threads are taken up in a small tin swimmer, made for the purpose, and passed from the large apartment of the basin to those directly under the guides. As the ends become broken they are passed back into the spare apartment, where they are again collected to be returned to the re el. The requisite number of fibres thus collected for two threads are passed, each, through the lower guides. They are then wound around each other two or three times, and each carried through the two guides in the traverse bar, and then attached to the arms of the re el. The turning should now be commenced with a slow and steady motion, until the threads run freely. While the re el is turning, the person attending the cochons must continually be adding fresh ends, as they may be required, not waiting until the number she began with is reduced, because the internal fibres are much finer than those composing the external layers. In adding new ends, the reeled must attach them, by gently pressing them with a little turn between the thumb and finger, to the threads as they are running. As the silk is reeled off, the chrysalides should be taken out of 452 X. the basin, otherwise they obscure and thick en the water and injure the color and lust r of the silk. When the water becomes dis colored it should always be changed. I f, in reeling, the silk leaves the cochon in burst or bunches, it is evident the water is too hot; or when the ends cannot be easily collected with the brush, or, when found, do not run freely, the water is too cold. A pail of cold water should always be at hand, to be added to the basin as it may be required. When the cochons yield their fibres freely, the feel may be turned with a quicker motion. The quicker the motion, the smoother, and better will be the silk. When: fro four to six ounces have been reeled, the aspen may be taken off, that the silk 'ici d 127) ' The end should be fastened so 'as to be readily found.

The quality of the silk depends much upon the art and skilful management of the reeled. All that is required to render one perfect in the art o free lip is a ittlejpractice, accompanied at the beginning with a degree of patience, and the exercise of judgment in keeping up the proper temperature f water, and the threads of a uniform size manufacture of perforated cochons. -the perforated and double cocoonacan be manufactured into various fabrics, such as stockings, gloves, under s hits. and the like. Before the cochons can be spun, they must be put into a clean bag, made of some open cloth, and placed in a pot or kettle, and covered with soft water, with soap (hard or soft) added, i sufficient to make a strong sums, ;and oiled for about three or four hours. If they are required to. be very nice and white, the water may be changed, and a small quantity more of soap added, and again boiled for a few minutes. After they are boiled, they may be hung up and drained; they should then be rinsed; while in the oak, in fair water, and hung out to dry, without disturbing them in the bag. When completely dry, they may be spun on the common flax wheel, by first taking the cochon in the fingers, and slightly loosening the fibres that become flattened down by boiling, and then spinning off from the pierced end. The silk will run entirely off, leaving the shell bare. The double cochons may be spun in the same manner, but should be boiled separately. Management Of A Cocoonery. Mackshi Of Cocoonery, near Leading, Hamilton To, Ohio, Sov. 17, 1845. E. J. Hooper, Dear Air: Agreeably to your request, I will give my mode of silk growing. I have been feeding, for the last six .years, with varied success. I have tried a number of plans and find the more simple the plan the better. I use Morris' Burlington frame, and think it decidedly the best I have seen or tried. First have good eggs, well kept, and. do not let then t hat ch till warm weather has fairly set in say from tenth to twenty fifth of By, as the season may be. As soon as they are hatched, lay on leaves and move them on to clean papers by lifting the leaves. He careful not to get them too thick, or you cannot feed them enough without covering them too deep x. a. 453 with leaves. Love and spread them every day, except when they are mounting. Need often with fresh leaves, give them all the air you can, so that they do not blow away. After the first mounting, feed with short, tender, twigs, They are easily moved and spread with the twigs in the morning when they are hungry. If they are neglected while young it is useless to feed them while they are old. I believe that all the diseases I have had among my worms were caused by neglect, or by keeping them in a close building where there was not enough pure air. After they pass the second mounting, if they are fed with care, they will eat the leaves so clean that they will need to be moved but once between each mounting, and that should be done just before they mount; but should their bed become foul move them by all means. I keep each days watching separate. The first day but few worms will hat ch, and they serve as a guide for all the rest. When they commence mounting, you can move the others on clean papers before they commencemnoulting. If the worms are well fed and not too thick on the, papers, and the, weather warm, they will mount nearly at the same time that is, 'each day snatching, and when they are kept separate and the papers marked 1st, 2d and 3d day, &c, you can feed them as they ought to be fed, and when they commence winding you can put up the bushes for them to wind in, as each -lotfeommences. They will not all need them at once as they would if all ages were mixed. When all the frames commence winding at once .they cannot be attended to in time, and many worms will be lost if there is no place provided for them. They will crawl over the frames and waste their silk- even if they make a cochon it will be of but little value. After the third mounting, feed with branches as long as they will lay on the frames. Deep the bed as even as possible. Met no leaves hang over the frame, lest some of the worms crawl out on them, others will cut them off, and leaves and worms will fall together to the ground When the worms get too large to lift with the branches, and they want moving, I place five strips, three-eighths or one half inch square, across the frames, (the frames are three by four feet) the strips are three feet four inches long; so as to extend two inches over the frame on each side Lift lime over the whole bed till it is all white, worms and all; then lay branches length wise of the frame across the five strips. After feeding a few times the worms will all be on a new bed; they will not stay among the lime in the old bed. They are then ready to move. Have a few duplicate frames ready; lay two sheets of heavy brown paper that will cover the frame: if you could get one large enough to cover the frame kit would be better- Give the worms a good feed, and as they come upon the upper bed, place two strips, four feet long, under the ends of the five cross strips. Two persons can then raise the worms up, while the third person slips the frame and old bed out and places one of the duplicates in its place; The worms can then be let down, and they will keep eating as if nothing had happened. If it becomes necessary to move them suddenly, have four or five sharp pointed sticks, slip them through the bed of branches just below the worms; then proceed as before. Sick off what few worms remain -on the frame; throw off' the litter, and the frame is ready for the next move. They should be moved just before the l bushes are put up for them, :to wind min, and give them a good coat of lime, it keeps the: bed .frommoulamg, and they. will not wind in it; for the cochons that are made in 454 X. their bed, if it is damp weather, are poor things. Lane brush is the best for them to wind in. When that cannot be had, cut oak limbs; lay the min the sun to wilt: if they are put up green and the worm commences winding in them the leaves curl and the worm has to leave its place to find a better, and will seldom begin again. But the brush of the right length to spring in between the frames. The frames should be eighteen inches apart, three tier, one above the other, the lower one two feet from the ground. When feeding, after the brush are put -up, lay the but end of the multicaulisbranches, (nothing else is worth feeding with) snug to the oak bushes, that the worms can get to them when they want to wind. After most of the worms on a frame are gone up, pick off the rest and mark the frame: in four days gather the cochons, if the weather is warm; if not, in six days. Having the oldest worms in the upper tier, you can take them down without disturbing the rest. After the cochons are gathered, I select the best for seed. When the millers come out, I throw all the poor ones out, if there is any. The papers intended for the eggs, are hung up to keep them clean, and there will be nothing on them but the eggs. I have a few ounces of eggs from the cocoonsyou st w in the bushes when you were here. They are as good as I ever saw. I propose leaving some with you for sale this winter. They are the nankeen pea nut. To keep eggs from watching in summer, roll the papers in cotton patting, put it in a wooden box aid place them in an ice house on the ice; cover it with straw and they will keep well. The cochons intended for reeling are put in the sun as soon as they are gathered; spread them thin, and a few days will kill the- crystal is. They must be well dried or they will <a name="mould25"><mark>mould</mark></a>. The pea nut being much firmer and heavier, takes longer to kill and dry than any other variety. To sum up the whole: have good, well kept eggs; give them plenty of room an ounce of eggs, when the worms are full grown, should have twenty-five frames, three by four feet, to feed and wind on his is very essential. Deep them clean; feed in an open building; close it only when it is very windy. Cultivate your trees well; if they are not thrifty the worms will not be; yellow leaves will not do. Need the worms all they will eat from the start. I feed the leaves wet or dry as they come. It is better to have them leave some, than not have enough. Have a good place for them to wind in; and if the weather is warm and uniform, the worms will do their part. If any are diseased, pick them off. I am frequently asked: "I s it profitable ?by answer is, it will pay as well as any other farm operation. Shob41you or any other person i ant any further information I possess on the sect, I shall be happy to communicate it. Joseph Mchannon. From the Soon socket (R. I.) Patriotsi    Of Manufactures. The time is rapidly approaching when this nation will not be dependent on Europe for its consumption of manufactured silk goods, but, on the contrary, will supply herself, and have a surplus for exportation to other porEEx. a. 455 tons of the globe. This business, like all other branches of manufacturing industry, has struggled against adverse fortune, and counteracted difficulties not contemplated by its early founders. But we believe for the past year or two the manufacture of sewing silk has been highly prosperous, and several new mills have been erected in different sections of the country. In Holland county, On n, there are six factories, which respectively turn off the following amounts of sewing silk and twist per annumVyse & Sons, at Filling ton. 12,000 pounds.

The business is yet in its infancy is but imperfectly organized, and never has been judiciously nor energetically pursued. If the raw stock could be admitted free of duty, or the duties more radically reduced and we think they should be it would give an impetus to the business, and place it beyond all contingencies of domestic misfortune or foreign competition. We hope this young and productive branch of our national industry may be represented to the consideration of Congress, and the strong a runs of a protective policy extended to its aid and support. A number of the firms now in this business contemplate enlarging i heir establishments the present year; and we are informed that Messrs. Rixbrd & Butler, of Mansfield, On n, are building machinery for a new mill to be erected in Philadelphia, and to b owned and operated by gentlemen in his vicinity.

Uanti  Of I Mportedi Of Culti  Vati  Of I N The Uni Ted iSTATI  Essuccessful Cultivation of Ladder in Ohio. On. Edmund Burke, Com mr Patents, Washington: ears Fire take pleasure .in: complying with your request, to furnish such information as I possess in relation to the culture of doers m adder in this state. It will be remembered that in 1843, I furnished to your predecessor in office' a communication on this subject (published with' report of commissioner cf patents for 1843,) giving an account of the very successful experiments of Mr. Joseph Swift, near Birmingham, :ohio, who is probably the most extensive cultivate or of m adder in the Union. His first crop of which particular notice was given consisted of nine acres. It was harvested in the fall of 1842, after being allowed four seasons growth, and produced at the rate of 2000 pounds per acre on his best land. From a careful estimate of all the expenses attending the cultivation of this crop, and its preparation for market, Mr. S. furnished me the following statement of the results The amount of labor required, including the preparation of. land, planting, cultivating, digging, cleaning, threshing, &c. was from eighty to one hundred days work per acre, (including team work) The out lay for buildings, fixtures, &c, did not exceed, in all, fifty dollars. The value of the crop was at the rate of fifteen cents per pound, at which price he sold most of it, notwithstanding the circumstance of its being unknown to purchasers, and having to encounter- the prejudice that ,usually exists in such cases. The result, then, in figures, fairly stated, stands thus, for an acre of good land properly managed By 2000 pounds of m adder, at 15 cents per pound.              $300.00Contra-To 100 days' work at 75 cents per day,    $75.00Use of land 4 years at       $4 per year. 16 00 Grinding, packing, &c. . .a. 9 00 100 00 Leaving a net t profit per acre, of. 200 00 The quality of this m adder was pronounced superior to most of the imported; and no difficulty was found in selling it wherever it became known. The price of m adder in the we stein cities (and also at the east I believe has varied during the past five years, from 14 to 18 cents per pound; the better qualities often selling at 18 to 20 cents, at wholesale. The yield per acre, Mr. S. is now convinced can be increased to 3000 lb sand it is better to harvest the crop at the end of three years' growth, than to xi 457 allow a; longer period ;these, improvements will, of course, nearly double the: amount of profits. The kind of labor required in cultivating m adder, can most of it be performed by a cheap class of hands, such as German immigrants; and hence the business can be most advantageously carried on where such laborers can be readily obtained whenever wanted, without having to furnish them constant employment. The vicinity of our western cities is particularly favorable on this account; and the lack of this advantage has prevented or- Swift from engaging in the business ;as largely as he would otherwise have done. Castualtiesmadder appears to be quite as certain a crop as 'mon t others in this .country. It is entirely 'exempt from injury, by insects and also by the weather, after the first seasons growth. The plant is perfectly hardy stands frost well, and also .heat and drought excepting that during the first winter after planting: there is danger on some soils of the gr of ind p irving; by frost so as to expose the roots to the air, and cause them to winter all, as isthelcase with wheat, &6: There is also danger, in this climate, of a severe drought, occurring immediately after planting, and destroying the sets before they have commenced to grow. I suffered 'considerable <a name="loss68"><mark>loss</mark></a> from both of these causes the past year, in making an experiment with m adder near this city, (columbus) Ri. Swift, also, in the spring of 143 lost nearly the whole of his new plantation from the effects of a severe draught just afterplanticid127) 8 This occurrence left so few roots alive, that it was tw0Qyears before he obtained a sufficient quantity of sets l to renew his plantation- and this will explain why it is that he harvested no crop fr for f or five years until the past year, as he neglected to mike a any: new plantation unit i after the first experiment was 'om p leted. Or pagationI n this country, m adder produces very little if any perfect seed. I to Europe seed is produced, and it has on several occasions been imported and sold to some extent in i this country, but I have not 'heard of i a single instance where it his been made to ve get ate freely, if at all. I I n fact   a inforilned that in 'ti ll  and and France the m adder growers never depend on seed but plot sets (p ices of roots) as is done by Mr. Swift and others in this country. This add& considerably to the expense and difficulty of co m menacing the business. "Diectibns for Cultivating Ladder l: "v i ,v t r , :0." " .

The land should be as free as possible from grass or weeds, stones, roots, &c and if cult in' d in hold crops for a year or two previous all the better. The land should be ploughed as deep as possible in the fall, and if clay by, be laid up in ridges so as to be mellow in spring; and as early in spring as the ground will permit, apply a good dressing of barn yard manure upland soil would be improved by hauling on also de composed swamp earth or leaf <a name="mould26"><mark>mould</mark></a> from, the woods; the amount of enriching to be proportionate to the previous condition of the land. When plough deep, and harrow till quite smooth, and the ground is ready for planting. Plantingwith a single horse plough, strike small straight furrows, say three inches deep, and eight feet apart, the whole length of th lie field. ;I n these furrows drop the roots, placing them length wise, without breaking, leaving about one foot space between the roots, then cover with hoes, about two inches in depth. About ten bushels of sets are required' for anracreifter culture- As soon as the plants make their appearance, go over the ground between the rows with a cultivate, and with hold along the rows, carefully, so as to destroy all the weeds without injuring the plants. Repeat the cultivating and hoping as often as weeds make their appearance, as it will save much labor the second year if the ground is kept clean the. first.

Washing and drying is soon as possible after digging, take the roots to some running stream to be washed. If there is no running stream convenient, it can be done at a pump. Take large round sieges, (riddles) two and a half or three feet in diameter, with the wire about as fine as wheatsieves; or what is better, procure from a hardware store sufficient screw wire of the right fine ness, and make frames or boxes about three feet long one foot deep, and the width of the wire; on the bottom of which nail the wire. In these sieges or boxes put about half a bushel of roots at a time, and stir them well in the water, pulling the bunches apart, so as 'to wash them clean; then, having a platform at hand, lay them on it to drain. Couple of hands will wash, in this way, 125 to 150 bushels per day, in a convenient stream of running water. Next, have a sufficient number of platforms made of common light boards, with clefts nailed across the under side, putting two or three boards together, so as to make them about four feet wide, and twelve or fourteen feet long on these the roots are to be dried in the sun as follows: Take the roots to a convenient place, not far from the house, then spread them on the platforms about ;three or four inches thick; place the platforms side by side, in rows east and west, and with their ends north and south, leaving room to walk between the rows. Elevate the north ends of the platforms about eighteen inches, and the south ends about six inches from the ground, putting poles or sticks to support them; this will greatly facilitate drying. After the second or third day drying, the m adder must be protected from the dews at night, and from rain, by placing the platforms one upon another, to a convenient height, and covering the uppermost one with boards. Spread them out again in the morning, or as soon as danger is over. Give or six days of ordinary fine weather will dry the m adder sufficiently, when it may be put away ii a barn or other dry place, till it is convenient to kill dry and grind it, which may be done at any time during fall or winter, when there is prospect of fine weather. In damp weather the roots will absorb moisture from the atmosphere, while breaking and hauling to mill, so as to render it difficult to grind. Kilndryingthe size and mode of constructing the kill may be varied to suit circumstances. The following is a very cheap plan, and sufficient to dry one ton of roots at a time. Place four strong posts into the ground, twelve feet apart one way, and eighteen the other; the front two fourteen feet high, and the other eighteen; put girths across the bottom, middle and top, and nail boards perpendicularly on the outside, as for a common barn. The boards must be well seasoned, and all cracks or holes should be plastered or otherwise stopped up. Take a shed roof of common boards; in the inside put upright standards about five feet apart, with cross pieces to support the scaffolding; the first cross pieces to be four feet from the floor, the next two feet higher, and so on to the top. In these cross pieces lay small poles, about six feet long and two inches thick, four or five inches 460 X. apart. In these scaffolds the m adder is to be spread eight or nine inches thick. A floor is laid at the bottom, to keep all dry and clean. When the kill is filled, take six -or eight small kettles or hand furnaces, and place them four or five feet apart on the floor, (first securing it from fire with bricks or stones) and make fires in them with charcoal, being careful not to make any of the fires so large as to scotch the m adder over them. Person must be in constant attendance, to watch and replenished the fires but he should be cautioned not to remain long inside, as the gas fromicharcoaj fires is liable to cause suffocation. The foregoing is Mr. Swift S mode of drying. :he says, the heat from the small fires will ascend through the whole kill, and dry the mnaddercompletely in ten or twelve hours. When sufficiently dred, the roots will be so brittle as to break like pipe stems. It is probable that a good box stove, placed in the kill, with a pipe passing up through the middle, and, well supplied with hard wood fuel, would answer the purpose as well as the charcoal finances or kettles, while it would cause less risk from fire, and no i danger to life or health. Breaking and grinding immediately after kill drying, the- m adder must be, broken .by i threshing with flails, or passing through a bark mill or some other machine for the purpose, so as that it will feed in the stones of a common .grist mill. The breaking and grinding must be done immediately after the kill drying, (say the next day, after drying during the night) else the rows will gather dampness from the atmosphere sufficient to prevent grinding. -but if broken and .taken to the mill immediately after drying, and during fine weather, there will be no difficulty in grinding the m adder in, ny grist mill. When ground, it should be packed in barrels like flour; then it is ready for market additional remarks n a letter from Mr. Swift, received a few weeks since; he informs me that on a portion of his land the crop of m adder harris ted by him this fall, produced at the rate of 4,000 pounds per acre; but owing to injury done by the fresh et last spring, and by winter killing, the average per acre was not over 2,000 pounds. He does not intend to plant over three or four acres in any one year hereafter, owing to the difficulty in his neighborhood of procuring extra laborers at times when they are needed. Or; S, offers, to furnish roots for planting, to any person who may desire to, engage ,in the business :of cultivating, m adder; price     $81.50 per bushel, when twenty-five bushels or over are taken, with no extra charge for cases or, delivery at the port on Take.

Appendi X No. 12.,)N The Culture Of The Grape, And The Manufacture Of Of  Of. Of  Nci  Nnati , Dec. 3, 1847.'~ir.:-Agreeably to your request, I shall devote this evening in givingy6ua hasty description of the cultivation of the grape in this vicinity, andtlh4 manufacture of wine. It is some fifty years since the attempt was madeoatpring Will, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, I believe by a society of genlcid127emen, under the superintendence of a foreign wine cooper, Foreignugrapes were tried, and, as usual, without success. One grape only was found to suit the climate, and was the grape now known by the name oftiSchuylkill muscadell, or Heavy grape. It is a native grape of Pennsyljyanj, and was first found on the banks of the Schuylkill river. To give the vine made from this grape reputation, it was called the Gape. grape, and was said to have been obtained at the Gape of Good Hope. The unddcid127cid127iking proved a failure; and the next attempt was by the Swiss emigrants, at Heavy, I n diana, on the Ohio river, seventy-five miles below this city. They imported the best wine grapes of Switzerland, but found them unsuited to our climate, and hearing of the Gape grape at Spring Will, obtained plants, and for many years cultivated this grape extensively. It is a coarse grape, but an abundant bearer, and perfectly hardy, and less subject to <a name="rot43"><mark>rot</mark></a> than any other grape we cultivate. From it a rough, red, hard wine a vas made, in consequence of their pursuing the Swiss custom of fermenting in the skins.  But little wine was imported to the back woods in that day, and it met a ready sale. In a few years the importation of foreign wines increased, and our Luck eyes and Hoosiers became proud, and the wines of Heavy became un sale able, and were chiefly used for making ofsangaree, for the manufacture of which it was preferred to any other. The cultivation languished, and I have not, for many years, heard of any of the wine being for sale. About the time they began to decline the cultivation  commenced it, believing a good wine could be made from the same grape, by a different process of manufacture. I put a German vine dresser on a hill, on Old Face creek, about one mile and a half from the river, and four miles from the city. I planted, in the first instance, the Heavy grape only, gathered the grapes as soon as ripe, put them on the press as soon as gathered; and from them made a wine of the color of Madeira, and resembling Madeira of the second quality. I added from ten to sixteen ounces of sugar to the gallon of must, ana, after ferment at ion, brandy, as is customary with Madeira. I soon after obtained the Catawba grape, and some other native grapes, from Major Drum of Washington City. The Catawba was the only one of them I found worthy of cultivation; and of this grape I formed, and still entertain, a high opinion, as a wine grape. In a letter to me, Major Drum says: "I found this grape in the garden of, a German near Washington. Of its origin I know nothing. In introducing this grape to public notice, I have done my country a greater service than  should have done, had I paid the national debt." I entirely concur in this opinion. Most grapes do not impart their aroma to the wine, but anew one is formed by ferment at ion, which leads foreign wine merchants to x. a. 463 flavor their wines. The wine from the Catawba grape retains ;the aroma and muscadine flavor, in all its stages. Our Germans, in the first instance, objected to this peculiar flavor; but all now unite in giving the wine from this grape a preference over the German wines. Major Drum erred in making from this grape a sweet wine, by the addition of much sugar to theiAust. I saw his error, and for some, years put from six to ten ounces of sugar only to the gallon of must, and the wine was suited to our palate for at that period, we had not been accustomed to the celebrated dry Lock wines, and should have pronounced them hard cider. Our German emigrants, learned us better, and we now seldom add sugar to the must; but I would still recommend it, in seasons when the grape ri pens badly. When added, before ferment at ion, I do not believe it can be distinguished from thesaccharine principle in the grape. Brandy would be highly injurious to this wine, and I have' never had it run into the ace to us ferment at ion or become copy, which is often the case with the light wines of Europe t believe the Ctawba will make a superior Champagne wine. Custom hasn made us partial to the skin flavor, common to some imported wines which they obtain from the foetid goat sins, in which the wine is brought from th.e mountains ;and to the bile water taste and aroma, of the Spanishimantinvella. Custom will soon reconcile us to the riclcid127) and pleasant muscadine aroma of the tat alba wine. We shall soon be prepared to send specimens of our western wines to your eastern cities. But candor compel s me to say, that I shall dread the accurate palates of your eastern wine bibbiers.

The wine of some of my tenants I have for years considered of double the i value of the wine of other tenants, and was under the impression that the wine of some of them could not be surpassed. :but I was at the vine yard of my tenant, Mr. Schneike, in the Garden of Denis, recently, and it is about seven weeks since he made his first wine. He made but two barrels, one of which he sold, the other was retained for me. It was made from the Catawba grape, was as clear as amber, and superior to any I have seen. I showed a sample of it to" Mr. Seat man, who has a large vine yard on a high hill, fully exposed to the south, and under the charge! of an experienced vine dresser, and the last fall had a fiinvintage.

A few long shoots should be left, 'and fully exposed! to sun arid -air, by not having the shoots crowded together. Thelenoir greatly resembles the Herbemont, and is by many deemed the same grape. It is not, nor is it equal as a wine grape. The wood is of a light color, i ad of a blue tinge, -and a, more vigorous grower, and the leaves at the extremity of the shoots, of a green color. The bunches generally have the grapes more compact. The Herbemont has a dark red, wood, and the leaves at the extremity of a brown or red color: We need not seriously regret that foreign table grapes will not succeed in our climate, if we can, raise -the Herbemont, Ohio, Senior, Elsinborough, and Catawba .grapes. The For tons Virginia needling does not deserve the reputation i it has had, either as a wife or table grape. With c care and skill ,in the manufacture, the pure juice of the' -Catawbai grape yields c a dry wine, equal to the bestHockand of superior :aroma and. flavor.

Hughes' crab apple is scarcely superior to the wild crab for the table, yet it has no rival as a cider fruit. I would not be understood as saying, that a soil that retains moisture, is favorable to the cultivation of the grape. But from my experience, I should prefer a rich soil, from 12 to 18 inches deep, with; a clay sub soil, to a light soil, mixed with gravel, and gravel below it. I have wine from the Catawba grape, made without sugar or spirit, that is 19 years of age, and has improved greatly. At the New York I institute, it was said, that before shipping Sort wine from Pain, 33 per cent. of brandy was added to the wine. Sort wine is one of the strongest of wines, yet I have never seen one that had been strengthened by the addition of. half that quantity. Although I do not consider the grape one of our most certain crops. I believe it is as productive here as in Europe. They are there satisfied, if they can have an abundant crop of fine fruit, one season in four; The I institute speak of it, as the most certain of all crops. Of    cannot concur in all the other views expressed in their late publication. The Scuppernong grape I do not consider "valuable for the table or for wine, nor that it is a chance needling from a stranded ship on the sea shore in North Carolina." It a bounds in all directions on the waters of the Mississippi, and is there called the muscadine. The growth, :wood, size and appearance of the leaf, are so peculiar that it cannot be mistaken. There is a white and black variety. The white is the better fruit, and is not often met with. The bunches rarely contain more than from one to four ferries. The skin is thick and the pulp hard, but the juice sweet and aromatic. The vines. will not bear p runing, and cover a large extent of ground. In Northcarolina it continues to ripe n for several weeks, and as fast as ,they risen they are shaken from the vines as you would apples or pears. It isionlycalculated to make a sweet wine by the addition of much sugar. It will not stand i br winters. They stated two thousand gallons had been me from an acre. :or. Herbemont professed to have made at the rate of three thou- ;sand five hundred gallons to the acre from his Madeira grape. During the past twenty years, we have had many fine crops of grapes, and bu aches of the Catawba have, in' our vie yards, weighed twenty-four ounces yet I have never known ai sacre to yield over eight hundredth allons- and such a crop is like angels' visits, "few and far between." For have we found the grape of late years " a certain crop' We do not find "a light sandy soil the best" but a good i soil, with a sub soil of clay, and your vineyards are raised a last i elusively -from cuttings.

I wish to be distinctly understood. I do not say that the wines now to be found in our coffee houses or private cellars, will compare with the best imported wives. We have much yet to learn, and when we have acquired all the knowledge wanted, the result will be as it is in France and Germany. The great body of wines raised in those countries, are of inferior quality, and are sold as cheap as cider. Great care, neatness and skill will be necessary to produce the best wines, both in gathering the grapes, pressing out the juice, and still more in the ferment at ion and constant attention to it for years after, till' ready for sale. Some seasons, even a north exposure will produce the finest of fruit, and the quality of the fruit will, to a considerable extent, depend on the soil and its cultivation. In a cold or wet seasons, the grapes to the south will be the richest. In a hot and .moist one, they will be subject to injury. (cid127Lcid127) wine of the most careful and skilful, when their reputation is established, will command double the sum that the wine will at an adjoining vine yard, even in a season when it is of equal quality- There is much in a name. The opinion was expressed at the American I institute, that our native grapes are yearly improving by cultivation. That "the I s abel la has greatly improved in past years, and will continue to improve for the next fifty years." There is a great improvement in a native grape brought from the woods, the first year of its bearing, when turned, and fully exposed to the sun and air. We have cultivated the I s abel la and Catawba grapes for along period, but I have seen no change in the quality of the fruit from cultivation. As our woods are cleared up, our climate undergoes a change, which improves certain fruits, whilst it injures others. And the change in our soil from cultivation, also operates on our fruits. The finest of all pe lathe yellow Berne, begins to fail with us. Our p each crop is a very uncertain one, to what it was thirty years since. Dr. Under hill is correct in saying, that " Mr. Drum failed to make good wine." One cause for this failure, I have stated; the addition of too much sugar. Cry Lock wine was not then, and is not now much drank at Washington. I applied there for Lock bottles, and was told Lock wine was not common. Champaignebottles were plenty. Another cause of Major Drums failure, was his poverty. I was at his vine yard one season when his vine yard failed, and he was supplying the deficiency from the wild grapes from the surrounding woods. Or, Under hill states, that the " bleeding of the vine is injurious in France, but not in Germany or the United States." This is certainly an error. All our German vine dressers endeavor to avoid it. It is evidently injurious to all vines, but less so in the United States, than in most parts of Europe, as our vines grow more vigorous, and overcome it. He speaks of the " Yorkmadeira, as a small grape, and fine for the table and for wine." The grape    saw at Little York as their Madeira, I thought inferior as a table grape, and their wine was certainly of inferior quality. I had not the a much knowledge of grapes, but I suppose it to be, what Mr. Owning represents467Ex . it, the Alexander or Schuylkill Muscadell. Will advised of the contrary, I supposed the grape in South Carolina contained more sugar than in this latitude. Both Herbemont and Call used more than double the quantity of sugar we used here, yet they often had their wines run into aetousfermentation. I am certain such was the case with the wine of Mr. Herbemont. Messrs. Herbemnont, Call and Guignard, all cultivated the grape for wine, and were men of intelligence and experience. It is probable the latter gentleman is still engaged in the cultivation. In a letter from Mr. Guignard, of Columbia, South Carolina, written in September, 1846, he says, 'I have succeeded, far above my expectations, in Virginia, the grape having made, in 1844, 2,000 gallons; in 1846, 2,200,and last month, 3,200 gallons, from about five acres. I have not, however, succeeded in making wine. I usually make 1 or 200 gallons of good wine, which I must consider by accident, for the far greater portion becomes acid in the course of the spring, after vantage; and which I have not been able to counteract. I followed Mr. Herbemonts plan, of adding sugar, at the rate of a half pound to one pound per gallon, and purpose adding brandy, when  rack my new wine, which I generally do at the commencement of winter take it for granted, his sugar is added to the must. I f, after ferment at ion, a renewal of it the next spring, would follow as a matter of course. /I incline to the opinion, that the sac charing principle in the grape, at the south, is as great, if not greater, than with us; and that the leave n is in proportion. Their summers are shorter than ours, and they have not the advantage of our cool cellars. If he were to ,add more sugar than the leave n can convert into alcohol, the wine would not run into the ace to us ferment at ion, but the result would be a rich sweet wine. Does not this result, in Carolina, account for the quantity of alcohol that is found in the wines of Madeira? I s not the brandy added to prevent a renewal of the ferment at ion? They have a method, as I was informed by the late Mr. Hayne, a wine merchant of Madeira, of adding, both strength and richness to their wines, at the same time. To the must of the Malmsey grape; they add, as it comes from the press, 33 per cent. of brandy. This checks all ferment at ion, and it is added to their wines. Age is given to their wines, in Madeira, by keeping them for some months in a cellar artificially heated. We hear much of the Southhill Madeira; and the wine from the south side of the island is not, by law, allowed to enter their harbors. I sent to Mr. Hayne for a person who had been bred to the grape culture and manufacture of wine in Madeira: he is now in our city. He tells me that his father lived on the sea shore, five miles from i the seaport, Lunch al, and that he has t oiled many a dark night, i iii loading wine from the north side of the island, and conveying it t the cellar of his father, who was the proprietor of a vine yard. The wine lay in his fathers cellar till the bring, when it was, with their own wine, carried to a merchant in Lunch al. I x now that Whiskey was taken to Madeira, by a 'wine merchant, as cheaper than brandy, believing he could take from it its peculiar flavor and use it in giving strength to their wines. I would strongly urge the grape cult wrists, at the south, to add brandy to their wine after "fomentation, to prevent its renewal in the spring; but not rectified whiskey. Brandy made from the same grape would have the same flavor and generally be preferable to 'french brandy. I would :also recommend them to give it 'both strength and richness, by adding one third brandy to must, as is done in Madeira, and mix it with their f wine. This accounts or some of the wines of' Madeira being ess dry than others. They also468Ex. add to it a portion of sweet Malmsey, to produce the same effect. Mr. Hayne sent me some samples of sweet Malmsey from' Madeira, which I thought a less pleasant wine than our I s abel la, where one and a half or one and three-fourth lbs. of good loaf sugar was added to a gallon of the must. The Missouri' grape, I obtained from the elder prince, twenty-five years since, and it was represented to be a native grape. I to origin is unknown. The Herbemont, Madeira and Senior, were both supposed by Messrs. Mccalland Herbemont, to be natives of South Carolina, from the great resemblance in the wood to their native vines. But they yielded up this opinion, from assurances that the same grapes had been recently imported from France. I still incline to the opinion, that they are native grapes; from their' hardy character. If foreign: grapes, it would be singular, that among our great variety of foreign vines imported we should not have found one equally hardy and productive. The Land grape is of good quality for the table, but did not with me make a good wine. It ri pens- late and does not succeed in this latitude. It is, by many, said to be a native; I doubt it. Men. Harrison assured me that it was imported into Virginia at a very early day by a Frenchman of the name of Mazzei. The quantity of must from the grape, is I believe as large with us, as it is in Madeira or in Europe. With them four gallons is the usual yield fromiabushel of good grapes. The yield with us is the same from the Catawba. I a the fall of 1845, our grapes were unusually fine and some of my tenants assured me they had five gallons from a bushel and where half of the grapes were separated from the stems six bushels. In these cases, it is prudent to make some allowance for lee way. In many parts of Europe they cut off the tops of the new wood, intended to bear the fruit the following season, during the summer; the better to ripe n the wood. With us it is a dangerous practice, as it is calculated to force out the fruit buds of the next season, The lateral branches are broken off in Europe soon after they make their appearance for the same object. We should not do it till the eyes are sufficiently ripened, not to he forced out, and never break' off above the point we shall prone them to. In Europe, the leaves are often thinned out, to let in the sun and aid in ripe king the fruit. This we never do in our vineyards, with our hot sun we usually have no shade to spare, and to cut off leaves and branches often stops the flow of the sap, and stops the ripe king of, the fruit. I have no confidence in the doctrine of the acclamation of plants and that foreign vines will after a few years of culture succeed in our climate. I have, too, plants of the white sweet water in my garden and have had this variety in cultivation for 30 years. I could when I first procured it occasionally get a partial crop, for the last 15 years it has scarcely ripened a single cluster. I would recommend to landlords to rent from 15 to 20 acres to German emigrants on shares, requiring them to plant two thirds of it in vine yard and orchard; the proceeds of both to be equally divided and the remaining one third for the tenant to raise articles for the use of his family and in this third the landlord to have no interest, the landlord to furnish the ,dwelling house, wine press, fruit trees and grape cuttings at his own expense; and I would recommend to German emigrants to buy our steep river hills, for: the same object, where too steep for other cultivation and of little value. An ;industrious German family, will from their own labor and at: idle seasons of the year, expend labor on them to twenty times the cost of the land, add make it more profitable than our richest bottoms. Dear our city, within the last 5 years, I have seen steep hills apparently a bed of. stone and 469 470 X. not worth one dollar for cultivation, trenched 3 feet deep. The stone as far as necessary used for walls in benching the ground and the extra ones sold, and the whole converted into a beautiful vine yard, and the whole labor done at a season of the year when if not done, the family would have been idle, and to have had it done by the day at usual wages, would have cost      $500 per acre. We must find a new name for Sick run a small stream near the city. -the beautiful hills on both sides of, it are yearly converted into vineyards and will in two or three years more afford a beautiful prospect, that the Rhine cannot equal. For the banks of the Rhine cannot boast of a soil of equal fertility. The cultivation of the grape for wine will be profitable where persons do their own work. It is seldom that any farming pays well where there is much hiring of hands. Our German emigrants can cultivate the grape to most profit, for the greater part of the work in the vine yard is performed by their wives and daughters, without interfering with household affairs. Greater profit would accrue to a man of observation and skill, who would devote much time to the subject, be certain to have clean cases, gather his grapes at the proper moment, use great care in picking, selecting and pressing and a clean press, a cool cellar, care and skill in the ferment at ion, racking at the proper time, and always keeping the cases full, never to bottle it till 4 or 5 years of age, and never to sell any wine with his name, in seasons when the wine is not of the best quality. Such a manufacturer may sell his wine from                               $12 to. 18 per dozen, when his less skilful and careful neighbor may find his wine a dull sale at 75 cents per gallon, with the same exposure and a soil equally favorable for the grape. I have never given the subject the personal attention necessary to the most perfect success. I am now too old to undertake it, and beneficial as the experiment might be, it would form no grounds should I apply to Providence to extend my life for 20 years more, for having it granted. I must leave it in younger hands. It would be a valuable business could a skilful wine merchant be found, who would buy the wines at the press, have them brought immediately to the city to his wine cellar, which should be cool, and there personally attend to the ferment at ion, racking, &c, till ready to bottle for sale. It would require capital and time before the business would be available. The profit would be certain. The day is not distant, when this and neighboring portions of the Ohio river will rival the Rhine in the quantity and quality of iswineYours respectfully, N. Longworthprofi Of Of A Scuppernong 'of   Neyard. Years since, or when about to commence my vine yard business, I visited a Captain Curling ham, living in an adjoining county, and who about a dozen years previous, had removed from the lower part of the state (where the Scuppernong vine is indigenous) and had brought some vines along with him. He pointed me to his beautiful vine yard of twelve vines only, covering with ca no y about a fourth of an acre, and assured me, (he was a gentleman above suspicion of other than strict vera city) that from that canopy he had made, the past season r 500 gallons of wine, besides himself and neighbors par taking abundantly of the grapes for about two months. I know of two Scuppernong vines in the lower part of this state (NorthEx. a. 471 Carolina) that each produce five barrels of wine yearly. This may appear incredible to some persons, but it is nevertheless true. And I might relate like instances in my vineyards. Mr. Herbeniont, late of Columbia, Southcarolina, related (see American Farmer) an instance of his Madeira grape producing at rates of more than 2000 gallons per acre. Some persons cannot credit the amazing productive ness of improved husbandry as to grain crops. When I once informed a neighbor that twenty barrels, or one hundred bushels and upwards of corn had been made per acre, ha declared it to be impossible for so much to stand upon an acre at once.  To that                               $1500 clear can be made from Scuppernong vines annually per acre, may appear utterly incredible to some persons, but it may appear still more astonishing if I assert, that it is possible to make four times that sum according to my calculation. For last winter I sold at Raleigh, to best judges of wines the Scuppernong, from one , li our collars per gallon, according toquMity. 'or instance: my Scuppernong Madeira, a white wine made with, double refined sugar, at          $3.00 per gallon; and my Scuppernonghfock, a red wine at       $4.00 per gallon. Now, 2000 gallons at       $4.00 pergalori is     $8000; and say            $2000 for incidental expenses, or all the cost of making, and we have        $6000 left as clear gain. For cost of making,             $2000 is pretty high; but for Scuppernong Lock, I put in the juice three pounds of dub le refined sugar per gallon, and take, extra pains to make it. Now the sugar at fifty cents per gallon is                                  $1000. And I think another                                  $1000 will cover the cost of other incidental expenses of making. True, the above enormous profits of        $6000 per acre annually is theory as to a. large scale, or even as large as one acre, as far as I know, but equally true that the they i sjrediated t faits as to a small sale. And here again the purport of the maxim; as: what j S been done on a small scale in agriculture, ma be doc on a large o .a. 'a.

The following article from the pen of J. Barre t, M. 'D.' of Middle town, It, deserves the attention of our horticulturists. It is well known, that the: goose merry seldom: prod u ces fine and healthy fruit in the western country. His plan is easily tested; In the Cultivation of the Gooseberry to secure Zitfromthe cab, ;a. That useful and valuable; fruit, the' goose merry, which is now considered so important in Euiiope, is with difficulty raised  here, the merry so soon becomes scab bed- or covered with a dirty <a name="fungus25"><mark>fungus</mark></a>. This takes place to in, gardens where every care has been bestowed on them. This excess of attend i in i keeping them n free of weeds and grass, and exposing them to the hot weather of August and September, proves highly injurious and contrary to their nature. I am fully convinced, after much observation that the m node of culture with goose ferries: ii I gland will not apply to this region. I have had ample opportunities of witnessing yhliat has been accomplished in England, and what his bee i attempted here, and now see the cause of failure    n the notes I have kept on the progress of vegetation, and th lie wiping of fruits for, 1837, which .was a remarkable wet season, there is the following entry: " July' 12.-'The goosebepries, this year .are better .th man I .ave seen them for several years past. (cid127cid127The shrubs as well as the fruit are less coated with a <a name="fungus26"><mark>fungus</mark></a> which spoils the ferries." It appears, therefore, that a wet season is peculiarly suited to the goose merry. That the season of 1837, was remarkable for its wet ness, will appear from the following table kept at Albany, N. Y. [see Report of Regents for 1838.]1837, Rauiapril, .1 inch 63 hundredths. May, .a. .7 do. 34 do. June, .5 do. 0 6 do July, .a. .a. 4 do. 38 do. It is satisfactory to find that a wet season which is injurious to many fruits, causing them to <a name="decay12"><mark>decay</mark></a> rapidly, is congenial to the goose merry. The season of 1846, as to amount of rain has resembled that of 1837, and has suited this fruit. With this knowledge we may hope to commence a newer a in the cultivation of the goose merry, which may be highly useful in some sections. I would here briefly state, that the secret and success in cultivating thegooseberry in this place, free of scab and securing a full crop, is to grow them in grassy places, or grass borders sufficiently wide, and allow the grass to grow rather luxuriantly among them, until they have attained their growth and are thereby secured from the forming scab. When the ferries begin to ripe n, the grass should be cut, being no longer required. I saw many years ago, in Vermont, some excellent gooseberriesgrowing in wet shady places, and among grass and plants. I also most un. X. 
473expectedly found a stray goose merry bush growing among tall rye, and bearing a full crop of excellent fruit. I give these instances to show that thegooseberry is fond of shade and moisture in this climate, and that to grow them with success in the garden, abundant dew and moisture must be provided, and this the grass fully supplies. There are. two gardens within the limits of thisYcty, which have produced goose ferries from year to year, entirely free of scab, the ii ll others we may say generally had their fruit ruined. Thee I ascertained were grown rather by negligence than e sign, at first among the grass. One of the gardens belonged toi the Rev. Dr. War vis, the other t dr. John Bliss. The latter assures me, he has not failed during about twenty years in having his goose ferries free from these ab. I purposely watched these gardens attentively as well as several otherscid127to give a, faith fig report of this novel mode of culture, which promises so much. I found them nearly ripe July 4. The ferries were of the red kind of medium size. The bushes required the aid of props to secure them from breaking under their load of fruit. As the the quantity I was highly gratified to observe that they bore as largely as the best examples that I had seen ii England. The goose ferries in the garden of the Rev. Dr. War vis, grew on a long strip of grass, about four feet wide. hey ar not, I apprehend, the largest and choicest fruit and at first, did not keep pace -with- some of the latter imported kinds. The grass instead of being cut, was suffered to grow a among the bushes Icid127was struck with the luxuriant manner they grew from the wet and dew thus afforded. While the grape and cherry were rapidly decaying; the ferries of the goose merry were :entirely free of <a name="decay13"><mark>decay</mark></a>, being clear and bright skinned. Those in dry grounds were much diseased and the bushes had become a nuisance. I have already averted to the peculiarity of the blossoms of the current, resisting heavy rains. The goose merry blossoms are similarly constituted, and entirely different from the flowers of the grape, the apple, the p each, and the plum. I have thought that grass may be further serviceable, to thegooseberry, by abstracting from the soil those substances which foster the growth of minute hung i. This, however, is offered rather as a matter of conjecture, than from actual proof, and requires further investigation to determine. I do not expect that the plan recommended, will be perfectly successful the first year after the removal of the goose merry shrubs among grass or when nodded, though I do in the second season. The forming buds are injured, and the bark diseased by exposure to hot weather during the months of August and September, when they are not protected by grass and sufficiently supplied by dew and moisture. The goose merry is a dew loving plant, and must be supplied with moisture, otherwise it cannot flourish here as in Europe. The wild American strawberry furnishes another striking example of a merry growing among grass. This seems its favorite place, or habitat as the botanists would say. They grow in grassy meadows in argillaceoussoils, (which are best adapted to hold moisture) much better and sweeter, than when suffocated among their own dense leaves in the garden. I remember to have seen a garden in England devoted to the cultivation of the strawberry, where the leaves and vines became too luxuriant, and they yielded but little fruit. As an experiment, one bed was under laid with a reddish clay, fit for brick making, and nests or a mixture of soil was prepared474Ex. for the strawberry plants. The difference was most striking; it seemed as if this bed was all fruit, and the others only leaves. I have observed some similar examples of this preference to clay in meadows, in new cleared lands in this country, where the wood ashes and carbon of the burnt brush had given the highest perfection to the fruit, without the luxuriant e of foliage which causes so much trouble. When left to nature, they travel or plant themselves, by means of the running vines they put forth. In my botany cal excursions in England, I do not recollect finding the strawberry growing i grassy places as in North America. I have turned to Gerards famous Verbal, printed in 1597, for his experience in this matter. He says "strawberries do grow upon hills and val lies, likewise in woods and other such places that bee something shadow rep. 485. The same author also describes and gives a figure of the goose merry, p 1 143, and mentions one whose fruit" is almost as bigger as a small cher rise, and v erie round e in forme: also another of the like lignes of an inch in length. We have also in our London gardens ah other sort altogether without prices whose fruit is very small, of a perfect red colour his early notice shows the little progress then invade in the cultivation of a fruit that is now the pride of the Lancashire weavers and not less esteemed in all the large cities of Great Britain. The English markets are now largely supplied with the goose merry. They have grown this merry weighing 31 penny weights and 16 grains! which is a little more than one ounce and three quarters avoirdupois. Twenty-five penny weight is regarded as a good weight for a goose merry. X. a. 475APPEN Of X No. 14. Breedi Of Of Cattle. In the feeding of horned cattle, and the conditions of the most profitable use of the fodder substances By T. V. Manner, of Krumpendorf, in Cafinthiatranslated from the German by E. Good rich Smith of the Patent Office. For a long time past rational land husbandry has been occupied with the promotion of the nutrition power of the different species of fodder, and more recently, relinquishing empiricism, it has been endeavored, by the progress and aid of the sciences related to it, to establish it on a more truly scientific principle, and to extend it, and in this way many advances and improvements have been made. The convention of the German farmers and foresters have deemed the object worthy of particular attention, as the programme of the former convention shows. Request relative to this subject has reached me from the officers of the 8th convention at Munich, through Prof. Dr. Hlubek, that I would communicate my experiments, which I could not, at that time, comply with, because I wished to publish them in an appropriate work, according to the request of the agricultural society of my own country. In the mean time, I have prepared, in advance, for the honorable convention, this essay on the subject in question, in order, in this way, to contribute my mine, trifling as it may prove, to their efforts for the public welfare. As I have pursued the fattening of oxen at large on my estate at Krumpendorf, near Klagenfurt, since the year 1822, I have compared the animals on placing them in stalls, in selling, and while fattening, have weighed the mat least every month, compared the increase with the quality of fodder used, and noticed the results in these cases, so that I am in possession of many particular experiences, and in a situation to draw extensive and certain averages. These observations were undertaken merely for the purpose of serving for my own instruction, and probably but for the particular request of the agricultural society of Carinthia would have never been made public through the press, although I made statements concerning the separate divisions of the subject in the meeting of the society just mentioned, iii th, years 1827, 1833, 1836, 1837, 1841. Thus much for the understanding of my purpose at this time. In a large fattening establishment, different fodder substances have been fed out; the object of such an establishment being to derive the ,highest possible value from the products employed, regard must there fort be paid* At the general meeting of the tenth convention of German farmers and foresters, on the 19th of September, it was resolved that this essay be separately printed and dis i buted to all the members, and also to the various agricultural societies of Germany. This is a decisive proof of the importance and interest taken in this communication by that large and scientificallyeand practically educated body of men 476 X. even if they are there produced as well to the existing price of the same, as to their effect in the increase of the animals. This renders calculations necessary, both before and after the fattening; before it, in order to select the fodder substances, by which the object proposed may be obtained, in the quickest, cheapest, and most eligible manner; after it, in order to manage the result of the supposed production. The principle of such a continued calculation, is constituted usually of the analyses, and comparative experiments in relation to fodder, which we already possess, in great numbers, for many, and indeed almost every fodder substance. The decided variations which are to be met with in respect to the nutritiouspower of many substances used for fodder, makes the preliminary choice of figures to be annexed, difficult; in a few cases, when many nutrition substances are fed out together, and copiously, the previous calculation gives the result to be expected from the same; but frequent and most remarkable differences show themselves: in the effect of the fodder, when the nutritivesubstances, wholly alike, and even contradictory ones, present, at one time taken with another, more or less variable increase of production: As the oxen designed for fattening were weighed: by me from the placing them in the stalls, even -to the time of slaughtering, every half, or at least every month their weight and increase separately marked down, the fodder consumed by them either weighed or measured by cubic, measure, and consequently no error can exert any influence on the account; the original cause of the difference of increase can be sought for only in a difference of the assimilation of the fodder employed. This determined me .to enter upon along course of experiments, and to compare the gross averages of the careful observations of many years before me, the result of which will here be given, not in detail, arid step by step, but only in a summary extract limited to the present products. Very animal, as well in a state of rest as of motion and labor- demands daily a certain portion of nourishment to live, i. e. for the reproduction of that which is lost by the process of consumption carried on by the operations of animal life, and the excess contained in the food, over and above this want, can be allowed to the animal in substance only where the nutriment contains this excess in an assimilated form. To supply that which animals daily lose from waste by the continual formation of their solid and fluid elements, and by the process of respiration and exhaustion, besides the- necessary oxygen and hydrogen which air and water partially give, a certain quantity of mineral substances, and such as contain nitrogen and carbon, is needed the last of which, as the substitute for sustaining life, must be derived by the animal according to the degree of the ordinarily existing necessity, or as increased by labor, growing, or milk production from the nutriment. As respects this fodder: To far as no other advantage is gained than thermaiintenance of the animal in the same state of its flesh and tallow, it is called; conservation: or sustaining fodder. The determining of this sustaining fodder, in animals that are not worked, nor milked, and not growing, appeared to me to be first of all necessary, as the foundation of further decisions. In the year 1832 I began to determine this, and presented the results at the general conventions of the Carinthian Agricultural Society atKlagenfurt, in the years 1833 and 1835. They are the result of continued experiments, which had been already accurately supervised in former years. According to this, the daily sustaining fodder amounts to one pound and ax. 
 477 half of hay value for a hundred of that live weight, which the animal had before his improvement in his state of feeding, at which he receives daily two and a half to three pounds of hay for a hundred of the live weight or it amounts to one and two third pounds of hay for the hundred of that live weight to which the animal is reduced after many days, by the mere allowance of conservation fodder. Labor, milking, calf bearing, bodily increase by growth or fattening, demand, besides this sustaining fodder, still more food corresponding to the existing necessity. If there is not enough to meet this necessity, if the animal which is not worked receives less than the conservation fodder, that which is worked less than his waste amounts to, the cow just giving milk, or with calf, and the growing young cattle less than their physical necessity demands, they become reduced, even to that live weight to which the fodder received corresponds: but at the same time also their economical use always suffers by it; the laboring ox will be incapable of severe exertion; the :cow will give less milk, or bring forth a lean calf, and the poor young cattle thrive less. In contrast to this appearance, arising from insufficient nutriment, cattle will gain more according to the degree in which the food exceeds the mere sustenance of life, and the supply of the further economical demands imposed on the animal; but in favorable progressive improvement, this. will be the case only up to a certain maximum point, after which the increase ,of food given out will be a gain of less value on account of the diminished production obtained. While, for example, 14 pounds hay value, i. e. about nineteen pounds of hay for oxen of ten hundred weight live weight, or of four hundred to four hundred and sixty pounds flesh weight, according to the measure of a scale before me, is daily given to the hundred of live weight of a fattening ox, it yields only three pounds increase of live weight for the one hundred weight of hay fed out, because the greatest portion of the fodder must be used for sustaining life, and therefore, as conservation fodder, it can furnish no increased production. But according to the scale of further average calculations, if the daily quantity of fodder be increased to three pounds of hay for one hundred weight of the live weight of the fattening ox, which, for ?ne ox, ten hundred weight live weight, makes thirty pounds daily hay value, then the hundred of hay fed out, will give five pounds and over of increase in live weight. In the other hand, should the daily fodder be raised to over-four pounds hay value for the hundred weight of live weight, which in a loose fodder and in combination agreeable to the animal can be done, so that the ox above supposed, of ten hundred: weight live weight, consumes daily forty-three to forty-seven pounds i hay value, t lie living average increase also, during a whole period of fattening, according to the scale of the increasing of fodder, would be lessened considerably below five pounds, and even reduced to four pounds. This is of importance in a fattening establishment, because the increase of live weight, as I shall show in future results, is only a trifle less in growing animals than the increase in flesh and tallow, and every fifth hundred weight of hay is scarcely of any value. I have spoken purposely of the average results of the whole fattening time, or at least, of a long period; for in weighings repeated shortly one after another, the balances often fluctuated, for the reason that the animals, especially in the change of fodder, often eat more, and often less though, as is always necessary, the weighing of the animal should take place at the same time of day. Besides, it must be observed, that the animals, at478Ex. the beginning of fattening, give a greater gain of production of live weight and in flesh for a hundred weight of hay foddered out, than they give with the same fodder a short time before its completion, when, according to the rule, they eat less eagerly, and can only be induced, by more relishing food, to take large quantities. It is moreover self evident, that an ox which has become much heavier by fattening, and which increase in a lesser animal may amount to about one third of his former, or one-fourth of his present live weight attained by fattening, must have the fodder apportioned to him according to the per cent age of his live weight increased in proportion to the scale of his gross weight, as it continually increases by his being fattened. To illustrate the causes of these appearances, I will add some results very animal has a normally proportioned state of corpulence and rotund it, which, according to the scale of his natural capacity for animal improvement, is based on the highest exercise of physical power, permanent e and soundness, answering to that organization of his, which corresponds to his destination, according to his nature, and one while in which the animal is equally removed alike from lean ness and a state of fattening. If in the otherwise perfect state of health he be below this degree, then there is an earnest effort carried on in hit organism to supply the defect, to reach to his natural covering of flesh; the animal functions related to it are heightened, the appetite and the power of assimilation are increased. The more the healthy animal is found to be removed from this state of welfare, in accordance with nature, so much the greater also is the effort of nature to replace what is wanting. Whoever keeps his animals below this degree, whether they are breeding, much line, or young cattle, he by bad or insufficient fodder, prevents the improvement suitable to them, and stands in the way of his own profit, because, instead of giving a value to his fodder, by increase, he throws it away by the mere allowance of food for sustaining life, and which will not be repaid except as only corresponds to the reduced circumstances of the animal. He, who by luxurious, nutritions, or frequent fodder, raises his animals above the normal state, who fattens them will make his animals more clumsy, fat, and less enduring in toil. In this case, by reason of repletion, the beneficial effort of nature for further improvement will be diminished, and the appetite, always in accordance with the necessities, will become less. I n this state of repletion, the animal can only be excited by dainty food to do any thing further, and increase yet more his corpulence. The wise providence of nature, for storing up in the bodies of animals some excess for the time of need, but for refusing any ~i per abundance injurious to health, is the reason of this appearance. According, therefore, as the supply by fodder, compared with the animal waste, presents an excess or diminution, the animal will increase or decrease. Very animal has, therefore, an individual capacity for increase which depends on his power of digestion, and the measure and quality of the substances to be consumed for food. Very fodder substance possesses, in proportion to the nutrition power and digest ability of its composition, a less or greater capacity to cause the increase, milk production, &c. of animals. Well digesting animals, fodder ed with very nutritions and easily assimilated substances, in a state of rest, therefore, give the greatest and most rapid results of production, and best repay their fodder, because, together with their support of life, they, in the shortest time, consume the most productive fodder, in which, however, red x. a. 479 hard must always be had to the maximum, in the. advance beyond which, the fodder often furnish ed to- liberally, again begins to give a less increase The reason why fodder, when it exceeds the nutrition power, daily, of four pounds of hay value for a cut. of a fattening animal, and especially so in the more advanced stage of fattening, gives a less productive result perch t. of hay, than when two and a half to three pounds hay va j he is used per cut. live weight, certainly consists in this, that; while a very liberal supply of nutriment is furnished in larger volume, the organs of digestion cannot assimilate so ;much of it, as is the case when the volume is, smaller. This is true, especially if: the animals thereby nourished, are always in a fattened state, when the necessity of very rich nutriment is so much less as by over nutrition it has exceeded the corpulence proportioned to the well conditioned state demanded by nature, and its organism has been compelled to lay aside a part of the superfluous nutriment secreted in the form of fat, while it has expelled another portion un absorbed as excrement she fact that the dan g of the fattening animal affords a much .stronger manure than of (cid127animals as usually fed, is a proof of this. The period of fattening may be shortened by nutriment raised above the rule; but the value of fodder products is not always in equally favorable proportions to this ascent in the scale of nutritiousness. In the contrary, the greater the animal waste and the weaker the power of digestion are with fodder innutritious and difficult to be digested, the more rapid is the <a name="loss69"><mark>loss</mark></a>. ' He who weighs his own cattle, sees what a rapid and striking diminution, sickness, hard labor, or new milking, the cow may undergo with bad fodder, while in the same time also, in endurance in labor and the production of milk she suffers proportion ably. Young cattle fodder ed suitably nearly always give a proper value to their fodder. To dilate here, as to the mode of foddering suitable to young cattle, would take up too much time. I must, therefore, content myself with giving the results Young cattle, in a good state of health and proportional foddering, reckoned on the cut. of their live weight, may consume more than grownup animals, and their food yields a greater productive result in live weight, for 'the cut. of hay value consumed in the first of their growth, than the same fodder yields in full grown animals. They give for the cut. of hay value consumed the first year of their age far larger increase in live weight, than the same in the first six months of the second year; and in the first six months of the second year, they again yield more production of live weight than in the second six months of the second year, as these rates of mine show. A three year old (ein Her z) moderately well built cow which I had, by particularly excellent fodder, weighed in one year 635 pounds, two years 10 15 pounds, two years nine months 1 225 pounds live weight. The gained together with her calf, new born, 1 160 pounds gross weight. This product for a month of the first year, amounted to 48 pounds, of the second year 311 pounds, and of the third year only 23 pounds gross. A calf which I raised, when slaughtered at two years and seven months old, after she had born a calf and been milked several months, yielded 490 pounds pure flesh. To adduct dates and examples, how far the consumption and the production based on it, of particular animals, may differ from each other with like fodder, as well as many other details which would be requisite for the perfect understanding of what has been said on this subject, would be tooprolix for the space and time of the present essay. Therefore, I have con 480 X. deluded, before the appearance of my work on this subject, to give to the public, in the Communications of the Carinthian Agricultural Society_ a swell as in the Economical Novel ties of Confessor Hhibek, a course of observations under my name, which, collectively, will treat, in an extended form and basis, of subjects only slightly touched upon in this essay. In order to exhibit the better, and in a more comparative form, the difference of the results of foddering by a greater or smaller quantity of fodder, I will illustrate this subject by examples in ox, when he is entirely lean, and therefore has no tallow, as will be, shown hereafter, weighs 260 pounds live weight, to 100 weight of pure flesh in the four quarters. With five per cent. of tallow i, he weighs only 255 pound live weight, for the 100 weight of flesh. At ten per cent. proportion of tallow, 245 pounds. At fifteen per cent. 235 pounds. At twenty percent. only 225 pounds gross weight, for 100 weight of flesh. ;in ox of 1000 pounds live weight, weighed in a state in which he has not been fed for fattening, has when entirely lean, therefore without tallow 385 pounds flesh and about 9 pounds of skin arid hair, in which in the after increase, the tallow' consequently to be weighed by itself, is included. His ox raised to five per cent. proportion of tallow, will weigh 10 50 pounds gross 421 poundsoftesh, arid 21 pounds tallow. :he gained, therefore, in this period of increase, 50 pounds gross, 27 pounds flesh and 12 pounds of tallowAtten per cent. proportion of tallow in the advanced state of fattening, he weighed 1 125 pounds gross, 47 pounds of flesh, and 25 pounds of tallow. It fifteen per cent. proportion of tallow, the same ox had 1 219 pounds gross weight, 519 pounds flesh, 78 pounds tallow, and therefore gained an increase of 94 pounds live weight, 60 pounds flesh, r and 37 pounds of tallow, At twenty per cent. proportion of tallow, the same ox weighed 1 350 pounds live weight, 600 pounds flesh, 120 pounds tallow; the increase of this period of fattening, therefore, amounted to 131 pounds gross weight, 81 pounds of flesh, 42 pounds of tallow. In the whole fattening, this ox gained 350;pounds gross, 315 pounds flesh, 111 pounds tallow. At this collective increase he was kept on a daily 'foddering of 3 pounds of hay value to the 100 pounds live weight, up to five per cent. tallow, 35 days, and had 7 87 pounds hay value; from five up to ten per cent. proportion of tallow, forty days, with 1 350 pounds of hay; from ten to fifteen per cent, tallow, fifty days, and used 1850 pounds of hay; and from fifteen to twenty per cent. of tallow sixty-five days, and used 2 633 pounds of hay all together 180 days and 66 cut. of hay value, for the whole fattening time. It is self evident, that when the ox is taken with the tallow he already had, for example ten per cent. proportion of tallow, the fattening up to twenty per cent. reckoning by time, only lasted, 115 days, and also -would only require 446 3 pounds hay value. The same entirely lean ox of 1000 pounds live weight, which as shown at the foddering of 3 pounds hay value daily, to 100 weight of his live weight, will be fat in 180 days; with 66 cut. of hay value, would demand in 160 days continued on, above 80 cut. of hay value for fattening, if he received, as fodder, only 4 i- pounds hay value for 100 pounds live weight. Part I I .in the Value of Fodder Substances. In this second part, I propose to speak somewhat respecting the value otfodderstuffs in reference to their nutritiousness. The" substances used for x. 
 481 the food of horned cattle, belong collectively to the vegetable kingdom. He see plants formed u out f the earth, water -nd air, trough the influence- of the power of life, by r means of their processes of absorption, digestion, and respiration, and bringing forth the most manifold forms, and the most varied products, in a manner hitherto un search able, of which we, indeed, apprehend the outward appearances, perceptible to our senses and understand how to arrange them by rule and system, but the inner being of which can .never be cleared up to the mind of l an; as it requires the exercise of power lying beyond his faculty of conception. Notwithstanding their diversity of form and product, all plants possess three elements, viz: carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. (cid127Maniy of them, and indeed, the usual fodder stuffs of our cattle, contain more or less nitrogen, together with other mineral and earthy constituents, which must be taken, more or less into consideration, in the food of animals. These first principles, are the forming elements of which the proximal e constituents of the vegetable organic being are composed. To these proximal e constituents t belong, among others, the so called nutritions substances of plants, in which we include in a more limited se rise, the glum ten of the cereals, or that of the god fruits; the feu la, the vegetable albumen, the fatty oil, sugar, marina, vegetable gum and slime, and partially also, the vegetable farinaceous fibres that are capable of being assimilated; but in a wider sense, we embrace all those substances contained in plants, which are required, or are suitable in he process of digestion, to the formation of the animal elements, as for example, lime, phosphorus acid, &c among the proxiinate constituent of plants, those which contain a note, or nitrogen hold the first rank, in reference to the food of animals. When follow' those containing carbon, and finally. the mineral, though ll three classes, together with water: nd oxygen are to be regarded as absblutelynecessry condition is for the 'formation of the animal constituent to. Everyone of the usual fodder substances for horned cattle, contain all these three classes, only in very different proportions. The vitality or activity of plants, arid therefore also of the fodder plants, normally seizes only on those substance that are adapted to the character of the species; for vegetable physiology reaches us, that plants make a selection in the substances taken up by them. By means of this power of i election of the nutritions substances necessary to their development, one bid the same species according to the rule, when their functions are undisturbed, always produces the same quality, but not always the same proportional quantity of the elements peculiar to their kind and species. His proportional quantity may depend on a multitude of modifications hitherto not sufficiently known. Differences exist in reference to the quantity of the proximal e vegetable constituents, according to the place, time and circumstances of growth. Air, light, heat, moisture, condition of the soil, improvement, and in reference to the last especially, the quantity and kind of manure, have more oo i less influence on the quantity of the constituent part, as well as on the nuricid127dtiosmBess of the plants themselves. At the same time also, climate, soil and culture operate more or less on their formation of the same. These facts prove by analysis; justify the conclusion that plants, according to the standard of the great e) or li existence of the conditions necessary to their general develop me it, also produce their various proximal e constituents, con formed in a greater or less dere e tdthesp conditions; for example, the be et, on a strong soil, manured With ani31482 X. mal, and especially sheep dung, produces less sugar and more notre. Heat on land manured with dung, containing a large quantity of nitrogen, possesses less marina, but more glum ten; while on the contrary it rejects that portion of matter which contains nitrogen and assimilates that of asylum, when the seed has been manured more with a dung containing carbon; as the experiments of Hermbstadt and others have sufficiently shown. The change in the quantity of nutritions elements of the fodder stuffs, thus modified by the influences of nature and culture, may also exert an influence on the nutritiousness of the fodder stuffs of which we are now treating, in the use of the same for food. Further; the capacity of nutrition of the proximal e vegetable elements to be nourished, varies essentially from each other, and their nutrition powers among themselves and to each other is not yet established by a sure method. The nitrogen of the vegetable constituents can produce in animal bodies, by assimilation, only combinations of products containing nitrogen; the carbon only those containing carbon; and the mineral again, only mineral one a. It happens, therefore, very often, in the practical use of them, that we employ for the different objects of animal nutrition, also the corresponding substances which contain the elements promoting the object in view, in sufficient quantity, suitable proportions, and in a form that may be assimilated. He who wishes to fatten, therefore, stores up as much carbon as is required in the form of fat; and he must, besides the nitrogen needed for the formation of flesh, likewise provide in his fodder, for the carbon required for the formation of the fat; while he who tasks his oxen by severe labor must, as much as possible, look out for fodder containing nitrogen in solid for in. Generally it is said, young cattle that are fed, yield for the same cut. of hay a greater increase of live weight, than the full grown ones. Any a kind of food peculiarly agrees or disagrees with one species of animals, as to nutritiousness or power of assimilation; as for example, with horned cattle, while they have a different value for horses. Any a sort of food is specially suited, or scarcely at all so, to many an object; as for example, to the production of milk, many a one is fitted to promote, or not so, endurance in labor; many a one the formation of flesh or fat, or otherwise. Although it is certain, on the other hand, that a food otherwise nutritions, and agreeing permanently with the animal, if, for example, it does not peculiarly aid the object in view, of the production of milk, yet at the same time may promote the formation of flesh or fat. Still, a person by the mistaken selection, has not obtained his object, of the increase of milk. I n the choice, therefore, of fodder stuffs, these should be estimated always in respect to their nutritiousness, for the kind of animal to which they are to be given, and especially the object which we have particularly in view in feeding them out. The combination in which the fodder stuffs are given, is important in general, and especially in reference to the objects in view; for the nutritiousness and power of being assimilated, of a fodder containing much carbon and little nitrogen, may be greatly raised by the addition of one containing nitrogen; because the different parts intended to be formed in animal bodies by fodder, can only be formed when the simple constituents, absolutely required for their formation, exist in the fodder in a form and quantity sn table to be assimilated. If this be not the case, in respect to a constituent absolutely necessary to the formation, then the formation of this animal constituent, for example, flesh or fat, takes place only in the proporEx. a. 483 t ion in which all the constituents of the food absolutely requisite for the result, exist in a form and quantity adapted to the capacity of assimilation of the -animal. In consequence of the insufficient form or quantity of a single indispensable constituent in the fodder, all the other elements which are found in the fodder, and which could otherwise be employed for the formation of animal substance, are cast out as useless, by means of the excrements. I would not, however, have it understood, that the farmer has it fully in his power, by very accurate combination of the different nutritions substances, to employ, for example, all the carbon or nitrogen that can be assimilated to form flesh or fat, for which, according to Boussingaults investigations* a cut. of fine hay, dried in the air, contains 'about seven and a half lbs. of crude flesh. There are different degrees of the capacity of assimilation i, in animals, a swell, according to the standard of the different species as also in reference to the individual power of appropriation; but in no case is there a capacity of a perfect absorption, to appropriate all the nutritions substances existing in the fodder, though they may accord ever so closely with the object in view, in respect to their separate elements. For, in this case, the dung would be nearly worthless for its object. (I profess, myself, indeed, ind respect to the theory of manure, in consequence of particular convictions recently established by experiments on the new theory, to be of the old school on this subject n addition to the above, I will only say, that if anyone so combines the fodder stuffs, that these, in respect to constituent parts, as well as in regard to form and quantity, bear the best proportion to the elements of that which is to be produced in the way of assimilation by the fodder; he can also attain, in the object in view the best increase corresponding to the particular capacity of appropriation possessed by the animal. This is proved by the fact, that men and beasts, living on abundant, and almost exclusive use of potatoes, secrete, in solid excrements, a quantity of under composed grains of marina, of which not a single trace can be discovered, when that food is replaced by flesh, grain, or other glum ten, or, in general, substances containing nitrogen, and with the nitrogen, of which the carbon in the animal body, before useless as marina, now yields higher products in favor of the object to be obtained by feeding. t Similar results have followed my numerous experiments Their form, also their volume, and the preparation with which the nutritions substances are given to animals, exercise an influence on their greater or less nutritiousness, as well as on the results to be produced by them. The raw solid form more excites the organs of digestion than the fluid or prepared, and is, on the contrary, less easily assimilated. The raw solid form is much better adapted to the purpose of endurance in labor. The fluid prepared form, to the object of increased production of flesh and fat, or of milk. Foodstuffs, which are but little nutrition in large volume, may, with suitable preparation, be fed out mixed with those that are corresponding, but very nutritions, if that food which increases their products is desired from them. The nutritiousness of grain will be raised by bruising, ferment at ion, baking into bread, and cooking; that of the raw food stuffs by steaming, grew *Boussingaults Agriculture, in its relation to Chemistry, pp. 264, 207 f Liebigs Organic Chemistry, pp. 119, 3cid1270484Ex. king, self heating; that of turn is and cabbage by picking. All substances gain by sat duration, or mixing with salt. The present year, for example, in feeding with raw potatoes, already sprouting, toward the close ;of the fattening, I had not a single case of tympanitic (wind dropsy j when, using a strong daily dose of salt while in former years, especially in foddering ou it ra full grown potatoes, .and only two doses of salt per week, frequent cases of tympanitic prevailed in the fattening stalls; to prevent which, as well to attain a better digestion and an increased absorption for moderate fattening oxen, a daily dose of salt, from 3 to 4 cloth, (equals I to 2 ounces) of wounded cooking salt, mixed with 7.loth, (i. e. I ounce) of crude wounded anti many, was given. I have attempted to. show, in the foregoing remarks, that the fodder stuffs, "according to the .difference of the kind of animals, and to that of the object in view from the fodder, with the combination, the form and n preparation in which it is given, according also to the influence of the soil, climate and culture, in .which they grow, yield different products. Further that: the value of the proximal e- vegetable constituents, for example, of glen, marina, &c, intrinsic ally and in relation to each .other, almost ever, it not al way is arises from the above stated causes, by Which the ni ore extended. result is produced; so that no definite and correct rules can he given in all circumstances; that consequently, the ascertaining the nitritious constituent parts, by analysis, can the less furnish a sure point of support, as analysis give results greatly varying from each other, and the analyses intothe remote r, or simple elements do not prove whether the substances to be regarded as nutritions, also exist in a form capable of assimilation in fodder stuffs; for we may. consider almost all plants which contain notre as nutitiousbecause this substance contains nitrogen The practical use of analysis in its accurate arithmetic al application to the attainment of definitely proposed results of feeding, for a set time withapreviqusly fixed quantity and quality of fodder stuffs, in the case of animals determined according to species and weight is therefore very doubtful, ;and judgments sustained by it only, will always bear the stamp of hypothesis hazarded and not to be depended on, which are adopted unwillingly and un certainly merely because we are in want of better o nes. Only comparative experiments, instituted with great circumspection, ban give a sure point of support as to the value of a fodder stuff for a species of animals according to the particular object proposed by the fodder, and according to its combination, form and preparation. But the animal rust be fed at least 8 to 12 days before the beginning of trial, with the fodder to be subjected to the proof, in order that it may become accustomed to the f odd, and to bring it up to the live weight which corresponds to the fodder; since voluminous innutritious food usually renders the animal heavier in live weight for the :mass necessary to be used for nutriment, without its yielding an increase in flesh or fat; but very extreme fattening often produces the contrary effect. After this .period, the animals should be weighed alive, their weight separately noted, and the per entr m of tallow determined. When the feeding must be. carried on: as much. as possible, by daily weighing the fodder, in the usual air dried state, and as far as may be, with exactly the same preparation and combination, and also allowing entire freedom of the animal from labor, at least 30 or 40 days. In case of the milk cow, the milk must be measured and determined as to quality, by alactometer, the animals weighed at short intervals, as far as possible every x. a. 485.day at the same hour, in order, by frequent weighing, to counteract the fluctuations of weight produced by more or less drink, or greater or less fulness of food; and averages of weight from time to time, deduced therefromhThe un consumed fodder must be daily weighed over, on which account, every animal should -have his own fodder bag, or particular fodder bin denoted by number. In such a trial, every thing must be accurately designated. Such an experiment, conducted with caution, can even then, in no wise, be' regarded as the general determination of the nutritions power of the fodder stuff under investigation, intrinsic ally; but only as an experiment undertaken, with respect to this or that species of animal, and of the fodder stuffs examined in this or that quantity simply, or in combination with this or that preparation The proving of the simple substance, so far as it can be fed out without combination, must precede the proving of the combinations and preparations, and all the fodder stuffs proved, must be given to the animal in that quantity, which, according to the before mentioned hints, is to be considered best for it, in the measure of food reckoned or given, or, at least, approximating to the living cut. of the animal line hay being the most frequent fodder stuff, and that which at first must be assumed as the standard of proportion for the others, must lie at the basis of the trial, and all the fodder stuffs, either simple, or in combination, must be compared with, or, which is better, be reduced to it, in respect to their nutrition power. Analyses may be useful in these provings, so far as they can indicate the constituent parts by the exhibition of the proportional quantity and properties for combining the fodder stuffs advantageously. To the use of the many comparative experiments already made respecting so many fodder stuffs, I am opposed, because, as the majority of the same, even of the most recent, have been destitute of every one of the above pointed out precautions, and of accuracy, and therefore, of the proper certainty, I discard them, in order, after so long a confusion of this sort of views and opinions, to be able to fix upon certain principles for a future correct valuation of the different species of cattle fodder. Relations of soil, climate, and culture, may always likewise occasion local varieties, but they cannot, ,to any extent, produce such differences as the superficial manner, in which such, experiments: have usually been conducted when they have been carried on for a short period, the animals not repeatedly weighed before, during and after the experiments, and regard had to the increase, or decrease of the same; where the higher, or lesser live weight produced by the introduction of fodder instead of the increase or decrease of weight, happening only by the greater or less proportion of fodder introduced, which is the real increase or decrease, have been improperly brought into the account; and where finally, no proper regard has been paid to the daily variations of the animal, and, which is essential, to having the weighing done at the same hour, as well as to many other accidents exercising an influence over the results; and thus valuations have beer f introduced for one and the same f adder stuff, which differ with different experimenteds about 100 or more per cent up. Such an experiment, to be certain, must be conducted under the regulation of fixed weight, until unquestionable observations have become available in averages of similar results respecting many animals, the value of the proved fodder stuff, and in the form, combination, and preparation tried. The space of these observations does not allow me to draw out here such and ex 486 X. Doc Too. 4.periment or mode of proving in its details; but if these subjects should be published in the more extended form of the essay before mentioned, some of these results will be submitted for the instruction and judgment of others. Of the Determination of the per cent age of At or Allow. The present section relates to determining the per cent age of tallow. This may be done by external marks. It is somewhat difficult to describe the external marks that belong to this subject, so that every one may be in a situation to determine the proportion of tallow with some certainty. This is done by means of the fat grips (fettgriffe) in oxen as they become father, appearing one after another, or in reference to their own increase. In order to establish for every ox a proportionate relation suitable for all large cattle, we must determine the proportion of fat according to the percentage of tallow, i. e. how many lbs. of tallow there is in 100 weight of pure flesh weight of the four quarters; an ox of 5 cut. of flesh, and ten percent. of tallow will accordingly have 50 lbs. of tallow. By pure flesh weight in the four quarters is meant the simple trunk of the ox without head or fore feet without generous or mean weight, and without tallow. In entirely lean ox, without any tallow, has scarcely any fat grip (felt' grief and also no bend; the first grip which is found between the fore shoulder blades and the neck, on taking hold of entirely lean horned cattle, is the fat grip showing itself. We feel it so much the easier the more we cause the beast to turn his head and neck to the side where we stand. An entirely lean ox, which has scarcely any bend, has merely the tissue and hide for the reception of the tallow; for these' in an ox of 1000 lbs. live weight, we may allow about 9 lbs, with which this empty fat reservoir may be weighed together with the tallow collected in the fattening. At 5 per cent. of tallow, the bend begins to show itself in the form of a cord strange) of the thickness of the little finger, running by the feeling along the foreshoijlder, between the neck and shoulder, from below upwards, while as yet no other grip can be noticed; it grows and loose is itself more and more, continually, so that we may always find it easier and larger in the band on bending the neck of the animal sideways; it becomes often tolerably thick until the side (lank e) begins to unfold itself, which is the second grip appearing on the corner of the belly between the belly and leg, (schlagel) [fore quarter] in the case of which development just .beginning and hardly yet noticeable, and the larger formed bend, the fattening ox, has 10 percent. of tallow; a. half developed, yet soft side, (weir he lank e) with a pretty large bend, (or bow) indicates 15 per cent. proportion of tallow; a pretty largely developed side (lank e) so that it fills the hand; an increasing sack, and greater bend indicates 20 per cent. of tallow. At 25 percent. fat, we need more practical skill in distinguishing; the bend is large, solid, springs out of the hand; if we press it, it glides from under the hand, it fills the hand, is solid, slippery, but not hard, which latter instance is called a flesh bend; the side (lank e) is firm and large we can scarcely any longer seize it in the hand; the sack is usually large and solid, although this latter is no very sure grip. The stomach hole, or opening, (hunger luck) is knotty, the hip bone usually tender and doughy. This last grip, according to the rule, appears first when the other grips are well developed, and the animal is fat, although, with oxen, which have been x. a. 487 taken very lean, often times, also, it does not appear. It is the grip of the    italian butcher, but which usually is not specially distinguished from the former fat grips, which furnish the measure without its aid. The further marks of distinction up to 30 per cent. of tallow are hardly de terminate enough to have the g radiations of this grip described, and can only be shown practically. After having thus given marks for the determination of per cent age of tallow, I pass on to the estimate of pure flesh weight from the live weight. In the Determination of the Flesh Eight from the Give Eight. Horned cattle, which receive about 21 to 3 lbs. hay value, as daily food on every hundred of live weight, of which the greater part is really hay, when weighed in a feeding state, according to the experiments adjusted by the new scale, produce hardly any fat in which state their collective skin and tissue which is destined to receive the fat, are estimated at about 8 les for 100 live weight per head on 100 lbs. of pure flesh in the four quarters, without generous or mean weight, (a) and without reckoning the tallow as flesh, are estimated to give 260 I is, of live weight. At 5 per cent. proportion of tallow there is reckoned for 100 lbs. of pure flesh, 255 lbs. live weight. At 10 per cent. proportion of tallow, is reckoned for 100 lbs. of pure flesh 245 lbs. live weight. At 15 pet cent. proportion of tallow is reckoned for 100 lbs. of pure flesh, 235 lbs. of live weight. At 20 per cent. proportion of tallow is reckoned for 100 lbs. of pure flesh 225 lbs. of live weight f the food consists of very voluminous, but scarcely nutritions constituents for example, straw, by which the stomach of the animal must be more extended and larger, in order to accommodate the mass necessary for nourishment then may a person increase the gross weight required for 100 weight of flesh by about 5 per cent. For, example; at 5 per cent. tallow 260 lbs. instead of 255 gross, or live weight. Moistened food usually produces more live weight than dry. But in how much lesser volume and weight, a great amount of nutritions matter is contained, so much smaller will be the belly of the animal, and so much less is the live weight gained for 100 weight of flesh; so that, for example, animals fed with simply oats, or bruised grain, if they have about 20 per cent. or over, of tallow, require only 180 to 190 lbs. live weight for 100 lbs. of flesh, because the food that is within weighs so much the less. An ox, also, which is in a hungry state, according to the standard, whether he be not fed, or not properly fed once, or a number of times, gives decidedly less live weight to a hundred of flesh weight; so that 'an ox of about 20 per cent. fat, kept on short allowance, for the purpose of slaughter, may lose -one-seventh to one fifth of his earlier live weight, when he was in a state of fattening; on which account about 190 pounds of live weight at 20 per cent. of tallow may give 100 weight of flesh. To, likewise, particular races of cattle, as well as the 'difference of fodder may exercise an influence upon it. I tis, therefore, necessary to learn to understand his fodder and cattle account, and in some slaughter house to estimate the average live weight that is to be reckoned at an average for a hundred weight of flesh, the determination of which must always be made for one of the above designated per cent ages of tallow. In the proportion that the number found 488 X. bears to that above designated per cent age, in the same proportion, also, must the numbers annexed to the other per cent ages of tallow be raised, or reduced. As particular animals may vary, therefore, the averages of many slaughtered animals must be always brought in to aid such attempts at determination. -the above proportional numbers are only the average numbers from many great averages of the races of cattle of this country. An ox which, from a supply of food of 21 to 3 lbs. hay value daily per 100 les. live weight, if put on the mere sustaining fodder of 1 lbs. of hay for 100 of that live weight, which he had previous to his being brought into a feeding state, or one of 12 lbs. of hay for 100 cut. of that live weight to which the animal is reduced by with holding the mere conservation fodder, loses after some days, from the original weight which he had previous to his completely feeding state about one half to one-eighth of his original live weight; so that now, for example, A 10 per cent. proportion of tallow instead of the previous 245 lbs. he only has a live weight of 214 to 224 les to 100 lbs. of flesh. The increase in live, or brute weight at the end of the fattening, at 20 percent. of tallow, is usually about one third to one-seventh greater in the feeding state than the increase of flesh and tallow reckoned together amounts to in the same period. I now pass on to estimation of pure flesh in the four quarters by measuring the thickness and length of the animal. In the Rode of Determining the Flesh Eight by Measuring the Animal. The pure flesh weight of the animal, in the four quarters may be determined with tolerable accuracy by measuring the length and thickness of the same. For our Carinthian cattles account, Dr. Toller has cast tables, the use of which I have modified for our Carinthian breeds of cattle, in a paper printed in the Transactions, &c. (new series, vol. 3, pp. 248 268) of the Royal Steiermark Agricultural Society, and which is extracted and published in Prof. Hlubeks System of Agriculture, (vol. ii, 8th part, p. 383.)I annex to my present essay such a table, together with the modifications to be made in reference to it in the use of it among the different races. The time allotted to this essay might be too long were I to give to so multifarious a subject only a development proportioned to circumstances, and many things must be left untouched, and probably obscure, which might be considered essential to a better foundation, and a clear view of the subject. I refer at this time to my already mentioned purpose to publish, before the appearance of my remarks on the subject under consideration, for the better illustration of the things here said, a fuller extract in the " Communications of the Carinthian Agricultural Society" as well as in the journal conducted by Dr. Hlubek, a course of observations which I would mention beforehand, should any one be inclined to give a further consideration to the subject here discussed; and, likewise, I should be pleased, should any one be desirous of it, to give many further explanations in writing.

Jon Rai Of    Of Calves. Translated from the German of the Was Neueste in Gebiete der And uitdiForstiwirthjthaft so wie" : derentechnischen nebenfacheyibyE: Good rich -omit i of the Patentoffieat one of the conventions of the German agriculturists ind foresters, the following remarks respecting i the raising of calves, were .made by iBardn Vonriedesdel as the result of his experiments The calf should receive from its birth till it is ten times of its then weight, daily, the same food in hay value, in which we reckon' one proud of : silk equal to one pound of hay. The food should be changed accordingly to that only in substance and volume, not in nutrition value, up to that time, and therefore be daily one third hay value of the animals weight. I for example the calf at its birth l weighs ninety pounds, then its .for front the beginning inst be continually thirty pounds hay value. When the young animals have attained to ten times their bodily weight, Which will he the case in a year without labor, then they are nearly f thebdilysie of their das, and may be used for breeding.

He set apart no' more calves fair breeding than were t necessary to theperpetuation of his noble alert of cattle, because the raising of ilii em costs him very high 2. He does not fix on :any calf, if it weighs less than one tenth of its mothers weight at birth 3' he ii i is th~ ~i is e, ,nd in every instance, the -takes care that the calf should have daily as much milk from its r mother as on -third of is own i ye weight; 4.

The same is the case when the calf is affected by any <a name="disease137"><mark>disease</mark></a> or casualty, since <a name="disease138"><mark>disease</mark></a> scarcely ever occurs with the nutriment proportioned justly; it must therefore be an infectious <a name="disease139"><mark>disease</mark></a> 6. The first four weeks of its life the calf must receive the whole of its mothers milk, because in this period the nutrition contained in the milk in so small volume can be replaced by no other equally nutritions and as easilydigestible means of food. -7. After four weeks the milk may be replaced by that means of fodder which contains nutritions substance next to it in equal weight of dry volume, in the greatest possible amount 8. The withdrawal of milk is to be advised only graduallyoneeighthor one-fourth of the quantity daily 9. The milk is most easily and advantageously replaced by means of thickened sweet milk 10. This method of supply is possible only when we make sweet milk cheese, otherwise use meal or groats of grain. 11. But before the calf is four weeks old, it begins to play with hay and straw, and gradually to eat more and more hay 12. The animal, however, must never be compelled by hunger to eat hay, but give it in place of milk, in dry volume, and in increasing capacity of nutriment every time as such as the milk would contain, that would otherwise have been given 3 13. We now advance in the course of feeding, to give the proportion of nutrition in always increasing volume. -14. His process of feeding being always proportionately increased, the animal grows in the same manner as at the beginning, yet, as mentioned, it is always proportionately weaned, until its body has developed the mass, to attain which it was designed at its birth Formerly Aren Riedesdel caused his he ifer, calves, at the age of six to seven months, after they had reached the size of their dams, to take the bull, so that they called at sixteen months old. But observing that his young animals were not :it grown up when l they had reached the size of their dams, aid 'even surpassed them iii size, he afterwards caused the heiress to take the, bull when at full two years 1d. Riedesdel was satisfied 'with this new plan; -his he ifer calves, in o" oncompletingcid127) their second yer, ~at fourteen to fifteen hundred ponds, weight, cost him, on each hundred lbouidf live eight, a' little over fifteen hundredweight of hay value; while before they sighed o di the cnmpletionioftheir third year, at the highest, only one thousand pounds of live weight; and every hundred pounds of live weight frost about eighteen and three fifth hundred weight of hay value in fodder. The bull for coup long at a year old is perfectly fitted for his work, i and on the completion of the second year, when he attains to seventeen hundred to eighteen hundred pounds live weight, he is in his capacity for service, superior to the :stoutest stallion 4: E..  N : " Oncid127edblnc Sheep. Experiments on the proportion of food to be given to sheep, by G. Meckel, director of husbandry at Frankenfelde, near Berlitrrisnlated from the German by E. Good rich Smith respected college of land husbandry in Berlin, in the auihmnGibofhlastyear, honored me with the commission of repeating the interesting, and, for x. a. 495 our cattle bleeders, most important experiments undertaken by the minister, Herr On Weckherlin, at Cohnheim, in order to determine the animal production according to the scale of i feding, and also as to the most useful quantity of fodder for sheep; but with this modification, that half of the hay fodder should be supplied by potatoes These experiments were made in the period, from the first of January to the twenty-eighth of May, of this year; and I make an extract from theiTransactions of the highly respected convention. In the 30th of December, of last year, the animals necessary for the experiment, viz: two and a half year old eyes and half year old lambs, were selected from the same flock, which, for a course of years, had shorn ten and a half to eleven stone, [a stone equals twenty-two lbs] per one hundred head, and the wool of which, in former years, had been valued at 1 125 six dollars, [equal to seventy cents each] per cut; and little wooden tablets with consecutive numbers hung around their necks. When the whole of them, sheep and lambs, collectively, were shorn, the flee ces accurately weighed, and each one placed in a particular basket, furnished with the number of the animal referred to, in order to be kept locked up till the spring, and then every flee ce to be washed separately. Next, all the animals were accurately weighed, and their weight, together with their tablets and tattooed numbers put down in a list, according to which they were then divided into sections as the object of the experiment required. The feeding of the experimental animals were committed to the sheep master, and a trusty scholar of the school of shepherds. This feeding took place in the morning at nine o clock, and at three o clock in the afternoon and was many times, weekly, under my own superintendence. At the weighing of the animals, which was always on the first day of every month before nine o clock in the morning, I was every time present. In the 27th of May, the experimental animals had their last food, and on the 28th of May, before nine in the morning, they were weighed with the wool, and then immediately shorn. The wool of every animal was weighed un washed, and then all the flee ces, from December and May s hearings, were separately washed in baskets, and after they were dried they were again weighed. The separate experiments were tried in the method pointed out by Herryon Weckherlin. Experi Ment Now the conservation fodder must be established as to the bodily weight, and in what proportion the fodder aiding the production, i. e. beyond mere conservation, operated for making flesh, i. e. bodily increase, and wool, accordingly as more or less of it was given. Your divisions were set apart, of which each contained four two and a half year old sheep at an average of sixty-eight lbs. bodily weight per head, and to which were apportioned: the appointed food, according to the hay. At the general meeting of the tenth convention of German agriculturists, on the 19th of September, 1846, it was resolved, that this communication should be separately printed and distributed to the members of the association, and also sent to the different agricultural associations of Germany. This resolution is a most decisive proof of the importance and interest attached to this paper by that large and respectable bodyfThe feed necessary to keep an animal in its present state is called conservation fodder. All over and above this which tends to increase, production fodder 496 X. value, [i. e. a quantity equal in value to a supposed quantity of hay] one half in c lover hay and the other half in potatoes.

This, indeed, was the result of the change of fodder, and the change to the rough temperature to which they were exposed by the s hearing off of the wool. In April, also, there was exhibited a stronger decrease, or a decidedly smaller increase than in February, March and Mayoecuse the experimental sheep were much disturbed by the driving out ofcid127) other sheep. X. a. 497 The wool of the first division maintained an equally proportioned growth but it was weak and tender, and of little use for manufacture. The wool of the other divisions was good, only the fourth was too thick, and loaded with greasy sweat, on account of which it sustained the greatest <a name="loss71"><mark>loss</mark></a> of weight on being washed. Experi Ment I I .whether large or small animals, with food in equal proportion to their bodily weight, will also be sustained in their bodily state, increase, or fall off in equal proportion Two divisions were set apart to. 5 and No. 6, each of which contained four two, and a half year old sheep, of the averages respectively, of 78 and56lbs. bodily weight per head; and to which the appointed fodder in hay value was given, half in c lover hay and the other half in potatoes. The fifth division received ' of bodily weight in hay value; its weight was 340 lbs. 20 both, therefore 10 lbs. 6 both of potatoes and 5 lbs. 8 both of c lover hay, or 2 lbs. 20 both of hay value per head les. both. The animals consumed in 148 days, in hay value. 1 542 16 Their weight at the close of the experiment including wool was, 331 14 Therefore the increase of bodily weight exclusive of wool was, 8 30 And on 10 lbs. of production fodder. .a. 3 The increase in fine washed wool was. 5 8Thriefore on 10 lbs. of production fodder, .a. .a. 2.. The sixth division received also .of bodily weight in hay value, weight224lbs. 18 both; therefore 7 lbs. 16 10th of potatoes and 3 lbs. 24 both of cloverliay or 1 lb. 28 10th hay value per head les. both. The animals consumed in 148, days in hay value. 1 102 16 Weigh at t the close of the experiment including Fool. . 224 15 Therefore decrease of bodily weight, exclusive of wool. 5 8 And decrease on 10 lbs. of production fodder. 3 The increase in clean Washed wool. .a. 4 1 Therefore on 10 lb. of production fodder. .a. 24 n these two divisions too, there was a decided falling off of weight iicid127Jantary, as well as in April, there was exhibited an interruption in their nutrition. The foregoing experiment thus answered the question proposed, that grown sheep of heavy and the same kind of lighter weight, do not maintain a state of the body in like proportions when fed with fodder of equal proportion, for although both divisions received as fodder .of the bodily weight hay value, yet No. 5 gained on 10 lbs. of production fodder 34 both; and to. 6 lost on 10 I is, 3 both in weight of flesh; while in No. 5 the increase of clean washed wool was 24 both; in No. 6 it was 24 both on 10 lbs. of production fodder. It hence follows therefore, that in full grown sheep wool will be produced mainly by fodder and that when the fodder necessary to the production of the wool, has been taken up from the quantity delivered out, the flesh weight is increased by the remainder. But now from a small light sheep, with a thick stand of wool on his skin, as much wool may be shearedsis from a large heavier sheep with a thin stand of wool on his skin; the light one also needs f. ' .n penance as much fodder as the heavy one, 32 498 X. and if the same is not given him, the falling off will be chiefly not in the wool but in the flesh weight. Therefore it does not appear to be correct to fodder full grown sheep, which are kept for the sake of the wool product only, according to the live weight; and in the feeding of the same, we must rather adopt a determined quantity of hay value per head, which must be regulated by the wool product and bodily weight. Thus experiment I. division 3, exhibits a quantity of fodder of 2- lb s hay value, as the correct measure for this gave on 10 lbs. of production fodder 21 both increase of bodily weight; while on the other hand, in division 4,.a quantity of fodder of 3 lbs. 12 both, hay value per head gave l 1 both of wool, but an increase in bodily weight of 120 both on 10 lbs. of production fodder. This shows us also how wasteful we are of our fodder and how wretchedly we deprecate it when we give our .full grown sheep, which we keep for their wool product more than 21 and at the highest 2 lbs. hay value per head, as in winter the more fodder given lessens the value of our wool, because this makes it gross, but the flesh and fat produced by it is lost again on the summer pasture. Experi Ment I I Whether a similar proportion is established also in young animals which are yet fully growing ?with this experiment I also at the same time sought to determine 1. The value as fodder of the dried leaves of trees, as this has never been established within my knowledge 2. Besides, how the fodder for lambs introduced into the royal stock flock, superintended by me, in its results was compared to that in the before mentioned experiments. For this experiment were selected 12 head of half year old lambs, and placed in 3 divisions, Los. 8, 10, 11. Their average weight was 44 les. per, had. The eighth, division received of bodily weight in hay value, half in potatoes and half in c lover hay; its weight was 176 lbs. 8 both, therefore 5 lb s 28 both of potatoes and 2 lbs. 30 both of c lover hay, or 1 lb. 15 both of hay value per head. I is, both. The animals consumed, in 148 days, in hay value. 86 8 20 Their weight at the close of the experiment, including wool, was, 190 18 Therefore, the increase of bodily weight, exclusive of wool. 9 21 And on 10 pounds of production fodder. 7 The increase in clean washed wool was. .a. 3 11 Therefore, on 10 pounds of production fodder. .a. 2s The tenth division received, likewise, one thirtieth of live weight in hay value, half in potatoes, and half in dried leaves of elms, linen and popular, of which one pound of leaves, without chopping, was taken as equal to one pound of hay : its weight 176 pounds, 12 both; therefore, 5 pounds, 28 both of potatoes and 2 pounds, 30 both of leaves, or 1 pound 15 both of hay value, per head les. both. The animals consumed, in 148 days, in hay value. 86 3 20 Their weight at the close of the experiment, including wool. 157 19 Therefore, the decrease of bodily weight, exclusive of wool. 2 23 And decrease on 10 pounds of production fodder. 2 x. a. 499 The eleventh division was not shut up in any particular space, but only shorn and weighed on the same day with the other experimental animals. The animals were left at liberty among other un housed lambs, and were foddered in the same manner as they were. Their food consisted of hay, straw, potatoes, carrots, and sometimes oats; and it was weighed out to the ri, so that daily 2 pounds of hay value were given per head. Obs. both. The animals consumed, in 148 days, in hay value. .a. .a. 1184Their live weight at the beginning, exclusive of wool, was, -a. 176 8 Their live weight at the close of the experiment, including wool, 216 19 Therefore, the increase of bodily weight, exclusive of wool. 32 10 And on 10 pounds of production fodder. .a. 14 The increase in clean washed wool was. .a. .a. 4 13 And therefore, on 10 pounds of production fodder. 2 By the foregoing experiment was to be determined 1. Whether, by an equal foddering, a similar proportion existed in young animals, still in full growth, as in full grown ones? For this purpose, let the eighth division be compared with the third one, and the results obtained by the .two divisions, show that in the eighth division the fodder on 10 pounds. of production fodder had gained in value by :3 both, as respects increase of bodily weight, more than in the third; but that, in regard to the wool production, the value of the fodder remained .the same in the two divisions. The fodder value of the leaves of trees was to be determined, and for this purpose let the tenth division be compared with the eighth. The former division lost, on 10 pounds of production fodder, 16, both of flesh, and gave only 2 both of wool; while the eighth division, on the same -quantity of fodder, gained 7 j both of bodily weight, and an increase of wool 25 both. The feeding of dry leaves of trees must hence be regarded as a light substitute for the failure of hay fodder; although I cannot deny that the same, given to lambs daily, in- small parcels, together with hay, potatoes and oats, have always proved to me very profitable in their influence on their health 3. The stronger foddering of lambs, of of hay value of bodily weight, shows very favorable results, as this, on 10 pounds of production fodder, effected an increase in bodily weight of 144 both, and in wool product of 2 both; while the fourth division, on b hay value of bodily weight, yielded only 11 both of wool production, and an increase of 12- both in bodily weight. We must therefore give lambs a stronger amount of fodder than Of    of their bodily weight, in order that they shall not fall back in their progress, and in order that the fodder given them may be worth more, from their higher wool production, than it is with respect to full grown animals. When I compare the results of the foregoing experiments, with thosewhichHerr On Weckherlin communicated to the eighth convention at Munich, they agree in general, and it is here found, also, that u hay value of the bodily weight cannot be taken, in respect to fill grown sheep, as conservation fodder, but that at least 4 hay value is requisite for them; and that this is not sufficient for smaller animals, because sheep, on account of tie wool growth, cannot be foddered only according to live weight. Finally, I may be allowed to observe, that as the first officer of the Munich convention, the councillor of state, On Stickaner, on the occasion of the500Ex. experiments of Herr Boa Weckherlin being communicated, added that about 250 pounds of hay value, in full grown sheep, yielded 1 pound of wool; I have used, the results of the foregoing experiments to determine how this proportion should be fixed, in the different quantities of fodder mentioned, and how in regard to young animals yet fully growing. I have found the following facts in the case Third division 272 pounds, 2 both in weight, hay, value; therefore 2 pounds per head yielded 1 pound of wool on 255 pounds hay value, and 1 pound of flesh on 154 pounds hay value. Fourth division 271 pounds, 19 both in weight, hay value; therefore, 3 pounds, 12 both per head yielded 1 pound of wool for 380 pounds hay value; and 1 pound of flesh for 40 hay value. Eighth division 176 pounds, 8 both in weight, ~a~ hay value therefore 1 pound, 15 both per head yielded 1 pound of wool for 258 1 pounds hay value, and 1 pound of flesh to 89 pounds hay value. , .i Eleventh division 176 pounds, 8 both in weight, y hay value; therefore, 2 pounds per head yielded 1 pound of wool' for 268 pounds hay value, and 1 pound of flesh for 36 pounds hay value. The calculations of the councillor of state, On Stickanerholds, therefore, very accurately with respect to sheep which are nourished proportion ably, i. e. with t 2- to 2 ay: value per head; but, oh it h other hand, the results are wholly different i ri the larger amounts of fodder, arid in young still growing animals.

Report on the value of Sheep Husbandry. Head to the Agricultural Society, Pendleton, South Carolina. In obedience to your resolution, requiring your committee to " report on sheep husbandry in the south" they beg leave to say that the resolution would seem i to require a more extended examination than could be embraced in a report of an ordinary length. They will therefore confine themselves to that part of the subject which, in their estimation, will best how the applicability and value of sheep husbandry to our neighborhood and section. Although but little attention is given by any of us, to raising sheep, and by none to preparing wool for a foreign market, yet, it will be admitted, that our native stock are healthy, growing to a fair size and produce a fair fleecy from two to five pounds, even under the great neglect with which they are treated. There is, however, one question necessary to examine and that is, whether the quality and quantity of the flee ce deteriorate in our climate. The question has been very fully examined by Mr. H. S. And all, a very intelligent and experienced wool grower in Court land, New Work. From his excellent letters, published in the Farmers' Library, (the perusal of which      take pleasure in recommending to the members of this society) I draw the following statement: " It is known that from Pain (north latitude 86 to 44 degrees) all the fine wool led flocks have sprung. And that in Saxony (north latitude 50 to 51 degrees 30 minutes) the Spanish mere no wool has been improved in fine ness of fibre but lessened in quantity. In New York (north latitude 42 to 44 degrees) the fine ness of the Spanish mere no is preserved and quantity increased. In Vermont (north latitude 43 to 45 degrees) the fine ness and quantity of the Saxony wool are preserved. South of us, in Madison county, Mississippi, (north latitude 32 degrees 41 minutes) the wool of the Saxony sheep has been found to maintain its original fine ness, and increased in quantity. Recent experiments in Australia (south latitude 33 degrees, 55 minutes) show that fine wool led, sheep the mere no) preserve the quantity and improve in quality of flee ce. The exports of wool from there in 1810 was only 167 lbs. C" " " in 1833 " 3,516,869 "a" " " in 1843 " 16,226,400 "I n 1834, London price for best Spanish mere no, was .a. .a. 67 its." Australian mere no. .a. 100" English wool. .a. 48 n England (north latitude 50 to 56 degrees) from some cause not yet settled fine wool cannot be grown. Dear the Gape. of Good Hope (south latitude, 34 minutes) mere no sheep do well, maintaining both quality and quantity of flee ce with Pain. The latitude of Pendleton is 34 degrees, 40 minutes, but counting a degree for every 200 feet attitude, would throw us some twelve degrees farther north and between the latitudes of Pain and Saxony. To far then as latitude is concerned, experiments have been made both north and south of us, which show, that here, Spanish mere no wool neither degenerates in quality nor quantity of flee ce. It is also known that rich such lent green food, generally adds length to 504 X. fibre, but does not always make fine wool coarser, at least between latitude twenty-eight and fifty degrees north, nor does it make coarse wool finer. Humidity and dryness of atmosphere seem to have, as well as climate, some influence on the fibre. But as yet, the laws which govern the flee ce have not been satisfactorily ascertained. It is sufficient for the present enquiry that experiments verify the operation, that in this latitude mere no wool will hot become coarser, nor the coarse long wool become finer, if each stock be kept pure. And as the climate is well adapted to both, the choice of stocks may very well be left to the fancy of those who try either. We come now to test the value of sheep husbandry to this section of country. There are many methods by which this can be done. I shall, however, take the simple one of comparing the profits of this with the other pursuits of the country. It is acknowledged in the northern states that growing vol is a good business there, mtidTI  will first give a table from Mr. Landau is letter showing the profits of growing wool in New Work. buys 100 eyes at        $2,... .a. .a.           $200.00" 33 acres of land at           $20..................... 607 00 putting and curing 11 acres of the above for hay. 13 65 may for s hearing. .a. .a. .a. 4 00 For salt, tar and summer care. .a. -a" .a. 4 00 For labor of winter feeding. .a. .a. 5 00 <a name="loss72"><mark>Loss</mark></a> by death 2 percent. above pulled who~ from those that die, 4 00 he ce its.     $837.75Receipts.300 pounds wool at 39 a. 118 7 180 lambs at                           $1............ .a. .a. 80 00 Summer manure equal to winter care. 5 00 203 71 his is equal to twenty-four per cent. on the amount invested, and makes the cost of the wool to the farmer twenty-seven cents per pound.

These are suppositions. Take what has actually occurred in Dickens district. Mr. Trifling, as I am informed by himself, bought one e we for                           $1.00I n 1846 she had three lambs.          $3.00Sheared two pounds wool at twenty cents. 40-          $3.40I n 1847, same e we had two lambs. 2 00Sheared again two pounds wool at twenty cents. 40 Each one of the last years lambs had a lamb apiece. 3 00 And shared from the 3, six pounds wool at 20 cents. 1 406 60 his is an increase of eight in two years from one e we, and Mr. Striblingsays at this time the whole are alive. I admit this is an extraordinary case and it is only mentioned to show there are cases of actual increase far above any of those calculations made above. If then the climate be not only adapted to fine wool, but also to the coarse if the range which is abundant and sufficient to feed a flock the entire year; and if the above calculations are founded on data any where near correct, what more can be desired to show the applicability and value of sheep husbandry to this section, Fro tip three very respectable wool growers, one from each of the states of Pennsylvania, New Work, arid Ohio, I was told the way to take a calculation on the profits of sheep husbandry in a reasonably safe way, was to put down every year one ninth less of lambs than you have eyes, and the, de duct one tenth from the whole for deaths in that year. Thus say you have. .a. 100 eyes. From one hundred de duct one ninth, and you have. 89 lambs189Then de duct one tenth for deaths. .a. .a. 18 And you have. .a. 171 o start with the next year. In this basis I have taken one hundred eyes and run the calculation on for eight years. The result was fool shared in eight years, .a. 17,190 lbs. X. a. 507 The gentlemen above alluded to, say that half the wool will pay all expenses, even wh an the winters require five months' feedDeduct then one half, 8,595, at 20 cents.                           $1,719The increase amounted to 2,067 sheep, at                           $1..... .a. 2,067Total,.... .a. .a.          $3,786This result, if attained, would exceed fifty per cent. compounded. Theysy, too, it is a safe estimate to say that the lambs of each year will pay the expenses of the whole flock for that year in Pennsylvania. They more than do it here. Allow eighty lambs to one hundred eyes, and you have from five hundred eyes, four hundred lambs; de duct one tenth for deaths, and you have three hundred and sixty at                           $1.00,..... .a.          $360 Charge 20 cents per head for 900 sheep, makes.                             $180" for shepherd. .a. 150330Lambs over pay expenses by.              $30 All these calculations are made on the supposition that sheep get a part of that regular attention which all farmers give to their other domestic animals. And to make sheep husbandry successful, it is not only necessary that this attention should be given, but every one who attempts it should know something of their diseases and the cures, and also the summer and winter management. This can be acquired only by their own, or the experience of others. Easy access can be had to the experience of northern wool growers, who are proverb i al for being close observers. They say the <a name="disease140"><mark>disease</mark></a> called the ' scours" is the principal one to which sheep are liable, produced by excess of rich green food, and cured easily by a change to dry, but if allowed to continue, is fatal. From the introduction into the United States in 1808, of mere no sheep from Pain, owners of this stock have considered it of the first importance to preserve the quality and quantity of their flee ce, and if possible, to improve both. They ascertained that lambs from young and healthy sires improved, while those from i old eyes fell back both in quality and quantity of flee ce. Among them it is now a settled practice not to breed from eyes over seven or eight, nor from bucks over six years old. It is very important to resort to the evidence of age the teeth afford. Their books have been particular in describing these evidences, which I will copy: "during the first year, lambs have eight small teeth in front, in the upper jaw, called nipper sat a year old, the centre two shed, and two larger teeth take their place. At two years old, the next two are lost, and supplied by two larger ones. Thus losing and being supplied by two larger ones annually, till five then they have a full set. At eight or nine they begin to lose their nipperstwoevery year and by thirteen or fourteen years old, they have lost their entire set t is evident that during the time eyes are losing their teeth, they become less and less able to supply themselves with food, consequently afford less and less milk for their young. Thus the de genera cy is accounted for. In Vermont, where wool is as much their staple as cotton in South Carolina, so important do they consider it not to breed from eyes after they begin to lose teeth, that although mutton is not used by the inhabitants for the table, they sell their old stock to be fed to hogs 508 X a. In most of the other northern states, their eyes at that age are kept (cid127fomthe bucks, and fattened for market. From their known skill (did 127) miangiigwell what they undertake, we may safely take their usage as a guide, when it is applicable to our situation. With them grass is the entire food of theirflocksgreen meadows for summer pasture and hay for winter. Their winters require five months' constant feeding, during which they estimate each sheep to consume fifty cents worth of hay. All stock is then kept enclosed, and the attention to turning sheep to pasture in summer, and feeding s herein winter, requires but little labor in addition to their other stock. Locks require close attention but at three times in the year the tapping, the lambing and s hearing seasons. Owes go with lamb one hundred and twenty-five days, or five months, and they so manage as to; have the lambs brought in April. and May; (here February is esteemed by, many a better month) To do this, the bucks. must be kept imp wounded, except at the time desired. From the great superiority of early lambs, this part of sheep husbandry is, esteemed very important. During lambing season, close attention is required to guard both e we and lamb from storms and cold winds to see that the. e we acknowledges her lamb, and to keep up the marking and altering as the lambs get between five and ten days old. . He i days previous to s hearing time they prepare for it by washing the wool on the sheeps back, that the natural oil of the wool, which is destroyed by the washing, may have time to be renewed, without which the wool feels and works harsh. The washing is done at shouts or pools, prepared for the purpose, and the other folks are kept on clean pastures till shared. Is the proper preparation of an article, for market is justly considered of the next importance to a good article, I will describe this process minutely, as practised for the northern market. The s hearing is done of a clean floor and each flee ce is kept unbroken en. n the shared, it is rolld outside in, until it is reduced to a lump about ten in inches each way, and then tied vital strings ii two places. For packing the wool, a bag is tied nearly 'as large as our cotton bags, which after sewing to a hoop at top, they hang through hole in an upper floor, a little less in diameter than the hoop; .here thifleeces are packed down by the foot, the weight of an ordinary sized man be iii ga sufficient pressure. Thus finished; the wool is ready for a northern or European market Manufacturers will not give full price for wool in less the flee ces are unbroken; because, before manufacturing, they consider it necessary to have each flee ce divided into five qualities, which they epi not drift he wool of different flee ces are emptied together. Different modes of summer management are followed in different countries. The one followed in Australia, as described by o Mr. And all, is not only less troublesome, but would b b better suited to our -mount ta iii region There they roam over the plains, under charge of a' shepherd, in flocks of tree hundred to one thousand. Very night, some two or more of these f locks are penned together, during the entire year. Breeding promiscuouslyfrom the bucks that run with the flocks, allowing three or four to the hundred eyes. At the Gape of Good Hope, he .says the s amie practice prevails; and from both of these places the wool exported is equal, and in some instances superior in quality to the mere no. The statements here given' Mr. President, we have carefully considered, and believe to be tread we submit them under he belief that if t importance of sheep husbandry was duly considered, especially by the districts. a. 509 lying north and contiguous to the mountains, much additional comfort and wealth might be added to that already delightful region/ .a; , :all which is respectfully submitted. R. F. Of    Mpson: Aotesince this report was read, I have been informed by Mr. Thomas. Loan, that his wool does not cost him more than five cents a pound and by Mr. Morris, at Dickens C. H., that for care, s hearing, &c, of a small flock of eight eyes, worth eight dollars- kept on: Cone, mountain, help did one had of the spring clipping, equal to three quarters of a pound per head, and that from them he had, after paying all expenses, near eightyonepournds of wool at thirty cents-three dollars and sixty cents, and eight lambs worth eight dollars-                             $11.60. And by Mr. Shepherd, a tenant on or. J. 0. Lewis' Amos a estate, that in 1846 he took with him from Green ville a few sheep, among which were four eyes, worth       $4.00They had four. lambs, worth $ 4 00 Thinks he shared three pounds per head, but   ;say two, which is 8 pounds at 20 its. 1 60- 5 60 n 1846, from eight shared 14 pounds wool at 20 its. 2 80 And had eight lambs worth 7 00- 9 80                              $1540 Salt and s hearing was the only expense' He he only offerd to feed them once in the two years, and then they refused to taste corn shelled to them. H. Ancrum Of Wool Mattresses. Asi    Ley, Like county, To. Fool mat tresses, the best material and the only one that ought to be used or bed dig for all ages and all ranks The object of this paper is to prove that wool mat tresses make thehealthibst, the warmest, the most luxurious, the cheapest, and the most economical bed that can be made, and that it is superior to any, other material for a bed for men, women and children, for all ages and sexes, and that man recovers much sooner from fatigue on such a bed than on any other. The human species are obliged to repair by sleep and repose the fatigues of the body, every sixteen hours at least, so that even the laborious pass more than a third of their lives in 'bed; the idle, fashionable and luxurious, and women, nearly half their time; and children, in health, sleep most of their time. Theromans used to sleep in the day, and had particular rooms distinct from their bed chambers where they slept in the day, and in I talk and southern countries, that practice is still continued; therefore, it is of the utmost importance what kind of bed we lie upon, the harder the bed, in reason, the wealthier we are. Fool mat tresses give this hardness and firmness, at the same time yield sufficiently to the pressure of our bodies and form an agreeable and luxurious bed, and wool does not make marks on the skin or relax as other bedding. In the old accounts of the court of England there is a charge on a journey for so many bundles of clean straw for the queens ied ; then it was said when men slept on straw with a log of wood for their pillows, they were men of iron, and ran  w they sleep on feather beds and down pillows, they are men of straw. All great men, warriors, heroes 510 X. c, who have made any noise in the world have always slept on a hard bed, from Charles Of I .a, to Napoleon.  Chemically, wool is the best for bedding, wool flannel, and all substances made of wool, keep our bodies warm; they are composed of a rare and spongy mass, the fibres of which touch each other so slightly that the heat moves slowly through their interstices, and wool retains its heat better than any other material, and does not strike so cold. People may be convinced of the impropriety of lying long in bed, by knowing that a sound man in onenightdf seven hours' sleep generally perspires fifty ounces avoirdupois or four pounds troy weight; we cannot wonder at that since there are above three hundred thousand millions of pores in the body of a middle sized man, and that in the last hours of sleep one perspires most; hence the impropriety and the weakness of lying too long in a soft bed and the necessity of lying on a comparative hard elastic bed, such as a wool mattress. In France wool mat tresses are generally adopted, consequently you never meet with a bad bed there. I have travelled all over France and never met with a bad bed, and a very recent intelligent American traveller of great observation, mentions on his removal from England to France, that he found the French beds delicious because the beds are wool mat tresses. M1lode of Taking a Fool . Mattressthe first thing to constitute a good healthy bed is, that it must be absolutely flat, therefore all bedsteads should have wooden baths instead of sac king, which always gives and forms a hollow the wool is carded by hand, and all knots and extraneous matter taken out, the great point is to make it thick enough. The best bed I slept in, in my life, had sixty pounds of wool in it, but the bed was a very large extra size half that quantity will make a small bed, but if you wish to lie luxuriously, yet hard, do not stint the wool, that makes all, this difference; it lasts forever the covering is washed once a year; the wool is carded and a few pounds of wool added, and the bed is sweet and new. However luxuriously he may be, let any gentleman have a good wool mattress made, and let him ride forty or fifty miles and thoroughly fatigue himself, he will then know the value of such a bed. My object is so to increase the home consumption of our wool. There are twenty odd millions in the United States; say five to each .family, four millions; say three beds to each family, taking the whole population twelve millions; say thirty pounds of wool to each bed, three hundred and sixty millions of pounds of wool; say thirty-four millions of sheep in the United States, say, eighty million pounds of wool; this will consume more than four years' clip of our wool. This ought to be promulgated to increase the consumption of our wool, and such wool as cannot be sold abroad. I n dependent of the benefit to all in their health who adopt wool mat tresses on account of their cleanliness and durability, in; the end, they -are cheaper than any other bedding. Flannel Manufactures of Woolhome market for Fool, l cf the necessity of all the world wearing flannel, and of the importance of the manufacture of flannel to the United States and the consumption of that kind of wool that cannot find a market abroad. Very thing that encourages our woollen manufacture is of the greatest importance. Very thing that increases the home consumption of our wool is of national importance. Very thing that will promote the general health of our people is equally of national importance. In this change able and vigorous climate in inner, if all the world were to wear flannel, particularlynarrowchested and delicate females, it would be of the greatest benefit to x. a. 511 their health and save them many a fit of sickness; if this flannel, as it ought to be, is manufactured in the United States, it will not only increase our woollen manufactures but create a large home market for' our wool, and such wool as cannot be sold abroad. When we consider how cheap the English sell their Each flannel, it ought to stimulate our manufacturers; I must however observe, that I never purchased any flannel in the Unitedstates equal to the real Each flannel, or that did not shrink, or that wore near so long as the English flannel. The English flannel has a k nap on both sides, which renders it warm and soft, and it w ashes soft to the last. The United States flannel that I have used w ashes harsh, and the wear is not near so agreeable as real Each flannel, but surely, all these difficulties can be overcome by our people, and they can make as good flannel as the best Each flannel. Considering the great national benefit it would be in point of health, i four people would all wear flannel next to their skin, I propose to repeat some observations of Dr. Lacks, because I think they cannot be improved, which, if generally known, may induce them to adopt it t is well known that woollen clothes' such as flannels, worn next the skin promote insensible perspiration. May not this arise principally from the strong attraction which subsists between wool and the watery vapor which is continually issuing from the human body, That it does not depend entirely on the warmth of that covering is clear, for this one degree of warmth produced by wearing more clothing of a different kind does not produce the same effect. The perspiration of the human body being absorbed by a covering of flannel, it is immediately distributed through the whole thickness of that substance, and by this means exposed by a very large surface to be carried off by the atmosphere, and the <a name="loss76"><mark>loss</mark></a> of the watery vapor which the flannel sustains on the one, side by evaporation being immediately restored from the other in consequence of the strong attraction between the flannel and this vapor, the pores of the skin are dis encumbered, and they are continually surrounded with a dry and salubrious atmosphere. It is astonishing that the custom of wearing flannel next the skin should not have prevailed more universally, it is certain it would prevent a number of diseases, and there certainly is no greater luxury then the comfortable sensation which arises from wearing it after one is accustomed to it. It is a mistaken notion that it is too warm clothing for summer, it may be worn in the hottest climates, at all seasons of the year without the least inconvenience arising from wearing it. It is the warm bath of a perspiration confined by a linen ~shirt, wet with sweat, which renders the summer heats of southern climates so insupportable; but flannel promotes perspiration and favors its evaporation, and evaporation, as it is well known produces positive cold. I can touch for the truth of every word of this. I wear the same kind of flannel all summer as I do in winter with sleeves; when I Ke extra exercise and perspire freely, my body and flesh is always cool and comfortable, and in part I owe it to wearing flannel that I have never had either fever or ague in this western country, which is full of it. All this may appear trivial, and sanitary rules are disregarded, but it is all of the utmost importance and to all. May fifteen millions of our people wear flannel next their skin, and three flannel waistcoats to each, that is forty-five millions of waistcoats, at two yards each not enough with sleeves as they ought to be made) ninety millions of yards cf flannel in waistcoats only. Old people, delicate women and children, and above all, consumptive people, ought all to wear flannel drawers as well512Ex. was a flannel waistcoat; if this was adopted the great sickness that prevails in the United States, would be must diminished. Men drink spirituous liquors to increase thee animal heat, and feel that glow that is called comfortable. Met them wear flannel next their skin instead and keep the body warm and the head cool. Experi Ments Of The Vari Ous Plants Of Of  Nnaeus. A trial respecting the indigenous plants of Sweden was made by Linnseus, and the result of his experiments was published in a paper entitled an Sueecus, printed in the second volume of the Amcenitates Academic e. It was written in Latin, and we have never met with it in an English dress, except in a magazine nearly one hundred years old, from whence we have taken some of the most interesting facts. Linnaeus first conceived the design from observations made by him in his Dalecarlian journey, in which he found that his horses left untouched among other plants, meadow sweet, great wild vale ran, lily of the valley, angelic a, rose bay, willow herb, marshcinquefoil, mountain crow foot, c rains bill, globe crow foot, yellow wolf s bane and various shrubs. Soon after his return he with many of his pupils set about the work. Above 2,300 experiments were made upon the horned cattle, goats, sheep, horses and hogs, many of which were repeated ten, and some twenty times over, with the sole view of determining what kinds of vegetables those several animals would eat, or reject. Are was taken, as far as circumstances would permit, to render the experiments as accurate as possible. The plants were all fresh gathered, not bruised in the getting, nor offered to the cattle when they were either almost famished or gutted with variety, nor yet in the spring time, when many of them greedily devour almost any vegetable they can get at, and which at another they will not touch. The plants also in many instances were offered to several individuals of the same species. The trials were made only with the indigenous plants of Sweden. From the experiments it appeared that horned cattle would eat only 276 species, and rejected 218; goats eat of 449 kinds, and refused but 126; sheep eat of 387, and refused 141 horses eat of 262 species and refused 212. And of those which were offered to swine they eat of 72 species and refused 171. The whole number of plants embraced in the list is 485, and they area ranged in the Linnean. orders. The figure (1) is made use of to signify that the plant was eaten by the animal. Two. units (11) denote that the animal is very fond of the plants. A cap her (0) denotes the plant to have been rejected by the animal. A unit and cap her thus (10) or thus (01) denotes that the plant is sometimes used, and sometimes rejected by the animal. The horizontal stroke (a) signifies that no opportunity occurred of trying the plant upon the animal. The names of the plants both English and botany cal are added, and also the natural places of growth of the plants, with occasional notes sub joined. Any of these have probably become disused and others in modern times have been substituted for them, but we have transcribed them as they are given in old en time. 0. stands for oxen, G. for goats.

The want of ready and cheap access to foreign markets, led the settlers of the western states to raising hogs and dis tilling whiskey, as a convenient means of taking corn, their great staple, in these shapes to market. To comprehend this subject thoroughly, a glance at the following table will benecessaryExports of I indian Worn from the United States for fifty seven years. Total exports of corn and corn meal This table is published in this connection to show how small a proportion of the crop of this, the most important of all our cereal products, finds it sway in the shape of grain and meal to foreign countries. This will be rendered apparent by the returns of the corn crop of the United States. Thisex. a. 525 was by the census of 1840, 377,531,857 bushels. The patent office report estimates the crop of 1845, at 450,000,000 bushels. The crop of 1846; as far as can be ascertained appears to have exceeded500000000 bushels. The present crop 1847, is not yet gathered, but from the extent of ground cultivated in this article, the present year under the late stimulus of high prices and a demand limited only by the means of getting it to our seaports, and with the advantage of weather uncommonly favorable alike to its growth and ripe king, not less than 700,000,000 bushels may be expected as the yield of the United States for the present year. The corn raised in reference to the whiskey market is independent of that which is fed to hogs, no price that can be paid by the distillers affording adequate regeneration to growers of corn who have to transport it far by land carriage. Cincinnati being the business centre of an immense corn growing and how raising region, is in fact the principal pork market in the United States, and without even the exceptions of Work or Belfast, I re land, the largest in the world. The business of putting up pork here for distant markets, is of some twenty-six years' standing, but it is only since 1833, that it has sprung into much importance. The following table furnishes a list of hogs put up each year since, including that of 1833, and the prices at which the market opened. The season begins in November and ends in March. Each year refers to that in which business closed. Table. Dear. No. of Dogs. Price. Dear. No. of Dogs. Price1i illinois, 136,709 67,964 68,120I indianad The hogs raised for this market, are generally a cross of I wish Brazier, By field, Berkshire, Russia and China, in such proportions as to unite the qualifications of size, tendency to fat and beauty of shape to the hams. They are driven in at the age of from eleven to eighteen months old, in general although a few reach greater ages. The hogs run in the woods until within five or six weeks of killing time, when they are turned into the corn fields to fatten. If the a corns and beach nuts are abundant they require less corn, but the flesh and fat although hardened by the corn is not as firm as when they are turned into the corn fields, in a less thriving condition during years when must as it is called is less abundant. From the 8th to the 10th of November, the pork season begins and the hogs are sold by the farmers direct to the packers, when the quantity they own justified it. Some of these farmers drive in one season, as high as one thousand head of hogs into their fields. From an hundred and fifty to three hundred are more common numbers, however, where less than an hundred are owned, they are bought up by d rovers until a sufficient number is gathered for a drove. The hogs are driven into pens adjacent to the respective slaughter houses. As soon after the dr over or farmer sells to the packer, the hogs are put into small pens where they are crowded as thick as they can stand, and a hand walks over the drove knocking them on the head successively, with a two pointed hammer adapted to the purpose. They are then dragged out by hooks into the sticking room, where there throats are cut, the blood passing through a drain or fewer below into large tanks prepared to receive it. The blood is saved to be sold together with the hoofs and hair, to the manufacturers of prussia te of potash and prussian blue. Adjacent to the sticking room, are the scalding troughs which are heated by steam. These troughs are of one thousand gallons capacity each. After being scalded the hogs are tossed by machinery on to a long bench, as many persons getting to work on a how as can get round it. One cleans out the ear, which work must be done while the how is seeking with steam, others pull off the bristled and hair which are thrown on the floor, others again scrape the animal. When these operations are through his hind legs are stretched open with a stick called a gabriel and the how is borne off by three men, two of whom carry the front part on their crossed hands and the other seizes the gabriel by which he carries to the proper place and slings the how to a hook which suspends him from the floor. Were the animal falls intothe hands, of the gutter, who tears out the in sides, stripping at the rate of three hogs to the minute. The slaughter houses of Cincinnati are in the outskirts of the city, are ten in number, and fifty by one hundred and thirty feet each in extent, the frames being boarded up with move able last ice work at the sides which is kept open to admit air in the ordinary temperature, but is shut up during the intense cold which occasionally attends the packing season, so no ills shall not be frozen so stiff that it cannot be cut up to advantageihesc esai3ishmnents employ each, as high as one hundred hands selected for thus business, which requires both strength and activity and always commands high wages. Give minor points in this state not ascertained and included in this list, are supplied by estimate in table Six. a. 527 The slaughtereds formerly got the gut fat for the whole of the labor thus described, wagoning the hogs more than a mile to the pork houses free of expense to the owners. Very year, however, enhances the value of theperquisites, such as the fat, heart, liver, &c, for food, and the hoofs, hair c, for manufacturing purposes. For the last two years from ten to twenty-five cents per how have been paid as a bonus for the privilege of killing. The hauling of hogs from the slaughter house to the packers, is itself a large business, employing fully fifty of the largest class of wagons, each loading from sixty to one hundred and ten hogs at a load. The hogs are taken into the pork houses from the wagons and piled un in rows as high as possible. These piles are generally close to the scales. Another set of hands carry them to the scales, where they are usually weighed singly for the advantage of the draft. They a retaken hence to the blocks where the head and feet are first struck off, each blow needing no repetition. The how is then c love n into three parts, separating the ham and shoulder ends from the middle. These are again divided into single hams, shoulders, and sides. The leaf is then torn out, and every piece is distributed with the exactness and regularity of machinery, to its appropriate pile. The tender loins, usually two pounds to the how, are sold to the manufacturers of sausages. The how thus cut up into shoulders, hams, and middlings, undergoes further trimming to get the first two articles in proper shape. The size of the hams and shoulders varies with their appropriate markets, and with the price of land, which, when high, tempts the p utter up of pork to trim very close, and indeed to render the entire shoulder into land. If the pork is intended to be shipped off in bulk, or for the smoke house, it is piled up in vast masses, covered with fine salt in the proportion of fifty pounds salt to two hundred pounds weight of meat. If otherwise, the meat is packed away in barrels with coarse and fine salt in due proportions no more of the latter being employed than the meat will require for immediate absorption, and the coarse salt. remaining in the barrel to renew the pick le whose strength is withdrawn by the meat in process of time. The different classes of cured pork, packed in barrels, are made up of the different sizes and conditions of hogs the finest and fattest making clear and mess pork, while the residue is put up into prime pork or bacon. The inspection laws require that clear pork shall be put up of the sides with the ribs out. It takes the largest class of hogs to receive this brand. Messporkall sides, with two lumps to the barrel. Crime for this pork of lighter weight will suffice. Two shoulders, two jowls, and sides enough to fill the barrel, make the contents. 200 pounds of meat is required by the inspector, but one hundred and ninety-six pounds, packed here, it is ascertained, will weigh out more than the former quantity in the eastern or southern markets. The mess pork is used for the commercial marine and the United States navy. This last class, again, is put up somewhat differently, by specifications made out for the purpose: The prime is packed for ship use and the southern markets. The clear pork goes out to the cod and mackerel fisheries. The, New Englanders, in the line of pickled pork, buy nothing short of the best. Bulk pork is that which is intended for immediate use or for smoking. He former class is sent off in flat boats for the lower Mississippi. It forms as important element of the whole, the great mass being sent into the smoke528Ex. houses, each of which will cure a hundred and seventy-five thousand to five hundred thousand pounds at a time. Were the bacon, as far as possible, is kept until it is actually wanted for shipment, when it is packed in hogs heads containing from eight to nine hundred pounds, the hams, sides and shoulders put up each by themselves. The bacon is sold to the iron manufacturing regions of Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Ohio to the fisheries of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, and to the coast or Mississippi region above New Orleans. Large quantities are disposed of also for the consumption of the Atlantic cities. Flat boats leave here about the first of July, and they all take down more or less bacon for the coast trade. For the purpose of farther illustrating the business I have been describing, I shall take the operations of the present season, 1847 1848, although the quantity of hogs which will be put up here cannot be ascertained with exactness for some weeks yet. There is little doubt that an estimate of four hundred and twenty- thousand, by far the largest quantity ever yet put up in Cincinnati, will not be beyond the actual fact. This increase partly results from the growing importance of the city as a great how market, for reasons which will be made apparent in a later page, but more particularly to the vast enlargement in number and improved condition of hogs throughout the west, consequent in this years unprecedented harvest of corn. What this increase is may be inferred from the official registers of the hogs of Ohio, returned to the auditor of state as subject to taxation, being all those of andover six months in age. These were one million seven hundred and fifty thousand, being an excess of twenty-five per cent, or three hundred and fifty thousand hogs, over those of' the previous year. Those of Kentucky, whence come most of our largest hogs, as well as a considerable share of our supplies in i this article, will exhibit a proportionate increase, while the number in I n diana and I illinois must greatly exceed this ratio of progress. If there be four lain dred and twenty thousand hogs cut up here during the present season, the product in the manufactured article will be 150 000 Bls. Pork21000000 lbs. Bacon13800000 " Hard. These are the products thus far of the pork houses' operations alone. That is to say, the articles thus referred to are put up in these establishments, from: the hams, shoulders, sides, leaf land, and a small portion of thejowlsthe residue of the car cases, which are taken to the pork houses, leaving them to enter elsewhere into other departments of manufacture. The relative proportions in weight of bacon and land rest upon probabilities. An unexpected demand and advance in price of land would greatly reduce the disparity if not in vert the proportion of these two articles. A change in the prospects of the value of pickled pork, during the progress of packing, would also reduce or increase the proportion of barrelled pork to the bacon and land. The land made here is exported in packages for the Havana market, where besides being extensively used, as in the United States, for cooking, it answers the purpose to which butter is applied in this country. It is shipped to the Atlantic markets also, for local use as well as for export to England and France, either in the shape it leaves this market or in land oil, large quantities of which are manufactured at the east There is one establishment here, which, besides putting up hams, &c extensively, is engaged in extracting the grease from the rest of the how. X. a. 529 his will probably the present year operate upon thirty thousand hogs. I that seven large circular tanks-six of capacity to hold each fifteen thousand pounds, and one to hold six thousand pounds all gross. These receive the entire car case with the exception of the hams, and the mass is subjected to steam process under a pressure of seventy pounds to the square inch, the effect of which operation is to reduce the whole to one consistence, and every bone to powder. The fat is drawn off by cocks, and the residue m, a mere earthy substance, as far as made use of, is taken away for manure. Besides the hogs which reach this factory in entire car cases, the great mass of heads, ribs, back bones, tail pieces, feet, and other trimmings of the hogs, cut up at different pork houses, are subjected to the same process, in order to extract every particle of grease. This concern alone will turn out this season three million six hundred thousand pounds land, five-sixths of which is No. 1. Nothing can sur pass the purity and beauty of this land, which is refined as well as made under steam processes. Six hundred hogs per day pass through these tanks one day with another. I come now to the manufacture of land oil, which is accomplished by dive sting the land of one of its constituent partsstearine. There are probably thirty land oil factories here on a scale of more or less importance. The largest of these, whose operations are probably more extensive than any other in the United States, has manufactured heretofore into land oil andstearine, one hundred and forty thousand pounds monthly all the year round. The great increase of hogs for the present season will probably enlarge that business this year fifty per cent. Eleven million pounds of land will be run into land oil this year, two-sevenths of which aggregate will make s tearing, the residue land oil, or in other words, twenty-four .thousand barrels of land oil, of forty to fortytwogallons each. The oil is exported to the Atlantic cities and foreign countries. Such the larger share of this is of inferior land made of must fed and still fed hogs, and the material, to a great extent, comes from a distance, making no part of these tables. Hard oil, besides being sold for what it actually is, enters largely in the eastern cities into the adult e ration of spermoil, and in France serves to reduce the cost of olive oil.  The skill of the French chemists enables them to incorporate from sixty-five to seventy percent. of land oil with that of the olive. The presence of land oil can be detected, however, by a deposit of s tearing, small portions of which always remain with that article, and will be found at the bottom of the bottle. I now come to the star candles, made of the s tearing expressed from the land in the manufacture of land oil. The s tearing is subjected to hydraulic pressure, by which three-eighths of it is discharged as an impure ole in e. This last is employed in the manufacture of soap. Three million pounds ofstearine at least, have been made, in one year, into star candles and soap in these factories, and they are prepared to manufacture six thousand pounds candles per average day throughout the whole year. The manufacture of this year will probably approach that amount, as the present supply promises the raw material in abundance. From the slaughtereds the off al capable of producing grease goes to another description of grease extract ors, where are also taken hogs dying of <a name="disease141"><mark>disease</mark></a> or by accident, and meat that is spoiling through unfavorable weather or want of care. The grease tried out here goes into the soap manufacture. Hard grease is computed to form eighty per cent. of all the fat used in the making of soap. Of the ordinary soap one hundred thousandcid12734530 X. pounds are made weekly, equal at four cents per pound to two hundred thousand dollars per annum. This is exclusive of the finer soaps, and of soft soap, which are probably worth twenty-five per cent. more. Blue to an inconsiderable amount is made of the hoofs of the hogs. At the rear of these operations comes brittle dressing for the Atlantic markets. This business employs one hundred hands, and affords a product of fifty-five thousand dollars. Last of all is the disposition of what cannot be used for other purposes, the hair, hoofs and other off al. These are employed in the manufacture of prussia te of potash, to the product of which also contributes the cracklings orresiduum left on expressing the land. The prussia te of potash is used extensively in the print factories of New England, for coloring purposes. The blood of the hogs is manufactured into prussian blue. A brief re capitulation of the various manufactures out of the how at this point present :TableD150000 barrels pork. 1,875,000 pounds star cahdles21000000 pounds bacon. 5,200,000 " bar soap43800000 " No. 1 land 7,300,000 " fancy and soft soaps, 000 000 gallons land oil. 50,000 " prussia te of potash 420 000 hogs average, including seven pounds gut fat to each, eighty-four million pounds as the car case weight when dressed.

The value of all this depends of course on the foreign demand. Last year, the pork, bacon, land, land oil, star candles, soap, bristled, &c, exceeded six millions of dollars in value. This year it will probably reach eight millions. But for the reduced prices which a greatly increased product must create it would far exceed that value. The buildings in which the pork is put up, are of great extent and capacity and in ever part thoroughly arranged for the business. They generally extend from street to street, so as to enable one set of operations to be carried on without interfering with another. There are thirty of these establishments besides a number of minor importance. The stranger here during the packing and especially the for warding season of the article, becomes bewildered in the attempt to keep up with the eye and the memory the various and successive processes he has witnessed, in following the several stages of putting the how into its final market able shape, and in surveying the apparently interminable rows of days which at that period occupy the main avenues to the river in continuous lines going rd returning, a mile or more in length, excluding every other use of those streets, from daylight to dark. For is his wonder lessened when he surveys the immense quantity of legs heads of bacon, barrels of pork, and keg six. a. 531 of land for which room cannot be found on the pork house floors, extensive as they are and which are therefore, spread over the public landing and block up every vacant space on the side walks, the public streets and even adjacent lots otherwise vacant. It may appear remarkable, in considering the facilities for putting up polk which many other points in I illinois, I n diana, Ohio and Kentucky possess in their greater continuity to the neighborhoods which produce the hogs and other advantages which are palpable, that so large an amount of this business is engrossed at Cincinnati. It must be observed, however, that the raw material in this business (the how) constitutes sixty per cent. of the value when ready for sale, and being always paid for in cash, such. heavy disbursements are required in large sums, and at a days notice, that the necessary capital is not readily obtainable elsewhere in the west. For in an article, which in the process of *curing runs great risks in sudden changes of weather, can the packer protect himself, except where there are ample means in extensive supplies of salt, and any necessary force of coopers or laborers to put on in case of emergency or disappointment in previous arrange mints. More than all, the facilities of turning to account in various manufactures, or as articles of food in a populous community, what cannot be disposed of to profit elsewhere, renders hogs to the Cincinnati packer worth at least five per cent. more than they will command at any other point in the Mississippi valley. As a specimen of the amazing activity which characterizes all the details of packing, cutting, &c, here it may be stated, that two hands in one of our pork houses, in less than thirteen hours, cut up eight hundred and fifty V dogs, averaging over two hundred pounds each, two others placing them ,on the blocks for the purpose. All these hogs were weighed singly on the scales, in the course of eleven hours. Another hand trimmed the hams, (seventeen hundred pieces) in Cincinnati style, as fast as they were separated from the car cases. The hogs were thus cut up and disposed of at the rate of more than one to the minute. The price of pickled pork in the eastern markets varies greatly, as maybe seen by the following table of prices in New Work, during the last twenty-four yearsTableF. Average price per year fear.

Those who are cognizant to the importance of the domestic market will not be surprised to learn by the table of our exports of pork to foreign countries, the small proportion it forms to the quantity packed.

Bald well, Campbell, <a name="loss77"><mark>Loss</mark></a> and Entry, the oldest being nineteen months in age. The value of these manufacturing operations to Cincinnati' consists in the vast amount of labor they require and create and the circumstance that the great mass of that labor furnishes employment to thousands, at precisely the very season when their regular a vocations cannot be pursued. Thus there are perhaps fifteen hundred coopers engaged in and outside of the city, making land kegs, pork barrels and bacon hogs heads: the city coopers at a period when they are not needed on stock barrels and other cooper age, and the country coopers, whose main occupation is farming, during a season when the farms require no labor at their hands. When there is another large body of hands, also agriculturists, at the proper season, engaged getting out states and heading, and cutting hoop poles, for the same business. Last quantities of boxes of various descriptions are made for packing bacon, for the Savannah and European markets. Hard is also. packed to 'a great extent for export in tin cases or boxes, the making of which furnishes extensive occupation to the tin plate workers. X' a. 533 f we take into view farther that the slaughtering, the wagoning, the pork house labor, the rendering grease and land oil, the s tearing and soap factories, brittle dressing, and other kindred employments, supply abundant occupation to men, who in the' spring, are engaged in the manufacture and hauling of bricks, quarrying and hauling stone, cellar digging and walling, bricklaying, plastering and street having, with other employments, which in their very nature cease on the approach of winter, we can readily appreciate the importance of a business which supplies labor to the industry of probably six thousand individuals, who but for its existence would be earning little or nothing one third of the year. The United States census of 1840 gives 26,301,293, as the existing number of hogs of that date. The principal increase since is in the west owing to the abundance of corn there, and that quantity may be now safely enlarged to forty-five millions. This is about the number assigned to entire Europe in 1839, by Mcgregor, in his Commercial Dictionary, and theres probably no material increase there since, judging by the slow advance n that section of the world in productions of any kind. The number of hogs cut up in the valley of the Mississippi wail reached his year to one million five hundred thousand, of this it will be s en that   went-eight per cent. or over one-fourth of the whole quantity iv put up, or market in Cincinnati alone 534 X. a. Appendi X No. 16. Letter Of Hon. H. L. Ellsworthlafayette, I n diana, Dec. 15, 1847. Dear Fire intended to have given you a statement of the agricultural productions of this section of the country at an earlier day. I hasten, however, now to remark, that the quality of wheat is better than that of the last year, but the quantity will be much less, full one third; many fields were winter killed and ploughed up for corn. The corn crop is not an average one. The quantity of land planted was greater; while some fields produced a fair yield, others failed full fifty per cent. The drought of summer retarded the growth of the corn, and the early frosts prevented its coming to maturity. There will, nevertheless, in the aggregate, be a large amount for shipment. I have several hundred acres that will yield seventy-five to eighty-five bushels per acre, and this without hoping, simply sloughing three times; indeed, on a thousand acres cultivated in one farm, a he was not used this summer. The number of hogs fattened this year, in the Wabash valley is unusually great. 'these have consumed much corn that would otherwise have been shipped. The price of hogs last year, induced many to fatten what they could, and the market is gutted; pork weighing 200 pounds and upwards is        $2, and from that to                           $1.50. The price at the east does not justify such a reduction in the price of last year. Money is scarce salt and barrels also; hence packers have the command of the market, at their own prices. Some are trying up the car case, except the hams, and will, I think, do better than to sell at        $2 per hundred. Soon the rail road will be finished from Lafayette to the Ohio river, and this will enable us to obtain reasonable prices, de ducting the freight. During the summer I have been successfully raising barley and flax together. If forty-eight quarts of barley and sixteen quarts of flax seed to the acre are sowed in the spring, both w 11 grow well together, and ripe n at the same time, and give a good yield; his crop may be cut with a scythe and stacked. After being threshed, in a common thresher) the flax seed is easily separated, as it passes through the si eve. I wished to try the ,peri men for the seed of both, but more especially to ascertain the value c the straw or stem for coarse paper; it is said that one ton of the straw or stem will make fifteen hundred pounds of paper, worth    $70 per ton. I shall soon know the result, as the paper mill is working up the materials. If a substitute for the present hard material (old ropes, &c) can be furnished by the stem of flax, it will be a great desideratum gained. Battle eat the straw and stem greedily. I may justly remark, that the discovery of Mr. Men tz, in pulling grain, and thus preparing it for grinding, seems likely to produce an important benefit; three and a half bushels of wheat make a barrel of super fine flour there are one pound, six ounces of br an in a bushel of wheat. A better and cheaper article can be procured than hitherto. X. a. 536 Having been informed by Mr. Men tz of the process, I tried it on buckwheat, and in five minutes obtained a beautiful article, the merry being perfectly pulled. I will not enlarge, knowing your report must be limited. I add an experiment to test the value of cooked and un cooked food, with some observations on our great staple of the west swine, which, if you have room, may gratify strangers, and especially correspondents, to whose inquiries I cannot individually reply. With an ardent hope for the prosperity of the Patent Office, I remain, Hours, most respectfully, Henry L. Ellsworth. On. Edmund Burkke, Commissioner of Patents. Washington City. Experiments in Feeding, by Henry L. Ellsworth. In the 24th of May, 1847, I purchased four hogs, of the following weights to. 1 weighed 131 is, 4 oz. both together weighing 281 lbs, 8 oz." 3 'c 157 c c 4 " go 4 " 15 20 7 4 " both together weighing 277 lbs, 8 oz. I fed Los. 1 and 2, to each three and a half pounds of I indian meal cooked, making to both seven pounds per day. The food I prepared as follows: I took fourteen pounds of meal, enough for two days, wet this with cold water to prevent lumps; then put it into a five pail iron kettle (full of boiling water, stirring it well) covered over the kettle with a tight board let the must stand till morning; putting up dampers, the heat of the kettle and arches makes the mass boil for a long time without wood. In the 8th of June, fifteen days, No. 1 weighed 149 pounds, 13 ounces, a gain of 18 pounds, 9 ounces." 2 " 165 " 13 " " 15 " 9 c cloth together having gained 34 pounds, 2 ounces in fifteen days, and consumed 105 pounds of meal. If pork is worth 3 cents per pound gross, the gain in the hogs, viz. 34 pounds, 2 ounces, is                           $1.02, equal to very nearly 1 cent per pound for the meal, viz. 56 pounds per bushel, say 55 its. per bushel. No. 3, as above on the 24th of May, weighed. 157 lbs. 4 oz. No. 4, " " " " vi .a. 120 lbs. 4 oz. Both together weighing. 277 lbs. 8 oz. These I fed, on 14 lbs. of corn, 7 lbs. to each, per day, with water, on the 8th of June, fifteen days. No. 3, weighed 179 lbs. 13 oz gain, 22 lbs. 9 oz. No. 4, " .146 lbs. " 25 lbs. 12 oz. Both together, 48 lbs. 5 oz, in fifteen days. Both together consumed 210 lbs. of corn, just double the quantity of meal fed to the other two. The 48 lbs. 5 oz. of pork, at three cents per I b gross, amounts to                           $1.45 cents, making corn worth 38- cents per bushel of 56 lbs. The hogs had salt, generally, in cakes, composed of ashes, three parts clay, one part saturated with salt, a most excellent mode of salting all kinds of stock. Those fed on corn drank freely of water. Those that eat much would rarely drink any. After fifteen days the food was changed of twenty days; those, that previously had corn, lived on must, and vice versa. No. 3, was much affected by the too rapid change from dry corn to must, the stomach having been contracted by digestion, only required by the co an 536 X. 
centrated nourishment of dry corn, could not bear the sudden extension which must gave it, each how having about eight pounds of must three times per day, equal to twenty-four pounds per day. Were I may remark, also, what seems almost incredible, that fourteen pounds of good corn meal, thoroughly cooked, will make ninety pounds of must, so thick as not to run when taken out of the kettle. In the further experiment I omit No. 3,from the cause above, since being unwell, he did not gain over five pounds in twenty days. His case is added as a caution against too rapid change of diet. I proceed, therefore, with only the other three hogs, viz: Los. 1,2 and 4, and weighing as follows to. 1, weighed, on the 8th'of June, 149 lbs. 13 oz; on the 28th June 179 lb s gain, 29 lbs. 3 oz. No. 2, weighed, on the 8th of June, 165 I is. 13 oz; on 28th June, 189lbsgain, 23 lbs. 3 oz. Both together, having gained 52 lbs. 6 oz, in twenty days, and consumed, (at the rate of fourteen pounds per day) 280 lbs, equal to 52 lbs oz. of pork, at three cents per pound gross, as before, which gives                           $1.57,equal to thirty-one cents per bushel. This gain was less than the other experiment on corn, which is accounted for by the change of diet. No. 4,weighed, on the 8th of June, 146 lbs; on the 28th of June, 166 lbsgaintwenty pounds; just one pound per day. He consumed seventy pounds o meal, cooked twenty pounds of pork, at three cents per pound gross, amounts to sixty cents; making the corn ground and cooked, worth forty-eight cents per bushel. Had not No. 4 suffered somewhat by a too rapid change of diet from corn to must, he would, doubtless, have made the second experiment with the meal equal to the first experiment. Taking both experiments together, which is hardly fair, as the exchange from highly concentrated food to that far more expensive, is disadvantageous more so than from expensive to concentrated, raw food is, to the cooked food, as 68 to 103, making the gain, by cooking, about fifty-five per cent. over un cooked food or, three bushels of meal, cooked, is .equal to four and a half bushels of dry, hard corn. I tis generally estimated, that if corn is cut up and fed to hogs that fifteen bushels will fatten each one that is, give one hundred pounds of flesh. If hogs, at gross weight, should be worth -3 per hundred, this would make corn worth just twenty cents per bushel. The hogs, in this case, were not confined in pens. If confined in pens; dry corn is worth thirty cents, and meal, cooked as above, is worth over fifty cents; so that there is a gain, by grinding and cooking, over feeding in the field, of one hundred and fifty per cent. The expenses, however, are to be deduced, and these depend on the price of wages, wood and filling. I am about to try Bogardusmill, which, it is said, will, with two horses, grind three hundred bushel of corn and cob in a day. I further design to fix the mill so that the meal will fall into a tub or vat, where the grist, (corn and cob) can be cooked by steam, supplying the boiler and tub with water from a spring, am king the must just thin enough to run from the tub into troughs, thus avoiding all labor in drawing water or carrying the food. If one fifth is deduced for off a, which is a fair estimate, net pork, at          $3.50, per hundred, is about equal to three cents, gross, or it is, as two hundred and eighty is to three hundred. I am about making further experiments to test the value of feeding corn on the stalk, after being cut up, and also by turning, hogs into the fiew t. X. by present impression is, -that the most profitable way to feed corn, all things considered, is to cut the corn as soon as it begins to turn hard; then hogs will eat corn, cob and stalk; then, too, the weather is mild, and swine will thrive much faster in September, October and November, than in December, January and February. There land is cheap and easily tilled, and labor dear, as in the west, it may be best to make hogs their own harvesters. Thus, prepare c lover, oats, early corn and buckwheat, and let hogs eat them in succession. Eye, also, may be raised. The advantages of rye for stock has been under rated. It is a better improve r of land, if fed off, than oats; its roots are thicker and grow deeper: it affords nourishment, (if sown in August) f roth November until the autumn of the following year. Young, green rye has one great advantage over green wheat or green oats: the two last are apt to scour stock, while rye is more nourishing without the relaxing qualities. Some highly respectable farmers prefer rye to c lover. One thing is certain, rye can be sowed upon new land successfully, when c lover would fail rye can be scattered before the last sloughing of corn; in this way, calves can be wintered cheaper than in any other manner. Dogs will thrive remarkably well on green rye, and fatten on it when ripe. Taking, therefore, all things into consideration, rye should be placed much higher than it now is, in the' comparative scale of valuable fodder plants. But to return to the subject of field feeding of hogs. I mentioned the preparation of various crops, as c lover, oats, early corn and buckwheat, to be fed upon in succession by the swine. These crops will last till the ordinary field corn is ripe enough. If a move able fence is provided to confine hogs to a small quantity, little is lost by field feeding, unless the weather is wet, when so much will be tramped in, that it is advisable to feed corn cut up and carried to a dry lot, where there is water. There is a general mistake in putting in oats too late. It is well to plough the ground in the fall, when work on the farm does not press, and then seize the first moment to harrow in the oats in the spring. If peas are added to the oats, as' was practised or i the North River, N. Y., when pork was the great staple there, it would be an improvement at the west. A great error likewise has been committed in giving hogs too much age. At the west, hogs average over twenty months, thus subjecting the owner to the expense of wintering; at this age their average is net two hundred and fifty pounds. , More than half the fat made is run off by labor and travel little food is allowed in winter and less in the fall and spring, and the hogs have to work for a living. In many cases they get stinted and never recover. It may here be mentioned that pig pork is worth more for domestic use or for shipment to England and France, than pork from older hogs. I need a pig should be kept constantly growing and ought (and will, if properly attended) to increase one pound a day till killed, at ten or eleven months old, when he will weigh three hundred pounds if the breed is good, The doctrine that the breed is in the trough is not wholly correct good hogs must be also fed, but there is as i such (if not more) difference in hogs as cattle as to taking on fat, I have some so much inclined to fatten that it is difficult to reduce the mi sufficiently for bleeders if they were placed even in corn' i short pasture. Dogs to fatten best should not know what liberty is, t. y should have a warm dry bed their feed at regular hours, and insufficient quantities. As soon as the meal is over they then lie down and, rest till the next feeding time comes round. Pushing hogs however only 538 X. to those intended for early killing; if extraordinary weight is desired, pigs should not be confined too closely or be too highly fed for the first year room and moderate exercise is favorable to the growth of bone and muscle. A pig that has been pampered for one year, will if taken then fall far below one of the same weight that has not been crowded if both are allowed the same diet afterwards. I cannot omit to notice a fatal error among farmers in hazarding all by new crosses. Any of the first breeds in this and other sections of the country have been spoiled by mixtures with the Berkshire, for while a cross with the Berkshire and the Good breed of hogs could not but improve the stock, an equal improvement has not followed in crossing the former with the improved kinds. When a good breed has been obtained it should be kept till there is a certainty of getting a better. Crosses often do not improve stock, the experiment should be first made with a few hogs. There is. another important fact to be attended to. It is desirable to breed in and in, for one or two litters, until the breed becomes established. One cross may produce an improvement in the appearance of the pigs, but their progeny may partake fully of the male or female, neither of which is wanted. The great deter i oration in hogs does not follow so much from breeding in and in as from injury to the male by excessive indulgence. The male should be kept up and not allowed more than one or two connections if farmers would be particular on this, point, they will have better hogs ind also find that the number of bear pigs will be increased fifty per cent. such is the result of experiments in Europe as most fully tested. After a full consideration of the subject I am satisfied that stock raising at the west is much more profitable than growing small grain indeed an examination of the present circumstances in the northwestern states shows a vast difference in the wealth of the braziers over those who crop with grain. The profits of wheat appear well in expectation on papers, but this prospect is blasted by a severe winter, appearance of insects, a want of harvesting, bad weather in harvesting, in threshing, for there are few barns at the west, or transporting to market, and lastly, a fluctuation of the market itself. Someone of these is likely to happen, for very fortunate is that farmer who escapes them all. There is too another very important fact to be noticed. Constant dropping of corn and small grain carried from the field will of course diminish gradually, at least, the fertility, and the farm is at length worn out. In the contrary, by feeding the crop on the land, the farm every year grows better. I am making several experiments with stock, but shall not be able to complete them in time for your report this year, I have now on my farm one hundred breeding sows, which are expected to produce six hundred pigs in March and April; these I design to fatten by January, 1849, s paying the old sows and killing them at the same time as the pigs, reserving one hundred young sows (also a few extraordinary old ones) to stock the farm for another year. This mode of farming enables me to gather my rent from distant farms with the least trouble and most profit, as I can notify the tenant when the rent gathereds are coming and so continuing the collection of rent, leaving the farm nearest market till the last. It may seem to eastern men incredible that such amounts of corn can be raised or purchased so cheap. It costs 2 50 to          $3 per acre to hire land tilled in corn the crop averages fifty bushels; thus making the corn in the field six cents per bushel, inclusive of rent of ground, which to a purchaser is ver vex. a. 539 inconsiderable. One young man with two horses will tend easily forty acres, and raise two thousand bushels by three and a half months labor. I mentioned in a former letter (published in your agricultural report of 1845) that I had six teams (five yoke of cattle to each) to break up the sod without any help but one boy to drive, the plough being fastened to a short axle, so as to graduate the depth of furrow or to keep the plough in a proper position; two boys attending upon the six teams, to drop the corn which was covered by the soft his gave a sod crop without tending of thirty to forty bushels per acre; I wish now to say that with two stout horses I have this year broken up two acres per day of similar land, by using a steel plough, called the " Chicago Slipper." The chief advantage of it is the angle of the <a name="mould27"><mark>mould</mark></a> board and its smoothness. In very hard soil three horses may be required to do the work of five yoke of cattle, with the old plough. The Chicago Slipper is not a patented article and is therefore open to all. I have requested Mr. Quarrel of Geneva, to improve upon it by adding his friction roller 540 X. a. Appendi X No. 17. Of 'THE Proporti  Ons Of Nutri Ment Of The Means Of Of  Of   Of. By Dr. Laser. Translated from the German by E. Good rich Smith. According to a memorial presented to the French minister, 100 pounds of wheat bread on average contain 30 pounds of nutrition elements, (glutenwith starch) Black bread much less 100 pounds of flesh on average 31 pounds of nutrition, (according toWohler) fresh flesh seventy-seven per cent. water, the remaining solid substance, (fibrin e 100 pounds of French beans, on an average, contain eighty per cent. nutrition 100 pounds of peas twenty-three per cent 100 pounds of lent is ninety-four per cent Vegetable case in and Starch 100 pounds of bees pulse eight per cent 100 pounds of carrots fourteen per cent Vegetable albumen with Sugar 100 pounds of potatoes twenty-five per cent. Vegetable albumen, Starch and Sugaraccording to this we disagree with many erroneous views and prejudices in reference to the effect of the most known means of food. Flesh for example is not the most nutritions food, butlentils. Farinaceous food gives more nutriment than flesh. To meal is richer in glum ten, and therefore morenutritive than wheat flour. Heat bread is also more v satisfactory than black bread. The nutrition power of lent is is well known, as also that bean meal gives a very nutritions power baked with bread. To slaves and prisoners, are daily given in the east comparatively small portions of beans, by which they are perfectly supported. The whiter and finer the beans, so much the better, and the more nutritions, and. so the. more to be recommended to the poor. The wheat bread of the French and Americans is more sustaining than the Westphalians rye bread, and our black bread, in spite of all the in bred preferences for the same by our countrymen. Eggs are chiefly nutritions for their albumen; the york contains of it 17 per cent. (together with 29 per cent. of oil and 54 per cent. of water) and the outer white 12 to 14 per cent. of albumen dissolved in water. Among the usual vegetables as above, potatoes are the most nutritions. But with one pound of lent is we can supply the place of three pounds of flesh; the increased culture of which would therefore well repay the trouble. Means, too, in respect to their actual value, are reckoned much too small. The prevailing farinaceous food, indeed, on account of respiration, ought to be connected with juice vegetable fruits, Silk, especially skin milk, deprived of its fatty parts, nourished by means of its, proportion of case in. Sweet milk is sufficient for young creatures as the single means of sustenance, for the production of all the parts of the body, and by means of it six. a. 541 sugar to keep up perfectly the respiration. To cheese (the substance freed from the they, containing sugar of milk) is deficient as a supply for respiration, on which account it is properly eaten with bread and butter; otherwise it nourished uncommonly. An likewise could live on mere vegetable fruit, although the formation of his teeth, consisting of cutters and grinders, indicates the mixed nature of food suitable for him. When in times of scarcity and need it comes to still hunger and to refresh the life, without regarding the good taste of the food we ought to have a reference mainly to the diffusion and consumption of the above denoted and so effective god fruits. The delusion that the drinking of beer, wine and brandy gives nourishment and strength, which induces the poor man in the midst of his necessity to give a couple of kreutzers for it, in place of procuring good white bread for his money, may still induce the conviction that a liquid with mere spirit of wine and some portion of sugar, is in the highest degree warming and exciting; but it can never nourish; for how should it do so? Beer, with its escaping proportion of glum ten, cannot, therefore, be regarded as particularly nutritions; its sugar, in case of strong draughts, makes men fat indeed, while it fills up with fat but cannot add to food 542 X. a.

Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patentssirthis cast iron grain, coffee and spice mill was invented, about three years since, by a Mr. Swift, of But chess county, New Work, and is considered one of the most useful and economical machines for the farmer and planter, that has been got up for some time. The plates are of cast iron, and will generally last to grind from 500 to 1000 bushels. Whepworn out, new plates can be substituted, which will grind an equal quantity The grain, coffee or spice falls from the hop per among coarse teeth set on a spiral shaft, which, revolving rapidly, break it up, and then pass it between plates which can be screwed up to grind to any required fine ness. The cast iron mill is suitable for grinding rice, corn, wheat, rye, barley, oats, peas, l beans, or any other kind of grain into meal; but it does not flour wheat and rye well, because it cuts the grain with its iron teeth, without washing it, as when run between stones. It is also suitable for ondingspices of all kinds. The advantages of the cast iron over the stone in. are the following: 1st. I to cost is only about one third as much. 2d. It never needs' dressing. 3d. When the plates are worn out they can be supplied by new ones, at a trifling cost. 4th. It is of so light weight that it is easily transported, and can be had with or without the frame.

In estimating the domestic consumption of grains in the United States during the present year, we begin, first, with 'the quantity of each kind used for seed. Rid, in relation to this item of consumption, it is proper to re lark, that we have taken for the basis of our calculations, the estimates of intelligent practical agriculturists, residing in different parts of the Union, to whom we have personally applied for information. -taking due allow 35 546 X. dance for different localities, soils and climates, it is believed, they may be relied upon as very nearly accurate Whole Quantity Amount after quantity raised. used for seed. de ducting seed.

For wheat we have allowed in the proportion of one bushel of seed to ten bushels of grain produced. Of rye one bushel to eight; and of buckwheat one bushel to sixteen. These proportions of seed to the quantities produced are greater than those allowed by the statistical writers of France, for the crops of that country, and less than those allowed in England. As oats are not used for human food in this country, we have not included that crop in the table above. The proportion, however, of need to the quantity produced, is about one bushel to twenty. Thus, after de ducting from the crops of the various grains used for bread stuffs in the United, States, in 1847, the quantity used for seed, 672,691,220 bushels remain for the use of men and animals, and for exportation to foreign countries. In estimating the consumption of bread stuffs, English and French writers usually allow five bushels of wheat to each individual. In this country, I indian corn enters largely into the consumption of nearly every class of the community. It is the principal food of the slave population, and is consumed in much greater proportion than wheat, by the agricultural population of the New England states. The general use, therefore, of I indian corn, in the United States, as an article of human food, very much reduces the quantity of wheat consumed. Another cause which tends to diminish the quantity of bread stuffs consumed by the people of the United States, is, the large amount of animal food consumed by them, which can easily be obtained, and which forms a large item in the consumption of every class of the population, of the Union, not excepting the slave population. Taking an allowance for the use of  indian corn and animal food, it will appear, that the quantity of wheat consumed by the people of the United States is much less, in proportion, than the quantity consumed by the people of other civilized countries. We do not believe it will exceed three bushels for each individual of the whole population of the Union free and slave. As the slaves consume but very little wheat, of course, the quantity for each white person would be greater. Below is a table presenting estimates of the quantities of wheat and corn consumed by ti people of the United States, based upon two ratios of calculation; first, upon the allowance of three bushels of wheat and five of corn for each individual of the whole population; and second, upon the allowance of three and a half bushels of wheat to each person, excluding the slaves. In these bases of calculation, the table also shows the surpluses and deficiencies of each state and territory in the Union, above or below the consumption of its population.

This estimate gives eight bushels of grain to each person. To be liberal in the allowance for domestic consumption (our purpose being mainly to show the amount which may be left for exportation) we will add half a bushel of rye to each person, and 6,000,000 bushels of buckwheat to the whole population. Right and three-fourth bushels of grain, in addition to the animal food consumed, without reckoning beans, .peas, and other vegetables and fruits, will be an ample allowance for the sustenance of each individual of the population of the United States for one year. But large quantities of grain are consumed by. cattle, horses, and swine. In the absence of any satisfactory data, the quantity consumed by animals, must be mainly a matter of conjecture. Met we have some facts upon which we can proceed in our calculations. If the estimate of the population of the United States for 1847, submitted in the tabular estimate of the crops accompanying the agricultural report, be correct, it will appear that the population of the Union has increased nearly 22 per cent. since the census of 1840. As there has been, during the lasts even years, no particular cause operating in this country to check production and accelerate consumption, it may be pretty safely assumed that property, of all kinds, has increased in the same ratio of the increase of population that is, 22 per cent. since 1840. Assuming the increase of 22 percent. the following estimate of the number of horses and mules, neat cattle sheep and swine, in the United States at the present time, is submitted, as a very near approach to the actual number, viz Horses, Rules and .is ses.

Note n consequence of the rapid development of the pork business in western states, and the consequent greater increase of swine, than in other portions of the Union, we have, in another place estimated the number of swine in the United States at 35,000,000. The latter probably is nearer the true number, and we shall assume it in our estimate of the consumption of corn by domestic animals. For similar reasons we have estimated the number of sheep at 25,000,000. We therefore estimate the consumption of I indian corn by domestic and nails as follows, viz 550 X. a. Bushels.

In addition to the quantity of I indian corn consumed by men and animals, probably 25,000,000 bushels are used in dis tilling and for other purposes.

It now remains to enquire I That countries are purchasers of bread stuffs- What the probable extent of their demand and which are the countries with which the 'Americanagriculturist must compete, with their estimated surpluses and prices. In the month of December inquiries were submitted by the Patent Office to certain American ministers and consuls abroad, for information in relation to the product of corn, in the countries in which they reside; whether sufficient was produced to subsist their inhabitants; and what quantity, if any, would be required from other countries. Prompt attention i was paid by thefunctionaries referred to, to the inquiries of this office; but unfortunately the offices to which they applied, were unable to furnish the information sought for. The object of these inquiries was, to enable the Patent Office to lay before the country an estimate of the probable demands of foreign countries for American produce, during the present commercial year. The famine which unfortunately prevailed in Europe in 1846 and 1847,caused a very considerable increased demand for American bread stuffs and provisions. That calamity resulted from the destruction of the potato crop and from scanty harvests generally. The harvests of corn abroad, in 1847 were abundant. The potato was much injured by the plague which has assailed it, but suffered less than in the previous year. In the whole, then, it is believed that the foreign demand for American bread stuffs and provisions, during the current commercial year, will be much less than it was in 1846, but considerably greater than in average years. It cannot be desired that years of dear th and famine should occur in any country, to occasion an increased demand for the great staples which our favored country produces in such seeming abundance, and therefore, the American agriculturists should not base his calculations upon the necessities of other countries which grow out of casual periods of scarcity or calamity. In the contrary, he should look to the steady demand which results from their ordinary wants. He will then know how large a demand there is to be supplied, and whether he can furnish the supplies needed at lower prices than the agriculturists of other countries which produce surpluses for, exportation. We have taken some pains to ascertain the countries which are likely to import grain in ordinary years; the extent of their demands; the countries which produce surpluses; the amount of their surpluses; and the prices at which grain, (more particularly wheat) can be purchased and transported to England, which may be regarded as the great corn mary of the world. The following may be regarded as the principal corn purchasing countries of the world, viz: Great Britain, France, Holland, the West I n diam s lands, British American colonies, Brazil and South America generally. The following table, compiled from Spachmans Statistics of the Britishempire and the British Almanacs, shows the quantity of wheat and wheat flour, imported into Great Britain, the quantity exported, and the quantity delivered for consumption, during a period of ten years, commencing with 1837.552Ex. a.

A large quantity of other grain will also be required. We have not been able to obtain the returns from other countries for a series of years. But, from the best authorities which we have been able to consult, we have compiled the following table, exhibiting the quantity of wheat (exclusive of other grains) required by the principal corn purchasing countries of the world.

This demand is, of course, affected by extraordinary causes. Occasionally a plentiful harvest will diminish it; while on the other hand a short harvest, or destruction of some crop like the potato, will greatly increase it. In 1847, it was greatly increased by the latter cause. If the estimates submitted of the surplus of wheat raised in the Unitedstates be correct, it will be seen that the American agriculturists are able to supply the ordinary demands of the corn importing countries of the whole world. But they have competitors in this great commerce of bread stuffs, and it remains to see who they are, and the extent of the competition. The principal grain exporting countries in Europe appear to be Russia, Russia, Denmark and Sicily; in Asia, Syria; in Africa, Egypt. We have two estimates of the quantities of grain which the countries above named produce (or import from other countries) for exportation. The first which we submit is an estimate prepared for the London Dark Lane Express, of April 5th, 1847. It was prepared at a season when enquiry was keen and active for the sources whence the great deficit in the English and I wish harvests was to be supplied.

The information which it contains, having been obtained by the most careful enquiry in every corn mary in Europe, is unquestionably the most reliable. It embraces only wheat, and exhibits, at one view, the surpluses at the different grain parts, the prices on shipboard, cost of transportation to England, and total cost in England, reduced to equivalents in federal money.

The British consul attica, in his report, under date of Sov. 30th, 1841, says the harvest in these provinces for that year " has only turned out satisfactory with regard to spring corn, whilst the wheat and rye crops have not yielded even a middling average; so that but little rye and no wheat can be looked for from those two provinces for next years exportation." We are inclined to think thatRiga will not hereafter be a large ex porter of wheat. Odessathe export of wheat in 1846, was 1,955,316 chetwerts, or11700000 bushels. While the exports of Odessa increased in 1846, that, of many of the ports mentioned in the table above greatly diminished. Rotterdamaccording to a table published in Mcgregors Commercial Statistics, vol. 1, p. 824, the value of " grain, or corn and flour for food" exported from Rotterdam in 1841, was 207,280. Allowing fifty-five shillings per quarter, it would seem that the quantity exported in 1841 was 75 374 611 quarters, or 602,997 bushels. This quantity included rye. Behave been able to find no later returns of the export of grain from this ports Was. d 43 95 4 448 436 639 937 343 94 7 64 4 639 637 344 357 358 84 6 345 3 3rd z dolls. its 10 611 3 171 1 7 28 769 649 03 10 611 1 5 210 79 9 589 03 10 7 313 88 14 221 1 2 110 99cid127ocid127dolls. its 1 641 461 0 921 201 131 321 1 441 34.1 191 131 341 73 1 771 401 37 vex. a. Antwerpthe value of all kinds of grain from this port in 1839 (the total returns we have) was 766,200 francs, or about                            $147,481. The export is therefore small. Palermothe estimate in the table is for abundant harvest only. From the two tables above, we infer that the whole quantity of wheat produced for exportation, by the grain exporting countries of the world, excluding the United States, is not far from 20,000,000 bushels, and that the great rival of the United States is Russia. The produces the most and sell sit the cheapest, certainly at the port of Odessa on the Black Tea. The has, however, but few ports, and her means of transportation from the interior, are not so great as those possessed by the United States. It is doubtful, too, whether Russia can produce grain cheaper than the western states of the American Union. From inquiries submitted during the last summer, answers to whiqji will be found in Appendix No. 3, it appears that the cost of growing wheat in the United States, is as follows, viz n Newhampshire, .a. .a.                           $1.10 per bushel."

Of course, the cost varies in different years, in proportion as the harvest is abundant or scarce. For example, the cost of raising a bushel of wheat in Michigan is given from four years actual experiment, and was as follows: 1st year a bushel cost the grower 67* its 2d year, 364 cents; 3d year 28 cents; 4th year 30 cents.

We have shown in the last of our tables the cost of a bushel of grain purchased in the leading corn parts of Europe delivered in England. We propose now to slim it some facts which will enable the American farmer to judge whether or not the conclusion which we have expressed be sound, that he can compete with the foreign corn grower in the markets of England. And as freight is one of the principal elements of cost, we first give a table showing the freight on a barrel of flour and a bushel of grain, on the Erie Canal from Buffalo to Albany, New Work, and from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. And also on the same article from the other principal portscid127of the United States, to Liverpool* Most for three years, affected by short or abundant harvests. The estimates are those of practical farmers residing in the states mentioned, and may be relied upon 556 X. a. Freights (tolls included) on the Erie Canal to Albany. From Buffalo.

Add 2 cents per bushel more for storage and other expenses of grain on the way from Buffalo to New Work, and 6 cents more for a barrel of flour. The flour barrel will probably cost 33 cents more, and grinding and bolting 30 cents. Calculating five bushels of wheat to a barrel of flour, the cost of a barrel of flour put up at the Rochester mills in New Work, and delivered in Liverpool, would be thus :give bushels of wheat at sixty-four cents per bushel, first cost.          $3.20Grinding and bolting. .a. .a. .a. 30 Barrel. .a. .a. .a. 33 Freight to Albany. .a. . .a. . 56" and charges from Albany to New Work. 12" from New York to Liverpool (average. 39 insurance, wharf age, &c. .a. .a. 255)5 15 most of wheat per bushel in Liverpool when exported in the form of flour. .a.                            $1.03I t is proper to remark that, in the absence of correct information we have estimated some of the items in this calculation, but we believe, sufficiently high to cover the actual cost. We are therefore confirmed in the conclusion, that the American grain growers can deliver grain or flour at as low a price .in England, as the grain growers of any other country, not excepting Russia on the Black Tea and that they have it in their power to command the great grain market of Great Britain, and of nearly all the corn importing countries of the world* Russia is beyond question the great rival of the United States in the corn markets of the world. We have before us an estimate by a Russian nobleman, prepared for the " Londoneconomist" of the average quantity annually of grain of all kinds produced in Russia. The statement is as follows : "the present population of Russia, in Europe, is 65,000,000, of whom about 15,000,000, are males, engaged in agriculture. In an average there are annually sown with s winter grain18750000 hectares, yielding Hectolitres.

One hectare is nearly two and a half English acres. One heetolitre is a little more than two and three-fourths imperial bushels. Large as the statement from the "economist" makes the quantities of the grain produced annually in Russia to appear, it may, perhaps be not too great. We find in Mcgregorscommercial Statistics, volume 2, page 734, the following statement of the produce of grain in Russia, in Europe, derived from Schnitzlers Statistics of that empire, in 1835, viz Average quantities sown, 50,000,00 chetwerts. Average produce three and a half for one. Total average produce, 181,000,000 chetwerts, or about 126,500,000 quarters, (or 1,012,000,-000 bushels) Total average consumption, including seed and the supply of distilleries141000000 chetwerts. Total average disposal be surplus, 40,000,000 chetwerts, or about28000000 quarters, (or 224,000,000 bushels) These quantities include grain of all kinds. In a recent German work of great authority and ability, we have found a very full description of the soil, climate and productions of Russia, which impresses us with the belief that the productive capabilities of that empire are much exaggerated. We annex a few paragraphs, extracted from the work alluded to: "agriculture in Russia is still in its primitive state, though the number of products and their quantity is great, no province furnishes more than one half of its natural capacity. For this reason does the soil, in by far the greatest portion of Russia, possess no real intrinsic value the latter depending entirely on the labor of man, so that instead of asking the number of acres, the number of hands that belong to it, form the measure of its value. The best, cultivated provinces of Russia are on the Baltic, in the provinces adjacent to Moscow, and in the Russian provinces of Poland; but even in these provinces are to be found immense districts of which not the fifteenth part is as yet taken into cultivation. The whole area of Russia in Europe is 1,742,145,725 Russian acres, of which 676,000,000are covered with forests and underwood; 771,000,000 acres are wholly unfit for cultivation un land) there remains consequently but 246,500,000 acres fit for agricultural purposes, and about 24,500,000 acres capable of being used as pasturage. I indian corn (maize) is principally grown on the shores of the Black Tea; the provinces on the Baltic and western Russia furnish the greatest quantity of hemp and flax; potatoes have but lately been generally introduced; the raising of grain (oats, &c) for feeding cattle is entirely neglected. There exists an official seven years' average for the whole crop of all the Aussi as, Poland alone excepted. From this it appears that the yearly crop of all Russia yielded 167,112,224chetwerts; while that of Poland alone amounted to 280,906,000 chetwerts. According to official reports on the state of agriculture, it appears that, in 1832, there were used as seed 19,269,088 chetwerts of winter grain, and in the spring of 1833, 28,920,754*chetwerts of summer grain, making together 48,189,842 chetwerts of grain. The exports from Russia were n the year (one chetwerts is equal to six English bushels, nearly 1830 3,935,000 chetwerts1831 3,790,000 "1832 3,500,000 "I n 1833 there was an entire failure of crops, which in 1834 caused the permission of free importation of grain which, from a partial failure of the crops of 1834 was, by an imperial ukase, dated December 1st, 1834, extended, for the ports of the Black Tea and the Tea ofAsof, to the 1st of January, 1836, and in consequence of a new total failure of crops in southern Russia, further extended by the ukase of the 9th January, 1835, to the Austrian and Russian frontier and the ports of the Baltic and the White sea. The abundant grain crops of Poland, especially in the Woiwodships, Sendomir, Dublin and even Massovia, have already been celebrated in the middle ages; but they are more owing to the excellent soil than the progress of agriculture in that country.

N. Memoranda Relati  Of Of The Patent Laws I N Great Bri Tai Nand I N The Other Pri Nci  Pal States Of Europe. Great Britain. In Great Britain, patents are always granted for one fixed period, viz: fourteen years; but at the expiration of that term, if the patentee can show that he has not been adequately regenerated for his invention, a prolongation will be granted for a term not exceeding seven years. Patents are granted either for inventions emanating from the applicant, or for communications obtained by him from abroad. To description or specification is required at the time of making the application, unless the patent should be opposed, in which case a brief memorandum of the leading particulars of the invention is deposited with the attorney general; but within six Months after the completion of the patent, a full specification must be enrolled in the court of chancery, otherwise the patent becomes void. A patentee is not required to practice his invention, under pain of forfeiting his patent, as is the case in some countries, it remains valid during the term for which it is granted, whether he bring it into operation or not. In respect of patents, England, Scotland, and I re land, are considered as constituting three distinct kingdoms; if therefore it is desired to patent an invention throughout Great Britain, a separate patent must be taken for each kingdom. The ordinary charge for obtaining these, including agency, is as follows England, 110, and 5 additional if the colonies are included Scotland, 80; I re land, 135. The charges do not include the cost of the specification, which varies with the length and other circumstances, neither do they include the cost of opposition, which, should there be any, will amount to 5 additional. Persons contemplation g taking out patents in England, would do well always to enter a caveat as early as possible, they thereby receive information of all applications for patents for objects analogous to that which forms the subject of their invention, and thus have the opportunity of opposing the application, should they conceive it likely that the invention is the same as their own. I t must, however, be understood, that the caveat gives no right of priority, nor any protection, whilst making experiments. The cost. of a caveat is one guinea, and it remains in force for one year. N. B. As inventors can abstain from completing their British patents at any stage -of the process, it must be observed that the privilege of British patents depends not upon the date of the application, but upon The Date Of The Completi  Of Of The Patent, that is, The Date Of Whi Of I T' Vas Sealed. X. 
791Continental Patents. In the continental States of Europe, one or more copies of a full, and complete specification of the invention must accompany the application for a patent, and in most of them the patentee is required to have his invention in operation within a limited time. In most of the States patents are granted for various terms, at the option of the applicant, and in some .a prolongation may be obtained beyond the term originally applied for; but in almost all the States, if the invention be the subject of a patent in another country, the patent right ceases with the expiration, of the original patent, whatever may be the term for which the subsequent patents may be granted. The principal regulations in the several States are as follows France. French patents are granted for five, ten, or fifteen years, at the option. of the applicant, but no prolongation of the original term is ever granted. The government charges are: for five years, 100 francs; ten years, 1,000 francs; and fifteen years, 1,500 francs, payable in annual installments (in advance) of 100 francs. Two sets of drawings and two copies of the specification, written in French, must accompany the application for the patent; and the agent must be furnished with a power of attorney from the party in whose name the patent is demanded. The invention must be brought into operation within two years from the date of the grant. Certificates of addition are granted for improvements subsequently devised, but the patent right in these improvements expires with the term of the original patent. The government charge for each certificate is twenty francs. Belgium. Belgian patents are granted to natives or foreigners for their own inventions, or for inventions imported from abroad, for terms of five, ten, or fifteen years, at the option of the applicant, but prolongation of the original term can rarely be obtained. The government charges are about 13 for five years, 26 for ten years, and 51 for fifteen years Two sets of drawings and two copies' of the specification must accompany the demand, and the agent rust have a power of attorney and if the patent be one of importation, the agent must have the name of the foreign patentee, the exact date, the title, and the number of years for which it has been granted in the kingdom from whence it has been imported. Patents of addition can be obtained, and the only government charge is the stamps, which is very trifling. Belgian patents must be put in operation within two years, unless a prolongation of the term has been obtained, which can sometimes be done when sufficient cause can be shown 7 92. X.  C. To 54. A Belgian patent becomes void if, after obtaining it, the patentee takes out a patent in another country in his own name. Holland. The laws and the government charges are nearly the same as in Belgium, only the specification is required to be in Dutch. Dutch patent becomes void if, after obtaining it, the patentee takes out a patent for the invention in another country in his own name. Austria. Austrian patents are granted for one to fifteen years, at the option of the inventor, who may demand for one or two years, and obtain a prolongation for any term that shall not extend the whole duration of the patent beyond fifteen years, but patents of addition are not granted. The government charges are as follows For 1 year in full, at the time of making the demand, and there is further small annual tax of about 1 sterling. The Austrian florid is worth about 2s. 2d. sterling, or ten florins1 1s. One set of drawings and one copy of specification, in German, are required, accompanied by a power of attorney to the agent. An Austrian patent should be put in operation within the current year, but nullification will not immediately follow, if the small annual payments be regularly made. The Austrian government assumes that the demand is made with the consent of the original inventor, so that in the case of a patent for importation, a power of attorney should be obtained from the original inventor. Russia. In Russia the term of a patent is at the option of the government, and which usually grants there for eight years. X. a. 793The government charges are almost nominal, seldom amounting to more than 1. One set of drawings and one specification (in German) are required, and the patent must be granted in the name of a resident, whom the agent will generally provide, if required. Patents of addition are not granted. The patent is usually required to be ,put into operation within six months, but the government is generally lenient on this head if they are satisfied that a commencement has been made. Russia. The Russian government grants patents of invention for ten years, but those of importation for from one to six, at the option of the applicant. Prolongations are seldom or ever granted. The government charges are as follows For 1 year 200 rubles, or 10. For 2 years 400 rubles, or 20. For 3 years 600 rubles, or 29. For 4 years 800 rubles, or .39. For 5 years 1,000 rubles, or 48. For 6 years 1,400 rubles, or 58. The documents required are 1 drawing on strong drawing and I on tracing paper and 1 specification. To patent of addition is granted. To that, if a further improvement be made, a further patent must be demanded. The term allowed for putting a patent into activity is six months. Patents are granted to any person making the demand, but the government always exercises its own discretion in granting or refusing. Bavaria. A Bavaria n patent from 2 to' 15 years, and prolong ed at pleasure. The charges depend a good deal on circumstances; but may generally be calculated at about 1 10s. per annum. The documents required are 1 set of drawings, 1 specification, and a legalized copy of the original patent of which it is an importation. Patents of addition are not granted for an improvement on the original. A new one must be demanded, and paid for by an annual contribution of 1 10s. The patent must be put in activity within Two years from the date of the grant. Patents in Bavaria will be granted to any applicant, whether residing in the kingdom or not. Saxony. The government exercises its own discretion in limiting the term for ' which a patent shall be granted; but it is advisable to state the 97 94 , X. term for which it is desired, as 8, 10, or 12, and in support of the petition to state the advantages which will accrue from its introduction. The documents required are 1 specification and 1 drawing. The petition must likewise set forth the exact title of the foreign patent, of which it may be an importation, with the date and number of years for which such patent has been granted. Patents of addition are not granted, but any improvement on the original may be secured by a new patent on paying certain charges, to be fixed by the government. The patent should be put into activity within one year from the date of the grant. Wurtemburg. The Wurtemburg government does not grant patents of importation for a longer term than 10 years, but the legislature may, and sometimes does. One may be demanded for any term short of 10.years, and afterwards prolonged, but the application for a prolongation must be made six months before the expiration of the term originally granted. The government charges will be from 50 to 200 florids, in annual installments of from 5 to 20 florids, the first to be made on the delivery of the patent say from 10s. to 2 per annum. The documents required are simply a description arid a tracing, with the date, name of granted, title, and number of years of the patent of which it may be an importation. A patent of addition may be demanded, and is generally granted without additional charges; but this is always at the discretion of the government. The patent must be put into activity within two years from the date of the grant, and may not remain, at any one time, for the term of two years, unemployed, under penalty of nullification, unless reason can be alleged to the satisfaction of the government. Patents are granted in Wurtemburg to all persons, whether natives or foreigners. Deci  Of    Onsof T Hehon.

Temper sets forth that he ' has invented certain improvements in the manner of constructing vessels for the st owing and carrying ice; and also an improvement in the manner of st owing the same, and prays that letters patent of the United Statesmry be granted to him there for, securing to him and his legal representatives an exclusive right in and to his said invention, agreeably to the provisions of the acts of Congress in that case made and provided; he having paid thirty dollars into the treasury of the United States, and otherwise complied with the requirements of the said acts n his specification, after describing his vessel and the improvements in the same, and certain matters to be attended to in the st owing of the ice, he says: " I have discovered that, for the purpose of keeping ice for a great length of time, it is necessary, in st owing it, to place all the pieces edge wise, as, when placed flat wise, small openings are formed through it by the perforation of water or otherwise, and that the injurious effect goes on increasing and eventually producing a rapid destruction thereof: this I obviate, by carefully packing all the blocks edge wise, when, as experience has abundantly shown, no such effect is produced. This mode of st owing applies not only to vessels, but also to ice houses, and wherever ice is to be preserved2After stating what he disclaims and what he claims as his invention and improvements in constructing vessels for the transportation of ice, he says: "I n the manner of st owing the ice I claim the placing of the prepared blocks edge wise, in t the manner and for the beneficial purpose herein set forth to objection was made by the Commissioner of Patents to the grant of a patent for the novel construction of vessels for the transportation of ice as claimed by him; but the Commissioner decided that the applicant was not entitled to. receive a patent for the manner of st owing the ice by placing the blocks edge wise. From this decision he has appealed, according to the provisions of the 11th section of the act of March 3, 1839, and the 7th section of the act of July 4, 1836; and has filed in the Patent Office his reasons of appeal, and paid the sum of twenty-five dollars to the credit of the patent fund. By the 11th section of the act of March 3, 1839, ch. 88, (pamphlet edition) the judge is to confine his revision to the points involved in the reasons of appeal, and the Commissioner of Patents is to lay before the judge the grounds of his decision touching the same points. The applicant claims a patent for his vessel, and his manner of798Ex. st owing ice in vessels and ice houses, as one invention, and pays thirty dollars as for one patent. The Commissioner denied his right to a patent for his manner of st owing, but admits it for his improvement in the construction of his vessel. The first and principal point involved in the reasons of appeal is, whether the thing for which the patent is claimed is the invention or discovery of a new and useful art, or of a new improvement on an art, within the meaning of the constitution and laws of the United States respecting patents. The invention, if it be one, consists only in laying each block of ice on its narrow est side. An that act be considered as a new thing invented or made? Was it never done before? If it has been done before, although the. beneficial effect of so placing it, rather than on its broadest side, had not been discovered, it is not a new thing, The only thing new is the discovery of the beneficial effect, and that is the discovery of a thing which existed before; for if it is now true that ice so placed keeps longer than when differently placed, it was always true; and that it existed before is shown in the specification, where it is said that the effect was discovered, by experience e. Such of the confusion of ideas upon this subject has arisen from the ambiguity of the words "discover" and "discovery" used in the constitution and the patent laws of the United States. In their primary and common sense they are not synonymous with "invent and I invention or. Webster, in the last 8 vo. edition of his dictionary, under word " discover" says: " discover differs from invent; the discover what before existed; the invent what di, d not before exist." And under the article invention" he says: " invention differs from discovery- " I invention is applied to the contrivance and production of something that did not before exist. "discovery' brings to light that which existed before, but which was not known discovery, in this sense, is not the subject of a patent; and it will be found, by a careful perusal of the constitution and laws of the United States upon the subject of patents for useful arts, &c that it is not there used in this sense, but always as synonymous with invention. Thus the constitution) (in ch. 4, art. 1, see. 8, clause 8,) among the enumerated powers given to Congress, says: " To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited terms to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveriesiHere it is evident, that the " discoveries" the use of which is to be secured, are the discoveries of inventors only. The applicant must invent, contrive, or produce something that did not exist before. A man may discover (i. e. may disclose) his invention and for that discovery or disclosure he will be entitled to the exclusive use of his invention for a limited time n the first act of Congress, " to promote the progress of useful arts~ passed April 10, 1790, the words invention and discovery x. are used synonymously, throughout the whole act; and whether application was for a patent, for an invention, or a discovery, it must be founded upon an invention or discovery of an useful art, &cor improvement therein) not before known or used. The discovery of a new art that will justify a patent under that act can be only the invention of a new art, and the discovery of a new improvement, the invention of a new improvement. In every case, therefore, the applicant must be the inventor, and by the constitution none but inventors could be entitled to the monopoly. The next act was passed on the 2 1st of February, 1793, entitled an act to promote the progress of useful arts, and to repeal the act heretofore made for that purposely the first section of this act, the applicant was to declare that he had invented (not discovered) a new and useful art, &c, or improvement, &c, and the patent was to give a short description of the said invention or discovery. Were 1 discovery 5 is intended to be synonymous with invention, for the claimant had alleged an invention only; and it is afterwards again in the same section called, the said invention or discovery. The second section says, that any person who shall have discovered an improvement and obtained a patent there for, shall not be at liberty to use the " original discovery, nor shall the first inventor " (i. e. of the original discovery, which he had alleged to be his invention) " be at liberty to use the improvement 55 and the change of form or properties was not to be deemed a " discovery." By the third section, "every inventor was to swear or affirm that he believed that he was the true inventor or discovered of the art, &c, and deliver a written description of his" invention, by which it may be distinguished from other inventions The fourth and fifth sections speak of inventors and inventions, without saying anything of discoverers or discoveries. The sixth section, alluding to the same invention, calls it " his discovery and speaks of original discovery and supposed discovery, and the discovery of another man, and all these expressions are used in reference to what had been patented as inventions. The tenth see, ti on speaks of the true inventor or discovered, and the eleventh section provides that every inventor shall pay thirty dollars before he presents his petition. The act of 17th of April, 1800, only extends the privileges of the former act to aliens, and to the legal representatives of inventors and discoverers, &c, and gives treble damages for violation of patent rights. The act of July 13, 1832, applies only to aliens. The next act is that of July 4, 1836, entitled " an act to pro wrote the progress of useful arts, and. to repeal all acts and parts of acts heretofore made for that purpose The first section speaks of " issuing patents for new and useful discoveries, inventions and improvements as part of the business of the Commissioner of Patents, whose office was therein created. In the 5th section the words invention and discovery are used throughout as synonymous800Ex. a. The 6th section, which declares for what a patent may issue, shows that the applicant must have "discovered or invented, some new art, &c, or improvement, and it is called "his discovery or invention thereof" and he is called the inventor or discovered. I t then says: "but before any inventor shall receive a patent for any such new invention or discovery, he shall deliver a written description of his invention or discovery." The descriptions and drawings are to be "signed by the inventor" and he is to furnish a model of his invention 2 and he is to make oath "that he does verily believe that he is the original and first inventor or discovered of the art, &cor improvement, for which he solicits a patent; and that he does not know or believe that the same was ever before known or used n the 7th section, wherever the word discovery or discovered is coupled with invention or inventor, it is evident that it means the discovery or discovered of something new something that did not exist before and, therefore, equivalent to invention and inventor. In the latter part of the section it speaks of the "science to which the alleged invention appertains' and of the part or parts of the invention which he (the Commissioner) considers as not entitled to be patented. The 8th section speaks of the right of "can original and true inventor" to a patent for his invention, and says nothing of a discovery or discovered. The 12th section speaks only of invention, not discovery; yet it is evidently applicable to the former sections, which use the words" invention or discovery The 13th section provides that where a patent shall be "invalid by reason of the patentee claiming in his specification, as his own invention, more than he had a right to claim as new~ the Commissioner "may cause a new patent to be issued to the said inventor for the same invention" &c. The same section afterwards speaks of a "description and specification of any new improvement of the original invention or discovery which shall have been invented or discovered by him" (the patentee) " subsequent to the date of his patent. , 'the 15th section specified the special matter which may be given in evidence by the defendant under the general issue, among which is evidence tending to prove that the description and specification filed by the plaintiff does not contain the whole truth 'relative to his invention or discovery, or that the patentee was not the original and first inventor or discovered of the thing patented, or of a substantial and material part thereof claimed as new; or that he hadsurreptitiously or unjustly obtained the patent for that which was in fact, invented or discovered by another. It also speaks of "the invention or discovery for which the patent issued." It spedaisalso of the first inventor, without adding discovered, and of the invention, without adding discovery. The 16th section speaks of the intentions patented, and generally of inventions, without adding discoveries. The 19th section speaks of injunctions to prevent the violation of the rights of any inventor, but says nothing of any discoverers x. a. 801 showing that the word inventor included all such discoverers as were contemplated by the .legislature as within the protection of the patent laws. The 18th section provides "that whenever the patentee of an invention or discovery shall desire to extend his patent beyond the term of its limitation, he may make application" &o, and shall furnish a statement of the ascertained value of the invention" and having failed to obtain from the use and sale of his invention a reasonable regeneration, &c, he may have the term extended. Were it is evident that the word invention was understood as equivalent to "invention and discovery" mentioned in the beginning of the section; and shows that the discovery contemplated was the discovery of something new, i. e. that did not exist before, and was used as synonymous with the word invention. The remaining sections of the act do not use the words invention or discovery. The act of March 3, 1839, (pamphlet, ch. 88, p. 74,) section 7,says that every person who shall have constructed any "newly invented machine, manufacture or composition of matter, prior to the application by the inventor or discovered for a patent, shall be held to possess the right to use. &c, "the specific machine 5 &c, "so made" &c, "without liability there for to the inventor or any other person interested in such invention; and no patent shall be held to be invalid by reason of such use" &c, "except on proof of abandonment of such invention to the public" &chere is nothing further in this act tending to explain the meaning of the word "discovery" as used in the constitution and laws of the United States respecting patents for useful arts. Upon consideration of the constitution and laws of the Unitedstates upon this subject, therefore I think I may safely say that the claimant in this case can build no argument upon the supposed deference between a discovery and an invention, for no discovery will entitle the discovered to a patent which does not in effect amount to the contrivance or production of something which did not exist before; or, in other words, to an invention. The patent claimed is for " the placing of the prepared blocks edge wise" for the purpose set forth in the specification. The placing of the blocks of ice edge wise is not the contrivance or production of anything which did not exist before. It is not an invention. It is not a discovery, #because everybody knew before that blocks of ice might be placed upon their narrow est side; and it is asserted by the Commissioner in the grounds of his decision, and not denied in argument, that blocks of ice have been so placed, whether by accident or design is immaterialthe placing in not new It is not an invention. The discovery of a new effect of that which existed before is not the subject of a patent. Locks of ice have been placed on edge before the alleged discovery by the claimant. If they were so placed with intent to retard their dissolution, I presume the claimant would at once, abandon his claim. But the intent can be no ground of a patent. The claimant may be the first who placed 8 02 X. blocks of ice on edge with that intent, but this cannot justify a patent for doing that which was often done without that intent. In truth, the whole merit of the claimant is the discovery of a fact which existed long before, viz: that ice placed edge wise kept longer than when placed flat wise. This is a mere naked discovery, for which a patent cannot .be granted. There is no invention nothing contrived or produced which did not exist before. It is, however, contended that, although the discovery, merely as such, is not patent able, and although blocks of ice may have been often placed edge wise, yet "it will not be pretended that, in vessels or in ice houses, ice had ever been st owed away upon the system adopted by Mr. Temper 55 By "system" I suppose, must here be meant intent or purpose, for the placing the ice on edge cannot, of itself, form a system. A system, as defined by Dr. Johnson, is " any complex are or combination of many things acting together; a scheme which reduces many things to regular dependence or cooperation; a scheme which unites many things in order The patent, in the present case, is not asked for a system, but for the exclusive right to place blocks of ice on their narrow est side. The claim, therefore, obtains no support by calling it a system, nor by calling it a "plan, as in the reasons of appeal, where it is asked, " I s the proposed plan unquestionably old." What the writer meant by the word plan is not very obvious; but I presume he intended to refer to the placing of the ice edge wise, with the intent that it should thereby keep longer than if otherwise placed. He probably meant to include the intent with the act; but, as be ford observed if the thing done be not new, the intent cannot entitle it to a patent. It is admitted, in argument in behalf of the appeal ant, " that a discovery, taken abstractedly, is not patent able' but it is contended " that, if the thing discovered be practically applied to produce a new and useful effect, the manner of attaining the end is patent able." Now, let us apply this rule or doctrine to the present case' The thing discovered is the beneficial effect of the position of the ice not the position itself. Now is this effect, which is the thing discovered, applied by the appeal ant to produce a new and useful effect? And what is the new effect thus to be produced by the effect discovered? Whatever it may be, it must be produced by means that are new, by some invention, some contrivance, or production of something that did not before exist. The beneficial effect of the position of the ice is the retard at ion of its dissolution. To new and further effect is proposed. That retard at ion is the ultimate effect contemplated. To new means are intended to be used which can be the subject of a patent. A new effect from old means will not justify a patent from those old means. This -case is, therefore, not within the rule or doctrine thus advanced to supply it. The patent to Mr. Tudor for filling the interstices between the blocks of ice with some non conducting substance is cited as a precedent for the present application. To judicial decision is produced affirming the validity of that patent, and it seems to me to x. a. 803,rest upon very doubtful ground; but it is to be presumed that the commissioner who issued it was satisfied that the means used were a new invention. Mr. Hollands patent for an improvement is also referred to; but there the means used were decided to be, as to him, a new invention, although Dr. All had, 40 years before, constructed two telescopes upon the same principle, but had not pursued the matter and brought it into public use. That case has no analogy to the present. In the reasons of appeal, it is suggested that patents for processes or modes of procedure, in preserving animal and vegetable substances by means extremely simple, have been granted in England and in this country; but as they are not particularly brought. to my notice, I cannot say how far they may be considered as precedents to justify the present application. I presume that, in all of them, something new was invented; something more than the discovery of a fact or a principle, and the application of such fact or principle to some useful purpose by old means, or by means not newly invented. It is also suggested, in the reasons of appeal, that " the Commissioner is bound to issue a patent for the thing claimed, if, on, examination, it shall not appear to him that the same had been invented or discovered by any other person in this country prior to the alleged invention or discovery thereof by the applicant, or that it had been patented or described, &c, as stated in the 7th section of the act of July 4, 1836; and that the discovery in question is not placed in either of the conditions that would justify the refusing of a patent under the law. But the 7th section refers to the 6th, by which it appears that a patent is to be issued only to a person who has discovered or invented some new ,and useful art, &c, or some new and useful improvement on any art, &c. The 'Cornmissioner, therefore, is to decide, in the first place, whether the invention is new, and whether it is the proper subject of a patent; he is bound to refuse it, although it may not be liable to the particular objections specified in the 7th section. It is also said, in the reasons of appeal, that the professed rule of the office is, "that where the question is at all doubtful, the patent should be granted his rule, I suppose, must have been adopted when the applicant had no remedy if ,the Commissioner rejected his claim, and the decision of the Commissioner was affirmed by the board of examiners under the 7th and 16th sections of the act of July 4, 1836; which last mentioned section gave the applicant a remedy, by bill in equity, only in case the patent was refused on the ground that it would interfere with an un expired patent previously granted. I n all other cases of refusal, the applicant had no remedy; whereas, if the patent should be granted, its validity might be, at all times, questioned in the courts of law. It was reasonable, therefore, to adopt such a rule. But now, by the 10th section of the act of March 3, if the patent 80 X. be refused for any cause, either by the Commissioner or the judge, the applicant may still establish his right to a patent by a bill in equity. The reason of the rule, therefore, fails, and I should not think myself bound by it, if I thought this to be a case of doubt, which      do not. Very patent is a monopoly; and nothing can justify it but the natural right of property which a man has in the products of his own labor and ingenuity. With this exception, it is in derogation of common right; and it should be strictly confined to the case excepted. Upon the whole, therefore, I am of opinion, and so decide, that the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, that the applicant, John F. Temper, was not entitled to receive a patent for the manner of st owing ice, by placing the blocks edge wise, was correct, and the same is hereby confirmed. And I hereby certify the same to the said Commissioner of Patents. And I do further certify that, having received an appeal and the petition here with. enclosed of John. Temper, and the original papers named in the letter from the Commissioner of Patents of the 13th of February, 1841, here with also enclosed, I ordered notice to be given, as appears in my order of the 17th of February, 1841, also here with enclosed, which was returned to me on the 18th of February, 1841, with service acknowledged. I further certify that the parties appeared before me at my chambers, on Monday, the 8th of March, 1841, when, by consent, the hearing was postponed to Monday, the 15th of March, when the applicant, by Dr. Thomas P. Bones, his attorney, presented his written answer to the grounds of the Commissioners decision, (which written answer is also here with enclosed) when the hearing was further postponed, by consent, to Wednesday the 17th instant, and on that day further postponed until Friday, the 19th instant, when the parties attended, and the Commissioner filed his reply to the argument of Dr. Bones, which is also here with enclosed, and the case was then submitted without further argument. All which papers are here with transmitted to the Commissioner of Patents this 22d day of May, 1841. W. Cranch. George W. Of Ldreth, appeal ant, Pp el from the decision ofGEORGE Eat8 appeal lee. J the Commissioner of Patents. In the 29th of April, 1840, George Death filed in the Patentoffice his application for a patent for his invention of an improved canal lock gate. The Commissioner being of opinion that the patent thus applied for would interfere with an un expired patent granted to George W. Hildreth, on the 19th of March, 1840, gave notice thereof to the x. a. 805 parties, and, upon a hearing before him decided that George Death was the original and first inventor, and entitled to a patent there for. From this decision Mr. Hildreth has appealed, and the question is now submitted to me by the parties upon written argument. The Commissioner has furnished a certificate in writing of his opinion and decision; and Mr. Hildreth has filed his reasons of appeal, with the written argument of his counsel. The reasons for appeal thus filed are eight in number, but maybe reduced to three 1. Because Mr. Death was not the first inventor, in the meaning of the patent law, inasmuch as his invention was never reduced to practice, but was the mere speculation of a philosopher or mechanician2. Because he never filed a caveat pursuant to the 12th section of the act of July 4, 1836.3. Because he has forfeited his claim to the invention by his delay in applying for a patent 1. Upon the first point the very ingenious argument of Mr. Hildrethscounsel is founded upon a dictum of Mr. Justi  Of Story, in the case of Bedford v. Aunt, et al, 1 Mason, 304, that : the first inventor who has put the invention in practice, and he only, is entitled to a patent" and that dictum was perhaps founded on the words in the 6th section of the act of February 21, 1793, viz: "or that the thing thus secured by patent was not originally discovered by the patentee, but had been in use, or had been described in some public work, anterior to the supposed discovery ly the patentee" ~c, from which an inference seems to be drawn that the defence that the matter was not originally discovered by the patentee would not avail, the defendant, unless he show also that it had been in use by the prior discovered. But the words "but had been in use" seem to have been carefully excluded from the 15th section of the act of 1836, which, like the 6th section of the act of 1793, states the matters which may be given in evidence under the general issue in an action for in f ringing the plaintiffs patent. By thus excluding these words the defence, "that the patentee was not the original and first inventor or discovered of the thing patented" is complete, without showing that the first inventor had put his invention in practice. One of the patent laws have ever required that the invention should be in use, or reduced to actual practice, before the issuing of the patent, otherwise than by a model, drawings and specification containing a written description of the invention, and of the manner of making, constructing and using the same, in such full, clear and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which itappertains, to make, construct and use the same. In England it is understood that, if the thing is in use before the issuing of the patent, it is void; and our act of March 3, 1839, section 7, in order to meet such an objection, provides that the use of the thing, even by leave of the inventor, for two years before his application for a patent, shall not invalid ate it; a fort iodi the use of by a third per 806 X. son or subsequent inventor, after the first invention and before the issuing of the patent to the first inventor, without his consent, will not, under our patent laws, be a bar to the issuing of it. Mr. Justi  Of Story, in the case of Bedford v. Aunt, was not considering the question whether the patent should be issued, but whether it should be invalid a ted by prior use. He has not said that, under any circumstances, an invention must be in use before a patent for it can be obtained, and his dictum is wholly inapplicable to the question whether the Commissioner of Patents should issue a patent. If a patent should be issued to Mr. Death, its validity would be still a question open to the courts; and is one which can be conclusively settled by the courts only. By the 7th section of the act of 1836 the Commissioner is bound to issue a patent in the case, and under the circumstances there stated. He has in such a case no discretion; and the present is such a case. By that section it is enacted " that, on the filing of any such application, description and specification, and the payment of the duty herein after provided, the Commissioner shall make or cause to be made an examination of the alleged new invention or discovery, aid if, on such examination, it shall not appear to the Commissioner that the same had been invented or discovered by any other person in this country, prior to the alleged invention or discovery thereof by the applicant, or that it had been patented, or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country; or had been in public use or on sale, with the applicants consent or allowance prior to the application, if the Commissioner shall deem it sufficiently useful and important, it shall be his duty to issue a patenttherefor1I t appears by the proceedings before the Commissioner that Mr. Death regularly filed his application, description and specification, and paid the duty; that the Commissioner made the examination, and that upon such examination it did not appear to him that the same had been invented or discovered by any other person, or had been patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country, prior to the alleged invention or discovery thereof by the applicant; or that it had been in public use or on sale, with the applicants consent or allowance, prior to his application. The Commissioner was, therefore, prima face bound to issue the patent to Mr. Death. At first view it may seem doubtful from the words of that section, whether a patent issued to the second inventor, before the application of the first inventor, would not be a bar to the issuing of a subsequent patent to the first inventor. But upon comparing the words of that section with those of the 6th, 8th and 1 5th sections of the same act, it is evident that the patent, which would bar the issuing of a patent to the applicant, must be a patent issued prior to his invention, and not merely prior to his application. Having complied with all the requisites of the 7th section, what is to prevent the applicant from obtaining his patent. It is alleged x. D c. To 54. 80 that he was not the first inventor because he had not reduced his invention to practice. But that objection is answered by showing that there is no law which requires an inventor to put his invention in practice or use, before obtaining his patent; and it is perfectly in material to him whether the subsequent inventor had put it in practice or not. That fact cannot effect the right of the first inventor. If Congress had intended that a patent to the second inventor should be a bar to a patent to the first inventor, they would not have given jurisdiction to the Commissioner to decide the question of priority between them, and to grant a patent to the first inventor in cases of interference, as they have done by the eighth section of the act. Either that section, nor any other section of that, or any other act, makes the right of the patentee, or of the applicant, depend upon the fact of the invention being reduced to actual practice, except in the case of an alien patentee failing and neglecting, "for the space of eighteen months from the date of the patent, to put and continue on sale to the public, on reasonable terms, the invention or discovery for which the patent issued." From this exception, an inference may be drawn, that a citizen patentee cannot lose his right by non user, unless it amount to evidence of an abandonment of the patent; and the question of an abandonment of a patent is a question for the jury on a trial at law. If the invention be the mere speculation of a philosopher or mechanics an in his closet, and he takes no step towards obtaining a patent, but keeps his invention secret, and another person, who is also an original but subsequent inventor of the same thing, obtain a patent for it and bring it into use, it has been held, both in England and in this country, that the patentee, in a suit at law, is to becdnsideredas the first inventor. But it has happened in such case, as in many others, that elementary writers, and subsequent tribunals, have laid down the doctrine in broader terms than the cases upon which it was founded will warrant Thus Smi For in his Epitome of the Patent Laws, (p. 11,) says: " I t, sometimes happens that two men severally discover the same thing, each by his own un assisted exertions; when this happens, the first who communicates it to the public is deemed the first inventor and entitled to the patent" and he cites Moulton v. Full, 2. He, 487; Forsyth v. Riviere, Thirty, Prerog. of the Grown, 182,n.; Lewis v. Darling, 10 B. f C., 22; Good v. Summer, Bolt, X. P. C., 98; Edge bury v. Stephens, 2 Talk. 47. And Mr. Justicestory, in the case before cited, says: " The first inventor who has put the invention in practice, and he only, is entitled to a patent The doctrine thus broadly laid down is not supported to that extent by the case g cited, and it would be unjust if it were, for it makes no exception of the bone side first inventor who is "using reasonable diligence in adapting and perfecting" his intention, and whose right is saved by the spirit, if not the letter, of the fifteenth section of the act of 1836, which makes it a good defence to an action for in f ringing the patent, that the plaintiff had " unjustly obtained the patent for that which was in fact invented and disco 80 8 Of. overed by another who was using reasonable diligence in adapting or perfecting the samecid127If such a case had been presented to the mind of Mr. Justicestory, there can hardly be a doubt that he would have excepted it from the broad terms of the doctrine as laid by him in the case of Bedford v. Aunt. Such, from the evidence and admissions of counsel, was the case of Mr. Death. He was using reasonable diligence in adapting and perfecting his invention; and it appears by testimony a deduced by or. Hildreth that in the winter of 1839, before he obtained his patent, Mr. Death exhibited to the witness, Alfred Garrett, who had in his possession a model of Mr. Hildreths paddle gate, his, the said George Deaths, model of his gate, and claimed to be the inventor thereof; it is probable, therefore, that Mr. Hildreth had notice of Mr. Deaths claim before he obtained his patent. The doctrine as stated by Mr. Smith and by Mr. Justice Story seems to have originated in Hollands case, cited by Fuller, J., in the case of Moulton v. Well. Holland had a patent for an improvement in making object glasses for telescopes. It was objected that he was not the inventor, "but that Dr. All had made the same discovery before him. But it was hold en, that as Dr. All had confined it to his closet, and the public was not made acquainted with it, Holland was to be considered as the inventor The case of Holland is not reported; and all that we know of it is what was said by Fuller, J., in the case of Moulton v. Well, 2 H. He. 463 4; and upon that foundation is probably built the broad doctrine that the first of the two original inventors who communicate the invention to the public is entitled to the patent, although the other invented the thing first. Between simultaneous inventions this may be just, because neither can claim priority, but it cannot be just that the prior inventor, who is maturing his invention and preparing to make application for a patent in a reasonable time, should be defeated by a subsequent inventor who first obtains a patent. This is not the doctrine of Hollands case, which was only that an inventor who confines his invention to his closet, and does not communicate it to the public, and takes no steps towards obtaining a patent until a subsequent original inventor has obtained his patent. thereby forfeits and abandons his claim to priority of invention. But the question of forfeiture or abandonment is for the jury, upon a trial at law. The first inventor is prima face entitled to a patent, and the Commissioner, as before observed, is bound to issue it under the 7th section of the act of 1836, if certain facts should not appear to the Commissioner as therein specified; which specification of facts does not include delay or abandonment; so that the question of delay or abandonment is not, by that section, submitted to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner. I do not consider the expression "reduced to practice as importing the bringing the invention into use. When applied to an invention, it generally means the reducing it into such form that it   may be used, so as not to be a mere theory. If a machine be in x. a. 809 vested and described in such a manner that it may be made and used, and especially if a model be made, the invention may be said to be reduced to practice. In the present case, it is admitted in argument (and such is the evidence- that Mr. Death, in the summer of 1836, actually made a lock gate according to his specification. It was, indeed, a small one, a model only, but the size is of no importance. The thing was done; the invention was reduced to practice; and it was demonstrated thereby that the invention was practicable. I am, therefore, and for the reasons before stated, of opinion that where the invention is not of a mere philosophical speculation, abstraction, or theory, but of something corporal, something to be manufactured, the applicant need not show that he has reduced his invention to practice otherwise than by filing his specification and furnishing drawings and a model, as required by the statute, where the nature of the case admits of drawings or of a representation by a model. These having been thus filed and furnished by Mr. Death- and it being admitted that he, in point of time, was the first inventor of the thing patented, he is entitled to a patent there for notwithstanding the patent granted to Mr. Hildreth, unless he has lost his right by not filing a caveat, or by delay in applying for his patent 2. The second reason of appeal is, that Mr. Death never filed a caveat, pursuant to the 12th section of the act of July 4, 1836. That section was introduced for the benefit of the inventor, but was not necessary to the preservation of his right. It only enables him to have notice of any interfering application. God row (saw of Patents, 146) says: " Of its nature and effect much his conception has arisen. It does not create any right, but is simply a request to be favored with informationcid127) Again he says: "upon the whole, therefore, the entering of a caveat is nothing more than giving information that there is an invention nearly completed, and requesting that, if any other person should apply for a patent for the same thing, the preference may be given to him who entered it, which request is complied with by the courtesy of the crown, upon its being satisfied of its reasonableness by the attorney general, or the opinion of the lord chancellor; and when the patent is granted, it is to be judged of as if no caveat had been entered But this caveat gives no notice to the world, or even to the interfering applicant. It is notice to the Commissioner only; and is locked up in the secret and confidential archives of the office. I t would not in any manner have strengthened the title of Mr. Death nor does the omission of it impair that title, or aid that of Mr. I Hildreth. This reason of appeal, therefore, as well as the first, must be overruled 3. The statute does not limit any tit r e in which the inventor must apply for a patent; nor does it declare a forfeiture by reason, of any delay. The delay, therefore, seems to be unimportant, unless it amounts to evidence of abandonment of the claim. It is not one of the specified grounds for which the Commissioner is, by thelOcid127810Ex. 7th section of the act of 1836, authorized to refuse to grant the patent; and it seems to be a matter within the peculiar province of the jury upon a trial: at law, in any action which either of the patentees may institute against the other. If there be any limit of the time of application, it must be a reasonable limit, and that is proper matter for the consideration of a jury; and I am very much inclined to the opinion, that any matter of defence which it is the peculiar province of a jury to decide, and which is not by the 7th section of the act of 1836 made a ground for the refusal of a patent by the Commissioner, should be left by him to be decided by the jury in a subsequent action at law. In . Morris v. Hunting don, 1 Paine, 354, Mr. Justi  Of Thompsonsaid: "to, man is to be permitted to lie by for years and then take out a patent. If he has been practicing his invention with a view of improving it, and thereby rendering it a greater benefit to the public before taking out a patent, that ought not to prejudice him but it should always be a question submitted to the jury, what was the intent of the delay of the patent, and whether the allowing the invention to be used without a patent, should not be considered an abandonment, or present of it to the public n Pennock of Sellers v. Dialogue, 2 Peters, 16, Mr. Justi  Of Story, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: "I t has not been, and indeed cannot be, denied, that an inventor may abandon his invention and surrender or dedicate it to the public- "the question which generally arises at trials is a question of fact, rather than of law, whether the acts of acquiescence of the party furnish, in the given case, satisfactory proof of an abandonment, or dedicate on of the invention to the public." The point decided by the court in that case, was " that the first inventor cannot acquire a good title to a patent, if he suffers the thing invented -to go into public use, or to be publicly sold for use, before he makes application for a patent." But it is believed that it has not ,yet been decided that the right of the first inventor has been lost merely by lapse of time between the invention and application for the patent, unless there has been some intermediate use by the applicant, or by his consent and especially where he was bone side taking measures to improve or perfect his invention, and to prepare for applying for the patent which, from, the evidence, appears to have been the case of Or, Death. I f, therefore, the question of abandonment be cognizable by the Commissioner, there is, in' my opinion, no evidence to support it and this reason of appeal must also be overruled. It is, therefore, upon the whole case, my opinion, and I do so decide and ad judge, that the decision of the Commissioner of Patents in this cause be, and it is hereby, affirmed.

A the 19th of September, 1840, John Arnold made application for a patent for his invention of a (new and useful manner for, forming the web of felt cloth and web for other purposes" and in October following complied with the other requisites of the act of the 4th July, 1836. A caveat, however, had been entered by Leo. G. Bishop and John Skin, who claimed to be joint inventors with the said John Arnold of the same machine; and on the 20th of March, 1841, the said Bishop and Skin made application by petition for a patent for the same invention in the name of the said Bishop, Skin, and John Arnold, averting it to be the joint invention of the three. The Commissioner, on the 30th of March, 1841, decided them to be interfering claims, and notice was given to the parties by the Commissioner that he would hear them on the second Monday in May, 1841, and they respectively took the depositions of several witnesses. In the 16th of June, 1841, the Commissioner decided that it was to be considered a joint invention, and that neither of the parties can claim the whole, and rejected the applications of all the applicants. From this decision, Mr. Arnold has appealed, and the reasons stated are in effect : That the Commissioner has considered and acted upon evidence not competent according to the general rules of law, and upon testimony not taken according to the regulations prescribed and promulgated by himself; and that, indepen812Ex. den t of the evidence thus objected to, there is not sufficient to establish the fact of joint invention.

Bishops letters to the Commissioner of 7th of May and 12th June, 1841.5. Mr. Volleys deposition. One of the objections to the deposition of Mr. Fowler is, that the Commissioner of Needs, before whom the deposition was taken, has not certified upon the deposition, according to the 5th rule, that it was sealed up by him; and there is no evidence that it was in fact sealed up by him. By the act of March 3, 1839, 12, it is enacted, "that the Commissioner of Patents shall have power to make all such regulations, in respect to the taking of evidence to be used in contested cases before him, as may be just and reasonable Under this authority, the Commissioner made out and promulgated the following rulesRULES For Taki Of And Trasmi Tti  Of Evi   Dence, &c, Of The Commi Ssi    Oner Of Patents.

That, before the deposition of a witness or witnesses be taken by either party, notice should be given to the opposite party of the time and place when and where such deposition or deposition s will be taken; so that the opposite party, either in person or by attorney, shall have full opportunity to cross examine the witness or witnesses. And such notice shall, with proof of service of the same, be attached to the deposition or depositions, whether the party cross examine or not; and such notice shall be given in sufficient, time for the appearance of the opposite party, and for, the transmission of the evidence to the Patent Office before the day of hearing. ,4th. That no evidence, statement, or declaration, touching the matter at issue, will be considered upon' the said day of hearing, which shall not have been taken and filed in compliance with these rules: Provided, That if either party shall be unable, from good and sufficient reasons, to procure the testimony of a witness or with x. 
 813nesses, within the above stipulated time, then it shall be the duty of said party to give notice of the same to the Commissioner of Patents, accompanied with statements of the cause of such inability, which last mentioned notice to the Commissioner shall be received by him days previous to the day of hearing, aforesaid, viz: the day of next 5th. That all evidence, &c, shall be sealed up and addressed to the Commissioner of Patents, by the persons before whom it shall be taken, and so certified thereon. The first of these rules is evidently intended to apply to the initiator y proceedings in applications for patents, and to un contested cases, where the Commissioner may consider all the circumstances which may come to his knowledge. The other rules, viz: the 2d 3d, 4th, and 5th, are applicable to contested, cases, were parties are to be heard; and in such cases, inasmuch as each party is bound by the rules, each party is also entitled to the benefit of them. The 4th rule says: "that no evidence, statement, or declaration, touching the matter at issue, will be considered upon the said day of hearing which shall not have been taken and filed in compliance with, these rules." This is a restraint imposed upon the Commissioner himself as much as if the very words of the rule had been contained in the statute; for the rules, made in conformity with the law, while they remain un abrogated, are as binding as the law itself The rule is an assurance, an engagement, by the Commissioner, that he will not, at the hearing, consider any evidence not taken and filed in compliance with these rules; one of which was that the person taking the deposition should certify thereon that it was sealed up by him. This is not an in material form. It is a security that the deposition has not beed altered after it left the hands of the magistrate before whom the deposition was taken. In the rules which the Commissioner has promulgated, he has not- reserved any right to dispense with them, in particular cases, at hi a pleasure. After a deposition has been taken while {he rules were in force, his dispensations cannot affect that deposition. A re vocation of the rules can affect only subsequent proceedings. After a contest has arisen, the parties have a right to insist not only that the evidence should be taken agreeably to the rules prescribed by the Commissioner, but that it should be evidence competent in law. It is one of the rules in law, that no man can be a witness in his own cause, unless made competent by statute, or by being called upon by the opposing party to answer upon oath, as in cases of equity and admiralty jurisdiction, &c. If the witness is interested he is excluded, however small the amount of interest may be. Objection was made to the taking of the deposition of Or, Fowler, at the time of taking it, because of his interest, and because the notice was too short; because the magistrate was not named before whom the deposition was taken, and because the time was so late that Mr. Arnold would not have time to takecountervailing testimony814Ex. the interest of Mr. Fowler in the patent right is the same, whether the patent should be granted to Mr. Arnold alone, or jointly to the three applicants; for his only interest is as a member of the company to whom all the applicants have bound themselves to convey the patent right when obtained. If the covenants do not cover the claim for a patent, then Mr. Fowler is not interested a tall. If they do cover it, then it is in material to' him which of the claimants obtains the patent. The objection to the shortness of the notice is answered by the fact that Mr. Arnold did appear at the time and place, and cross examined the witness. The lateness of the time is no cause for rejecting the deposition; but it might, perhaps, have been good ground for an application to the Commissioner of Patents to allow further time for taking other testimony which he might deem important in the cause. But the objection that the magistrate, before whom the deposition was taken, did not certify thereon that it was sealed up by him, is sufficient ground for excluding that deposition from the, consideration, of the Commissioner of Patents. This evidence, then, being excluded, there remains only, on the part of Messrs. Bishop and Skin, the deposition of Mr. Lownsberry. This deposition is admitted to have been taken' and transmitted according to the rules; but it is said that it shows Mr. Lownsberryto be so interested as to be an incompetent witness. In that respect, however, he stands on the same ground with Mr. Fowler, and the same answer is applicable to him. It appears by his deposition, that the idea of crossing the woolidiagonally was suggested by Mr. Bishop and Mr. Clean, or one of them, before Arnold was applied to, or had any connexion with the company in which Lownsberry, Bishop, and Clean was concerned; that, upon the recommendation of Mr. 'moulton, Bishop as agent of the company, applied to Arnold to make the necessary machinery, who undertook the work, and was to have one fifth of the concern; that he made a machine for crossing the wool at right angles, and, obtained a patent for it in 1829 or 1830, which was afterwards improved by him and Bishop, who obtained a patent for the improvement in their name; that Bishop frequently, from 1828,to 1837, urged the building of a machine to cross the wool diagonally, to which Mr. Lownsberry was opposed. The machine, however, was built in 1837, by Arnold and Skin, for the company, who paid them for building it. It has always been in possession of the company, and owned by them; that the machine is the same spoken of by Alonzo C. Arnold in his deposition, and the model of which was sent to the Patent Office by Bishop, in March, 1841. That one objection to adopting the 'diagonal machine was, that it would interfere with a patent machine then in operation at At skill; but the right angled machine did not interfere, and made a better article. That the claim of Bishop and Skin is made for the benefit of the company, and that whether the patent be taken out in the joint. X. a. 81 5 names of Bishop, Skin, and Arnold, or of Arnold alone, the benefit of it is to be assigned and transferred to the company under certain covenants, entered into by all of them, to the company; and copies of these covenants are filed with the papers in this cause. He does not know who invented the machine built by Arnold in 1837, but it is the same mode which had been agitated by Bishop, and occasionally by Arnold during their connexion in business. That Skin suggested alterations while the machine in 1837 was putting up, and after it was up, to make it go better; that he did the greater part of the work; cannot explain the alterations, nor the difficulties to be overcome, but it did not operate at all. I t seems to me that there is enough in this deposition to showthatMr. Arnold was not the sole inventor of the principle of crossing the wool diagonally, or of the machine for reducing that principle to practice; and, if not the sole inventor, he is' not entitled to a patent. There is no claim before in e upon this appeal but that of Mr. Arnold. Bishop and Skin have not appealed from the decision of the Commissioner rejecting their joint claim. It appears by Lownsberrys deposition that the principle or mode of crossing the wool diagonally was suggested and contemplated by Bishop and Clean before Arnold was employed by them to reduce their ideas to practice. The, machine did not constitute the whole invention. The next material part of the invention was the principle, i. e, the diagonal motion, which was to distinguish this machine from all other felting machines; and it is the vibratory and rotary motions which produce the diagonal crossing of the wool, which Mr. Arnold claims as his invention, and for which he asks a patent. The man who reduces to practice the theory of another who assists in the reduction of it to practice, cannot be considered as the sole inventor of the machine. Arnold would not have made the machine unless informed by Bishop of the discovery which he had made of the effect of the diagonal crossing of the wool. The invention consisted both of the discovery of the principle and the reduction of it to practice. Either Bishop nor Arnold, therefore, could be considered as sole inventor. It appears also by the deposition of Henry Lamb, taken by Mr. Arnold, that the machine, when first put up" would not go" that Skin went up to remedy the defect, and that the witness afterwards saw it in operation in the fall of 1837, or spring of 1838; and that he never heard Arnold claim the patent right until within a year. I see nothing in the deposition of Alonzo C. Arnold inconsistent with the facts stated by Mr. Lownsberry in his deposition; but if there were, Alonzo C. Arnold seems, by his own showing, to be interested by the promise of his father, to give him a share in the patent if it should be obtained; for, although afterward, in answer to the leading question, he said the agreement was abandoned, yet it is evidence that in the preceding part of his deposition, he thought it depended upon his generosity whether he should have an interest in the patent when obtained. If this interest, however 8 16 X. was not sufficiently certain to exclude his testimony, it cannot fail to have some effect upon its credibility. But he states that the machine was put in operation in 1837, and his father never spoke with him about getting the patent, now applied for, until the summer of 1840, and after his father had ceased to be a member of the Union manufactory, who claim the benefit of the patent under the agreement -before mentioned, if it should be obtained by either or all of the claimants. It may be inferred from this, that so long as he remained a member of the company he did not claim a sole right, or any right to the invention. Another strong argument that he did not claim to be the inventor during those three years, results from his suffering the machine to be set up and used during that period without taking any steps to secure a patent, when, by the terms of the acts of 1836 and 1839, the use of the machine, with his consent, for two years prior to his application is a bar to his claim. That fact, indeed, seems to be a bar to all their claims, and to put an end to this controversy; for, if a patent should now be granted to any of them, and an action should be brought by the patentee for a violation of the patent right, it seems that the defend art might defend himself under the 15th section of the act of 1836, and the 7th section of the act of 1839, by showing that the machine had been in public use, with the consent of the patentee, for more than two years prior to the application for the patent. It is suggested, in the reasons of appeal, that if the decision of the Commissioner is sustained, there does not appear to be any possible mode of determining this question; and that it is only by granting the patent to Arnold, that the rights of the individuals interested, and of the public, can be determined according to the intention of the acts of Congress for the promotion of the useful acts. But upon comparing the 16th section of the act of 1836 with the 10th section of the act of 1839, it will appear that, "in all cases where patents are refused, for any reason whatever, either by the Commissioner of Patents, or by the chief justice of the District of Columbia, upon appeals from the decision of said Commissioner" the "applicant may have remedy by bill in equity and the court having cognizance thereof, on notice to adverse parties, and other due proceedings had 5 "may ad judge that such applicant is entitled, according to the principles and provisions of the act of 1836, to have and receive a patent for his invention, as specified in his claim" "and such adjudication, if it be in favor of the right of such applicant, shall authorize the Commissioner to issue such patent on his filing a copy of the adjudication, and otherwise complying with the requisitions of that act The reservation of a right to a further hearing on the part of or. Arnolds attorney, was confined to the case of my admitting the evidence which he objected to; and, as I have rejected that evidence, any further hearing is unnecessary. Upon the whole, then, after rejecting the evidence, I am of opinion that Mr. Arnold has not supported his claim .as sole in x. a. 817Tentor; and that if he had, he has lost his right to a patent, by suffering the machine to be in use for more than two years before his application for a patent; and that, therefore, and upon both grounds, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, rejecting his el aim, ought to be, and it is hereby affirmed. W. Cranch. October 29, 1841. Subsequent to this decision of the honorable judge, he transmitted a second opinion to the office, in the following wordsJOHN Arnold, appeal ant, (cid127vs. Appeal from the decision of the Conmgeorgeg. Of Shop & John missioner of Patents. Aki N, appellees. After I had sent my opinion in this case to the Commissioner of Patents, on the 30th of October last, I was satisfied that I had his apprehended the attorney of Mr. Arnold, in supposing that, in case I should sustain his objections to the testimony and evidence on the part of the appellees, he would not desire to be further heard, I therefore determined to hear his further argument, on the 20 th instant, at my chambers, of which I gave notice to the attorneys of the parties, and they attended, viz: Doctor Bones on the part of the appeal ant, and Mr. For fit on the part of the appelleesMr. Fitzgerald also attended on behalf of the Patent Office, to give any explanations, &c, which might be required. Doctorjones then presented his further argument, in writing, in which he contended that this claim of Mr. Arnold for a patent is not included in the covenant to the Union Manufacturing Company, of which Mr. Lownsberry is a member; and, therefore, that the interest of Mr. Lownsberry "cannot be the same whether the patent should be granted to Arnold or to the three applicants cannot, however, perceive how that consequence should follow. It is only by introducing the assignments and covenants by Mr. Arnold to the Union Manufacturing Company, and by showing that these covenants cover this claim, that Mr. Lownsberry is supposed to be interested. If those covenants do not cover this claim, then Mr. Lownsberryis not interested; and if they do, then, as all the applicants a rebound by similar covenants, it is not material to him which prevails. The only question for me to decide is that which is suggested by the reasons of appeal, viz: whether Mr. Arnold was the sole inventor of the machine. To that question it is wholly in material whether it be an entirely new machine, or an improvement upon an old one. Upon a careful review of the depositions of Alonzo C. Arnold, Mr. Waters, and Mr. Lamb, taken on the part of the appeal ant, and of that of Mr. Lownsberry, on the part of the appeal lee, I am still of opinion that Mr. Arnold has not supported his claim as soleinventor818 X. a. But it is suggested that there is no law which authorizes the Commissioner of Patents to withhold the grant of a patent, in the case in question, that is, where the applicant is not the sole inventor, that it is not one of the grounds, stated in the 7th section of the act of 1836, which would justify the Commissioner in refusing the patent; and that the only one of these grounds which can be supposed to apply to this case is, its appearing to the Commissioner that the same thing had been invented or discovered by some other person prior to 'the alleged invention or discovery by the applicant. But by the sixth section of the same act, the applicant must be the inventor. One of the three joint inventors cannot with propriety be called the inventor; and if he applies for the patent, the Commissioner is bound to refuse it. This seems to be admitted in the reasons of appeal, where it is said that Arnold, who has sworn that he was the original and first inventor, cannot, without admitting that he has been guilty of per jury, acknowledge that Bishop and Skin were joint inventors with him, and that, upon their own showing, a patent cannot be granted to Bishop and Skin without, the concurrence of Arnold. Were, then, is the authority of the Commissioner to withhold a patent from an applicant who is not the sole inventor. In my former opinion in this case, I stated as one of the grounds for affirming the decision of the Commissioner of Patents rejecting the claim of Mr. Arnold, that he had lost his right, if he had any, by suffering the machine to be in use for more than two years before his application for a patent. I should have said " public use, which are the words of the statute. But, upon reflection, I doubt whether I can decide upon any other matter than that which arises upon the reasons of appeal. The words of the act of 1839,section eleven, which confer the jurisdiction upon the judge, after allowing the applicant a right to appeal, by giving notice thereof to the Commissioner, filing his reasons of appeal, and paying intothe office twenty-five dollars to the credit of the patent fund, are: " and it shall be the duty of the said chief justice, on petition, to hear and determine all such appeals, and to revise such decisions in a summary way, on the evidence produced before the Commissioner, at such early and convenient time as he may appoint, first notifying the Commissioner of the time and place of hearing; whose duty it shall be to give notice thereof to all parties who appear to be interested therein, in such manner as said judge shall prescribe. The Commissioner shall also lay before the judge all the original papers and evidence in the case, together with the grounds of his decision, fully set forth in writing, touching all the points involved in the reasons of appeal Of Whi Of The Revi   Of    Of Shall Of Confi Ned, i. e, the revision by the judge shall be confined to the points involved in the reasons of appeal. He is to " hear and determine such appeals~ but he is to revise the decision of the Commissioner only in respect to the points involved in the reasons of appeal. If the Commissioner did not err in those points, his decision upon those points must be affirmed, although the judge should x. a. 19 be of opinion, upon the evidence and the merits, of the whole case, that the patent ought to have been granted; so, if the judge should reverse the decision of the Commissioner up of those points, it would seem that the patent must issue, although the judge should be of opinion that upon the whole case, as it appears in evidence before him, the patent ought not to issue. I say this would seem to be the effect of such a decision; because the effect of such a decision upon the further proceedings of the Commissioner would depend upon the question whether the reasons of appeal thus affirmed, by the judge, involved the merits of the case. If they did not, the Commissioner might well say: it is true, I erred in those points, but my objections to the issuing of the patent still exist untouched by the decision of the judge. The words of the act are, that the judges decision " shall govern the further proceedings of the Commissioner in such case." This must apply only to so much of the case as is involved in the reasons of appeal; and the appeal itself can be considered only as an appeal to so much of the decision of the cornnmissioner as is effected by such reasons. I f, therefore, after the judge shall have decided in favor of the applicant upon the points involved in his reasons of appeal, other sufficient reasons remain for rejecting the claim for a patent, untouched by the decision of the judge, it would seem that the Commissioner might properly still reject it. Whether such new rejection would be subject to appeal, is a question which may be left, as well as the effect of the judgment of the judge in regard to the subsequent proceedings of the Commissioner, to future decision, as cases may arise requiring a decision upon those points. For these reasons, I doubt very much whether it was competent for me to decide in this case, that Mr. Arnold has lost his right to a patent by suffering the machine to be in public use for more than two years before his application for a patent. To much, therefore, of my former opinion in this case maybe considered as extra judicial and as withdrawn. This renders it unnecessary to. answer the very ingenious argument of Mr. Arnoldsattorney upon that point; which argument, however, has not in any degree diminished my confidence in the correctness of the opinion which I have thus withdrawn. His withdrawal does not in any manner affect the judgment which I certified on the 29th of October, 1841, inasmuch as I am still of opinion that Mr. Arnold has not supported his claim as the sole inventor of the machine for which he claims a patent. The judgment, -therefore, rendered by me, and certified on the 2 9th of October last, must stand as my final decision in the case. W. Cranch. November 25, 1841.820 X. a. Judgment in the case.

W. Cranch. Washi Ngton, October 29, 1841. Of Chambers, Jvouv. 21, 1842. Ralph Pomeroy, appeal ant, Alex. Conni Son, appeal lee, Alexander Connison applied for a patent. The Commissioner of Patents being of opinion that the patent applied for would, if granted, interfere with a prior un expired patent to Ralph Some roy, granted on the 24th of January, 1841, gave him notice thereof, under the 8th section of the act of July 4, 1836,chap. 357, vol. 8, p. 549, and he appeared before the Commissioner of Patents and contested the right of Mr. Connison, who claimed to be the first inventor. The Commissioner, on the 25th of July, 1842, decided "that a patent ought to issue to Alexander Connison, as the first original inventor, and that the same be accordingly issued, unless an appeal be entered within ten days From this decision Mr. Some roy appealed, and filed his reasons of appeal. The Commissioner has laid before the Judge the grounds of his decision in writing, with the original papers, and the evidence in the cause. The first question is, has the Judge jurisdiction upon this appeal from the decision of the Commissioner, not rejecting but granting the application x. a. 821 n no other case under the patent laws can an appeal be taken from the decision of the Commissioner, unless the application for a patent has been rejected by him. In no other case can an appeal be taken to the granting of a patent; and the reason for giving an appeal from the rejection of an application for a patent, and not giving an appeal from the granting of a patent, is, that the applicant whose application is rejected has no remedy. He cannot go into a court of law or of equity to obtain a patent; nor can he maintain any action for the use of his invention. But if the Commissioner should grant a patent erroneously, its validity may be tried; and any person interested may defeat it by a suit at law or in equity. The general object of giving an appeal under the patent laws, therefore, is to correct the error of the Commissioner in refusing to grant the patent applied for. His error in granting a patent is corrected by the ordinary tribunals of the country; and there was no need of a special tribunal for that purpose. This general object seems to me to govern all the provisions of the laws upon this subject, and ought to be taken into consideration in their construction. Thus in the 7th section of the act of July 4, 1836; "if the specification and claim shall not have been so modified as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, shall entitle the applicant to a patent, he may on appeal, and upon request in writing, have the decision of aboard of examiners" &c, who may reverse the decision of the Commissioner. And by the 16th section, the remedy given by bill in equity is confined to the case of two interfering patents, and to the refusal of the board of examiners to grant a patent. The provisions of this section are, by the 10th section of the act of 1839,extended to all cases where patents are refused, for any reason whatever, by the Commissioner of Patents or by, the Judge, &c. The proceedings before the Commissioner and before the Judge by appeals are all initiator all relating to the question whether a patent shall issue; they cannot effect a patent already issued. Such are the provisions of the act of 1836, sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11, 12 and 16,and of the act of 1839, sections 10 and 11. There is no section or clause of either of the acts which gives a patentee a right of appeal from the decision of the Commissioner, granting a patent to another person, unless that right be given by the 8th section of the act of 1836. By 'that section it is enacted "that whenever an application shall be made for a patent which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, would interfere with any other patent for which an application may be pending, or with any un expired patent which shall have been granted, it shall be the duty of the Cornmissioner to give notice thereof to such applicant, or patentee, as the case may be and if either shall be dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner, on the question of priority of right or invention, on a hearing thereof, he t may appeal from such decision, on the like terms and conditions as are provided in the preceding section of this act and the like proceedings shall be had to determine which or x. whether either of the applicants is entitled to receive a patent a sprayed for The power and jurisdiction given by the patent laws to the board of examiners and to the judge are special and limited, and must be construed and exercised strictly. The judge can only decide such questions, and render such judgment as he is expressly authorized by the statues to decide and render. In the case stated in the 8th section of the act of 1836 the judge is only " to determine which or whether either of the applicants is entitled to receive a patent as prayed for. ' He can only act in a case where there are contending applicants for a patent, and those applicants must have 94 prayed for" a patent. A patentee is not an applicant. He has already obtained all he asked for. If his patent can be supported at law, he has nothing to fear. The grant of a subsequent patent erroneously to another cannot affect the validity of his patent. The judge is to determine which or whether either of the applicants is entitled " to receive" a patent. It would be absurd to say that a patentee is entitled to receive the patent after he he has already received it. It is true that the 8th section, after speaking of applicants and patentees, says, if either shall be dissatisfied, he may appeal. The word " either" may be satisfied by applying it to the words " suck applicants; i. e, " either" of " such applicants." And that such was the understanding of the legislature seems probable, from the fact that they have only authorized the judge to determine between contending applicants, and not between an applicant and a patentee for when they come to say what the judge is to do upon the appeal, we find it is " to determine which or whether either of the applicants is entitled to cet ve a patent a sprayed for." The word " either" in the former parts of the clause is here explained to mean either of the applicants. It cannot be contended that the judge is to decide whether a patentee is entitled to receive a patent which he has already received, and which he still has in his possession. This construction of this section is corroborated by the reference to it in the 11th section, which gives a right to file a caveat; and where it is said, that " if in the opinion of the Commissioner the specifications of claim interfere with each other, like proceedings may be had in all respects as are provided in the case of interfering applications" (i. e, in the 8th section The 16th section seems to give the remedy in a case of interfering patents, which this will be if the Commissioner shall issue a patent to Mr. Conpison. It also provides for the case where a patent is refused by the board of examiners, on the ground that it would interfere with an un expired patent; and the provisions of this section are extended by the 10th section of the act of 1839, to all cases of refusal by the Commissioner or the Judge. When the patent has issued the jurisdiction of the Commissioner is exhausted. He has no further control over it, except in the case provided for in the 13th section of the 4 act of 1836, where the patent is inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient822Ex. 
823description. An adjudication upon it by the Commissioner or the Judge has no effect upon a patent already granted, and is entirely inoperative as to the rights of the parties, unless the decision be against the applicant, against whom it would be conclusive, unless an appeal were given by the statute. He could apply to no other tribunal. But as to the patentee, a decision against him would be a brutumfulmen; and if the second patentee should do any act under his patent to the supposed injury of the first patentee, he would have a right of action, and might maintain the validity of his patent in the same manner and to the same effect as if the second patent had not issued. When the commissioner inquires as to the relative priority of invention between the applicant and the patentee, it is only for the purpose of setting aside the patent already granted, over which he has no control. The decision of the Commissioner does not affect the patentee if his patent is valid, and if it is invalid, he has no right to complain. There was no necessity, therefore, that the patentee should have va right to appeal from the decision of the Commissioner, which could have no effect i upon his rights. This is a sufficient reason why the legislature should not give him a right to appeal in such a case. He has already abundant means of redress, both at law and in equity, if his patent is valid, and should be violated; and this accounts for the restraining the action of the Judge to the case of contending applicants. An appeal is given to a disappointed applicant, because otherwise the decision of the Commissioner would be conclusive against him. It is not given to the patentee, because the decision of the Commissioner is not only conclusive as to him, but does not in any manner affect his legal or equitable rights; and if the patent should be issued to Mr. Connison by the Commissioner, the act of 1836, section 16, expressly gives him a remedy in equity, where he may have the benefit of the oath of the second patentee, in addition to all legal evidence taken according to the rules of a court of equity, which has power and jurisdiction to act effectually in the case, and to ad judge either of the patents to be void; or, if he does not like the remedy by bill in equity, he may bring an action at law for a violation of his patent; in which case, its validity may be tried and decided. In either of these cases, his remedy is full and conclusive, whereas if he were to have an appeal, he would not thereby have any conclusive or effectual remedy, for, if upon such appeal he should prevail in reversing the decision of the Commissioner, the reversing decision would not be final and conclusive upon Mr. Connison. He would still have his remedy upon a bill in equity, under the same 16th section. I am therefore of opinion that the legislature designedly limited the authority of the judge to the decision of the question, " which or whether either of the applicants is entitled to receive a patent as prayed for" and that as, in this case, there is only one applicant, I have no jurisdiction in it under the 8th section of the act of 1836. The only other case of appeal provided for in the statutes, is824Ex. where the application for a patent is rejected; and as the application of Mr. Connison was not rejected, but sustained, I have no jurisdiction of the appeal of Mr. Some roy, who is not an applicant. Believing that I have no jurisdiction in this case, and that Mr. Some roy has all his rights and remedies reserved to him by the statutes upon this subject, I shall return the papers to the Patentoffice, with a certificate of the substance of this opinion. W. Cranch. November 22, 1842. Benjami N . Smi Of, appeal ant, )a) Appeal from Commissioner of. Patents. Fli  Ckenger and Knit, appellees) For. Smith was an applicant for a patent for a machine for separating garlic from wheat. The Commissioner being of opinion that it would interfere with a patent already granted to Flickenger & Grim, gave notice thereof to the applicant and patentees, as required by the act of Congress of the 4th of July, 1836, ch. 357, see. 8, and assigned the 19th of December, 1842, for hearing the parties upon the question of priority of invention. Upon that day ii appeared that the deposition son the part of the applicant, Mr. Smith, were taken and transmitted in due form, according to the regulations which the Commissioner of Patents had (by virtue of the 12th see. of the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1839) made " in respect to the taking of evidence to be used in contested cases before him." The, deposition on the part of the patentees, Flickenger & Grim, were correctly taken, but not transmitted in the form required by these regulations, and, therefore, according to the Commissioners 4th rule, could not be considered by him upon the day assigned for hearings touching the matter at issue. But as it appeared to the Commissioner that the facts stated in the depositions thus informally transmitted would, but for that informality, clearly show that the applicant was not the first and original inventor, he postponed the hearing to the 27th of February, 1843; of which he gave to Mr. Smith the following notice: " Patent Offi Of, December 20, 1842."The day of hearing in the matter of interference between your claims and those of Messrs. Flickenger & Grim has been postponed to the 27th of February, 1843, the evidence on their part being informal in the manner of transmission to the Commissioner of Patents.

Smith; of Massillon, Stark i county, Ohio, and Messrs. Daniel Click en- Pae Ffi Her and Sebastian Grim, of Hanover, York Web. , 1843.county, Pennsylvania, for an alleged improvement in separating garlic from wheat by means of elastic rollers, &c." This case came up for hearing on the 27th instant, and on examination of the evidence on the part of Messrs. Flickenger and grim, it appears that he invented and constructed a machine for separating garlic from wheat, by passing the grain between elastic boilers, in the year 1835. In the part of Penn M. Smith, it appears that he first invented a similar machine in the year 1837. The testimony on both sides being duly taken and transmitted to this office, it is hereby decided that Messrs. Flickenger and Grim are the first and original, inventors of the said improvement, and, as such, entitled to their patent." H. L. Ellsworthfrom this decision Mr. Smith has appealed, and filed his reasons of appeal, with a petition that it may be heard and determined. Those reasons of appeal are 1st. That the Commissioner could not lawfully postpone the hearing of the case from the 19th of December, 1842, to the 27th, of February, 1843, on account of anything appearing in the depositions which had been informally transmitted; because, by the 4th of the rules which he had made in respect to the taking of evidence to be used in contested cases before him, he had preclude himself from considering any " evidence, statement, or declarationcid127cid127l upon the day of hearing, which shall not have been taken and filed in compliance with these rules" unless in the case provided for in that rule, which case is not applicable to these patentees. The applicant contends that it was his right to have the case decided on the 19th of December, 1842, (the day assigned for the hearing) upon such legal and competent evidence as was then before the Commissioner, who had no authority to postpone the hearing without the consent of the applicant, upon any ground appearing in the depositions informally transmitted 2. The second reason of appeal is, "that the appellees did not give a sufficient time for the appearance of the opposite party to cross examine the witness, as required by the rules for taking evidence; and therefore the deposition taken by the appellees on the 2 3d of February, 1843, is not legal, and should not have been entertained in deciding the case; for the appeal ant would have been required to travel 400 miles in three days to appear at the time appointed for taking the evidence, which is obviously impossible These are all the reasons of appeal alleged by the appeal ant, and to these the "revision" is expressly required to be "confined' and the appeal ant says, at the close of his first reasons of appeal, that x. 
827hle has fore borne to go into the merits "of the two claims at this time, because he considered his right to a patent, under the rules, as fully substantiated, and prefers deciding the validity of the former patent before a jury The grounds of the Commissioners decision, which he is required by the 11th section of the act of March 3d, 1839, fully to set forth in writing, are to be confined to the points involved in the reasons of appeal. As to the first reason of appeal the postponement of the hearing he says that, "upon examination of the papers, the affidavitsclearly showed that Mr. Smith was not the first and original inventor; That "the affidavits to show this were duly taken, but not duly transmitted." That this fact was presented "to his consideration by the examiner, and that having a due regard to the public interest, he postponed the case to a future day, giving both parties the, opportunity to procure further testimony, if they thought proper" of which he gave notice to Mr. Smith by the letter produced by him with his reasons of appeal. That "no motion of the opposite party was filed for postponement' and "that he adopted that course to further the ends of justices to the second reason of appeal, that sufficient time was not given to Mr. Smith, the appeal ant, to be present at the taking of the deposition on the 2 3d of February, 1843. The Commissioner says that "this objection did not arise at the time of trial, and should have then been made; but Mr. Smith was anxious to hasten rather than postpone the case, for any cause53The question arising upon the first reason of appeal is, whether the Commissioner was bound to hear and decide on the merits of the case upon the evidence which was regularly taken and transmitted to him, and which, according to his rule for taking and transmitting evidence, he could, on the 19th of December, 1842,have considered upon the hearing of the matter at issue, or whether he had a right to postpone the hearing, to enable the patentees to cure an informality in the transmission of their evidence, if he should deem such a postponement necessary to further the ends of justice; giving, at the same time, to both parties, an opportunity to procure further testimony. The argument of the appeal ant rests upon the construction of the fourth of the five rules made by the Commissioner "in respect to the taking of evidence to be used in contested cases before him, "which rules were made by virtue of the power given him in the 12th section of the act of March 3d, 1839. The fourth rule is in these words: "4th. That no evidence, statement or declaration, touching the matter at issue, shall be considered upon the said day of hearing, which shall not have been taken and filed in compliance with the rule: provided, that if either party shall be unable, from good and sufficient reason, to procure the testimony of a witness or witnesses within the above stipulated time, then it shall be the duty of said party to give notice of the same to the Commissioner of Patents 828 X. accompanied with statements of the cause of such inability; which last mentioned notice to the Commissioner shall be received by him ten days previous to the day of hearing aforesaid, viz: the day of next t is contended by the counsel of the appeal ant, not only that the Commissioner cain not consider the deposition, informally transmitted, as evidence upon the hearing of the matter in issue, but that he cannot look into it for any purpose, and therefore there was no cause whatever for post poning the hearing; and that, for that reason, the decision of the Commissioner upon the merits of the case ought to be reversed. But the prohibition contained in the rule is not to the Commissioners looking into the deposition thus informally transmitted, or to his reading it and ascertaining its contents; but to his considering it, on the day of hearing, as evidence touching the matter a tissue. The Commissioner does not consider it, upon the day of hearing, as evidence touching the matter ,at issue, and in that respect complied with his own rule. The proviso in the 4th rule is applicable only to the case where the party is unable to procure the testimony "in sufficient time for the appearance of the, opposite party, and for the transmission of the evidence to the Patent Office before the day of hearing, in which case it shall be the duty of said party to give notice of these -to the Commissioner of Patents." But the rule does not say what the Commissioner shall do in consequence of such notice whether he shall receive the testimony, although taken without reasonable notice, or whether he shall postpone the hearings that if the patentees had given such notice to the Commissioner he would have still been as much without power to postpone the hearing as he was on the 19th of December, 1842. The notice therefore would have availed them nothing There is nothing in the laws relating to the Patent Office, or in the rules adopted by the Commissioner, to prevent him from post poning the hearing of a cause, if, in his opinion, the justice of the case should require it, and especially for the correcting of an irregularity in matters of form. To deny him this power, would be to stifle justice in her own forms 2. As to the 2d reason of appeal, viz: that sufficient time was not given to Mr. Smith to be present at the taking of the deposition, taken on the 2 3d of February, 1843, it is a sufficient answer to say, that the objection was not made at the hearing; but it appears also that the notice was served on Mr. Smith, personally, on the 11th of February, at Massillon, in Stark county, in Ohio, to take the de positions of witnesses at Manhime, in York county, in Pennsylvania, on the 2 3d of February eleven days which seems to be a reasonable time, even if the distance was 400 miles, as suggested in the reasons of appeal. Upon the whole, therefore, I am of opinion that in this case the alleged reasons of appeal are not sufficient to sustain it, and that x. a. 829 the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, as to all the points involved in the said reasons, must be affirmed.

Appeal by John Cochrane fromJOHN Cochrane, appeal ant, the decision of the Commit inner of Patents, refusing to grant him is. a patent for a machine for sneering vessels, styled "the spring tillerHENRY Waterman, appeal lee, selfcompensating steering may chin ely the 11th section of the act of the 3d March, 1839, ch. 88,the re version of the decision of the Commissioner is to be "confined to the grounds of his decision, fully set forth in writing, touching all the points involved by the reasons of appeal or. Cochrane in his specification says: "the nature of my invention consists in applying the endless screw or worm working in cogs on the periphery of a quarante, to the moving or holding of the r udder; and, also, in the application of springs to compensate for the action of the sea on the rudderThe Commissioner refused to grant the patent, because as to the first supposed improvement, viz: the application of the endless screw to the cogs on the periphery of a quarante, it was not the invention of an improvement; and as the second improvement, viz the springs on the tiller, it would interfere with a patent already granted to Henry Watermanthe reasons of appeal from the decision are, in substance first, that the application of the endless screw, &c, is an invention of an improvement on the machinery of steering vessels, within the 8 30 X. meaning of the sixth section of the act of the 4th of July, 1836; ch 375; and, secondly, that he was the first inventor of the spring tiller; and, therefore, the patent ought not to have been granted to Later man, and ought now to be granted to him, Cochrane. The Commissioner, in stating his reasons for his decision, contends that the substitution of a known mechanical equivalent is not an invention within the patent law; and I think he is right. In some machines the moving power is communicated by a band. If I were to substitute a opinion for the band, I do not think it could be considered as an invention for which I could obtain a patent. A. Upon the first point, therefore, the decision of the Commissioner is affirmed. The second question is, whether Mr. Cochrane was the first inventor of the spring tiller, according to the evidence before theCommissionerUpon this point it is necessary to ascertain what the evidence was. James Cochrane testified in his deposition, taken on the 5th of March, 1844, at Baltimore, " that he knows that the compensation g principle in the steering machine was invented by John Cochrane, the claimant, by the application of steel springs to the r udder, prior to the 19th day of October, 1835." He " heard him describe their position on the r udder and explain their use, which was to ease off the action of the sea on the r udder, previous to the said 19th of October, 1835,6The endless screw and wheel is a common mechanical power, applicable to an indefinite number of machines, and the mere application of it to a machine, to which it had never before been applied would not be an invention, although it might make the machine better than it would have been without it. There may be innumerable cases in which that mechanical power may be used with great effect; but it does not follow that the person using it is thereby entitled to a patent. The fact that it enables the helm s man to hold and stay the r udder with more ease, results from the nature of the power, and is a property belonging to it wherever used; for the power of the helm s man is applied slowly at the long end of the lever against the power of the r udder, which works at the short end. This property is not now for the first time discovered. The application of it to the steering of vessels seems to be no more entitled to a patent, than if it had been applied to a kitchen jack for roasting. It seems to me to be an ordinary power applied to an ordinary purpose, and that the application of it is not an invention within the meaning of the patent law 2. Richard Cochrane in his deposition, taken at Newark, Newjersey, March 16th, 1844, says: " That the invention was made in the year 1835, but cannot now recollect any fact by which to ascertain in his own mind the exact date' That part of his deposition, in which he says that The distinctly remembers that the inventor, X. a. 831John Cochrane, said, years ago, that it was on the 7th of February, at 10 o clock at night" is not competent evidence in this cause. The de potent further testified that he "was present when the invention was made, and recollects that it was at night' He further testified that, "in the month of October, 1835, he had a conversation with Captain Scott, of the brig Planter, of Baltimore, Maryland, on the principle on which steering machines should act, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the springs were as important in steering as the said John Cochrane supposed; but that he, de potent is certain that this invention was in existence before said conversation with Captain Scott." He further testified that "the model deposited at Washington is the same in substance or principle as when first invented by John Cochrane." The letter of Captainibunker, of the 15th of February, 1843, a copy of which was enclosed in Mr. John Cochranes letter of the 22d of March, 1844, to the Commissioner of Patents, is not evidence in this cause; and, if it were, it does not give any information as to the priority of invention of the spring tiller. All the evidence in favor of the appeal ant upon that point is contained in the deposition of James and Richard Cochrane, and they, do not carry back the, date of the invention to any certain time prior to the 19th of October, 1835. The only evidence of Henrywatermans priority of invention of the spring tiller is contained in the deposition of Stephen Later man, who testified that in . April or May, 1835,he had a conversation with his brother Henry, in relation to the application of springs to the head of the r udder, and, again in July, 1839" that, at both of said interviews, said Henrywaterman described to de potent his said invention, the same as the one patented to him in Washington." That in February, 1843, thedeponent being about to go to Washington, Henry Later man furnished him with a model of his invention. That, being in Newyork, they called to see Mr. Cochranes model, and Henry Later man showed his own model. That the de potent asked Mr. Pal stead, who had charge of Mr. Cochranes model, how long it had been invented? and the de potent thinks he stated in reply, seven or eight years. The de potent annexes to his deposition an original letter from himself to his brother Henry; but it is of no importance. This deposition appears to have been taken in the presence offer. Cochrane, and carries back the date of Watermans invention of the spring tiller to April of May, 1835, whereas the date of Mrcochranes invention is not carried back with any degree of certainty beyond the 19th, of October, 1835. The Commissioner of Patents, therefore, was bound, as the case appeared in evidence before him, to refuse to grant a patent to Mr. Cochrane. Mr. Cochrane, in stating the reasons of his appeal, has alleged that Mr. Later man obtained his patent surreptitiously. There is no evidence to. support this charge. The reasons of appeal are extended at great length, and for the most part are founded upon the assumption of facts, of which there was no competent evidence before the Commissioner. , .1. There is no evidence that either of the applicants for the 832 X. patent had reduced the invention of the spring tiller to practice. The letter of Captain Bunker is not ad missile evidence 2. There is no evidence of the protest of W. W. Dingley mentioned in the reasons of appeal 3. There is no evidence that in the interview between the Watermans and Pal stead in New Work, in 1843, Henry Watermansaid that he invented the spring tiller "four or five years ago" nor that he had never tried it. For that Mr. Pal stead informed them that this machine was then on board of two ships, viz: theAlabarna and the Vicksburg, and was in operation about six months, and so far appeared to answer well. For that "or. Cochrane had been at great expense in maturing the invention and in reducing it to practice, and had it in actual operation." For that Mr. Later man had bestowed no labor and gone to no expense upon the invention 4. There is no evidence that Mr. Later man claimed to have invented this application of springs, in 1838 or 1839.5. There is no evidence that Stephen Later man protested "that if Ellsworth should take back the patent they would enter suit for damages against him 6. There is no evidence that Richard Cochrane had the books of the brig Planter examined to ascertain the date of the conversation with Captain Scott 7. What Mr. John Cochrane says, in his reasons of appeal, he told his brother Richard is not evidence 8. There is no evidence that James Cochrane stated as a reason for fixing the date of the invention before the 19th October, 1835,that on that day he left Baltimore to reside in Richmond 9. There is no evidence that Stephen Later man stated in evidence that Cochranes "machines were in operation 10. There is no evidence that Henry Later man was intentionally assisted by the Patent Office in disregarding the caveat, as in situated in the reasons of appeal. For is there any evidence that the evidence of one of Mr. Cochranes witnesses was mutilated, nor that any important evidence was suppressed, nor that a portion of the evidence was passed over without notice, as charged in the reasons of appeal. All those reasons of appeal, therefore, which were founded on supposed facts, of which there was no evidence, must be disregarded. The fact that the patent to Mr. Later man was granted while or. Cochranes caveat was pending and in force, does not of itself vacated that patent, nor authorize the Commissioner to grant to Mr. Cochrane a patent unless he should establish his priority of invention. The Commissioner could act only upon the evidence before him and I can act only upon the same evidence. If Mr. Cochrane had other evidence, and did not produce it, it was his own fault, or misfortune; but perhaps he may yet, file a bill in equity under the 16th section of the act of Congress of the4tlk of July, 1836, and establish his priority and obtain a patent x. a. 83 upon consideration of the reasons of appeal, and the reasons of the Commissioner of Patents, for his decision. I am of opinion that the decision is correct, and ought to be affirmed. W. Cranch. November 6, 1844.

Thereupon I do, this 7th day of November, 1844, decide and ad judge that the said decision of the said Commissioner of Patents, upon the points involved in the said reasons of appeal, be, and the same is hereby confirmed; and I here with return all papers in the cause. W. Crancholomon C. Warnecid127r Appeal from the decision of the Commit" sooner of Patents refusing a patent to Solomon Earner, for combining with versus the metallic callender rollers an elastic endless apron and a stretching frame, forCHARLS Goo .manufacturing corrupted or stirred I n) di a rubber goods. The only material point " involved in the reasons of appeal, and to which my revision must be limited is, whether Solomon C. Earner was the first inventor of that combination, (which is the same combination for which Charles Good year obtained a patent on the 9th of March, 1844, upon a specification dated July 24, 1843; more than fifteen months before the application of Solomon C. Earner for if he was not the first inventor, it is in material to this cause who was. Upon this point the Commissioner of Patents has decided that he was not the first inventor; and upon his appeal from that decision the question is now brought before me, and must be decided according to the evidence produced before the Commissioner, and now laid before me. That a patent able improvement in the manufacture of corrugatedor stirred I india rubber goods by machinery has been invented is admitted by both parties; and, in order to ascertain who was the inventor, it seems to be necessary, first, to ascertain in what tjhispatentable improvement consists 8 34 X. a. It does not consist in the whole machine nor in any particular part of it; for neither the whole nor any part of it is new. The invention consists only of a new combination of some known mechanical principles or powers. The ca lenders, the rollers, the endless apron, and the stretching frame are all old instruments, and, as such, cannot be patented; but when a certain particular combination of them produces a new and useful effect in the manufacture, that combination becomes the lawful subject of a patent. Earners specification says, that what he claims as new is the combining with the metallic callender rollers an elastic endless apron and a stretching frame. Good years specification is in the same words, omitting the word metallic. The question then is, was Solomon C. Earner the first inventor of that combination vast deal of testimony has been taken; much of it is in material. The counsel for the claimant objects to some of Mr. Good years witnesses as incompetent, by reason of their interest. But there is an agreement, signed by the counsel of the parties, dated January 9, 1846, " that all testimony taken before -gardener, esq, United States commissioner, and -Met calf, esq United States commissioner, up to and during the 9th of January, 1846, shall be heard and considered by the Commissioner of Patents, whether the same be filed before the twelfth day of January, instant, or not, rights reserved as to all other testimony taken after this date." All the testimony to which the objection relates was taken before those commissioners, or one of them, and before or during the 9th of January, 1846. This agreement seems to me te be a waiter of the objection to the competence of the witnesses, whose testimony is thus agreed to be heard and considered. The objection, however, may go to their credit, and have its due weight. The principal evidence in favor of the claim of, Mr. Solomon C. Earner is the inference drawn from the fact that he made the machine which contains the combination for which he desires to obtain a patent. This is prima face evidence that he was the first inventor of that combination. This inference, however, is re butted by the facts, that in making that machine he was working in his trade as a machines t, in the employment and for the benefit of Mr. Good year, for wages; that he did not claim to be the inventor of that combination for a long time after his supposed invention, but stood by and saw Mr. Good year apply for and obtain a patent for it without objection, and did not apply for a patent for it as his own invention until the 4th of November, 1844, more than 18 months after his supposed invention, and nearly six months after Goodyearhad obtained his patent for the same invention, and not till Norton and Lawrence had agreed to secure him against a, ll costs and expenses to be incurred in procuring the patent. These facts seem to me to re but the inference drawn from the fact that Mr. Earner was the fabric at or of the machine which contains the combination. X. a. 835 The greater part of the testimony produced by him is to prove the fact that he built the machine. The presumption, from the fact that Earner made the machine for Good year, at his request, for his benefit, and at his expense, is that it was made according to his directions; and the burden of proof is then on Earner, to show that the machine was not made according to his directions. By a careful examination of the testimony, I am satisfied that in the fall of 1842 Mr. Charles Good year made several experiments, combining the principle of the ca lenders, the stretching frame, and the elastic apron passing through the ca lenders with the cloth intended to be corrupted; and ascertained that a machine combining those principles, if properly made, would effect the object he has in view, viz: the stirring of I india rubber goods by machinery. This combination, the effect of which Mr. Good year had thus ascertained, was reduced to practice by the machine built by Solomon C. Earner, at the request or by the order, and at the expense of Mr. Good year, so that it was, in fact, I Mr. Good year, and not or. Earner, who reduced the invention to practice. Whether the apron should be an endless or a straight apron does not effect the principle; the object was to have and elastic matter pass through the ca lenders, with the cloth intended to be corrupted. The one may do the work better than the other, but either of them effects the object intended. Mr. Good years discovery or invention was in the year 1842. Mr. Earner claims only from the spring of 1843. Without deciding, therefore, the question, whether or not Mr. Solomon C. Earner received his instructions from Or. Goodyearor from Mr. Am tory Wider, or from any one else, I am of opinion, from the evidence, that Mr. Solomon C. Earner was not the first inventor of the combination for which he seeks to obtain a patent. W. Cranch. July 17th, 1846. Joseph P.

Cundell, Of Of Parkhurst, Appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents refusing a patent to In m. Unwell, because it interferes with an application by Parkhurst, the prior inventor of the same improvement of a machine for cleaning sheeps' wool from burrs, &c. The commissioner having decided that Parkhurst was the first inventor of the improvement. The commissioners decision is as follows: " The invention in dispute between the parties is the application x. a. 87 of the zigzag or pointed guard to the burring machine. The testimony of Was. C. Johnson proves that the said Parkhurst showed the guard in question as early as the spring of 1845; and none of the witnesses testify to its invention by the said Unwell earlier than the summer of the same year. Priority of invention is 'therefore decided in favor of Rib a Parkhurst. This view of the case renders the decisions of the interlocutor y questions which have been raised in taking the testimony wholly unnecessary. February 2, 1847."From this decision Mr. Unwell has appealed and assigned his reasons of appeal as follows: " Although the witness referred to does testify that Rib a Parkhurst described to him the improvement in question in the spring of 1845, and at a time anterior to the alleged invention of Am. Unwell, yet, it will appear from the testimony on both sides that this witness erred in his statement of the time at which this communication was made to him, for it is clearly proved, by the testimony, that this improvement was made in consequence of the imperfect working of the original machine, and to remedy a defect which was discovered after this machine was put in operation, and the whole of the testimony shows that this machine was not put in operation until the month of July, 1845, subsequent to the time at which the witness testified the said improvement" was described to him by Parkhurst; they therefore submit that the improvement which was the result of, and suggested by the defective working of a machine, could not have been described before the said machine was constructed and put in operation; and that, therefore, the Commissioner of Patents erred in giving presence to the statement by a witness of a date, which all the circumstances of the case, established by the testimony a deduced in both sides, clearly shows was the result of error By the act of March 3, 1839, section eleven, the Commissioner of Patents is to " lay before the judge all the original papers and evidence in the case, together with the grounds of his decision fully set forth in writing touching all the points involved by the reasons of appeal, to which the revision shall be confined The only point involved in the reasons of appeal is the date of the conversation between Rib a Parkhurst and Most. Johnson, in which the former showed the latter a drawing similar to exhibit D, of a machine call a a strip per or guard, to be applied to burring machines. Mr. Johnson thinks it was the latter part of the spring of 1845, but says he cannot name dates. He fixes the date, however, by recollection of another fact, to wit: that in May, 1845,Ziba Parkhurst went out to Erie county, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and bought some 50 or 60,000 pounds of wool, and drew uponJohnsons house for it, who sold it on commission for, him, and that that is his reason for knowing the time; and that he saw the machine before Rib a left for Erie county, Pennsylvania. This witness, who is a merchant, appears to have testified fairly and impartially. To attempt is made to discredit him, unless by showing that he has mistaken the date of the conversation. This838 X. his attempted to be done by proving facts supposed to be inconsistent with the testimony of this witness. One of the other witnesses carry the invention farther back than a few weeks after Stephen R. Parkhurst first departed forEnglafid, which appears to have been about the 1st of August, 1845; but they speak of the time when the invention was first applied to a machine in operation, not to the time of the invention itself, which necessarily precedes it. There is, therefore, no irreconcilable discrepancy between Mr. Johnson and the witnesses as to the time. But it is said by Mr. Cundells counsel that the defects of the machine, at No. 60, Jersey street, led Rib a to suggest the improvement, and that the machine was not put into operation in Veseystreet until the 18th of July, 1845. But I have not found any evidence that it was the defect in the working of that particular machine that suggested the improvement. Other burring machines had been before in use, to which the new strip per might be an improvement, and the defects of which might have suggested the improvement. Other circumstances have been given in evidence tending to throw some doubts as to the time of the invention, but none which, in my opinion, outweigh the positive testimony of or. Johnson. I am, therefore, of opinion that Rib a Parkhurst has established his priority of invention of the zigzag guard to the burring machine, and is entitled to a patent there for; and that the decision of the Commissioner of Patents be affirmed.

Appeal from Commissioner of Patents. S. G. Cornell, appeal lee. The first reason of appeal is, that the evidence does not show Cornell to be the first to conceive the idea of a machine such a she now claims. The question, therefore, is, what is the evidence The counsel for Mr. Merry offered to the Commissioner of Patents the depositions of Robert J. Craig, and twenty other witnesses, taken without notice to this applicant, Samuel G. Cornell. These depositions, therefore, cannot be used against him, unless he has waived his right to notice, and agreed to admit them to be read in evidence before the Commissioner of Patents. It is suggested that the notice given by Mr. Cornells counsel to the other parties litigants, to produce these depositions to a Commissioner for inspection and examination by his counsel, and the offer by Mr. Merry to have the witnesses again before the Commissioner, to be cross examined by Mr. Cornelpls counsel, and his refusal to cross examine them when produced, was equivalent to a waiter of notice. I am not; however, of that opinion. Mr. Cornell had a right to be present at the direct examination in chief. But it is said that the Commissioner of Patents has received these depositions in evidence; and, as he decided in favor of Cornell, he cannot appeal upon that ground. But the Commissioner, in his judgment, says it is unnecessary to decide the question raised in reference to theadmissibility of the evidence, as its rejection would ?not vary the result. It is plain, therefore, that he did not decide that question. There is no evidence that Mr. Cornell, or his counsel, has ever agreed to admit these depositions as evidence against him. They must, therefore, be rejected. Mr. Seller, the agent of the defeated applicant, objects to my hearing any argument by an officer or counsel of the Patent Office. Heretofore it has been usual for some officer of the Patent Office to attend the hearings before the judge, upon appeals from the judgment of the Commissioner, and no objection to that course has been taken, until this time. The officer who attends is not con840Ex. side red as counsel for the Commissioner, or for the office; and I should think he could not with propriety be considered as an advocate of either of the parties litigants. I have hitherto considered him as attending for the purpose of explaining the decision of, the Commissioner, and not as arguing the cause of either of the litigants. He can only appear as an officer of the department as such I shall always be willing to avail myself of his assistance in the investigation of the truth. W. Cranch. Opinion given Tuesday morning, June 23, 1847. A. D. Perry, appeal ant, Appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, a warding prims. or it of invention to Samuel G. Cornell of an improvement in the may. G. Cornell, appeal lee. J chin e for making lead pipe. There were four conflicting applications for a patent for the improvement 1st. By John Robertson, on the 9th of September, 1846.2d. By Alonzo D. Merry, on the 6th of October, 1846.3d. By Stephen Marks, jr, on the 12th of November, 1846, and 4th By Samuel G. Cornell, on the 2 1st of December, 1846. Before the application of Samuel G. Cornell, and while the litigation was going on between the other three applicants, the depositions of 21 witnesses had been taken on the part of those applicants, respectively, and, of course, without notice to Mr. Cornell who had not then made his application. These depositions were returned to the Commissioner of Patents, and objected to by Mr. Cornells counsel for want of notice. The Commissioner, without deciding upon the question of theadmissibility of the evidence 'as to Mr. Cornell, awarded to him the priority of invention, saying, "the decision of the question raised in reference to the ad visibility of testimony is unnecessary to decide; its rejection would not vary the result; the testimony is therefore received, and priority of invention awarded to Samuel. Cornell." (march 24, 1847.)From this decision Mr. Merry has appealed, and his reasons of appeal are in effect 1st. That the evidence does not show that Mr. Cornell was the first to conceive the idea of a machine such as he now claims, but that the plan proved to have been so conceived is essentially different and mechanically inferior to the one claimed and now awarded to him by the Commissioner 2d. That the evidence on which the decision in favor of Mr. Cornell is based is contradictory and insufficient to establish his claim even to the conception of the idea of the principle or mode of operation of the machine now sought to be patented, but, on the x. a. 841 contrary, shows that the plan said to have been conceived was entirely different; and 3d. That if he did conceive the idea of the principle or mode of operation of a machine substantially similar to the one now claimed, and did describe to the witness such a machine prior to the date of the invention claimed by the applicant, Merry, yet it was merely an intellectual invention, based in theory, and not an invention in the meaning of the law. The Commissioner has laid before me " the original papers and evidence in the case, together with the grounds of his decision, fully set forth in writing, touching all the points involved by the reasons of appeal" to which my revision must be confined, as provided in the 11th section of the act of March 3d, 1839, c. 88,(pamphlet edition, pp. 75 and 76.)The grounds of the decision of the Commissioner, as set forth in writing, are in substance" That it is proved by the testimony of In. Frost, confirmed by that of Benjamin Neck, that the said Cornell invented the machine in dispute as early as the summer of 1843; and there ist no testimony that tends to show that either of the other parties! invented it until a considerable time afterwards That " it appears by the testimony of Frost that Cornell described the machine to him fully, so that he perfectly understood it; that he repeatedly made draughts representing it in so clear a manner that the said Frost was able to r make draughts and estimates of its cost, and absolutely did make both with the assistance ofCornellThat " Cornell made the invention as clearly understood as if the machine had been built and in operation' " It appears, therefore, that Cornell had done all that an inventor, as such, could do, and nothing remained to complete tie machine but the labor of the mechanics, which cannot be confounded with invention." "The daily number of inventions daily patented have never been reduced to practice n the grounds of his decision, the Commissioner controversy the dictum found in some of the books, that "he who first reduces an invention to practice, is the first inventor" a dictum which, he says, "although often quoted and 'reiterated, was not applicable to, nor borne out by, the case in which it was first pronounced, nor by any of the cases in which it has subsequently been repeated; and which, in the broad terms in which it is announced, is not, and never has been, the law. If by reduction to practice is meant rendering a principle practicable or useful in a new way, and clearly pointed out the manner in which it may be thus made useful, so that any co i patent mechanics can avail himself of it, then, and in that sense, an invention must be reduced to practice- but " neither the statutes, nor the decisions of the courts, require that -a machine should be built and itsed as a part of the invention, and before the party can be considered an inventor; but that the sense, above alluded to, is the sense in which the courts have used the phrase reduction to practice" and the only sense which will reconcile the 128 42 X. decisions, and make them conform to the statutes regulating patentrightsThe other two applicants, Mr. Robertson arid Mr. Marks, have not appealed; so that the contest is now between Mr. Merry andWMr. Cornell only. It is admitted that a great and valuable improvement has been made in the old machine for making lead pipes; and the principal, if not the only point involved in the reasons of appeal is the question" Which, or whether either of these two applicants is entitled to receive the patent prayed for? and this is to be decided by the evidence produced before the Commissioner. The 21 deposition s taken in the conflict between Robertson, Merry, and Marks, being then without notice to Cornell, are not evidence against him, and, therefore, cannot be considered by the judge upon the appeal. The only evidence which he can consider is that which is contained in the depositions of Am. Frost and Benjamin Neck, and in the cross examination of Mr. Cornell himself by the counsel of Mr. Merry. The question then is whether the machine described by Mr. Cornell to those two witnesses is substantially the same as that for which he asks a patent. The improvement consists in the great diminution of the friction of the machine, by which the same effect is produced by a power much less than that which was necessary to work the old machine. As the question is merely of priority of invention, it is not necessary to describe the particular alterations of the old machine which constitute the improvement. It is, however, necessary to examine the testimony, to see whether the improvement which Mr. Cornell described to the witnesses is, substantially the same as that for which he now claims a patent. It appears by the deposition of Or. William Frost, the principal witness, and who seems to have testified fairly and intelligently that Mr. Cornell, in June or July, 1843, described to the witness a plan for a machine for making lead pipe, different from any machine for that purpose then in use; and that he intended to use a hollow ram, with an aperture in the bottom coming out at the side of the, ram; that he intended to place a die on the top of the ram, then to have a mandrel to pass through the top of the cylinder long enough to pass through the interior of the die, leaving a space between the mandrel and the die for the lead to pass through when the ram was forced upward against the lead, making the pipe from that portion of the lead which was first acted upon by the top of the ram being pressed against it; his object being, as he stated it, to avoid the immense friction that was produced by driving so large a mass of lead before the ram out through the aperture, as used in many other machines then in use. That he (or. Cornell) exhibited to the witness a sketch or drawing of his plan; and the witness then prepared and produced a drawing of Cornells plan, as he then drew and described it, which is annexed to his deposition, and marked A. That, about a fortnight afterward, the witness had a further conversation with Mr. Cornell in relation to his said plan for a pipe machine in Mr. Cornelfs office, in New Work; that he then state dix, a. 84 to the witness and described the manner in which he intended to construct a pipe machine for the purpose of passing the lead pipe through the interior of the ram, and for using a move able man drill in connexion with the hollow ram, and for forming the pipe at the point on which the ram pressed against the lead; that Mr. Cornell made a sketch of such machine, a copy of which this witness has made, thinking it might be called for, and to explain the arrangement which he then described. Mr. Cornell said he intended to make such a machine. The counsel for Mr. Merry objected to the introduction of the copy of Mr. Cornells sketch, unless the <a name="loss79"><mark>loss</mark></a> of the original should first be proved. After the proof of the <a name="loss80"><mark>loss</mark></a> of the original, the witness produced and filed his copy, which is annexed to the deposition and marked B. It further appears, by the testimony of the witness, Williamfrost, that the sketch or drawing B differs from the sketch or drawing A, in having two. cross heads and two rods to connect them together; also an upper move able mandrel which was connected to the upper cross head and kept in its proper position by means of a stand or frame which was secured to the lead cylinder, the lower cross being secured to the ram rising from the hydraulic cylinder. The upper mandrel or ram, he stated, might be hollow or solid, for the purpose of holding either the short mandrel or die that these drawings do not exhibit the nuts, bolts, or screws, or the manner in which the different parts are guided or secured to each other, but merely the arrangement of the raised dies and mandrels to each other, and as he designed to place them for the purpose of manufacturing lead or other pipes; that the leading essential feature of these two planes, which distinguishes them from n machines previously known for the purpose of making lead pipe, is the hollow ram, and the die placed on the top of it, and the forming of the pipe on the head of that ram from the point where it presses against the lead, and the passing of the pipe, when so formed, through the interior of the ram; that the second plan drawn and described to this witness contained this essential feature or difference, with the addition of the parts which are before described; that, from the drawings and descriptions so made by Or. Cornell to this witness, he could have made and constructed machines for making pipe upon those plans. That the drawing, marked exhibit B, shows the relations of the rams to each other, of the die, of the short mandrel, of the cross heads, and the rods which connect them together, as also the lead cylinder, the cast iron stand or frame, the hydraulic cylinder, and a portion of the ram rising therefrom; as also the columns for connecting the hydraulic and lead cylinder together. It also shows the upper hollow ram, as also the lower hollow ram, with the apertures through the same. It does not describe the manner in which the different parts are secured to each other, but simply the arrangement described by Mr. Cornell in New Work. This witness says he is not aware that Mr. Cornell ever built a machine with the improvements which he described to the witness. He further testified that Mr. Cornell, at different times, showed 8 44 X. him at least half a dozen drawings like exhibit B on separate and distinct pieces of paper, also two in Connecticut and two in Brooklyn, also two like exhibit A, one of them on board of the steamboatCroton" in June or July, 1843, and the other at his 'factory, inGlenville, Connecticut. That, in the fail of 1844, he made, at the request of Mr. Cornell, an estimate of the cost of such a machine as that described in the exhibit The witness, Benjamin Neck, testified that, in June, 1843, before or. Cornell had applied for a patent for his invention of an improvement in the machine for the manufacture of lead pipe, he communicated to this witness his plan for the construction thereof that he stated that the die was to be attached to the end of the ram. The ram to be hollow, the pipe to form at the end of the ram, and pass down through the hollow ram; that the object was to prevent friction. The core was to pass through the. cylinder, the end of it to be inserted in the die, the die and mandrel to move together; that the mandrel forms the inside of the pipe. It is sometimes called the core. The pipe is formed over the mandrel or core. The hollow ram and the move able mandrel were to move together by force of an hydraulic press; that Mr. Frost was present at this communication. This witness states that the machine for which Mr. Cornell seeks a patent, contains, among other things, the lead cylinder, the ran the die, the core, rod or mandrel. That the construction of this machine differs from that of the old machine, which was worked by Marks; in this the die is placed at the head of the ram, in the old one, at the top of the cylinder. I n this the pipe forms at the head of the ram, in the old one at the top of the cylinder. ,that the advantage of this over the old one is, that in the old one the whole body of lead from the bottom to the top of the cylinder was required to move in a body, in order to form the pipe at the top of the cylinder; whereas in this improvement the main body of the lead is not required to move, because the pipe forms at the head of the ram immediately after the pressure, is put on, and passes out through the ram. That about two months ago, (november, 1846,) Mr. Cornell showed this witness a pencil sketch of his improvement, saying that that was his plan for the machine for which he was about to get a patent, and to have a model made of it. That sketch did not show the hollow ram. That when Mr. Cornell showed to this witness that sketch, he said that was a sketch of his invention which he had before disclosed to this w it ness, and that there was a die at the head of the ram, and that the ram was hollow; that on the sketch he saw he could not say whether the ram was hollow or not. Methinks there was no hydraulic sketch on that sketch. There was a lead cylinder and a mandrel core or ram. The end of the core oriandril extended out of the top of the cylinder, and down to the head of the ram, or near to it. This witness was sure there was a representation of a ram; one end of the ram was placed near the cylinder, the other below. He thinks that no part of the ram, as represented in the sketch, entered the lead cylinder. That the ram. X. a. 85 of the lead cylinder, as represented in the sketch, was a round piece of iron. His witness only saw the sketch for a few minutes, and handed it back to Mr. Cornell. Being asked, in cross examination, to describe the frame work of the machine as it appeared on the said sketch, he says there was a mark across the top which he supposed represented a piece, and one straight line down each side. The core was in the centre of the cylinder; one end projected at the top, and came down near the bottom of the cylinder. There was a piece across the top. He does not recollect seeing the die. He does not know by .whom the sketch was made. This, he says, was a rough, and" to all appearances an imperfect sketch. For. Cornell, the appeal lee, having been affirmed and examined as to the <a name="loss81"><mark>loss</mark></a> of the two original drawings of sketches, of which the witness, Mr. Frost, testified that the exhibits A and B are copies made by him, was cross examined by the counsel of Mr. Merry, at large, as if he, Mr. Cornell, were a competent witness in chief thereby making the answer of Mr. Cornell 'evidence for himself. Upon that cross examination he stated that he has a distinct recollection of making a sketch, and has no doubt it was at the time referred to by Mr. Frost. Thinks it was made on foolscap paper, with a lead pencil, but it might have been with ink. It was made in the office at his works, (in Connecticut) presumes it was at the time Mr. Frost speaks of. They have had many conversations on the subject. He showed the drawings to Mr. Neck, and he thinks to Mr. Marks, who was at work for him. He affirms positively that he showed th.em to Mr. Neck and Mr. Frost. He does not wish to identify any particular drawings. He made a number at different times, and had frequent conversations with Mr. Neck and Or. Frost on the subject. He is not certain whether he mentioned it first to Mr. Frost or Mr. Neck. The first to Mr. Neck was, no doubt, in his works in Connecticut, in June, 1843. He cannot recollect which the first time he mentioned it to Mr. Frost, but it was in either June or July, 1843. He thinks it was early in June. He has none of his drawings at present. The first drawing was showing the appearance of a lead cylinder; the ram at the mouth of the cylinder, which ram should be hollow; a die to be placed in the head of the ram, and the pipe should form at the head of the ram as the ram rose, by any power that might be applied to it, and pass out, through the bottom of the ram. The mandrel or core, to form the calibre of the. pipe, should come from the head of the cylinder. From comparing this evidence with Mr. Cornelps specification, it will be seen th'at the invention therein described is substantially, if not exactly, that for which he now claims a patent. That it isa great improvement is admitted, and the only question is, who is en tiled to the priority of invention? There being no evidence th, at any other person invented it, Mrcornell must be ad judged to beth t first inventor. But it is said that Mr. Cornell is not entitled to a patent, because he has never reduced the invention to practice. But reducing to practice, differs from bringing into use. There is no law requiring846Ex. the applicant to reduce his invention to actual use before he can obtain a patent. In the contrary, the use of the invention before obtaining the patent is one of the reasons for refusing it. An inventor has reduced his invention to practice when he has so described it upon paper, with such drawings or model as to enable any person, skilled in the art, to make and use the same. He must show that i: is practicable, and the manner in which it may be used. But it is not necessary that he should do this until he has perfected his invention and is ready to apply for a patent. He may have conceived the idea years ago, but is not obliged to furnish drawings or model until he makes his application. In the present case the specification and drawings and model have been filed, showing the inverltiori to be practicable, and the manner in which it can be used. It is suggested that Mr. Cornell has not used "reasonable diligence, in adjusting and perfecting" his invention; having done nothing from the spring of 1843 to the winter of 1846, and therefore under the equity of the fifteenth section of the patent law of 1836, has lost the benefit of his priority of invention. That clause of the section is only applicable to the case of a patent surreptitiously or unjustly obtained while the first inventor was using reasonable diligence in adapting and perfecting his invention; not to the case of conflicting applicants before any patent is granted. I tis one of the pleas which the defendant, who is sued for a supposed violation of the surreptitious patent, may plead; and if pleaded, it may be necessary for the defendant to show, in order to vacated the patent, that he was using reasonable diligence, &c, when thecid127patent was obtained. ' But before a patent is granted to any one for the invention, there is no law that requires the first inventor to disclose his invention within any limited time before application for a patent; and there is no limitation unless the lapse of time be sufficient to show an abandonment of the invention, which is a question for the jury and not for the commissioner. For does the priority of application for a patent decide the priority of invention. It should be borne in mind, that the cases cited 'from the books are all cases at law or in equity, in actions for violations of patents already granted. The proceedings before the Commissioner of Patents are initiator y. The question is, C whether the patent shall be granted" not "whether it shall be vacated r and a patent may be granted or refused upon less evidence than would be required to sustain or amend it. Upon all the points made in this case, I refer to the opinion in the case of the appeal of Hildreth is, Of each, filed in the Patentoffice, on the 15th of October, 1841. Upon consideration of the whole casecid127) I am of opinion that Samuel G. Cornell is the first inventor of the improvement in the machine for making lead pipe, as claimed in his specification, and that the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, a warding the priority of invention to the said Samuel G, Cornell be, and the same is x. a. 84 7 hereby, affirmed; and that he is " entitled to receive a patent a sprayed for.

W. Cranch. October 21, 1847. This decision is sustained by the following opinions  Lli  Of Atki Nson, appeal ant, )of. Of  Lli  Of Boardman, junior, appeal lee, This is an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, in a case of conflicting applications for certain improvements in the construction of steam pumps. It appears by the files 'in the Patent Office, that, on the 4th of December, 1843, William Board man, junior, filed his application for his invention c of a new and improved portable steam jumping engine, for relieving stranded vessels and for other purposes which application was rejected by the then Commissioner of Patents, on the 20th of February, 1844. It does not appear upon 48 X.  a. What grounds that application was rejected; but it is suggested that the matter as then presented was not patent able, but that certain improvements have been since invented and made by which the matter has become patent able, and the Commissioner has decided that the applicant, William Boardiman, junior, is entitled to a patent. It is unnecessary, to ascertain what these improvements were, as this is a case of conflicting applications for a patent for the same thing. The question is not, now, who invented the matter upon which the first application of Mr. Board man was founded, but who is the inventor of the improvements which have made the matter patent able. That such improvements have been made is admitted by both parties, and by the Commissioner. I do not find any evidence that Mr. Atkinson, after the rejection of Mr. Boardmans first application, on the 20th of February, 1844,invented any patent able improvement upon the pump. It appears by all the evidence that Mr. Board man constructed the pump and all the improvements. In the absence of all evidence to the contrary, the presumption, therefore, is that he was also the inventor, and the burden of proof is thrown upon Mr. Atkinson to show, not merely that he first suggested to Mr. Board man the abstract idea of a steam pump, (for steam pumps had been in common use for many years) but that he invented the improvements which entitle it to a patent. To re but this inference Mr. Atkinson produces the deposition of Josiah L. Pale, who says: " Not long after the <a name="loss82"><mark>loss</mark></a> of the ship Chef field, in November or December, 1843, I met Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Board man in the Merchants Exchange, and knowing that some a lie nation of feeling existed between them, and being anxious that they should be friends, I said to Or, Board man, 'why dont you and Mr. Atkinson settle your .difficulties' or words equivalent. I He, Board man, made a reply, having reference to a little paragraph, which had, about that time, appeared in one of the papers, respecting the pump in question" (meaning, no doubt, the paragraph which appeared in the Journal of Commerce of' the 25th of November, 1843, which gave to Mr. Atkinson the whole credit of the invention of the pump) "he, Board man, spoke with some warm, but respectfully. ,the de potent replied, 'I had always supposed Of r. /atkinson was 'the inventor' He, Board man said, ' he was again say, he was he, Board man, used these words, or words ,equally strong. I, de potent, replied, 'so I always supposed After these strong expressions, Mr. Board man said 'that it was the combination which made the steam' pump' Always supposing, that or. Atkinson was the inventor, I feel certain I could never have conveyed any other idea to any person that he was not theinventorTaking the whole testimony of Mr. Josiah L. Pale, altogether, it seems strange that Mr. Board man, while expressing indignation at the paragraph which gave to Mr. Atkinson the whole credit for the invention of the pump, should have admitted that he was the inventor, in the technical sense of the word. He might have admitted " that Mr. Atkinson suggested the idea of having a steam pump" as testified by Mr. Glanders; and yet he (Board man) might. X. a. 849 be the inventor of the peculiar combination of mechanical principles which entitled it to a patent. Mr. Pale says, that Boardmantold him, "that it was the combination which made the steam pumprThere is no evidence that that combination was suggested to him by Mr. Atkinson. I do not perceive in the testimony any further evidence in support of Mr. Atkinsons claim to be the inventor of any of the patent able improvements in the portable steam pump. Of    have not considered the declarations of the parties in their own favor, in the absence of each other, as competent evidence in this cause for any purpose but to ascertain when and what they have respectively claimed to have invented. There is no evidence that Mr. Board man was in the employment and pay of Mr. Atkinson at the time of the supposed invention, or at the time of the construction of the improvements which render it a patent able invention, or at any previous time. In the contrary, it appears in the testimony of Mr. Hurried, that before his first application for a patent, in December, 1843, Err. Boardmanbuilt four of these pumps for the board of under writers, who paid him for the construction thereof; and that this was done without the interference or agency, but with the knowledge of Mr. Board man. There does not appear to be any evidence that Mr. Atkinson, either before or after the rejection of Or: Broadmans application for a patent for the pump, gave Mr. Road man any instructions in relation to the 'particular combination of mechanical principles, which is understood to be the ground of his present application for a patent; nor any model or drawings by which to construct the pump, nor does there appear to be any evidence that he paid Board man or any other person for constructing .it; or that the under writers had any authority from Mr. Atkinson to use these pumps, which had been built for them by Mr. Board man. The deposition of Mr. Josiah L. Pale was taken in New Work, ten days after Mr. Boardmans, senior, deposition had been taken, in Nashville, New Hampshire, and may have been +a ken with a view to, re but it. Mr. Board man, senior, testified, that between the spring of 1841, and the fall of 1842, Mr. Atkinson told him that William (his son) had invented a steam pump at his, Atkinsons, request, and that he had' requested William to turn his attention to getting up a steam pump, a portable pump, to be used about wrecked vessels. That Atkinson asked him if he had seen the mo, del of the pump invented by William. He, this witness, replied, that it was shown to him by Hurried.  That in none of the conversations which he had with Mr. Atkinson did he ever pretend or intimate that he was the inventor of the pump, or of any part of it, but, on the contrary, had always stated that William, his son, was the inventor. That in September, 1842, Mr. Pale, speaking of William Board man, junior, said, he had recently invented a steam pump, which they thought highly of, and he should use his influence to have the insurance companies adopt it, and to have one built, and that he intended William should make money out of it. Mrs. Board man, mother of the appeal lee, says, that in the sum 8 50 X. her of 1842, Mr. Atkinson, speaking of her son, William, told her that he had been inventing a new pump a steam pump, to raise ships from the ocean, that he thought William would do something great with it, that he would assist him. That in the next season, Mr. Atkinson was again at their house in Nashville. He said William was getting along finely with his pump, and expressed his opinion that it would be very valuable to him. That in neither of these conversations did Mr. Atkinson intimate that le h ad invented any part of the said pump. That he expressed himself as grateful for favors, he had received from her husband, and was glad to have some opportunity to make a return by assisting hers on. Mr. Jeremiah J. Dickinson says that some time between June and September, 1812, he was present at the exhibition of a steam pump in Earl street, at the request of Mr. Atkinson. That two or three of the board of under write is were there, and le thinks Mr. I oanriman was there also; he understood from Mr. Atkinson that Mr. Board man was the inventor of the pump; that Mr. Atkinson was to find the funds, and that they were to be partners in the concern and that he always thought they were partners until one or two years ago, when he learned there had been some misunderstanding between them. Horace Prior testified that he received from Mr. Boardmarn ompensationrfor the use of the room in which the pump was exhibited. Mr. Orlando Men net proves the publication .of the. offensive paragraph, which seems to have caused the misunderstanding betweenBoardman and Atkinson, by attributing the whole invention to Mr. Atkinson. This paragraph, a copy of which is annexed to Mr. Men nets deposition, appeared in the Journal of Commerce of the 25th of November, 1843. This seems to have excited Mr. Board man, and on the 4th of December following he filed his petition for a patent. William Fletcher testified that William Board man, run, employed him to make the patterns for the pump, and paid him for making it hem. Mr. Board man showed him a sketch which gave him the idea so that the could commence. He never had any communication with Mr. Atkinson, and did not know him till the day of taking his deposition. This witness made a casting 'of the pump pattern. Mr. Board man made and alteration in the angle of the discharge noble. About the 1st of June, 1842, he took to Mr. Board man a boiler for the purpose of trying the model, which was then complete. The boiler was of iron. The pumps were cast in Frownings foundry. Cyrus Hurried, of the firm of Davis, Hurried & To, martinists at Newark, New Jersey, testified that they made four of these steam pumps for Mr. Board man, and were paid for them by the New Yorkunderwriters; Mr. Board man having at tested to the accuracy of the accounts. That he directed the building of them, and drafted them. The order for the first pump was given about the middle of March, and completed the middle of May, 1843. Mr. Atkinson was never in the shop during the building of these pumps, to the knowledge of this witness, and gave no instruction six. a. 85 about the building of them. He, Mr. Atkinson, has been in the shop since they removed. He came and said he wanted an engine built with a pump attached to it. He gave no drawings, but asked this witnesss opinion as to the size, &c; thinks he asked if Mr. Boardmans patterns were there; he was answered "no" they were in New Work. He then asked the witness if he could build him a pump, the same as they had built for Board man; thinks it was in the fall of 1841, that Board man first told him he contemplated building a pump for wrecking purposes. Thinks it was in the middle of the fall. He first saw the model of the steam pump completed in the spring or summer of 1842. He saw Mr. Atkinson at the place where he saw the model. Mr. Atkinson did not, at that time, claim to be the inventor of the pump, or say anything to lead this witness to think that he was the inventor, nor did he say or do, anything which gave this witness to understand that he did not recognize Mr. Board man, at that time, as the inventor. Mr. Atkinson said nothing about it. Mr. Board man showed him the whole and explained it to him. For. Julius On Schmidt, a machines t in Washington, D. C., testified that he was applied to, to make a model for Mr. Atkinsonsa year ago last winter." (his deposition was taken in 1847.) Or. Atkinson showed him a model and drawing in Doctor To ness, and wished him to make him such a no del, which he did with somesrnall variation; saw the same model in the Patent Office about three' months ago. The name of William Board man, junior, was upon it. He made a sketch of it at Dr. To ness office. He has seen, at the Patent Office, the model he male for Mr. Atkinson. Mr. Atkinson did not give him any idea of the principle or construction )f the pump before he took him, to Dr. To ness office. Recalled the model at Dr. To ness office his model. He did not examine the drawing particularly; he only took a glance at it. Or, Bones held it in his hands, and took it away immediately and told him he could sketch better from the model. Upon a careful consideration and comparison of the evidence on both sides, I am of opinion that the preponderance is greatly in favor of Williamboardman, run, as the inventor of the improvements in the steam pump, for which he has now applied for a patent, and I do therefore affirm the decision of the honorable the Commissioner of Patents in this cause.

All these actions took place under the administration of the late Commissioner Ellsworthunder these circumstances, the decision heretofore hide cannot be disturbed, and your application must stand rejected. Respectfully yours" Edmund Burkeedward Janney, Esq." Are of J. J. Are enough, Washington, D. The last application for the patent was made on the 27th of October, '1847, some small amendment having been made in the specification, not affecting the merits of the claim, so that it was, in effect, an application to the present Commissioner to revise and r evoke the two decisions made by Mr. Ellsworth, the former Commissioner. His refusal so to revise and r evoke these decisions is not a ground of appeal under the acts of 1836 and 1839. The act of. 1839 gives the right of appeal to the Judge only in cases where an appeal was, by the previous act, allowed .from the decision of the Commissioner to a board of examiners, and then only when a patent was refused. In the present case he his not refused a patent; He decides only that he will not examine the merits of the claim, which has been twice rejected, after a full examination of his predecessor in office. This refusal was not a ground for appeal x. a. 853 to examiners under the 7th section of the act of 1836, and therefore is not a ground of appeal to the Judge. Having no jurisdiction of such an appeal, it is not for me to say whether the refusal, under the circumstances of the case, was right or wrong. There is no limitation of time as to the appeal; and I do not perceive any reason why Mr. An ney may not now appeal from the decision of Mr. Ellsworth, and have the merits of his invention decided. I understand the merits of both applications are alike. Having no jurisdiction of this appeal, I suppose it must be considered as dismissed. W. Cranch. December 13, 1847. X.

Joseph Powell, Edward Holden, Nelson Barlow. No. 4984. Having thus fully described the nature of my improvement in the manner of transporting wagons and other wheeled vehicles across rivers and other waters. what I claim as new therein, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the combining of floatsmadeof I india rubber cloth, or of other material that is water tight, and capable of being inflated, with a wagon, or other wheeled vehicle, in the manner and for the purpose herein set forth. I do not claim the use of such floats when attached to, or making a part of, boat six. a. 87 for other vessels or floating bodies, for the giving buoyant y thereto, or for their conveyance across or along rivers or other waters, this application of such floats living well known; but I limit my claim, as above stated, to their combination with wheeled vehicles, retaining their wheels; this being the essential feature' of my improvement, and that upon which its whole novelty and utility are dependent, as it enables the wagon to pass into and out of the water, and also over s heals therein, in virtue of said combination of. the floats and wheels. Henry Stanton. No. 4985. I do not give a description of an apparatus, because any whatever may be employed, provided that a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure be produced within; besides, what I claim as my invention, and what I desire to secure by letters patent, is not an apparatus, but the application of a temperature (higher than the temperature of ebullition under the atmospheric pressure) to the sugar cane juice in order to destroy the greatest part of the matter injurious to the sugar, and using increase of pressure which results from it for removing the liquor out of the kettle and carrying it in contact with a purifying agent; (lime, for example) in such a manner the juice is protected against fire during the defection or purifying, and during the deposit e of coagulated matters and other impurity. It is plain that letters patent only for an apparatus prepared to obtain these results, would be completely without interest to your petitioner, because any one may obtain them with an apparatus of any particular form conveniently adapted, for this object on the same principles, and it is possible to employ a great many, forms. In order to point out the importance of my new method, I wish to make a few remarks. Very sugar maker knows that a great deal of the impure ties cannot be destroyed, except at the end of the evaporation, because it is only at that moment that the temperature is sufficiently high, and this is the reason why I commence with heating strongly the cane juice, in order to obtain the separation at the beginning of the operation, so as to secure the sugar from the destructive effects arising from these impure ties during the whole evaporation; and every sugar maker knows that it is a great inconvenience for the juice to be constantly in motion by ebullition, as in such case it is impossible to obtain a complete separation of insoluble matters. It is plain that my new mode of operating avoids this inconvenience, because that during and after purifying or defection, the liquor is away from the fire and may allow the matters separated by purifying to be precipitated without motion or any disturbance. Chevet14874 X. a. No. 4986. Having thus described the nature of the invention and the manner of performing the same, we would remark that we do not confine ourselves to the precise details herein given, so long as the character of the invention lie retained, but what we claim is the process herein above described for making in leather, swords, scabbards, sheaths, tubes, trappers, and cases for fire arms and for other purposes without the use of blueing, cementing, or sewing, as specified. Durand. Pecqueur. No. 4987.

Rfuben Fai Rchi Of, Starr Fai Rchi Of. No. 4991. What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the mode of producing the barrel form of metallic pens by the use of a mandrel and plate as herein set forth. Of. G. Bagley. No. 4992. Having thus explained the nature of my invention, that which I claim is as follows, viz: I claim the pressure roller, (i) which makes pressure on the lap joint for welding, in combination with the beak e) that resists the pressure of the roller (i) when this beak is made of less diameter than the inside of the tube, and bent upwards to sustain e lap joint under the roller, (i) substantially as described, what be sustained by its attachment* at the outer end above or by under rollers, (y) and (w) as described and placed between point of the beak and its attachment. In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my signature this twenty-sixth day of May, in the year of our Word one thousand eight hundred and forty-six. J. H. Russell. No. 499 3 am aware that there are other kinds of folding apparatus in use, particularly those described in the patents of Joel Spaulding and Silas C. Margin. My machinery is much simpler and more effective in its operations than such. I do not make use of folding boards as they do, such as are made to slide over the surface of the cloth and press it down upon the cloth below it, and with such force as to often draw it from underneath the latch bars used in such mechanism. I do not use latch bars which rest on the upper surface of the cloth, but simple bolts, which press over the edges of the cloth, and over which the cloth is folded, and by which it is so held as not to be pulled away by the tapping frame. My tapping frame    conceive to be a very different matter from the folding boards used by Spaulding. I therefore do not claim a combination of reciprocaling folding boards and latch bars, such as are described in the specification of the patent of Joel Spaulding, but that which I do claim is my improvements therein; the same consisting, first, in the vibrating lap pig frame apparatus, as constructed and made to operate substantially as above described; second, in the latch bolts 876 X. for apparatus made to operate over the sides or edges of the cloth as specified; third, in the s lacking apparatus, as constructed and combined with the tapping frame and watching machinery, and operating therewith substantially as set forth. In testimony whereof I have here to set my signature this twenty first day of November, A. D. 1846.* Elbri Dge G. Woodman. No. 4994. I claim as my invention the employment of a horizontal sliding lathe, with measuring and folding scales or bars, that folds and deposites the cloth in layers of one yard or any other exact measure. Also, the use of receivers or holders that operate in connexion with the sliding lathe, to receive and firmly hold from slipping the successive layers of cloth as they are distributed by the folding scales. Also the use of a compressible bed or platform on which the cloth is deposited, that, operating in connexion with the sliding scales and receivers, shall gradually lower to make room for the cloth as it is folded thereon. I do not construed my claim to originality in these three particulars as depending upon the use of the exact set, or form, or size of wheels, springs, or other fixture, set forth in these drawing but I claim the invention of the* above or any analogous corn (cid127ionthat shall operate to produce like results, by which cloth the like fabrics are deposited in compact folds of one yard in length, or any other required measure, by means of a sliding lathe, receivers, and a compressible bed. Arnold R. Austi  N. No. 4995. What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, are the two changes, (c and d) as shown in fig. 3, which connect together by the screw bolt (M) permanently the f large (c of the <a name="mould32"><mark>mould</mark></a> board (A) with the f large (d) of the guard plate, (was described in the specification, and illustrated by the drawings. My mode of connecting the <a name="mould33"><mark>mould</mark></a> board and guard plate leaves the <a name="mould34"><mark>mould</mark></a> board free from the sheath or upright, and renders the plough stronger, and much easier put together; and the bar which binds the <a name="mould35"><mark>mould</mark></a> board to the share, if it should break, can be mended without difficulty. My invention may be applied to either right or left handed ploughs. I de nominate the said plough the Albert furrow guard plough. Emanuel Albert. No. 4996. Having thus fully described my improvement, what I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the combination and arrangement of the flies with the cylinder so as to take x. 
877the draft off on each side, directly at the top of the fire, and cause it to descend, thence ascend the corner flies, as described, the stove having an opening in the top for fuel, as above set forth. John T. Davy. No. 4997. What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the method of reducing boards to equal thicknesses or widths by passing them under the action of cutting or scoring wheels, which cut into the surface, substantially as herein described, when this is combined with another c utter or cutters which cuts off the parts scored or invented, substantially as herein described; and  also claim, in combination with this, a smoothing plane or planes for shaving or smoothing the surface, substantially as herein described. And I wish it to be understood that I claim this method of reducing and, planing plank, boards, &c, whether for planting the surface, tongueing or. grooving, or cutting <a name="mould36"><mark>mould</mark></a> kings. John Cumberland. No. 4998. I do not claim simply the employment of he local springs as a means of hanging carriages, nor simply connecting the springs with tie carriage by means of levers, as these are all well known, but what I do claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is arranging the he local springs that support the carriage horizontally and length wise along the bottom of the carriage, when this is employed in combination with the four levers having their arms at right angles, or nearly so, to form the connexion between the springs and carriage body and frame of the running gear, the whole being constructed and arranged substantially as herein described. John Maxson. No. 4999. What I claim as my invention and improvement, and for which I desire the exclusive privilege and right there for, is for the application of any kind of net or open work material, affixed upon arms, radiating from a shaft to act as a better or b eaters, either with or without a manner, in the cleaning of cotton c. Robert M. Of  Of   Ngston. No. 5000. Having thus fully described my improvements, I wish it to be understood that I do not plain i placing pro pellets at the sides of a boat, when said pro pellets are formed with the pro telling surface extending into the axle, or nearly so, whether said prop elder be a true felix, a carbolic or other curve, as that has been before es 8 78 X. D. No. 54.sayed, but in that case the prop elder was either wholly submerged, or submerged nearly to its shaft, which brings its connexions with the motive power down to the water line; but what I do claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is, first, the employment of side wheels, having their shafts parallel with the line of motion, with narrow short paddles, in an oblique position on the periphery of the wheel, and all the radial lines of which are perpendicular to the shaft, constructed substantially as herein set forth, and so arranged as to dip the paddle only into the water, in the manner and for the purpose described, the paddles being made to enter and leave the water without obstruction, and with sufficient velocity to prevent putting it in motion before leaving it, enough to impede the progress of the boat, as above specified. Secondly. I claim placing two or more wheels on the same shaft, as above set forth, the lead or angle of the paddles of the, rear wheels being increased, as herein described. Lastly. I claim forming the wheel with two or more arms projecting down to the periphery of each of the stationary paddles, said arms being embraced by the paddles, which are made in two parts for that purpose, so as to present no obstruction to their passage through the water, while the strength and lightness of construction are fully preserved, and the paddles are perfectly braced. Stephen J. Gold. No. 5001. What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is constructing the links of the endless chain of a horse power, in the manner described, so that they form connexions and a permanent axle for the friction rollers, while at the same time they constitute the rack by which the power is transmitted, substantially as set forth, by which means the use of axles, extending through from side to side, is dispensed with, while the advantage of the rollers attached to the platform is retained, forming a cheap and efficient horse power. Jesse Urmy. No. 5002. What I claim as my invention, and desire' to secure by letters patent, is making the spokes, which unite the hut and rim of railroad car wheels, each of a plate, one portion of which is parallel with the ons of the hut, and extending from the hut to the rim, and the other connected with the rim in a line diagonal with the plane of the wheel, and extending from the rim to the hut, the first gradually diminishing from the rim to the hut, substantially in the manner and for the purpose described.

Norri S L. Marti  N. No. 5005. It will be manifest to every machines t, that the crippling and the weaving apparatus, herein described, may be made to assume other forms, and yet produce a like effect; and it will be manifest, also, that the merit of the invention does not consist; in the particular of constructing these machines, but in the process of crippling the wires, preparatory to the forming of the meshes for screens, therewith. I claim, as of my invention, the apparatus, herein described, for weaving the screens from wire, so crinkled; said weaving apparatus consisting in the combination of the stretching frame, or blocks, and screws G and H, with the sliding frame J J, the harness I, and the sleigh L, which are attached to the said frame, the whole of which are made to advance, from one end to the other of the loom by means of the lever O and its appendages. Henry Jenki Of. No. 5006. What I claim, therefore, as constituting my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the manufacturing of screens orsieves from wire of the larger size, either rolled or drawn; the wire from which they are made' being prepared by wrinkling, as herein set forth, previously to its being formed into meshes, by which procedure I am enabled to manufacture screens with meshes of the larger sizes, say four inches on the side, more or less, and in such manner as that they shall be more dura be and less costly than those made in other ways. And this new manufacture ofsieves I claim, independently of the particular manner of effecting the wrinkling, or of inter weaving the wire so as to form the requisite meshes. Henry Jenki Ns880 X. a.

And I also claim the method, substantially as described, of giving the reciprocaling motions of any desired extent, and greater than the circumference of the act eating opinion, by placing the two ranks on each side of a plane at right angles to the axis of the opinion, in combination with the opinion, having cogs entirely around its circumference, in the middle of its length, and segments of cogs on each side, as described. Moses I Ngalls. No. 5016. What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the construction of a double gaged cast iron levis, substantially as described. John Van Brockli  N. No. 5017. This pendulous plate, together with its ball or weight G, and the cylindrical stud B, (figs. 2 and 3) constitutes the improvement which      claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent. This plate may be constructed of wood, or any kind of metal, and may be made to assume any fanciful shape, provided it contain the points necessary to the attachment of the parts connected with theescapement and pendulum; and provided the part G be of sufficient weight to preserve the plate in a perpendicular position. The cylindrical stud may be made of brass, or any other metal, and maybe attached to the frame of the clock by screws or otherwise. John S. Grei G. No. 5018. It will be obvious that this mode of moving and transferring the plates of comb teeth may be employed in connexion with a combing, carding or brushing cylinder, or any two or all three of the min succession, and that the fibres may be applied and removed from them by any means desired, as these make no part of my invention; and that instead of using the grooved cylinders at the end of the machine to transfer the plates from i one of the grooved bars to the other, and back again, slides may Red substituted, moving either horizontally, vertically, or in any other direction; or that they may be made to slide in appropriate grooves or slides, as I do not limit my invention to the precise arrangement of machinery for effecting the transfer. What I claim, therefore, as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is making the series of plates that carry the comb teeth continuous in their action by transferring x. a. 883 them at each end from one groove or set of ways to another, and back again, substantially as herein described. Chas. G. Sargent. No. 5019. What I claim as my invention and improvement, and desire to secure letters patent for, is the self adjusting quality or property the bosom possesses by the addition and application of the yoke and elastic strap above described which belong to no other false bosom. M. Tassi    E. No. 5020. From the foregoing it will be obvious that the parts of this mechanism, which I claim as my invention, can undergo many modifications without changing the principle of my invention, as for instance: instead of using the mechanism, above described, for shifting the belt from one driving pulley to the other, a clutch maybe substituted, or any other arrangement of mechanical, means which will shift the belt from one to the other, or clutch and un clutch the parts, the object being to start one part of the mechanism as the other is arrested, a brake being used for each separate organization, so that the moment the driving power is shifted, the brake shall act to arrest the momentum of the moving parts. Again, instead of using fingers that open and close to receive anddeliverothe fig during wires, hooked arms may be employed, and connected with an harbor, so that they can turn to pass under the wire to receive it from the pince is, and in like manner turn to drop it into the box which carries it under the fig during warps. And, instead of the hop per and scuttle formed box for receiving and introducing the wires, arms, such are employed in the box to close and open the bottom for the delivery of the wire, may be used without the box, by giving them a greater curve, as the main object is to give the wire ample support as it passes between the warps. But notwithstanding all the modifications of which my invention is susceptible, the mode fully described and represented of applying the principles or characteristics of my invention, which distinguishes it from all other, things before known, I deem the best. My object, in referring to the others being simply to show that I have contemplated other modes. What I claim, therefore, as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is giving to the two parts of the mechanism, that which weaves the cloth or forms the body of the fabric and the one which operates the fig during wires, a separate and distinct organization, substantially as described, when these are connected and combined by an intermediate mechanism, which shifts the motion or driving power from one to the other, substantially as described. And, in combination with this, I also claim the employment of the two b rakes to arrest the momentum of the moving parts, to prevent aqy884 X. conflict in the operations of the two parts of the mechanism as described. I also claim the method, substantially as above described, of taking the fig during wires and transferring them, one by one, to the apparatus which introduces them under the fig during warps, as described. And finally, I claim the method, substantially as described, of carrying and dropping the fig during wires under the fig during wars by means of a sliding box, or its equivalent, which supports the wire, as described. E . B. Of Gelow. No. 5021. What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the mode of relieving the pressure of the 'swell lever, "F, against the 'scuttle" whilst the "scuttle" is leaving the "box Also, the mode of causing the loom to run backward, without the use of the "scuttle" by means of the before described combination of the "additional finger" A, with the "stop rod" D, and lathe arm" B, and pin, G, or any other combination, substantially the same for producing analogous results.

What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the combination of the knives with the crushing cylinder and cutting box, in the manner herein before described. The advantages of such a machine consist chiefly in its being capable of cutting and crushing a greater quantity of fodder, straw, &c, in the same time, than any machine heretofore invented within the knowledge of the petitioner; the facility of its being attached to any power, such as common horse power, of threshing machines, &c; also the perfection with which the knives cut, placed in the manner described, and the superior quality of the food after having been crushed, as before stated, between the cylinder and concave. Another great advantage, and one which is highly important to the agriculturists, and which is generally, I believe, made a point with the Commissioner of Patents, is the simplicity of its construction and the durability of the machine. The great advantage of the knives being placed as they are on the cylinder, is, 1stTheyare less liable to get dull than if they were placed in any other position. 2d. Because they have less resistance to overcome, from the fact of their having the same angle to cut through the Fodder c, that they are placed at on the cylinder; for the greater the angle, the greater tendency the fodder has to slip from the knives and consequently dull them.

I do not claim as my invention simply expelling air from a receiver, by means of steam from a boiler or genera to r, to fill the said receiver with water by the pressure of the atmosphere, as this is a well known device, but what I do claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the combination of a self acting receiver and boiler, constructed substantially in the manner described, for the purpose of supplying hot and cold water, for bathing or other similar purposes, the receiver being connected with the boiler by a spoon, and having gage pipes in its sides for regulating the quantity of water 4 discharged at one operation, and the boiler having its discharge pipe situated so far above the bottom as to retain a sufficient quantity of water to fill it and the receiver with steam for a renewed operation, all as herein described. Of Of. H. Hobbs. No. 5378. Having thus specified my improvements, that which I claim is as follows: I claim the combination of mechanism by which the stroll shaft has a partial rotary forward motion imparted to it, and is allowed to fall or move backwards; the same consisting of the standard, e, or any equivalent there for, the bent lever, c, the spring dog, a, the clutch or dog wheel, g, or their mechanical substitutes, the whole being arranged, applied to the stroll shaft i and operated and made to operate together, substantially as specified. And, in combination with the aforesaid shaft and machinery for imparting to it its rotate ve motion or motions, I claim the can and chain, and machinery connecting said shaft with the ring rail or rays, or any mechanical equivalents there for, the whole being for the purpose of raising the ring rail or nails, and suffering it o rib hm to fall down, for the purpose of laying or binding thread over each layer of thread of each of. the' cops, as specified. I further claim the combination of mechanism by which I am enabled to regulate the length ,of each successive layer of yarn composing the cop, the same consisting of the can, f, and made to rotate on the stroll shaft, as described, the worm gear, u, endless screw, 1, shaft, w, frame, x, hatchet wheel, y, vibrating lever, a impelling pall, b, lever 2, standard, f 2, projection, z, and rod, h, extending downwards from the ring rail, or their mechanical equivalents, the whole being combined and made to operate substantially as specified. I further claim, in its application to the stroll shaft, the combination of mechanism, by which the fall of the ring rail is regulated in such manner as to prevent it from descending too suddenly so as to break any of the yarns, the said mechanism consisting of the x. 
985fly wheel 0, and machinery for rotating it as applied to the stroll shaft, and made to operate in connexion therewith, substantially as specified. And for the purpose of causing the ring rail to rise upwards with the increased velocity necessary to prevent the yarn from piling too much in any one place, and thereby destroying the conical form of such layer of yarn composing the cop, I claim the can 2,lever K, and roll my, or any equivalents there for, as combined with the stroll shaft, and the chain g, and made to operate substantially in the manner as herein before explained. And, in combination with the said machinery, I claim the projection 2, applied to the can I, for the purpose of producing a very quick rise of the ring rail, in order to finish the nose or upper extremity of each layer of yarn composing the cop, in the manner as specified. And I also claim the above described manner of making each of the spindles in order that it may be elevated so as to carry a broken end of yarn above the ring rail, so that an attendant may readily seize it to piece up or join it to, the thread proceeding from the draw rollers without being obliged to wait for the ring rail to fall downwards. And I also claim to construct the spindle, directly beneath that part of it on which the cop is formed, of a diameter proper to produce the lateral day on the traveller sufficient to overcome its inertia, and impart to it a velocity necessary to prevent the yarn from being broken, in combination with making that part of the spindle, on which the cop is formed, smaller in diameter, as above specified, the same being for the object or purpose as herein set forth. George H. Dodge. No. 5379. Having thus described my. improved loom, I wish it distinctly understood that I do not intend to confine my invention or improvements to the precise form or arrangements, as specified, but   mean to vary them in any manner, while I do not depart from the principles or parts claimed as new. I do not claim two sets of rising and falling shutter boxes, applied respectively to both ends of the lay, or both sides of the loom three or four series of scuttle boxes applied to the lay or loom, and made to operate in such manner as to move back and forth horizontally, as well as to rise and fall vertically at suitable intervals of time; nor do I claim a simple series of rotating or revolving scuttle boxes applied to one end of the lay or loom, in combination with one simple scuttle box, applied to the other end of the lay or loom; but that which I do claim is the combination of two revolving series of scuttle boxes, applied respectively to both ends of the lay of the loom, and made to rotate forwards and backwards or operate together, in manner as specified. By the employment of two revolving series of scuttle boxes, in 219 86 X. stead of rising and falling ones, very important advantages a regained, in their combined operation. When a series of boxes is composed of four or more, and they are arranged the one over the other so as to rise and fall if a scuttle is to be thrown from the first box, and be succeeded by one in the last box, the whole of the series must be gradually raised upwards or depressed, as the case may be, before the scuttle of the last box can be ejected therefrom. This requires a great waste of time; now when the series are arranged around a revolving axis or shaft, or what are termed revolving boxes, the first box of the series may be said to be directly alongside of the last one; to throw the last scuttle, the series would only require to have the movements reversed the breadth of one box. Thus, it will be seen, a great saving of time can be effected in s shot about" weaving. The arrangement of the boxes around an axis, to revolve, enables me to bring many of them into action, much sooner or with more despatch than when they are arranged in line with each and the one over the other, and are made to rise and fall vertically. I also claim the pattern belt of change able wires, external and c, central links, as made, confined, and applied together, and to asp rocket wheel or other equivalent, substantially as specified, in combination with the reversing arms 1, 0, and supplementary wires 2, 2, of the pattern belt, or other equivalents, as combined with the apparatus or mechanism for rotating either series of scuttle boxes; the said arms and wires being for the purpose of reversing the motions Of the boxes, as specified. I consider the combination of a circular plate z 3 and change able screw pins inserted in it, as above explained, and as applied and used in manner set forth as a mechanical equivalent for the pattern belt, above described. I also claim the weighted lever W, and pin by, or any equivalentstherefor, in combination with the lever P and step motion of the loom, the same being for the purpose -of arresting the motion of the spoke t wheel and pattern belt, or the pattern plate z 3, when a falling thread breaks, as specified. I also claim one or more inclined planes or came pp, q 3, as applied to or combined with the loom frame or lay and revolving series of scuttle boxes, for the purposes hereinbefore specified. I also claim the contrivance for elevating the loose filling we ft threads, out of the way of the stop motion of the loom, the same consisting of the arm r, as arranged and operated substantially as specified. I also claim the combination of pins a 4, a 4, notches b 5, or other similar contrivances, with the front end of the revolving series of scuttle boxes, in the manner and for the purposes substantially as set forth. James Of Eld. X. a. 987No. 5380.
