In: In accordance with the provisions of the act of Congressgentitled "in act in addition to the act to promote the progress of science and the useful arts~ approved March 3, 1837, the undersigned has the honor to submit his annual report. The whole number of applications for patents, received during the year ending December 31, 1848, is sixteen hundred and twenty-eight. The number of caveats filed, during the same period, is six hundred and seven. The whole number of patents issued during the year 1848, is six hundred and sixty, including twenty-three reissues, three additional improvements, and forty-six designs; classified and alphabetical lists of which, with the names of the patentees and their places of residence, are annexed, marked J and K. But one disclaimer was entered during the same period. Within the same year six hundred and twenty-six patents have expired, a list of which is* annexed, marked L. There were during the same period nine applications to extend patents, the terms of which were about to expire; seven of these were rejected and two granted. Two patents were also extended during the year by acts of Congress. The claims, embraced in the respective patents issued during the year 1848, are also annexed, marked M. As a much larger proportion of the applications are rejected than are granted, and as many of the rejected applications may be reconsidered and passed, it is not deemed necessary to notice particularly the action of the office with reference to that class of its business. The receipts of the office during the year 1848, including duties and fees, paid into the treasury on applications for patents, caveats, reissues, disclaimers, additional improvements, extensions, recording assignments and other papers, and for copies, amount in the whole to the sum of                   $67,576.69; of which sum                                                                                                                                                                 $11,529.33 has been repaid on applications withdrawn, and for money refunded which was paid in by mistake, as per statement, marked A. The expenses of the office during the year 1848, are as follows 4x. viz: For salaries,                                                 $22,581.90; temporary clerks,             $7,956.80; contingent expenses,      $9,467.65; compensation of the chief justice of the District of Columbia, sitting on appeals from the Commissioner of Patents,                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100; library,                                                                                                                                                             $1,414.09; agricultural statistics,                                               $2,608.17; printing digest of patents,                                                                                                                                                             $1,700; compensation for extra services to E. G. Smith, under the act of Congress for his relief, approved August 5, 1848,                                                                                                                                                             $1,000;* amounting in the whole to                            $46,831.61, as per statement, marked B. There was also expended during the last year, under the act of arch 3, 1837, for the restoration of records and drawings, the sum of                           $44, as per statement, marked C. The aggregate of expenditures under the different heads above enumerated, including money refunded on withdrawals and money returned which had been paid in by mistake, is                             $58,905.84; leaving a balance to be carried to the credit of the patent fund of                     $8,670.85. In the first day of January, 1848, the amount of money in the c treasury to the credit of the patent fund was                                                             $207,797.98. Thus the amount in the treasury to the credit of the patent fund, including the balance paid in during the year 1848, was, on the first day of January, 1849,                                                  $216,468.83. The large balances over expenditures, which have accrued during the last four years, were caused, in part, by the great increase of applications for patents, which accumulated in such a degree, as to far exceed the ability of the examining force of the office to dispose of them; thus occasioning a dis proportion between the applications and withdrawals, as compared with former years. That cause has been removed by the recent increase of the force of the office, and it may now be expected that until the office is relieved of its accumulated business, the proportion of withdrawals to the receipts of the office will be greater than in former years, and, consequently, the balance which will accrue to the credit of the patent fund will be less. By the act of Congress, approved May 27, 1848, two principal and two assistant examiners, and two ordinary clerks, were added to the force of the office, and the salaries of the examiners were raised from                                                                                                                                                             $1,500 a year to                                               $2,500, and the assistant examiners from                                                                                                                                                             $1,250 to                                                                                                                                                             $1,500. The clerks authorized by the act before mentioned were allowed salaries of                                                                                                                                                             $1,200 each per annum. Thus, the increase of the number of examiners and clerks, and of salaries provided for by the act of May 27, 1848, will occasion an addition to the annual expenditures of the office of                                                                                                                                                                                   $12,900. This amount will be reduced by fees for recording assignments, authorized to be charged by the same act; but the permanent addition to the expenses of the office will not be less than                                                                                                                                                                                             $10,000 per annum. Notwithstanding this addition to the permanent expenditures of the office, the constant increase of its business and receipts give ample assurance that its revenues will continue to equal, if not ex* Allowed Mr. Smith for extra work out of office hours on the agricultural report underM4I r.

But if its revenues should, for a year or two fall below its expenditures, the patent find is sufficient to meet such casual deficiency; and thus the policy of Congress, in making the Patent Office a self sustaining institution, will be successfully maintained. The two principal and two assistant examiners, provided for by the act of May 27, 1848, were appointed as soon as it was believed that suitable persons had been found for those offices, and they entered immediately upon the discharge of their duties. When they had acquired a sufficient knowledge of the duties of their desks, and had become sufficiently acquainted with the routine of business to begin to render efficient aid to the office, which was not before the first of August, the number of applications on hand awaiting the action of the office was 998. In the first day of January, 1849,.that number was reduced to 539, notwithstanding the difficulties which the examining branch of the force of the office were obliged to encounter, resulting from the inexperience of half their number thus exhibiting a flattering proof of the progress of business, and promising an early relief from the embarrassments under which the office has long labored in consequence of the great amount of business which had accumulated during the last three years, for want of a force in the scientific desks sufficient to dispose of it. A very few months will probably relieve the office entirely from its present embarrassments. The rigid examinations now made in the Patent Office, with regard to the originality and patent ability of new discoveries and improvements, result in the rejection of a much larger proportion of the applications than formerly, when a less scrutinizing system of examination was pursued. Before I assumed the duties of Commissioner, more than half the applications were patented. During the last four years, not quite half of those which have been examined have been patented, and now the proportion of applications patented to those rejected is about two to three. Within a few years the inventive genius of the country, under some stimulant or other not readily perceived, has been more than usually active, and has produced corresponding results. Formerly, invention was pursued. mainly from an ardent desire to develop the laws of nature, and to adapt them by mechanism and by processes to the use of man. Now, it is not only pursued from a love o science and from motives of a noble ambition, but by some as a profession. Hence invention, instead of accomplishing at the present time, by its essays and experiments, as many striking results in proportion to the number of its products as in certain periods of history, applies itself more to improvements in details. It now aims to improve what already exists in a form more or less imperfect, and to adapt itself to the practical wants of society. short, it has become more utilitfrian than it has been in earlier periods. Such, at least, is the conclusion to which I have arrived from very considerable opportunity to observe the progress of invention in this and other countries, during the time I have discharged the duties of Commissioner of Patents. X. a. Met, it would be very unjust to the inventive genius of the present age to affirm, that every year does not produce great and original inventions, which illustrate the progress of science and add much to the elements of civilization and the improvement of society. But my purpose was more particularly to bring to view the fact that, in consequence of the many improvements in details, much is believed to be discovered which has already been known and hence a greater proportion of 'applications for patents, in late years, have been rejected than have been patented. The reports of the four principal examiners, addressed to the undersigned, and giving a review of the most valuable inventions which have passed their desks during the year, are annexed, marked, E, F, and G. They are referred to as containing brief but interesting views of the progress of invention and improvement in the mechanics arts in this country during the last year; and, also, as proofs of the intricate and difficult duties which that class of officers are required to perform. I n' my three former reports I have taken the occasion respectfully to bring to the attention of Congress the propriety and experience of amending the present statutes relating to patents, with a view to give more efficient remedies to patentees against the infringements and depredations of 'pirates~ as those individuals are appropriately de nominated who make it a business wilfully to invade the rights of the inventor, and appropriate the fruits of his ingenuity and labor to their own use. I have, in my former reports, so minutely pointed out the defects of the present patent system, and so zealously urged their remedy, that it would be but a useless repetition to add more upon that subject than to refer to the views expressed in my reports alluded to. The experience of every day, and the prolific crop of litigation which has recently sprung up from the unscrupulous and remorseless invasion of the rights of patentees, by persons who have no claim nor pretension to the name of inventor, nor to the fruits of inventive genius, point with impressive force to the necessity of some reform in the existing- laws which shall give greater security to the rights vested in patentees. The facilities of evening punishment or retribution for a wilful infringement of the property of patentees is now so great, that the whole term during which a patent runs is not sufficient, if it be for a very valuable invention, to vindicate and establish the just claims of the inventor. This evil could be remedied by a few simple amendments to the existing law of patents. Of a provision were made for the repeal of a patent, and if it were provided that, until it was avoided by process of repeal, the instrument should be received in all actions of infringement as conclusive evidence of the right of the plaintiff to recover, much of the difficulty, expense, and injustice, which now fall upon the patent le, would be avoided. It is, therefore, hoped that Congress will speedily act upon this matter, and thus provide for the protection of a class of men who contribute so much to the convenience, X. 4 comforts, and luxury of the community, and to the progress of society in science, art, and civilization And surely, the de predator upon the rights of the patentee rights which are solemnly and sacredly guaranteed to him by law on the condition that he surrenders to the public the secret of his invention is not entitled to the sympathy, nor the protection of the legislator. The wilful infringe r of the rights of the inventor is as base and corrupt morally, as that class of the community known as common thieves. His offence is committed from the same depraved and wicked motive. He is impelled 'by the same corrupt intent, or animus fur and, which actuated the perpetrators of a large ny, and should be hunted from society. with the same inexorable perseverance. Justice, therefore, requires that the wilful infringe r of patents should be punished with the same rigid severity with which the common thief is punished. But the laws enacted by Congress for the protection of the inventor fall very far short of securing to him this measure of justice. For is it asked by him nor in his behalf. He will be content if the title deed of property, which he receives from the government on condition of the surrender of his secret to the public shall be respected, and shall be conclusive as to his rights, until it has been duly set aside by the tribunals of his country, in a proceeding against the patent itself. Of his invention were not required to undergo a severe and critical examination, in reference particularly to its novelty and originality, at the Patentoffice, there would be some propriety in making his patent merely prima face evidence of title in suits for infringement. But after it has passed such an ordeal, one trial, at least, in a court of justice, had in good faith upon the merits of the invention, should be sufficient to establish its validity, and secure to the patentee an undisturbed enjoyment o( his property until the end of the term of his exclusive privilege. It must be obvious, upon the least reflection, that the best and true st interests of society will be aided and advanced by the adoption of a system of policy with regard to inventors, which will give them adequate security and protection in the enjoyment of their just rights. Of they cannot obtain the security and protection to which their genius and labors entitle them, which justice awards to them, and which are promised in the constitution and laws of their country, it requires no sagacity to perceive that discovery in science and improvement in the arts will be greatly checked; for men will not devote their intellects, their toils and their fortunes, to pursuits which promise them injustice, spoliation and poverty, instead of securing for them regeneration, competence and honors. It has come to the knowledge of the undersigned, since his last report, that one method of evening the rights of patentees in the United States is the setting up of machines in Canada or other neighboring British provinces, where the articles manufactured by such machines are fabric a ted and thence brought into the United States and sold to the great injury of the American patentee. As the sale of the products of a patented machine has been decided by our 8 X. a. Courts not to be an infringement of the patent, the patentee has no remedy in the case now under consideration. The protection, therefore, of. our own citizens holding patentscid127uder this government would seem to require some legislation for the suppression of these fraudulent practices carried on within the limits of a foreign jurisdiction. A provision authorizing the seizure and forfeiture of all fabrics and manufactures which have been produced in a foreign jurisdiction, by machines protected by patents in the United States, and brought into this country for salewouI d probably be an adequate remedy against such a violation of he rights of the American patentee. In my last annual report, I had the honor to refer the attention ca Congress to the experience of placing the citizens and subjects, of foreign governments, applying for patents in this country, on the same ground with regard to fees which our own citizens occupy. Seeming the matter of much importance to the interests of this country, I feel it to be my duty again to bring that subject to the consideration of that honorable body it present, the subject of a foreign government who applies to this of ice for a patent is required to pay the sum of                                       $500, if a subject of Great Britain, and                                       $300 if the subject or citizen of any other foreign power, before his application can be received; while the American citizen is required to pay only                                   $30. It is true that the fees and duties required in most foreign countries are very much higher than those which our laws demand, but they are imposed on all alike, whether subjects or foreigners. But, even if it were just to make a discrimination in favor of American citizens, with regard to fees, for patents, I am of the Opinion that the policy is injurious to the interests of this country, and therefore not expedient. There are in foreign countries many valuable inventions and improvements which are used in secret, for the very reason that the inventors are not able to pay the enormous duties required by their governments for the security of a patent, or are fearful that they will not be protected if they were patented. And many of those inventions would find their way to this country, if their proprietors could introduce them without being burdened with a heavy tax at the outset, before they could try the experiment of their success. In my judgment, if the foreigner were placed upon the sam equal footing with the citizen, with regard to the fees charged i pon his application, it would result in a large addition to our stock of useful and valuable inventions and improvements, and letter enable our citizens and mechanics to compete with the i rivals of other countries. This consideration alone should outweigh the value of the insignificant revenue amounting each year to a few thousand dollars, which is now derived from foreign applications. For would it at all interfere with the rights or interests of the American inventor. The competition of invention is not that which arises from the production of the same descriptions of fabiricsbut it exists in a proud and honorable rivalry of efforts to x. Produce new things which do not interfere with each other, I roi which are accessions to the stock of invention and art already known and in use. The field of invention is as illimitable as the world of mind and matter, and is now but just beginning to be cultivated. There is, therefore, ample room for all explorers after the valuable treasures, which yet, in rich abundance, lie hidfdeand undeveloped in its bosom, and which will require the thought and labor of ages to discover and reclaim for the uses of mankind am, therefore, deeply impressed with the belief that the interests of this country would be greatly promoted by encouraging through the instrumentality of a liberal system of legislation, the inventors and improves in the arts of other countries, to come here with the productions of their genius and labor, and seek. a reward by introducing them into use. In the, patent systems of most countries, encouragement is offererifor the introduction of foreign inventions, which have never before been introduced, by granting such persons as may be at the expense, and sometimes danger, of procuring a knowledge of their abroad, and importing them into their native country, a description of patents called " patents of importation." These patent secure to the introduced of the foreign invention rights and privileges similar to those which are enjoyed by original inventors. Our system contains no provision for the granting of patents o if importation; yet, in my experience in the office of commissioner, many instances have come to my knowledge where justice and the public interests required such a reward to enterprising persons wh a had obtained a knowledge' of valuable inventions abroad, which hadTanot been introduced and were not known in this country. Recently an enterprising citizen of the country applied to the undersigned to know if there was a legal mode of protecting him for a limited period, in the enjoyment of the art of manufacturing. Russia sheet iron, the secret of which he alleged he had obtaineds there was no provision of the existing law which applied to his case, he was referred to Congress as the only department of the government which could give him the protection and reward which he claimed. The secret which he alleged he had obtained is a mcstivaluable one, and I believe is known only to the Russian manufacturer of the article. I to introduction into this country would contribute more to our national wealth than hundreds of ordinary inventions made at home, and therefore, in my opinion, the imported was eminently worthy of a reward in the form of a patent, securing to him the exclusive enjoyment of it for a limited term of years. Legislation reaching such cases would certainly be founded icid127swisdom and good policy. Ample provision could be made against fraud or in position where patents are applied for to protect imported inventions. The importer of the new art or manufacture should, as the inventor now is, be required to disclose his secret and a rigid examination should be made into its novelty in this and other countries, as is now made with original inventions, before a patent of importation is granted. With such provisions and guard six. the new feature proposed may be safely introduced into our patent system. The undersigned, having had an opportunity during the past year to attend several of the mechanics' fairs which have been held in various cities of the Union, is gratified in being able to bear testimony in favor of the present flourishing condition of the arts in this country. In some branches of the arts and manufactures, the beauty, ingenuity, and skill of workmanship, displayed by our artisans, cannot be surpassed. They may proudly challenge comparison with the products of the most skilful and ingenious of other nations. And what is particularly gratifying, is the fact that every year exhibits a sensible progress in the various departments of mechanical industry, and promises, at no very distant period, to elevate our country to the front rank of nations in the abundance, variety, and perfection of its products, manufactures, and other works of art. The report of this office upon the condition and statistics of agriculture, during the year 1848, is annexed, marked I. In reference to the table of the estimated crops, for the year 1848, it will be seen that they exhibit generally a very sensible increase over those of former years. The careful and scrutinizing observation of every cause which can affect the growing crops in every section of the country, during the year, which is made at this office, enables me to state that the past year has been very favorable to the growth of the great staples, as well as the minor agricultural products of the Union. The quantity of wheat raised in the United States during the last year will, according to the estimates of this office, not be less than12600000 bushels. he quantity of corn produced is estimated to be about 588,000,000 bushels; oats, 185,000,000 bushels; <a name="potatoes0"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, 114,000,000 bushels; rye, 33,000,000 bushels; buckwheat12500000 bushels; barley, 6,222,000 bushels; hay, 15,735,000tons; hemp, 20,330 tons; cotton, 1,066,000,000 pounds; tobacco219000000 pounds; rice, 119,000,000 pounds; and sugar, (in Louisiana) 200,000,000 pounds. Thus it will be seen that the agricultural productions of theUnioi, during the last year, are ample for the consumption of the country; and of many varieties of grain and provisions, large surpluses will be left for exportation to other countries. There is, probably, no country in the world whose agricultural industry exhibits a more rapid and steady progress than that of the United States. I to population is rapidly augmenting by natural increase and immigration, and every year large quantities of new land are reclaimed from the wilderness and subjected to cultivation. The number ofcultivators and the breadth of soil are fast increasing with each succeeding year; and as Providence yet spares our favored country from the visitations of dear th and famine, which have afflicted less favored countries, the amount of agricultural products must necessarily increase in equal proportion. Very year adds, also, to the skill of our agriculturists, and to. Ex
improvement in agricultural implements; and thus, too, is the amount of production annually augmented. The minute and searching inquiries which this office causes to be made in relation to the condition and interests of agriculture in every neighborhood in the Union, enable the undersigned to speak positively of the increasing activity and energy of our enterprising and intelligent farmers, and their constant advancement in the knowledge and practice of their transcend ant art transcend ant in importance when viewed as the great minister, prolific and efficient in means, to the absolute wants and necessities of man, and the indispensable foundation of all civilized communities and nations. The world has, within comparatively a few years, learned that agriculture offers an almost illimitable field for the operations of the scientific as well as practical experimenter. I to full development seems to require the application of all the physical sciences in some form or other in the analysis of soils; in the nature, structure and habits of plants; in the food of plants and the adaptation of soils and manures to their sustenance and growth; in the improvement of the races and kinds of animals; in the invention and improvement of useful implements and machines; and finally, in political economy, which points the agriculturists to the contemplation of his interests as they may be affected by the institutions and the legislation of governments. Viewed in this light agriculture may truly be regarded as the most important, dignified, elevated and honorable pursuit in which man can engage. The intellectual qualifications which the cultivation of the science of agriculture requires are therefore not second in degree to those which are necessary for the pursuit of any other science. Hence the importance of study, experiment, and close observation n the part of the agriculturists. All who may be engaged in that elevating and enabling pursuit, may not have the time nor the opportunity to become thoroughly versed in the philosophy which lies at its foundation, but, in a life devoted to its practice, the humble st will have the time and the opportunity to acquire much interesting and valuable knowledge. At the last session of Congress an appropriation of                                                                                                                                                             $1,000 was made for the institution of a system of analyses of the different grains produced in this country, and of flour manufactured here and exported abroad. The two most important problems which it was deemed desirable to have solved in reference to this matter were the effect of soil and climate upon the different varieties of grain produced in this country, and the effect of a sea voyage and storage upon the flour and meal manufactured from grain produced here and sent abroad. For this important work I engaged the services of Professor Neck, of New Brunswick, New Jersey, an experienced analytical chemist, who has been occupied during the past season in the execution of the investigation confided to his charge, and who has submitted to me a most interesting and valuable report, which will be found in the appendix to the agricultural report, marked No. 1. As there was but little time after the invest i in was author x. wished before it became necessary to commence the work, I had not the opportunity to procure as many samples of grain and flour for, experiment as I desired. Met, a large number of analyses have been made, and the results are embodied in the report of Professorbeck. I am now receiving samples of wheat, corn and flour, from the ports of the most distant countries to which they have been exported; and if Congress shall continue the appropriation necessary for the investigation, more numerous results may be anticipated for the next report from this office. The investigation in which Professor Neck is now engaged, under my direction, produces not only results of much scientific value, hut they will furnish very valuable information to the manufacturers and ex porters of flour and grain. It is hoped, therefore, that provision will be made by Congress for its continuance. Seeming it of importance that a correct historical, statistical and practical view of the great staples of the southern portion of the Union, which form so large a portion of the exports of this country, should be given to the world in an authentic form, I have devised the plan of instituting close and searching investigations intothe history, progress and culture, and present condition of the great staples of sugar, cotton, tobacco and rice, which, if circumstances will permit, I shall pursue from year to year until my purpose shall have been attained. As a commencement of this system of investigation, I employed an intelligent and able gentleman, Charles L. Leishman, e squire, to visit Louisiana during the last season, to make inquiry into the condition and progress of the sugar culture in that State. He has accomplished in part the object for which he was sent, and has presented to me 1 a us t valuable report, which will be found in the appendix of the a gr cultural report, marked No. 2. As the time which. was allotted to him for the execution of the investigation committed to his charge was not sufficient to enable in to complete his inquiries, it will be necessary for him to re same his labors during the approaching season. His report, although necessarily incomplete, it is believed contains much valuable information, which will be interesting to the public at large, and particularly to the intelligent and enter prizing citizens who are engaged in the sugar culture in this country. The circulars sent out from this office, soliciting information upon the subject of agriculture, were very full and minute in the inquiries which they embodied, and the replies to them, many of them equally minute, contain a large amount of valuable and interesting information, which will be found embodied in the agricultural report and appendix. This office is under great obligation to the intelligent gentlemen who have so promptly and fully responded to its inquiries. And particularly is it indebted to J. D. B. He Now, esq, of New Orleans; Charles List, esq, of Cincinnati; B. P. Johnson, esq , of Albany, N. Y.;. B. Late ham, esq of Columbus, Ohio; J. Cela field, esq, of Seneca county, N, Yminehall Fainter, esq, of Pennsylvania, and N. J. Wyeth, esq, of x. a. Cambridge, Massachusetts, for interesting and valuable communications. Heretofore collections of such <a name="seeds0"><mark>seeds</mark></a> for the field and garden as were deemed most valuable have been obtained for distribution from this office. During the last year near 70,000 packages were distributed. This year nearly as many have been obtained, and will be distributed to the members of Congress before the adjournment of the present session. Most of them have been obtained from <a name="seeds1"><mark>seeds</mark></a> presented to this office by Mr. Patte mare, the enlightened founder of the system of national interchange, and by. Hagedorn, esq, the Bavaria n consul at Philadelphia, which were presented by their respective governments, through their agency, to this office. The <a name="seeds2"><mark>seeds</mark></a> thus obtained were placed in the hands of an intelligent gardener for cultivation, and those which succeeded best in our soil and climate, and appear to be of superior varieties have been preserved for distribution. Native <a name="seeds3"><mark>seeds</mark></a> have also been obtained, and will be distributed. This office is also indebted to Lieutenant Lynch, the commander of the expedition to the Head sea, for many interesting varieties of <a name="seeds4"><mark>seeds</mark></a> which have been kindly placed at the disposal of this office by the Secretary of the Navy, which will form a part of the <a name="seeds5"><mark>seeds</mark></a> distributed during the present year. Such complaint has been made by inventors, on account of the appropriation of a small portion of the, patent fund each year for the agricultural report. And I have heretofore sympathized in suck complaints. Nature reflection, however, has convinced me that no injustice is done to the interests of inventors by such an application of the patent fund; but on the contrary, the interests of the Patentoffice and of inventors themselves have been subserved by it. The agricultural report of the office, by its wide di em i nation throughout the country, has contributed much to increase the reputation and influence of the Patent Office, and to spread more widely among the people a knowledge of the new inventions and improvements which have been made during the year. And thus it promotes the interests of inventors, by contributing to the more rapid introduction and sale of their machines and improvements.  Therefore, in the opinion of the undersigned, there is hardly any object to which the small appropriation made for the agricultural report could be applied, which would benefit inventors more than the preparation and publication of that document. In the pursuit of its statistical investigations, this office has keenly felt the want of means for obtaining accurate and reliable information concerning the great industrial interests of the country, To provision has been made by the general government for obtaining such information, except in relation to the foreign commerce of the country. And, but very few of the States have adopted measures for obtaining authentic information in relation to their industrial interests. Massachusetts and Louisiana are in advance of most other States in their legislation upon these subjects. I n the former State, very full returns are obtained in short periods of, a few years, if not annually, of her industry and resources; and i, X. the latter, a bureau of statistics has been established, at the head of which has been placed one of her most intelligent and talented citizens. A most interesting view of the vast resources of this great republic would be annually exhibited, if all the States should follow the example of Louisiana and Massachusetts. The statesman and legislator, to whom the people commit the destinies of their common country, would then have at their hands ample material to aid them in the intelligent discharge of their momentous. and responsible (duties, without which, they are like blind men feeling their way in the dark. The next census, if the plan for taking it shall be well system sized and digested, will supply much valuable statistical information, in relation to the population, industrial interests, wealth and resources of the republic. The patent system of the United States having existed in some form or other for nearly sixty years, and having how become a very important and interesting institution, I came to the conclusion that a very brief statistical notice of the legislation affecting it, its financial operations, and the progress of invention as exhibited by its records, was much needed, and would be appropriate as a part* of the annual report of this office. I have accordingly prepared such a statement, which is annexed, marked H. The table exhibiting the history and progress of the inventive genius of the Unitedstates contains, in a brief space, many valuable, interesting and striking facts, which cannot fail to arrest the attention of the intelligent observer. The increasing business of the Patent Office has added so much to the duties imposed upon the Chief Justice of the District, who was by the act of A ch 3, 1837, constituted a court of appeals from the decisions of The Commissioner of Patents, that the present compensation which he receives for that service is wholly inadequate to the labor which he is required to perform. He now receives                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100 per annum as the judge of appeals from the Patentoffice. Within the knowledge of the undersigned there has been a single case before the chief justice involving an amount of labor and time, which, if devoted to any other pursuit requiring the same talents and attainments for its execution, would have commanded treble the sum he receives for his services in that capacity for the whole year. It would be just, therefore, that the present compensation of the chief justice should be increased to an amount which would be adequate to the duties and labors which the law imposes upon him. The liberal provisions made by Congress each year for the library of the Patent Office have secured extensive and valuable additions to its size and usefulness. When I first assumed the duties of Commissioner, it contained from 2,500 to 3,000 volumes. It now contains from 5,000 to 6,000 volumes, which are mainly scientific in their character. A small portion of them relate to agriculture, statistics and political economy, and are very necessary to fail i. X. state the investigations with which the office is charged concerning the great industrial interests of the country. The vast number of books and periodical publications of a scientific character now in existence renders it extremely desirable that a general index, containing sufficient reference to the various volumes to enable the scientific investigator to understand the nature of their contents, should be prepared for the use of the public. Such a compilation is desirable in reference to all works of science, and it would be particularly useful and labor saving to the Patentoffice. have, therefore, deemed it proper to recommend that a small sum be appropriated each year from the Patent. Fund for the preparation and continuation of such a digest of the books and publications now in the library of the office, and of such as may be hereafter added to it. The work should, of course, be confided to competent hands, and, when completed, it should be printed for more convenient use. Of it would be deemed proper to put the work, on sale for the benefit of the Patent Office, it would unquestionably enable the office to realise much more from its disposal ire that way than its compilation and publication would cost. As Professor Henry, the distinguished secretary of the Smithsonian I institution, contemplates such a compilation for the library of that institution, the two works might be blended, and a most valuable index to the vast treasures of science would thus be given to the world. The business, operations, and finances of the Patent Office, have expanded rapidly within the last four years. This fact will become more strikingly visible by a contrast of the progress of the office for the last four years with its progress for the four years next preceding. The following statement will exhibit this contrast, viz First period of four years.

It should be remarked, in reference to these results, that, during the first period of four years, more than half the applications for patents were granted; whereas, during the last four years, as has been before remarked, not much, if any, more than three fifths of them have been granted. It is also necessary to observe that, during the first four years, there was expended for the restoration of models, &c, the sum of                          $41,977.31. Of this disbursement had been charged to the account of the expenditures of the office, there would, instead of being an excess of receipts over expenditures of                                                $24,299.68, have been a deficiency of                                                                                                                                                               $17,677.63. The patent fund, therefore, instead of being actually increased, was diminished in the amount last mentioned, during the first period of four years. Firing the second period of four years the sum of                            $5,257.54was paid out for the restoration of models, &c. This sum has been reckoned in the account of expenditures for that period, and only the actual balance stated, which was carried to the credit of the patent fund. Consequently the patent fund has been increased, during that period, in the sum of                            $45,689.63. In the first day of January, 1845, the patent fund amounted to the sum of                                                                                                                                                               $170,-'779 20. In the first day of January, 1849, it amounted to the sum of                                                  $216,468.83. This contrast of the business, operations, and finances of the office during the two periods above stated, is not made with a view to institute an insidious comparison between the administration of amy immediate predecessor and myself on the contrary, the affairs of the office were administered with great ability, prudence, and economy, by the late commissioner but it is made with a view to16Year1845384618471848. Total. Excess. X. a. 17 show the progress of the institution during the last four years; which is also interesting as an indication of the progress of the country in population and wealth, and the cultivation and improvement of science and the useful arts. The exhibit which I have made in this and previous portions of any report of the affairs and business of the Patent Office, shows that it will soon be necessary not only to enlarge the Patent Office building, but to increase its clerical force. And, as it required three years of persevering effort on my part, sustained by the auxiliary aid of loud complaints on the part of applicants for patents, growing out of the delay occasioned by the great accumulation of business which could not be done, to obtain the late addition which has been made to the clerical force of the office, I have deemed it my duty now to appraise Congress that but a very few years will elapse before another addition to the force will be necessary. As the office sustains itself from its own revenues, it seems reasonable that it should be allowed a force sufficient for the prompt and efficient execution of its duties. The law requires the Commissioner of Patents to report to Congress the operations of the Patent Office from January to January, and not from July to July, as in other branches of the government consequently, the reports of the office cannot be commenced until after the callender year expires. The commissioner, therefore, is allowed comparatively but a very brief period for the preparation of his report, particularly in short sessions of Congress. Thuslastily prepared, it must necessarily be imperfect. And, in the desire of the undersigned to make his report at as early a day as possible, during the present session he has been necessarily compelled to defer the preparation of several tables required to illustrate the subjects treated of in the report, until they will be needed by the printer. This explanation was deemed necessary to account for their absence. All which is respectfully submitted. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents, To the On. Robert C.

Of R: In conformity with your requisitions, I have the honor here with to submit the following notice of inventions referred to me during the past year for examination it the commencement of 1848, the following classes were assigned to me for examination glass 1st. Agriculture, including instruments and operations 2d. Chemical processes, manufactures, and compounds, including *medicine, dying, color making, dis tilling, soap and candle making, mortar, cements, &c 3d.

In the 22d of August a division of the above classes was made, and those marked with an asterisk were retained under my charge, while the rest were assigned to Dr. Pale, one of the newly appointed examiners. In consequence of this division the labor of my desk has diminished one half, and a brief reference to the progress of business will show that it cannot be long before the arrears will be entirely mastered. In the 1st of January, 1848, there were 423 case a at my desk waiting for examination; on the 1st of August following, 463. In the 22d August the division of classes was made as above referred to, which left about 230 cases with me. X. 
21The number of new cases received monthly by me, since that time, has been about the usual average, while the number of cases in arrears has been rapidly diminishing, so that at this time I have on hand but 35 applications awaiting their turn for examination. The whole number of applications received in 1848 is 1,628, of which 767 fell to my lot, out of which number 397 have been transferred to Dr. Pale. Phi Losophi Cal I Nstruments, &e. Galvanism patent has been granted for purifying water and other liquids by the action of the galvanic current. Under this patent also, it is contemplated to apply the galvanic power in the same way to the purification of beer. It is not customary to mention the names of patentees with their inventions, but as this invention is from abroad, it will be regarded with far more interest when it is known that the inventor and patentee is the well known Mr. Rose of Gloom field, England, justly celebrated for his stupendous experiments in electricity, the production of crystals of quart z, &c by galvanism, and the development of insects (a carts Cross ii) under the influence of electricity. The purification of water containing, for instance, saline matters in solution, is effected in this case by the electrolysis or solvent action of the current; the salts being de composed and their ingredient s deposited respectively about the appropriate poles of the battery. Magnet o electric machines applied to medical uses patent has been granted for an improvement in this class, in which a coiled spring was concealed within the pole of the magnet as a substitute for the ordinary flat spring used to close the galvanic circuit. The improvement was alleged to consist in placing the spring out of harms way, as the ordinary flat spring was very liable to be deranged or broken. Copying surfaces by electro chemical operation for telegraphicpurposesA patent has been granted for a very ingenious invention, by which a sufficiently exact tr an script of any surface regular or irregular can be sent from place to place through the electric telegraph. Prior to this invention, which was first patented by the inventor in England four or five years since, the Woman letter had been printed through the electric telegraph, and intelligence had also been conveyed by printing symbols so arranged as to represent letters, and both these operations had been performed through a single circuit of conductors; but to send intelligence by telegraph of the shape or configuration of any object seems to have required the exercise of great ingenuity. Several years since a plan was exhibited in this office for accomplishing the same end by means of Horses telegraph, and although it seemed plausible yet it does not appear to have been pursued, and it is not known whether it has proved successful. It is believed, however, that the inventor of the improvement before us was the first to have produced this curious result. By this invention a figure such as a type, engraving, print or manuscript in re22Ex. life is put upon a tablet, the motions of which are governed by clock work; in fact the tablet is made the descending weight orpropelling power of the clock movement. The surface of the figure to be copied is covered or touched rather by an immense number of very fine metallic points closely packed, and a conducting wire connected with the pendulum of a clock is brought successively into contact with these points, and as the contact with each point completes the galvanic circuit an impression is made at the other extremity of the line upon a piece of chemically prepared paper, which is placed in a tablet moved by clock work, simultaneously and in a similar manner with the surface to be copied. Thus as the surface to be copied and the paper upon which, the copy is to be traced move simultaneously, it is obvious that isochronal pendulums sweeping over both surfaces would cause marks made upon the paper at one end of the line to correspond exactly with the points of contact at the other end. Telegraphic manipulatorA patent has been granted for a mode of transmitting messages by Horses telegraph, in which the communication to be forwarded is set up in type, the face of the types .corresponding in figure to the dots, lines, etc, of Horses alphabet. These types are set up in a frame, and a conducting point made to traverse the lines of type back and forth by the aid of simple machinery, and as the types are all in contact with one pole of the battery, the traverse r, as it is called, being in connexion with the other pole, makes and breaks the circuit as it passes over the entire or interrupted surfaces of the types, The novelty consists only in the mode of arranging the types in the form, and in the construction and operation of the traverse r. Electro magnetic telegraph patent has been granted for a telegraph of this class, in which the signals were made by dropping small balls upon an endless belt. At each electro magnetic motion communicated by the operation, the balls are released from a fee demand dropped upon an endless revolving belt on each side of a dividing line, and the signals are read off according to the distribution of the balls on either side of the line. The recording is effected by the pressure of the balls upon suitable paper, the balls being carried under this paper by the endless belt. Signal or indicating telegraph patent has been taken for a telegraph in which, although the electro magnetic force is employed, it is made to revolve a wheel in such a manner as to shew letters upon its face in certain positions. The novelty consists in the mode, of making the escape men t, and in a certain arrangement of symbols. Electro magnetic recording telegraph -his telegraph, patentee during the year, claims to be an improvement upon Horses invention, and differs principally from the original form in which horses telegraph was introduced in moving the paper toward: the pen, instead of the pen towards the paper. When Horses telegraph was first exhibited, the marks or symbols were made upon a travelling strip of paper by means of a pen constantly supplied with ink, and connected with a lever attached to the ar mature of x. 23 an electro magnet. Such difficulty was experienced in keeping the pen regularly supplied with ink and obtaining regular marks. The sudden jerk given to the pen was the source of one difficulty and a defect in the mode of supplying the ink the other. The present invention obviates one difficulty, by keeping the pen stationary and moving the paper towards the pen, and the other by an ingenious mode of supplying ink to the pen. A carrier which takes a given amount of ink from a reservoir charges the pen at regular intervals by means of the clock machinery. A patent has been granted for a new and convenient form of electric machine for experiments, where a small amount only of electricity is wanted. It consists of a glass tube about two feet in length and two inches in diameter, which is moved back and forth through an elastic ring serving for the rubber, which is firmly fixed to a stand to be clamped upon a table. An insulating rod is fixed into a socket attacked to the upper portion of the elastic ring, and upon this insulating rod of glass is fixed a wire branching on either side, and terminating in rings which embrace the tube lightly. The wire answers the purpose of the prime conductor, and its rings embracing the tube serve as guides, and to collect the electricity on each side of the rubber as the tube is moved back and forth. The model furnished worked very well. Taki Of Yeas And Nays. A patent has been granted for a mode of taking yeas and nays. The great delay attending this operation in legislative bodies has called forth a great deal of ingenuity to devise means for its facilitate on and the saving of time. A great many plans have been from time to time submitted for the approbation of Congress, though but one has been patented. The invention referred to, consists principally in operating levers furnished with lance t shaped points, so as to cause them to puncture paper, which is so arranged, as to shew the puncture or mark of each member in its appropriate place. Of course, there are as many sets of levers and lances, as there are members, and each of these has a wire communicating with the desk of each member; two wires and lances being required for each one, for the yeas and nays. The permanent record of the vote by the puncture in the paper has an advantage over the evanescent signals used in other inventions of this class. As a general rule, well made machinery is more accurate in recording or calculating than the mind of man, but it is obvious that a mechanical mode of taking yeas and nays must be infallible, before it could take the place of the present inconvenient method. Agri C Jltuee. <a name="potato0"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Planters patent has been granted for a machine for planting <a name="potatoes1"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It does not differ essentially from seed planters in general construction, but the mode of seizing and dropping the 24 X. <a name="potato1"><mark>potato</mark></a> is peculiar. The <a name="potatoes2"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> or pieces are let down gradually upon a grating, and revolving fingers, passing upwards through the stationary fingers or grating, take up the <a name="potatoes3"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and carrying them over, deposit them in a suitable conductor to lead them intothe furrows. Atmospheric churnThe discovery made several years since of making butter by means of a current of air forced through cream, has stimulated many inventors to contrive means of introducing air in conjunction with the ordinary process of agitation, under the supposition that the presence of air is necessary to the formation of butter from cream. But chemistry reaches us that no ox i dating process is essential to the formation of butter from cream; and, indeed, a very common fact settles this point, viz: that by agitation, butter may be made from cream when it is secured in tight bottles; and this operation is, in fact, frequently performed to the detriment of the dairy man, while carrying his cream to market. The function really performed by the air, is merely that of agitation, and this it does very thoroughly under certain circumstances. The churnreferrecid127e to was constructed in such a manner as to produce a most perfect agitation, by means of revolving arms connected with a vertical shaft; and, as the arms and shaft were hollow, it is evident that while in rapid revolution, by centrifugal action, the air would issue rapidly from the extremities of the hollow arms, and, rising in copiously disseminated bubbles through the cream, would add greatly to the agitation produced by the revolution of the arms themselves. Presses. Dressing flee ces of wool novel instrument for this purpose has been patented, by which the flee ces are folded and compressed by a series of fingers, somewhat after the manner in which a like material of smaller dimensions would be compressed within the human hand. The flee ces thus compressed occupy but little room, and are more convenient for transportation than when packed in the ordinary manner. Dressing cotton patent has been granted for pressing cotton in a singular manner. I instead of pressing the cotton in bales a a usual, the patentee proposes to form the cotton into an endless belt or patting, and by means of carrying rollers to receive it upon and wrap it tightly around a shaft or cone, which, after the rolEissufficiently large is withdrawn, leaving the cotton in a bale or mass of a cylindrical form. Evidently the form is most convenient for handling; but the availability in practice of this invention will depend upon more important considerations than this. In an article so bulky as cotton, storage is of great importance; and it would seem as if the pressure attain able in this way would be too small to justify the undertaking. Experiment, however, is the empire, and the inventor is confident of success. X. a. 25SURGERY. Getting artificial teeth Attempts have been hitherto made to cause the plates, holding the sets of teeth, to adhere to the mouth by atmospheric pressure, and several patents have been formerly granted for inventions of this class. All these plans have had their imperfect sons; and, although in some the plates once fixed would adhere well, yet it was not easy to remove them when occasion required, which with most persons is once at least in 24 hours. A mode, however, has been patented during the past year which seems to accomplish all that is desirable in this particular. By means of a cavity properly shaped and located in the plate, the tongue is applied to produce the exhaustion and fastens the plate immediately with great firmness, and, by a movement of the tip of the tongue, very easily acquired, the plate is readily detached. I inhalation of ether patent has been granted for an instrument for inhaling ether, and other like materials, which is very simple, cheap, and ingenious. In administering ether, it is necessary to admit atmospheric air with the vapor of ether, ant various contrivances have been introduced in the inhaling apparatus for securing a due admixture of air. In the instrument recently patented, the vapor is administered simultaneously through the mouth and nose. The shape and size of the tube is such that it, covers readily both these organs, and contains a sponge saturated wit li ether, and apertures for the admission of atmospheric air, all in a compact and convenient form. The inhalation of ether was at first regarded with great caution by a portion of the medical world, and met with strong opposition from others. It is, however, working its way to the most extended use, and is now looked upon by the most enlightened as one of the most valuable and remarkable discoveries of the age. At the time a patent was granted for this new application of ether, it was contemplated for use only in conjunction with surgical operations. But since its effects upon the system have been carefully studied, it has been introduced into medical practice for a variety of affections, and with great success. In obstetrical practice where its application was least looked for, it has proved of eminent service, and out of some 580 cases of accouchement reported recently by Professor Channing, of Boston, not one experienced any injury from the use of ether. Since the introduction of this great and beneficent discovery investigations have been made as to the anaesthetic property of other substances, and several others have been substituted for the sulphuric ether first used, and it has also been found that the effect upon the system to which the term anaesthesia has been given, may be produced by other substances than the others. Shower Baths. These valuable ministers to comfort and health are comparatively of modern origin, and it is not until within a few years that they26Ex. have received much attention with a view to improve them. Several patents have been granted during the past year for shower baths, and it would appear now as if their capabilities were well nigh all developed. One of the baths patented contains provision for a warm and cold douched, a warm and cold shower, and showering various parts of the body topic ally or diffusely, and in fact, giving every desirable variety of bath, and all by very simple means. Of Of Arts, &c. Tachygraphic Pictures. A term derived from Greek words signifying to paint quickly. Under the patent for this invention quite a new branch, of the art of painting has been commenced, and although of limited scope, yet it is interesting and ingenious in its special applications. The general features of the art consists mainly in giving very high lights and deep shadows to such pictures as snow scenes, representations of conflagrations, water falls, and water scenery generally, and such like, by painting upon glass with I indian ink or colors, and using for the strong lights a translucenlfmaterial, and placing behind the picture a sheet of bright metal, such as common tin, &c. Viewed in a strong light, the pictures thus produced have a fine effect. Holding envelopes patent has been granted for a machine for making envelopes, which is the first invention of the kind patentee in this office. Since the great consumption of envelopes first commenced under the present postage law, machines have been patentee for cutting the forms from sheets of paper, but the present machine stamps, pastes, folds, and em bosses the envelopes in rapid succession. Printing paperhangingsApparently a very important step in the progress of this art is the subject of a recent patent. By this invention the paper to be printed is seized by the borders and carried through the printing apparatus by means of very ingenious adjustable clamps or fingers, and it will be readily seen how favorable such a mode of holding the paper must be when compared with the former method practised of drawing it through by the end, and perhaps receiving it upon rollers. The printing, of course, mo is tens the paper, and tends to make its surface uneven, while the winding up of the paper or carrying it along in a continuous sheet through the press by means of rollers, would may the impression. Ll ills and dies for printing patent has been granted for an improvement in making the mills and dies in which figures are made upon a milled surface, the pressure being sufficient to obliterate all appearance of filling in the parts where it is not required, and to leave it where it is necessary. The inventor first makes on the die, and in in cave, the bondage, and a ground space without the ground figures. He then mills the entire curved surface of the mill by a separate filling tool or cylinder. He next presses or rolls the mill and die together, so as to produce on the former an impression of x. 27 the bondage and figure portions, and leave the entire ground of the mill in relief. Daguerreotypea patent has been granted for a mode of improving the appearance of the ground of these pictures, by taking away the usual stiffness of a copied background. A screen is held in front of the sister, which has an opening sufficiently large to expose so much of his person to view as is to be copied; and during the time of taking the impression the screen is to be kept in motion, which prevents any outline of the opening being copied, and also produces a dimness of outline in those parts of the figure covered by the screen. It gives an artistic effect, desirable for busts, and is well executed in the specimen sent to the office. Calori Of C. Sampson improvement in the lamp known as the spirit gas lamp, which is for burning the mixture of turpentine and alcohol, has been patented, consisting merely of using two wick s-one attached to the wick tube, and the other to the body of the lamp to draw up the liquid to feed the first named wick. A secondary or supplying wick has long since been patented for use in the camp line or pine oil lamps; but the principal design and mode of using the two wicks in this case is different. In the spirit gas lamps the flame must be blown out before a lamp can be re filled with safety, or, in fact, 'before the wick tube can be removed for any purpose whatever. But in this lamp you may un screw the wick tube, taking the small wick burning with it and set it a little aside while you fill the lamp by its light, the small wick. retaining enough of the liquid, to keep up the flame for some time. Raising lamp wick son ingenious device has been patented, in which the wicks are raised and lowered by pushing upon a projecting pin connected with the tube carrying the wick, which is enclosed, and slides up and down within another tube attached to the lamp cap. It saves the necessity of using or seeking for a pin or stick (never at hand at the time) for raising or lowering a wick. Lantern and lamp Two patents have been granted for a lantern and lamp so combined that the instrument serves, by a slight movement, the purpose either of a lamp or lantern. In one of them the whole article does not differ in shape from a common hand lamp. The tunic or lantern corresponds to the bowl or fountain of a common lamp, while the lamp is contained within the leg or stand of the lamp, its wick tubes projecting just within the tunic or lantern. When the full light of a lamp is wanted, the lamp is raised up from its socket precisely in the manner in which a candle is usually raised from the candlestick, and the wick tubes of the lamp are projected through a small aperture in the top of the lantern tunic. Glass fountains for Org and lamps patent has been granted for a mode of constructing a mould for this purpose; and, if the glass fountain for this description of lamps can be made successfully, it will be a great improvement in this useful article. Farming buildings by hot water patent has been grant28Ex. red for an invention of this kind, which has been successfully tried upon a scale of some size. It consists in a plan of heating by radiation from surfaces heated by water, which circulates from a boiler and back to it, and in its circuit passes up and down two or more times through a series of h eaters, each consisting of two tubes, one within the other, the water passing between the two, that the outer and inner surfaces of the h eaters may furnish heat, and these are so combined as to receive the water from the boil etat one end of the series, while the other end gives it out to the boiler, and the series of h eaters are so arranged that the water ascends in one, descends in the next, ascends in the next, and soon, the two extremes of the series being connected with the boiler. It is an old and well known plan of heating by hot water, to convey the water from the boiler through a series of pipes upwards, and then downwards through another series back to the boiler, there being an upward and downward movement in accordance with the well known principles of circulation. The question was raised whether the water would circulate through a series of tubes connected in this way, for as it would go on cooling in its passage through the tubes, it would not be supposed to rise after it had once descended in a cool state; but the applicant contended that the ascensional force of the hot column in the first tube would be sufficient to cause the forward movement of the water in all the tubes, and this he had tested by experiment. The plan, if successful, would be convenient in many cases where the series of tubes might be made within columns supporting a table, counter, wall, &c. Farming buildings by heated air patent has been granted for a plan of warming buildings by heated air, and also for a thorough ventilation, in which the principal feature is that of ventilation g from above downwards. The only definite plan for heating and ventilation g buildings upon this principle known to the office, was adopted in the Pentonville prison in England, a few years since, and so far as reported with great economy and advantage. The plan presented to the office, though involving this principal feature, differed essentially in the details, and seemed to present advantages over that adopted in the Pentonville prison. The plan of ventilation g downwards is objected to by some, upon the ground, that it is not natural, that is, it must be forced, or perhaps some have attempted such an inference upon the too common supposition, that analogies drawn from natures operations are those most likely to subserve mans wants. But such considerations are futile, in regard to the heating and ventilation of a dwelling house, an artificial structure, where heating and ventilation cannot proceed altogether upon natural principles. The inventor asserts with reason, that in ventilation g upwards, the dust from the floor or carpet must necessarily rise and vitiated the atmosphere, while in ventilation g from above downwards, a pure air is introduced into the room, and whatever effusion, dust or impurity may escape from the person or dress, must be carried out below, before it can mingle with the air to be breathed. Ventilating ships patent has been granted for applying two x. 29 ventilators or chimney caps, in such a manner, that one shall favor the introduction of the air into a vessels hold, and the other its egress. They are called, respectively, injecting and electing Ventilators. Fire proof safe fire proof safe has been patented, in which the partition usually containing gypsy m, as the incombustible, non conducting material, was filled with running water to be used in large cities, where a stream of water can be had. Tone and clay Grooved bricks. A patent has been granted for moulding bricks with dove tailed grooves upon their faces, for the purpose of locking them more effectually together by means of the mortar filling the grooves. Artificial slate, and fire proof cement patent has been granted for making a fire proof paint or cement of a peculiar earth, found in Charon, Median county, Ohio. It is composed of one half s iliac, one quarter alum in a, smaller proportions of oxide of iron, sulphur et of iron, lime, and carbon. It is of a dark color, almost black, and is quite soft like tallow, when first taken from the earth. Upon exposure to the air, it gardens like a stone. The earth when dry, is ground up and mixed with linseed oil, it forms an excellent paint, fire proof and very hard, so that when a considerable thickness is spread upon paper or wood, it makes a good artificial slate. Chemi Stry. Bromineanr improvement in the manufacture of br o mine has been patented, in which three novel points are presented. First, anew kind of retort composed of earthen ware and come. Second, using the bitter n as a bath for dis tilling the br o mine; and thirdly, the employment of a luring composed of pipe clay and bitter n. Chloroform and Gutta Percha patent has been granted for a varnish made by dissolving gutta percha in chloroform. The solution is very readily made, and furnishes an excellent water proof varnish. Russia te potash patent has been granted for employing in the manufacture of this article the caustic all ali instead of the crude material heretofore used. Gutta Perchaseveral patents have been granted for modes of employing this substance; among the valuable applications of it are those and tubing of all sizes, which are made by a process somewhat similar to the mode of making lead pipe. It is said also to be of great value for bands in driving machinery as a substitute for leather, rubber, and rubber cloth. It possesses a texture differing from caoutchouc and has but little elasticity. Before the bands are ready for use they are stretched forcibly, as in the case of the best leather bands. The stretching of gutta percha to a certain extent, is said to add to its strength, and although it will yield considerably at first, it does rot relapse again, qualities admirably adapted to bands. The gutta percha has come into extensive use for shoes as a substitute for caoutchouc or other water proof ing 30 X. material in the soles. It has been patented also as a substitute for patent leather. An immense variety also of articles are made from gutta percha, and from the facility with which it may be worked, and its various useful properties, it may be considered one of the most valuable acquisitions of modern art. It is, however, not sour able as india rubber, and from specimens shown to me that had been exposed to the weather for five or six months, it appears quite easy of decomposition, as the material was de composed to the depth of the thirtieth of an inch. In conclusion, allow me to add, that your examiner, from present appearances, indulges the hope that the coming year will witness a most flourishing and satisfactory condition of your office, and that ample time will hereafter be afforded to the examining corps to make their daily and yearly reports to you with more deliberation than has been heretofore practicable under the immense pressure and hurry of business. Chas. G. Page, Examinerhon. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. X. a. 31. Report of W. P. Of. Fitzgerald, Examiner of Patents. Of R: In compliance with your wishes and the practice of the office, I have the honor to submit to you the following report in relation to the applications for patents which have been referred ton me for examination, and examined within the year 1848. In the first of January, 1848, in consequence of the vast increase of business for several years immediately preceding, three hundred and fifty-three applications had accumulated upon my desk, which   had been utterly unable to examine. This great accumulation of business, together with the additions made to it by the rapid influx of new applications, has been a source of great embarrassment throughout the year, and has rendered it impossible to make that progress which might easily have been made under different circumstances. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the various particulars in which a great accumulation of applications produces embarrassment and delays; you are familiar with them, and they are set forth with sufficient fullness in my last report. The numerous applications belonging to each class upon the desk of examiners at the same time, renders great circumspection necessary to avoid granting patents for the same devices which are found in other applications. This renders it necessary to examine large classes at the same time, to the prejudice of others; and hence it becomes impossible to give at the close of the year a correct view of the comparative progress of the various branches during the year. Nearly all belonging to some classes may have been examined, while the principal part of the applications belonging to others may have accumulated. The number of applications patented and rejected during the past year will therefore show rather the condition and progress of the office, than the comparative progress of the various branches of the arts and manufactures to which they belong. At the commencement of the year the classes under my charge were as follows 1st. Metallurgy and manufactures in metals 2d. Manufactures of fibrous and textile fabrics and all machinerytherefor3d. Steam and other engines 4th. Navigation and marine implements, comprehending naval architecture, pro pellets, &c, &c 5th. Civil engineering and architecture 6th. And conveyance, comprehending all kinds of vehicles and implements of travel and transportation by land 7th. Hills, comprehending all kinds of machinery for crushing or grinding, horse powers, mechanical movements, &c 8th. Machinery for working in lumber, comprehending saw mills32Ex planing machinery, state machines, boring machines, mort ising machines, &c, with the various tools and implements used therein 9th. Fire arms and implements of war, comprehending ordnance, all kinds of weapons, &c, with the manufacture of the same 10th. Hydraulics and pneumatics, comprehending hydraulic engines, presses, &c, water mills, wind mills, fire engines, filters, machinery for raising water, &c, &c 11th. Miscellaneous, consisting of applications for patents which do not properly fall within any of the other classes. These classes continued under my exclusive charge until about the first of July last, when Mr. Men wick, then recently appointed examiner, took charge of them jointly with me. From that time until recently we have labored together and have monthly reported the result of our joint actions upon applications to you. Our examinations have not he en confined to the classes which each has now in charge, but portions of several classes have been examined by each. Our object at first was to bring up the arrears of business, and afterwards to make such a division as would be fair and permanent. During the time we were thus acting together it would be difficult for either to report fully upon the classes acted upon, and the precise number acted upon by each could not be ascertained without a detailed examination of the cases which would require more time than would be justified by the value of the information which would be obtained, as we consider it unimportant. The whole number of applications referred to our desks during the year 1848 is 854. Of these 292 remained un examined on the first of January, 1849. The number of applications examined and passed is 356, and the number of rejections is 546. A division of classes is now made and our joint labors have ceased. The classes now under my exclusive charge are 1st. Fibrous and textile manufactures and machinery there for 2d. And conveyance 3d. Hills 4th. Machinery and tools for working in lumber 5th. Hydraulics and pneumatics. I improvements in these classes, with their various subdivisions, and in the classes heretofore under my charge, which I have examined and which have been patented within the year 1848, 1 will proceed as concisely as possible to review; the accumulation of business on my desk does not allow a lengthened discussion of these subjects. Of Brous And Texti  Of Fabri Of And Machi Nery Therefor. The first operation, after the fibrous material is collected, is to clear it from the coarser substances with which it is usually connected. This is done by breaking, as in the case of hemp, flax c, whipping for cotton, &c. Hemp is afterwards subject to hacking, cotton to ginning, wool and cotton to burring or picking. After these processes the wool or cotton is subjected to the carding engine. Fool is sometimes combed upon appropriate max. a. 33 chines. Other fibrous materials require somewhat different preparation. After the fibres are properly cleaned and straightened they are sometimes, as in case of wool and fur, felted together. But more frequently wool, cotton, &c, are spun for use in the thread, or to be afterwards woven. After the yarn is spun, or the fabric woven or felted, various other processes, according to the nature of the material or fabric, are necessary before the fabric is fully prepared for use. To the class under consideration belong the various processes above alluded to, and the machines used there for, which latter present great variety, delicacy and complication. Such improvements as have been patented in these processes or machinery  shall examine as far as possible in the order above indicated. Prepari Of Hemp And Flax. Three or four patents have been granted within the year for improvements in machinery used for preparing hemp and flax. The manufacture of linen in consequence of the length of the fibres of flax, &c, is much more difficult the ii that of cotton, and many efforts have been made to reduce the expense of preparing he fibres for spinning. The mode finally resorted to was to cut the fibres into short pieces so that they might be operated upon by cards like cotton. This course is very extensively pursued. For most purposes the linen is materially deteriorated by this mode of manufacture, while it retains the same general appearance, but for some purposes it answers equally well with that manufactured by the processes previously resorted to. Letters patent have been granted within this year, for improvements in machinery by which hemp and flax may be prepared in this way for the cards. Letters patent have also been granted for machinery, for breaking and cleaning hemp nd flax, made after the old plan of vibrating and stationary knives and s butchers. The principal improvements presented by this machine are, so arranging the cracks and move able knives, that the force required to operate the machine in all positions of the parts shall be nearly the same; thus effecting a saving of power and steaminess of action, and in so shaping and arranging the s butchers, that they will take the broken flax by degrees, and without effort on the part of the attendant, and thus more easily and effectually separate the fibres from the broken and wood y fragments which hang to it. Less has been done during the past year in this branch of machinery, than heretofore. Prepari Of Cotton And Wool. A part of the machinery for preparing cotton and wool for the cards, is in some instances the same, and may therefore be considered together, though the gin is generally used for cotton only. About six patents have been granted within the year for improvements in preparing wool, and cotton, and separating. them from the coarser part of their impurities234Ex. a. One patent has been granted for improvements in the C roller gin" intended principally for long staples. The machine differs but little from those heretofore used, but the operation of ginning is a nice one, and small changes often produce important results. In the machine under consideration, the " shell" is iisedfor keeping back the impure ties, which to some extent interrupt the feed, and a fee der is applied to this machine, which in connexion with the other parts seems to obviate this inconvenience, and to cause the machine to operate more evenly, and gin better. Another gin has been patented, which operates by drawing the cotton in between, a roller and a travelling endless belt, held up to the surface of the roller by a curved block capable of yielding, and being sharp at the edge where the cotton enters. Before entering between the belt and roller, it passes between the same roller and the edge of a plate, above which a better revolves to beat off the coarser impure ties. The cotton after passing to the opposite side of the roller is brushed off in the usual way. Letters patent have also been granted for a better for burring wool, cotton, &c, consisting of a cylinder composed of discs united by laws at some distance apart. Some of the laws are armed with numerous teeth, attached like card teeth to leather, and much resembling card teeth in form, and others are armed with plain b eaters. The teeth are bent, but so placed upon the leather and law as that the outer part of each is radial. The teeth take off the principal part of the impure ties from the wool or cotton on the burring cylinder, and the b eaters beat off or loose n those which adhere so closely as to cause the teeth to yield. A patent has also been granted for a wool and cotton picked, whose feed rollers are divided into short sections and held together by a rod or axis passing length wise through openings in them larger than the axis. Each section of the roller thus formed and held together is pressed to its place by a separate spring, so that a burr or knot drawn between the feed rollers will elevate only the section it passes under and leave the rest of the roller to feed as usual. The foregoing is united with some improvements in the burring cylinder. Another machine for picking wool and cotton has been patented, whose peculiarities consist in a new arrangement and construction of toothed rollers, which could not be described within reasonable limits or understood without drawings. In this machine the gauze roller near the lap per is armed with teeth. Such ingenuity has been exerted within the last few years in devising means for the economical manufacture of cylinders used for burring and, also, for carding wool; and also in the manufacture of bearers for burring machines. Letters patent have been granted for the mode of constructing the hollow cylinder, to which the teeth of burring or carding cylinders are to be attached. A light cylinder of tinned sheet metal is first made wire, covered with tin, is then wound tight and spirally all over the convex surface of the cylinder. Metal proper for soldering is then poured over the surface thus formed, X. Doc: No. 59. 35 which renders the whole firm and compact; the surface is then turned true, and the cylinder is ready to receive the teeth of such character as may be desired. Letters patent have also been granted for a new method of constructing burring cylinders. A proper cylinder is first constructed for the reception of the teeth; wire of proper size is then rolled flat and afterwards planed in such manner as to leave a rib or shoulder its whole length on one side, and a thin edge on the other. Notchesare then filed into the thin edge at intervals, thus forming teeth. The convex surface of the cylinder is then grooved at proper intervals around its surface, and the toothed strips on the edge having the shoulder are laid into the groove, and the ridges of metal between the grooves are forced down upon the shoulders to hold them in place; or the toothed strips are wound upon the cylinder and soldered, and the cylinder is finished the shoulders, &c, giving proper distance between th_ rows of teeth. An improvement in b eaters for burring machines has also been patented. It does not differ essentially from b eaters heretofore used, except in this that the spaces between the vanes can be reduced as the vanes wear, and a good edge be presented until the vanes and the whole convex exterior of the cylinder is exhausted, instead of becoming worthless when the vanes are worn. Cardi Of Machi Nes. But few patents have been granted during the year for improvements in this variety of machinery. A patent has been granted for a carding machine, in which a cylinder like Parkhurst burring cylinder is made to work against the main cylinder. When cards are used the teeth will yield, and a knot closely matted together might be carried through the machine without being properly opened; but the cylinder above mentioned would hold such a knot and. bring it successively in contact with the teeth of the main cylinder, until by degrees it would be opened and carried forward. Another patent has been granted for improvements in this variety of machines, which consists principally in banding from the main cylinder, and thus giving a high speed to the workers with little increase of power. Rovi    Of, Spi Nni Of, Doubli Of And Twi Sti  Of, Etc. Some eight patents have been granted within the last year for improvements in machinery for performing these operations. After the cotton or wool is carded it is taken from the d offer in shivers, and is drawn and twisted until it is formed into threads of the proper size by the processes above named. These operations are of the most delicate character, and modifications which would be of no moment in coarser machines are of the highest importance in these. The6drawing" above mentioned is performed in drawing frames by passing the moving between several sets of rollers, each pair revolving36Ex. Doc. 0. 59.faster than the preceding. The duty of these rollers is important, and much care and ingenuity have been exercised in improving them. It has been ascertained by practice that one of these rollers should have a flexible surface, and a great variety of materials have been used for the purpose. The rollers are apt to become smooth and slip on the material. Generally, a strip of soft leather is wound around the roller, but this wears out or stretches. Letters patent have been granted within the year for rollers, made by cutting a groove around the solid part of the roller, leaving shoulders on each side, and then drawing over these shoulders and into the groove a small hollow cylinder of vulcanited I india rubber, which will at once contract to its place. The ends of the grooves at the shoulders are deepened, in order that the diameter of the roller at the ends of the I india rubber may be less than at the intermediate points. Letters patent have been granted fo# improvements in the stop motion of the drawing frame. When the moving breaks it is of course necessary for the machine to stop until it is joined. Devices have heretofore been used, such that the thread or moving by its strength or friction sustained a lever or other device, which, when it broke, would fall, and by appropriate mechanism throw the machine out of gear. But the moving having very little adhesion, is often broken by the strain required to sustain the lever. The invention above mentioned was intended and is calculated to obviate the difficulty heretofore experienced. The moving simply rests its weight upon the lever through a convenient medium, and by breaking relieves the lever of the weight, and the lever is so nicely balanced as to rise under such circumstances and throw the machine out of gear. The moving having no strain but its own i weight to sustain, is far less liable to break than in the machines above mentioned. The machine contains other features of novelty, but it is impossible to render them intelligible in this report. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in the drawing head. The drawing motion has heretofore been given to-one of the rollers by the differential revolutions of the tubes. Butt his motion was communicated through hearing on one side of the apparatus. This was found not to be sufficiently steady and compact for high speeds; and the patentee appears to have avoided this imperfect ion, by substituting for the outer hearing a worm on the interior of a move able part of the tube working into the grooves in the drawing roller. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in the spinning frame. The sobbing on each side of this frame are made to rise and fall alternately, for the proper distribution of the thread. The rising and falling part of the machine on opposite sides are so constructed as to balance each other, thus saving the power which would otherwise be necessary to operate them. The sobbing are all 'driven by bands passing around a common drum, extending length wise through the machine. As the sobbing rise and fall, their relative distances from the drum are changed, and the bands would naturally be tighter at one time than at another. Box. a. 37 obviate the inconveniences arising from this circumstance, the motions of the sobbing are so timed, that when one is at its greatest distance from the drum, the other shall be at its leastwhileslides, with angular s lasts in them, embracing the dudgeons of the drum slide up and down, pressing the drum towards one side or the other, as the sobbing recede or approach; thus preserving nearly the same tension of the bands throughout the traverse. In laying the yarn in cops by spinning machines, the threads are. made to lie in such a direction- that when removed from the spindle, which for some purposes is necessary, unless very carefully handled, they will fall. Letters patent have been granted within the year for an improvement in the spinning frame, which in a great degree overcomes this inconvenience. It consists principally in giving such a form to the can which operates the copying rail, that the rail shall, in its descent, move so rapidly as to allow but little winding from the point of the c pp to the base, and in its ascent, shall move slowly and wind the thread closely from base to point. This combination of the threads sustains the cop in every direction, aid renders it much less liable to fall than when formed in the ordinary way. Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in the wheel" for hand spinning, which consists in so arranging the parts, that when it is desirable by pressing a t meddle with the foot, the head of the wheel can be brought to the attendant, and carried back to its place, without in any way de ranging the machine or stopping its operations. The improvements in spinning machinery, patented within the last year are interesting, perhaps to an unusual degree, but I can dwell no longer upon them, but must hasten to that variety of machines which naturally follows spinning machinery. Weavi    Of Looms. Line or ten patents have been granted within the year, for improvements in weaving looms. Two of these are for improvements in the jacquard, of which it would be impossible to give an idea without drawings, and a description more lengthy than would be appropriate in this place. The object of one of the inventors is to simplify the apparatus, and diminish the number of trap boards, cylinders, and needles without impairing its efficiency. A new mode of throwing the scuttle has also been patented, which would not be easily understood without drawings; and is perhaps rather ingenious than practically useful. A mode also of operating the harness has been patented, whose details could not here be rendered intelligible; but its object is to operate by the same hook several leaves in succession. Other improvements must be passed unnoticed, in consequence of a degree of complication which would render an attempt at description useless in this report. It is unfortunate that such is the nature of so large a proportion of this interesting branch of machinery. X. a. Letters patent have been granted for a combination of parts for stopping the loom when the thread breaks or when the scuttle does at go home. The fork and grid varied in position from what is usually employed for action when the thread breaks, and combined with devices for operating the shipper when the scuttle fails. Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in shuttlesfr regulating the drawing of yarn from the bob bin by a small spring lever. Spring levers in various forms have heretofore be ensued for the same purpose, but the shocks to which the scuttle isa subjected are so violent and rapid that they soon get out of order. The lever has been pressed upon the thread by spiral springs wound no und a rod, and held by a set screw, but the screw having so slight a hold of the rod is jar red loose and the lever ceases to operate. To obviate these difficulties the patentee places one end of his lever, of convenient form, in a groove in the solid end of the scuttle and parallel with its length. The other end rests upon the thread in the hollow of the scuttle. Directly under the end first mentioned of the lever, a hole is bored entirely through the solid end. I n this perforation a spiral spring is dropped, one end of which rests against the lever, and the other is sustained and the spring adjusted by a screw working in the perforation, and whose head is sunk within the surface of the scuttle. The position of the spring, the lever and set screw are such that the end wise shocks to which the scuttle is subjected have little tendency to disturb them, and the action of the lever upon the thread will at all times be substantially the same. Letters patent have also been granted for an improvement in weavers temples and for an improvement in pickets. The pickerpatented is constructed as follows: the raw hide is bent in the usual way; between those parts which ordinarily strike the scuttle, there s laid a piece of metallic I india rubber; an opening is made in the raw hide, such as to allow the point of the scuttle to enter the picked, until it reaches the I india rubber; the scuttle thus receives the I india rubber upon its point when struck instead of the raw hide, and the small fragments of the raw hide which the point of the scuttle separates from the ordinary picked, and which are often thrown into the fabric while being woven, are avoided. It is unnecessary that I should dwell longer upon this class. Kni Tti  Of Machi Nes. Three patents have been granted within the year for improvements in knitting machines. One of them was for a machine invented in Europe, and described some time since in the English journals. It is, therefore, unnecessary to attempt a description of it. The machine is rather complicated, and not calculated to operate so well or accomplish so much as several other machines heretofore in use. The other two are for improvements in the needles. In knitting machines generally, the needles which receive the yarn for the formation of the loops, are hooked at the points. The loops are hung upon these hook points, and as the new loops are placed upon the x. needles, the old ones are carried back beyond the points of the hooks. A pressed then comes down upon i the hooks, and presses the points close down to the body of the needle leaving the re loops within the hook. The old loops then slip over the hooks upon the necks of the new loops. I instead of the long point of the hook and the pressed, one of the patentees uses an auxiliary needle and a short hook. When the old loop is drawn back upon the thank of the needle, the auxiliary needle retires to allow it to pass and when the new loop is formed, and the old one is to be thrown off, the auxiliary needle is thrust through an opening in the loop needle to guide the old loop over, the point. A somewhat similar contrivance is used for beaming. The other patent above mentioned is for an improvement in the form and action of the needle. At a short distance from the point of the needle, a short lever is hinged and turns freely on its fulcrum. When the old loop slides back it carries the lever over with it. The new loop is then placed upon the hooked point of the needle, the old loop having been carried back beyond the end of the lever. The old loop is then pushed forward and carrier the lever with it, which guides the loop over the point of the needle upon the neck of the new loop. Sewi Of Machi Nes. But one patent has, been granted within the year for improvements in this variety of machinery. The improvements are in the mode of putting tension upon the thread, and in the scuttle which carries the auxiliary thread. The machine operates upon the general principle of one patented a few years ago. Within the last year sewing machines have received a good deal of attention, but nothing further on the subject is in condition to be spread upon this report. Paper. About eight patents have been granted within the year for improvements in machines used in manufacturing, cutting, and performing other operations on paper. One of these patents is for improved machinery for grinding the pulp. The machine much resembles mills for grinding grain. I tis so arranged that the pulp is kept in circulation through the mill, passing in at the eye and out at the edges, until the whole is properly prepared. In one of the machines patented, the paper is cut into sheets of any desired length, placed upon a table, and the edges adjusted for folding. To insure corresponding .action throughout, the motions of various parts of the machine are taken from the cylinder which carries the knife. Others of these machines cut the paper and drop it upon rods, over which it bends and hangs preparatory !o folding. Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in sa an 40 X. paper, which consists, in standing both sides and the edges. The sand on the outside enables workmen to hold it, without injuring By doubling, and the edges are very useful in polishing parts which cannot be reached by the flat part of the paper. 'the article is vastly more dura be than that previously in the market. Letters patent have been granted for an improved si eve for shaking the sand upon the paper. It is so braced from the point which receives the blow, that the shock is transmitted throughout with nearly equal intensity, and thus distributes the sand evenly. In another machine patented, the parts are so arranged as to distribute the sand on both sides 'of the paper. A few patents belonging to this class, have been granted for improvements of a miscellaneous character. One of these is for an improved t enter frame, for stretching and drying textile fabrics. As the fabric leaves the roller upon which it is wound, it passes under small cog wheels which force its edges upon the t enter hooks. The t enter hooks are fixed upon two endless chains at each side of the frame. As the endless chain travels, the t enter hooks draw the cloth along with them. The. ways, as they progress, become wider, and thus the fabric is stretched, and at the end of the frame it passes over a roller for drying, and is finally received and wound upon another roller. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in tapping cloth with flow, for dressing fabrics previous to printing, and for grinding the teeth of cards. I shall forego all further remarks upon the class of fibrous and textile fabrics and their machinery. They have been pretty thoroughly reviewed and at sufficient length. Steam Engi Nes, Locomoti  Ves, &c. This is one of the classes transferred to my colleague, Mr. Men wick, who will report principally upon the patents granted for improvements therein. But few of those which I have examined require notice in this place. An ingenious arrangement of balance valves has been patented, in which the pipes are not extended around to both of the outer sides of the valves, but the steam passes down through the tube which connects them into a small cavity surrounded by a kind of valve seat under one of the valves for equal iting pressure. Patents have also been granted for an improvement in the arrangement of boilers, furnaces and flies, by which the heat remains longer in contact with the heating furnaces. Letters patent have also been granted for an improved locomotive. It has ten driving. wheels, and two sets of cylinders; one pair of these cylinders are connected with, and drive six of these wheels, and the other pair drive the other four. These operate together or separately as the grades or other circumstances require. When the maximum of traction is desired all the engines operate and the whole of the ten wheels operate as driving wheels; when the minimum of traction only is necessary the engines operating x. a. 41 the four driving wheels are worked, leaving the other six as supporting wheels. To produce a medium degree of traction, the engines which operate the six wheels are worked and the four become supporting wheels. It is obvious that the number of wheels in both sets can be varied, preserving similar relations to each other and producing similar practical results. Nothing further in this class requires my attention; the rest of the ground will be covered by Mr. Men wick. Of Of Arms And I Mplements Of War. This class, in comparison with many others, presents but a narrow field for invention. The improvements, however, examined and patented within the year, are much beyond the common average. The circumstances in which the country has recently been placed, have probably caused this branch of the arts to receive an unusual degree of attention. Some eight or ten patents belonging to this class have been granted within the year, but most of the applications have been examined since the class was transferred tour. Men wick. One patent, however, for improvements in the manufacture of bullets, I will notice. The bullets are formed in dies, one fixed and the other move able. The fixed die has a cylindrical, cavity semi spherical at the bottom, with a cleaver passing through the bottom which, when force is applied, becomes flush with the bottom. The end of the move able die has a semi spherical cavity in it coming to a sharp edge at the end, and is of proper diameter to fit the cylindrical part of the fixed die, and is placed opposite to it. The lead is fed into the machine by a motion properly regulated, in the form of a plate, at once wider and thinner than the diameter of the ball to be formed. The move able die then comes forward separating a strip of lead from the plate, and as the strip has less diameter than the cavity in the fixed die, 'it is easily carried forward into it by the move able die and pressed into the desired form. When the move able die retires the clearer forces ont the bullet. The balls thus formed are thought to be of equal density and are free from the spree and other imperfect sons incident to balls made in moulds. Navi    Gati  Of And Mari Of I Mplements. This class is also transferred to my colleague; I shall, therefore, limit myself to such improvements as I deem worthy of remark, which were patented while the class was under my exclusive charge. Anchors. But one patent has been granted during the year for improvements in anchors. This anchor is made in the usual way, except that a rod which passes through the top of the thank for injuring the proper position of the flakes when in use, is armed at its ends with flakes or points at right angles to it, and has such a degree x. of rotation allowed to it as will permit these points to penetrate it i bottom and hold when strain comes upon the anchor. Shi Of Of Ndlass. Three patents have been granted within the year for improvements in windlasses. One of these is called by the inventor arable lifted" and is best adapted to the lifting and transferring of cables from one place to another. The cable does not necessarily wind around its barrel, but the links are held and carried forward. Another of these patents is for an improvement in guiding the cable to and from the windlass. The third is for moving very heavy bodies, drawing up vessels e, and is for equal iting the strain upon the two cables, or the double cable, which the inventor proposes to use. A wheel is firmly attached to the middle of a shaft. This wheel has cogs on its periphery into which a screw works for giving motion to it and the shaft, and has also an opening near its periphery through which the cable passes. In each side of the wheel there is a loose sleeve upon the shaft, which may revolve independent of the wheel and shaft. The cable is passed through the place prepared for in the wheel; each part is then carried over the sleeve and onwards, and attached at two different points to the object to be moved. The windlass is then set in motion and the cable wound a pon the sleeves, and whenever the strain comes more severely on one end of the cable than the other, the sleeves slip on the shaft, and the cable slips in the wheel, until the strain is equal sized. The advantages of this arrangement are obvious. Propelli Of Vessels. Give patents have been granted during the year for improvements in pro pellets. One of them is for using a steam propelleri combination with side paddle wheels. The side paddles to be placed generally in front of the vessels centre of gravity. Another is for an improved form of flexible paddles; and a third for combining with a prop elder partially enclosed, a guard to prevent water from entering i, t, to be carried around in the case. Thesepepellers do not require further notice in this report. A new mode of facilitating the progress of vessels through the water has been patented within the year. The primary object of the invention is to interpose between the hull of the vessel and the water a stratum of air to diminish friction. The exterior surface of that part of the hull which is immersed in water, is made substantially in the form of scales pointing towards the stern. It the extremities of these scales air is ejected. As the vessel passes through the water at a high speed, there is a tendency to a vacuum n consequence of the shoulder left at the extremity of each scale, and the election of the air will be facilitated thereby. The resistance which the vessel will meet with from friction against air, X. a. 43 is evidently less than friction against water; and an obvious advantage is thus gained. But the exterior of the vessel must be modified, and machinery and power will be required to keep the hull of the vessel immersed in air; and whether the same expense and power will produce a more advantageous practical result on this than on the old plan, must be determined by experiment. It is hoped that the invention will be fully tested. Land Conveyance. A very considerable number of inventions belonging to this class have been patented within the year, some of which promise to be useful. Several patents have been granted for springs and other appliances, for hanging the bodies of carriages for common roads, which it is unnecessary in this place particularly to describe. New modes of coup long railroad cars have also been patented. One of which consists principally of a hook, so formed as to rise when pressed by the connecting link to receive the link, and when the link has come to its place it forces the hook down, and whether drawing or pushing holds it in its place. Patents have also been granted for dumping cars and wagons n one of which the body of the vehicle travels to its place, and to the proper position for dumping on rollers sustained by ways, and when in position is raised by eccentrics and bars of wood placed under it upon which it rests, until again raised in the same manner for the removal of the bars for dumping. In another, the body of the car runs back and forward upon ways and rollers, but when it reaches the proper position for resting upon the running gear, the rollers fall into grooves prepared for them, and the car body rests firmly upon the ways. For dumping, the car body is raised from its position by levers with rollers in their ends working against inclined planes on the bottom of the car body, by the combined action of which it is raised and receives its backward motion. In a third, the body rests upon a curved rack, with an intermediate toothed wheel attached to the body working into it, and is moved in either direction by a crank or other equivalent device operating the wheel. The teeth of the rack and the wheel are always in gear. Letters patent have also been granted for arrangements and combinations of wheels, &c, for railroad cars. The wheels of railroad cars have been connected with the body of the car by short axles, sustained by a stirrup like frame on each side, each wheel having an independent motion; but the length of the axle was not sufficient to hold the wheel with sufficient firmness. To avoid unnecessary vibrations fast and loose wheels have also been used, but without the stirrups above mentioned; accomplishing but one object, that of turning curves. Letters patent have been granted within the ye acid 127) for a combination of the fast and loose wheels, with the stirrups and an axle ex44SEx. tending from one wheel to the other, giving the requisite firmness to the wheel by the long axle and stirrups, and the facility of turning curves by the fast and loose wheels. Letters patent have also been granted for a construction and arrangement of wheels, in substance as follows: the front and rear wheels are in all respects as usual; but intermediate, between them, are placed one or more pairs of wheels without blanches and of a conical form, the smallest diameter of the wheel being inwards. When a car thus furnished with wheels is travelling around a curve, the middle wheels, on the outside of the track, will rest upon their largest diameter, and will in some degree raise the other wheels from the rail, and will cause that side of the car to travel faster than the other, to compensate for the difference between the length of the curve and outer tracks. A few patents have been granted for brakes for railroad cars. One of these is for a mode of operating the brakes of all the cars at once, by a combination too complicated to describe in this place and the other is for a brake placed upon wheels, and which operate s more especially to prevent the cars from sliding backwards upon the grades. Several patents have been granted for improvements in axles and boxes for carriages, &c. One of these patents is for placing in the positions sometimes occupied by friction rollers, toothed rollers, whose teeth come to edges on the outer circumference, which work into corresponding teeth on the axle and the interior of the box, thus substituting the "knife edge" for the rubbing surfaces usually employed. Letters patent have also been granted for devices connected with locomotive for watering the track to prevent the rising of dust. It is said that the benefit which the machinery connected with the train derives from this device, to say nothing of comfort to passengers, fully compensates for the expense. Car Wheels. Great exertions have been made during the last eighteen months to improve cast iron car wheels. They are so much less expensive than wrought iron wheels that their substitution is a matter of great importance. There would be no difficulty in fixing upon the proper form for them, if they could be cast without cracking or straining to an injurious degree; but the chilling of the tread, and the various thickness of the different parts, &c, prevent the wheel from cooling in all parts at the same time, or with equal contraction. It is necessary, therefore, that the most desirable forms should, in some degree, be sacrificed to allow compensation for unequal shrinkage and that compromise between the most desirable shapes for the wheels and those best calculated for compensation, which will produce the best combined result, is what most inventors in this branch of manufacture are seeking. Numerous experiments have been tried for the purpose of establishing the theories on this subject, with more or less success; but no form of wheels cast in years past seems to give universal satisfaction. Something new is constantly sought. X. a. 45 t has often happened that wheels cast apparently in accordance with sound principles have failed, while others apparently less philosophical in their construction have answered a good purpose. I that therefore not been deemed expedient to be governed wolf by theories, but to grant patents for such changes of form n' .cid127I appeared to promise usefulness, leaving the questions of practical utility to a practical public. Some twelve patents have been granted within the year for improvements in car wheels; a much larger number than usual, com preceding a variety of curved plate, and curved spoke wheels with chilled rims and solid hubs, and for wheels whose hubs and aims are supported by a combination of plates and spokes, both curved in the peculiar manner deemed most expedient by their respective inventors. One would think, after what has been done, that so limited a field was entirely occupied, and that a sufficient variety had already been produced to test the question fully, whether any, or what cast iron car wheel, will answer the purposes for which they are intended, to the satisfaction of the community. It is unnecessary for me to give a detailed description of the several inventions above mentioned. It would lead me too far, and they will generally be understood by reference t the claims. Of Of    L Engi Neeri Of And Archi Tecture. Upon examination of the patents granted within the year belonging to this class, I find none requiring particular notice which were examined while I had charge of the class. Several of the mare reissues of patents for inventions heretofore noticed. I shall therefore leave the analysis of this. class entirely to my colleague to whom it has been transferred. Of Lls. Upwards of twenty patents have been granted within the year for improvements belonging to this class. They are principally for horse powers, and for improvements in mills for crushing and grinding. Letters patent have been granted for a mode of preparing wheat for grinding. It consists in m listening the exterior coating of the wheat by steaming or otherwise, and then subjecting it to friction in any convenient way; whereby the outer covering of the grains, which ordinarily produces br an in grinding, is entirely removed, and nothing but the clean berne l is left ready for grinding. Letters patent have been granted for an improved form of cogs for racks and opinions, and also for a mode of transforming a lathe so that it may be used for cutting the teeth on cog wheels, &c. Letters patent have been granted for an improved cider mill, which consists principally of four toothed rollers standing upright in the four corners of a square, each working into two of the others, the whole resting on a perforated plate, with receptaclesbhelow for the cider, &c. The apples are placed in a hop per in46Ex. front of the first pair of rollers, and are by them drawn in and crushed; and the up mice is carried by them into the space between the' four rollers, where it is worked and pressed until it is carried out at the side by the action of the rollers, where it is permitted to fall out of the mill. Thus the apples are ground, the cider extracted, and the refuse discharged by the same operation. Letters patent have been granted for an improved hydraulic machine, for transmitting power from one point to another. The apparatus consists of two cylindrical vessels, each having a tight partition from the axis to one side of the vessel. A piston on a shaft passing through the centre of the vessel is also placed in each, which with the partition divides the vessel into two parts either of which can be enlarged, while the other is contracted by moving the piston, which may be done by a crank on the shaft. The compartments in one of these vessels are connected, each with its corresponding compartment in the other, and the whole apparatus is filled with water. It will readily be perceived that, with little power, the motion of one of these pistons will, through the water, be communicated to the other. Give patents have been granted for improvements in horse powers, some of which were examined by my colleague. In one of these horse powers, the opinions which carry the endless chain are placed loosely on their shafts, and are attached to the ends of a bar at points near their peripheryes. This bar is connected to the middle of the shaft of the opinions by a pin on which it s wives, Thus, when either opinion receives more than its proportion of strain, it yields and throws the excess on the opinion connected with it by the bar. Men or twelve patents have been granted within the year for improvements in mills for crushing and grinding. One of these patents is for improvements in the bush. In this the bush traverses up and down in the opening in the bed stone its diameter in the n middle is somewhat greater than at the ends, to permit slight vibrations of the shaft without injury. The opening through the bush is slightly conical, and that part of the spindle which passes through it corresponds in form, so that it can always be kept close as the parts wear, by raising or depressing the bushy which is sustained by a lever and a fork, and is elevated and depressed at pleasure. Some improvement is also made in the mode of oiling the spindle. Another patent has been granted for dividing the shaft, and giving, the part upon which the spindle is a separate support, and so connecting the lower part of the shaft with the upper that they will revolve together; but the lower part may vibrated without transmitting its vibrations to the upper part and the spindle. A patent has been granted for improvements in crushing and grinding mills. The corn in the cob placed in the hop per is broken and ground by two horizontal toothed cylinders, working against each other and against toothed concaves. The first roller is small arid moves slowly, and its teeth work between those of a concave at the mouth of the hop per. This is for breaking. I mm Ex. 
47diately below the first roller is a large one, revolving rapidly, its teeth working first between those of the first roller, and farther around into the teeth of an adjustable concave. This is for grinding. The surfaces of the two rollers, where they work together, move in the same direction; the large roller moving much faster than the small one. Thus the rapidity of the action increases as the corn progresses towards the completion of its grinding. There is first, the slow motion of the small roller against its concave, then the differential motion between the two rollers, and finally, the full speed of the large roller acting against its concave. An improvement in mills for grinding has been patented, which is as follows: The first grinder is a sphere revolving upon tr unions. Upon this is placed a concave grinder, fitting it down to the tr unions, and a hollow shaft, projecting upwards, is properly sustained at the top. One of the tr unions of the spherical grinder is connected with the shaft of the second grinder by cogwheels. The feed is through the shaft of the second grinder. Motion is given to this shaft, and from it both grinders are caused to revolve, their motions being at right angles to each other. An improvement has also been patented in the mode of setting bed stones. The rigid manner in which they are generally set renders them liable to injuries from the jars occasioned by the operations of the runner. To obviate this inconvenience the bed stone is made to rest upon the ends of set screws, and is held to its place by a spring connection, which allows the necessary compensation. Letters patent have also been granted for a new mode of manufacturing mill stones, and for a new mode of drawing in the air between the stones for cooling. Further remarks upon this class are deemed unnecessary. Metallurgy And Manufacture I N Metals. Although numerous patents of this class have been granted within the year, but few of those which were examined before it was transferred to Mr. Men wick require particular notice in this report. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in machinery for the manufacture of lead pipe. Heretofore, when the pipe has been made of metal in a ' set " state, a bridge has been used to support the core, and the metal above, being separated by the arms of the bridge, necessarily required great pressure after passing it to be welded together. In the machine above mentioned the cylinders for holding the metal are placed on opposite sides of the core, and there may be two or more of them, and the core is sustained above the metal. The cylinders being filled and the metal set, the pistons are forced forward simultaneously, driving the metal before them, equally sustaining the core by equal pressures, while the metal rushes out in a direction perpendicular to the cylinders in the form of pipes. To bridge being used, and no separation of the metal taking place, all the disadvantages arising therefrom are avoided 48 X. a. Letters patent have been granted for an improved method of casting large rolls. It differs but little from processes heretofore used, but in these operations slight changes in the mode of casting produce important results. The mould is placed in an upright position, and the melted metal is poured into a vertical tube as high as the mould. This tube communicates with the mould by a horizontal pipe at the bottom, in a direction and position tangential to the mould. This causes a constant whirl in the melted metal within the mould, which tends to throw the pure metal, by its superior weight, to the outside of the mass, and the scotia and other lighter matter to the centre. A swimmer is used also as an auxiliary. I tis kept constantly at the surface of the metal as it rises in the mould, and in such position as to direct the scotia to the centre as the metal whirls in the mould, so that when the metal chills the exterior will be perfect. To cast perfect rolls has always been a matter of difficulty and delicacy, and it is said the mode above described is very successful. Several patents have been granted for improvements in common spoons, having for their object increased strength and economy of the article; for improvements in bench vices for ensuring parallel ism of the jaws; for improvements in the manufacture of wrought nails, spikes, &c; also for improvements in welding iron pipes. Letters patent have been granted for an improved apparatus for rolling puddles balls. The ball is supported by two toothed rollers, revolving in the same direction, so that the mass will revolve instead of passing between them. Above is a can shaped toothed wheel which also operates upon the mass. At one end of the rollers there is a plate, against which the mass, as it is worked, a but, and at the other a hammer, which acts at intervals for upsetting. Letters patent have also been granted for beading sheet metal. This would be easily effected by winding the end around a small, rod. But the rod would spring and the bead would be imperfect. To avoid this difficulty the rod above and below it has dies which open and shut at pleasure, which leave sufficient space around the rod for the thickness of the sheet, and prevent springing as the sheet is drawn in and beaded. With these few notices I shall dismiss this class to be further treated by my colleague. Hydrauli Of And Pneumati  Of. Examinations in this class have not been so numerous in proportion during the year as in some others, and a very considerable, number of applications still remain un examined. Wate1 Of tEEI S. Some six or eight patents have been granted for improvements in water wheels, but the distinction between them, and others in previous use, are not very broad. Different kinds of water wheels are, of course, best adapted to different circumstances; and when ax. Of c. No. 59.49particular kind of wheel is generally used in a given district of country if another, after experiment, is thought to work better it is at once considered a new invention, without reflecting that the same may long since have been, used elsewhere; or that a difference in a supply of water, or the head or various other similar circumstances, having nothing to do with invention, may be the sole cause of the difference of action. Rejections in this class, for want of essential novelty, are always numerous, and the improvements patented seldom present much novelty. Letters patent have been granted for a wheel which has the position and general form of an over shot wheel. The rim of the wheel is supported by arms at one of its ends or edges only. I t receives the water on the inside, nearly on a level with the axis. The buckets are V shaped in their cross section, the outer side being the highest. As the wheel revolves, and the buckets descend, they become capable of receiving and retaining the water which falls from the bucket above, which is being filled. The form of the bucket prevents the water from falling outside, and causes its capacity to increase as it descends, so as to receive and prevent the waste of the water falling out of the upper buckets. Under peculiar circumstances, this wheel would answer a good purpose. In another wheel patented the water is received on the outside of the wheel upon two sets of buckets which meet, forming crusts along the middle of the rim, and is discharged on both sides. Theshute is divided into two parts, in such a manner as to direct a portion of the water immediately upon the wheel, and to conduct the rest nearly half way around before it strikes the wheel, thus causing nearly all the buckets to be in action at the same time. I tis not easy, without drawings, to show the difference between this wheel and some others, which would answer nearly the same general description. Most of the modifications made in water wheels for some years past, are little else than mere changes of form without invention or advantage. This remark is true to such a degree as to leave the impression that the subject is nearly exhausted. Rai Of Of Water. Some fifteen patents have been granted within the year for improvements in pumps and other machines for raising water; but in general, they present but little novelty, and very precise descriptions of them would be necessary to distinguish them from those previously known; and such descriptions as could be given of the min this place would not be generally useful. Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in tilting buckets for drawing water from wells. A fixture is attached to the curb for catching the edge of the bucket and tilting it as it rises, but the bucket will not always present the proper side to the hook for tilting. To ensure the proper position of the bucket, a flat strip of wood or metal is placed in the chain, not far above the bucket, which passes through a guide with friction rollers, and turns the bucket into the proper position 50 X. Doc. N. 59. Letters patent have been granted for an improved pump, constructed as follows? The space within which the piston works isa sector of a cylinder, and a flat piston vibratesinit upon an axis passing through the centre of the cylinder, of which the chamber is a sector. Above this axis is a chamber, with which the pipe for the discharge of water communicates. Dear the bottom of the sector are valves for the admission of water. Dear the edge of the piston next the shaft, is an opening through the piston to the lower edge of which a valve is hinged. There is also a corresponding opening through the shaft, for the passage of the water from the sector to the upper chamber. As the piston vibrated, the valve also vibrated, alternately opening and closing the passages from each side of the piston to the upper chamber. This machine is a decided improvement upon those acting upon a similar principle which have heretofore been used. A patent has been granted for an improvement in the Archimedean screw 'for raising water. The distance between the thread diminishes towards the top, and the screw and reservoir are so arranged at the bottom, as that the screw shall receive a portion of air with the water at each opening which is driven along up the screw. By these combined arrangements the water may be discharged in a jet to a considerable distance above the apparatus, by the air compressed at various points of the screw. Letters patent have also been granted for an improved arrangement of pumps, to supply and operate the hydraulic press. Any convenient number of pumps may be used. When the press commences its operations in many cases, the resistance is comparatively slight, and a rapid supply of water is necessary; as the resistance becomes greater, equal or greater power should be applied, but the supply of water should be less. In the above apparatus, the pumps are so combined that one after another they cease to furnish their quota of water as the resistance increases, and the principal part of the power is exerted to operate the pumps which continue to furnish water. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in lock gates for improvements in stop cocks and molasses gates; also for improvements in filters to operate on a large scale, and for improvements in stop cocks and filters combined; but a particular analysis of them is not deemed important. Machi Nery For Worki Of I N Lumber. K considerable number of patents have been granted during the year, for improvements in machinery belonging to this class; but not enough to do justice to the class. A large number of applications belonging to it still remain un examined. In general, the inventions patented this year in machinery for working lumber, are not so interesting as in some former years; though this remark does not apply to all. X. 
51STAVE, Shi Ngle, And Lath Machi Nes. Some ten or twelve patents have been granted within the year, for improvements in machinery for the purposes above indicated. Some of these are too complicated to describe in this place, and the description of others would not be interesting. New radical improvements have been made in this variety of machinery; but inventors seem to confine themselves to slight refinements upon machinery heretofore used. Difficulty has always been found in planing or smoothing rivedstaves. Their surfaces are usually warped and twisted, and the ordinary planing machine would destroy instead of finishing them. Several attempts have been made to smooth them with various success. Two patents have he en granted within the year, for improvements in machinery for dressing this kind of state. One of them has the general appearance of the planing machine; the device which drives the state forward is such as to allow it to turn to accommodate its shape. At the point where the cutting takes place, the state is pressed, by rollers working against it- near its edge, to the rest. These rollers are used, instead of the long ones generally used in planing, so that they may properly press the state irrespective of its shape, so that whatever may by the position of the state at other points, it is properly presented to the cutters at the points operated upon. When the state is partially dressed, it is seized by grip mrs at the other end, which allow it to turn and draw it entirely through. A full idea of the machine cannot be given without drawings. In another patented machine, the lived state is pushed through between stationary cutters, in such a manner as to allow the state to turn, to compensate for its irregularity of' form. An ingenious machine has been patented for sawing c lap boards. It would be impossible to give a full idea of it without drawings, but its principal object is to give the various travelling and vibrating motions to the carriage for the purpose of sawing up the whole block, and giving the proper shape to each of the c lap boards without waste. Letters patent have been granted for an improvement in sawing out blanks for spokes. The round block, as it is s awed from the log, is split as nearly through the middle as possible, and one half of it is held by points between two posts rising up from a carriage. One of these posts is hinged so that it may be inclined backwards and if the grain of the wood is winding, this inclination will bring the lower edge of the block parallel to one of the saws. Two saws are used, one for sawing a serf towards the centre of the block, and the other for finishing .the separation of the blank from the block. As each blank is separated, the block is partially revolved for another cut.  When the whole convex exterior is thus cut off from the block, it can be lowered, and commencing as before, another set of blanks may be s awed, and another until the block is entirely s awed into spoke banks. By the arrangement of machinery above described, it will be perceived that blanks may be 52 X, is awed from blocks having a winding grain, nearly in the direction of the grain. Turni Of Regular And I Rregular Forms. Several patents have been granted for this variety of work in lumber. One of these is well adapted to working blocks of timber into forms whose cross sections are poly goal, but varying in thickness from end to end, according to any desired pattern. Piano legs, &c, may be dressed by it. The block is turned at the proper intervals by self acting machinery, without the care of the attendant. Another is adapted to spiral f luring along a surface of a block varying in diameter from end to end. The cutters in both of the above machines operate with the grain. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in machinery for turning small rods, such as he handles, rake handle s c, which are liable to bend in turning. The knife used cuts the whole length of the rod at once; and to prevent torsion, the mandrels are driven by gullies at both ends; and to prevent bending, rests are so connected with the knife as to be brought up to the support of the rod in proportion as the c utter is brought down upon it. Plani Of Machi Nery. But four or five patents have been granted within the year for improvements in this variety of machinery. Numerous applications, however, are still pending. One of these is for dressing mould kings. A thick plank is flitted in such a manner as to leave each part nearly in the form of a triangular prim, and then placed in the machine, which has the general appearance of a common planing machine. A rotating cutters used of proper form, to give the required shape to the mould in gas the plank passes under it; and a smoothing plane or c utter, behind the revolving c utter, also operates upon the same and dresses it as it passes. The upper feed roller is formed of toothed rings of various diameters on an harbor, which are change able at pleasure. These rings are so arranged as to operate in feeding upon those parts of the surface, which are to be removed by the cutters without injury to the others. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in reciprocaling planing machines. The machine is too complicated to be fully described. After the plane has made its cut, it is by anew combination of machinery, raised from the board and returns to its position and is again brought down upon the board. Support is given to the board while under the plane, and between the tongueing and grooving cutters, by bars with springs between them, which spread or contract according to the width of the board. Letters patent have also been granted for an improvement in the hand plane. The lower side of the plane stock is made convex x. from end to end, and a flexible plate is placed over this convex surface, and firmly attached near the point where the plane iron passes through. The extremities of this plate are so connected with the plane stock that they can be forced down and held at any point required. The face of the plane is thus made of a variable form, so that plane, concave or convex surfaces, can be smoothed by it at pleasure. Letters patent have been granted for improvements in bench hooks; for improvements in machinery for cutting screws in posts and rails of bedsteads; for improvements in boring and mortisingand ten oning; for cutting figures out of veneers; for improvements in chucks; for improvements in machinery for sawing timber, &c. Letters patent have also been granted for improvements in machinery for making match splints. A perfect idea of this machine cannot be given in this place. The blocks, as they pass through the machine, are cramped or matted on one end, so that splitting them at the other into splints will not separate them on the matted end, but will leave the mass of splints in such a condition that they may easily be separated afterwards. The action of the splitting knives, by an ingenious contrivance, is regulated by the resistance, so that when the splints are split far enough so far as to hold together only by the matted part the resistance ceasing, the knives advance no farther. A more detailed analysis of the improvements patented in this class is deemed unnecessary on the present occasion. Of Scellaneous. Some twenty-five patents have been granted for improvements which, as they are not referable to any of the other classes, belong to this. This class is now under the charge of Mr. Men wick. New of the patents granted, while I had charge of the class, require particular notice. One of these patents is for a mode of saving property in stores, counting rooms, &c, in cases of fire. The shelves, counters, desks, &c, are placed on rails instead of being connected with the room, and so held in their places as to be easily disengaged, and left free to move towards the doors. The doors are so arranged that, when opened, the principal fixtures above mentioned, with their contents, may easily be run out into the street. Letters patent have also been granted for a self setting trap for animals. A small platform is held in place by a spring catch so that the animal may stand upon it without disturbing it. His hook is so connected with a fixture under the bait holder, that when the animal attempts to take the bait the hook releases the platform and it tilts. The bait is so placed that the animal cannot reach it without getting into a position in which he can male little exertion to save himself; at id, therefore, when the platform tilts, he falls into a box or pit below. The platform, relieved of its weight, falls again into its usual position with the other parts, is again caught by the latch and the trap is set as before. The trap remains 54 X. baited, because the animal falls in the unsuccessful attempt to reach it. Letters patent have also been granted for saving animals confined in stables in cases of fire. It consists principally in a device by which, at one end of the stable, on opening the door, turning a crank, pushing or pulling a slide, or by any other similar means, all the animals are at once and in i a moment released from the rack. But it is unnecessary for me to proceed further in the analysis of machinery patented within the past year. Although many patents have been passed over without particular notice, yet enough of them have been mentioned to give a sufficiently full idea of the progress of inventions, and the character of improvements which have been referred to my desk. In conclusion, allow me to make a few remarks upon the progress of business. In the year 1844, the one immediately preceding the commencement of your administration of the affairs of this office, the number of applications increased over any preceding year about twenty-five per cent, and unusual exertions were made to keep up the business. At the close of that year there was a small accumulation of business in the classes now under the charge of Mr. Men wick and myself. During that year the aggregate of patents and rejections in those classes examined by my predecessor, was. 408 Whereas, the aggregate of patents and rejections examined by Mr. Men wick and myself-one of us laboring the whole year, and the other about six months was .a. 902An increase of results, in proportion to the time and force, of nearly fifty per cent, notwithstanding the accumulated difficulties with which we have been obliged to contend. Respectfully submitted, by. P. N. Of Tzgerald, Examiner of patents. To honorable Edmund Burke, Commissioner of patents. X. 55. Uni Ted States Patent Offi Of, January, 1849. Of R: In accordance with your instructions, I have the honor to submit the following report, relating to the duty performed by me under the appointment you were pleased to make in June last, and also giving some idea of the progress of American invention in those classes of the arts which it has become my duty to act upon. In entrance upon my duties, one half of the classes formerly entrusted to Mr. Fitzgerald, were allotted to me, and we, for a time, acted in concert upon such subdivisions of classes as first presented themselves in order for examination. Under this arrangement our reports have been, with the exception of the last two months, made in common, not reporting specially upon the amount of duty performed by each. In the numerical statement, to be found in my colleagues report, it will easily be perceived, on inspection, that almost double the amount of cases have been acted upon during the last six months, by us in concert, when compared with the number acted upon by him alone. During this time a final division has been made, and classes Of, metallurgy; No. 6, steam engines and boilers; No. 7, navigation, etc; No. 9, civil engineering and architecture; No. 19, fire arms and implements of war, and No. 22, miscellaneous, have been allotted to me. I will now proceed to notice briefly, and succinctly in the extreme, some of the inventions which have been examined by me, promising that such notice will not extend to all the cases so acte i upon, and also that those omitted are so merely on account of want of time, and not because they may not be, from their ingenuity and utility, equally worthy of comment and explanation. Those cases acted upon by me, before a division was completed, and which are among the classes now a p pertaining to Mr. Fitzgerald, will first be noticed. Among fences, a patent has been granted for a flood fence, the characteristics of which may be described as follows: Posts, having a series of notches, open on the down stream side to receive the rails, are placed in the ground in the usual manner. One end of all the rails in each panel is attached by two staples to the bottom or end of these notches, so that it may sway freely about when acted upon by the current of water. To the top of each post a stick of timber, of the same length as the post, is attached by a hinge, which piece is so arranged that when the free ends of the rails are placed in the notches, each on top of the fast end of the rail in the panel preceding, then these sticks of timber shall hold all the rails in place. To the piece of timber attached to the post at one end of the fence, a trigger is fastened to be acted on by the56Ex. pressure of the flood, and when the water rises, this trigger trips the first piece of timber, which loose is the rails in the first panel the lower rail in this panel trips, by a trigger, the piece of timber attached to the second post, and so on through the whole series. Other patents have been granted for an improved method of fastening the wires of a metallic fence to the posts, and for an improvedhurdle fence, which can be very easily taken apart and carried, detached from the posts, to any required position. Patents have been granted for two horse powers, one of which is constructed wholly of iron, and has cogs upon the periphery of the pedestal, which supports the whole apparatus; acting upon opinion whose axis is in the arm to which the animal is attached. Another opinion in the same shaft, is in gear with a third cog wheel upon an axis concentric with and inside of that upon which the working arm revolves. The whole arrangement is compact, strong, and simple. The other horse power is the well known one of the vertical wheel, with the animal moving in its inner periphery. The novelty consisting in a contrivance, by means of which a governor is made to control the position of the animal, and consequently the amount of its effective force. Minions, axles, screws, etc, act upon the h alter and the splinter bar to which the animal is attached, causing him to mount higher along the inclined inner surface of the wheel as more work is required, or backing him down to the lowest portion of the cylinder when the least amount of labor is to be performed. Among machines for raising water, an arrangement of a bucket with a valve in its bottom, and certain devices for lifting it and throwing it out of the line of the shaft, through which it has been hoisted, has been patented. This contrivance is peculiarly adapted for raising water from arterial wells, where they are too deep to admit of the common pump, and its use is said to be increasing in limestone districts of the western States where such wells afford the only supply of water. A patent has been granted for a double acting force and lift pump, all the valves of which are contained in the bed plate of the machine, they are flap valves, and so arranged that the same piece of leather acts as hinge and packing for them all, besides serving as packing between the cylinders and bed plate. A water ram may be noticed, the valves of which are so constructed that a small ring of water is continually kept between the valve and its seat, thus preventing the slamming and consequent wear, which is the case in valves of the ordinary construction. In the class of land conveyance, there have been many patents granted, most of which have been acted upon by my colleague. There is one only of those that have been under my notice of which I desire to make\ mention. It consists of a very simple contrivance for mi ligating the injuries to which horses attached to carts are subject when drawing loads over rough pavements, these injuries arising from the constant jar upon their backs of that portion of the load which i thrown directly upon the horse. Byex 57 placing a spring beneath the shafts or t hills, and attaching the back chain to it, the horse is relieved at once. In the class of metallurgy many improvements have been made during the past year, the greater portion of which relate rather to manufactures in metal than to improvements in the production of the metal itself. Among those cases which relate to the production of a certain variety of the manufactured metal, one patent, that has been granted for improvements in the manufacture of sheet lead, demands particular attention. The idea upon which the process is based is simple in the extreme, and when the plan has been elaborated and brought into execution, it appears wonderful that the same idea should not have presented itself before. In the ordinary processes for rolling sheet lead, the metal is first cast into a thick slab or flat pig, which is passed between rollers that revolve alternately in different directions, dragging the lead through them, first from the right hand and then from the left. In this process continual interruptions take place from the necessity of reversing the motion of the rolls, and a cumbrous and expensive apparatus for supporting and traversing the sheet in process of manufacture must be used. In this improved process the lead is cast into the shape of a hollow cylinder, which is slipped over a cylindrical roll, another roll is then brought in contact with the cylinder by means of screws' or some similar device, and the two are moved with a continuous rotary motion; it is obvious that as the lead becomes thinner, it will no longer exactly fit the cylinder upon which it was placed, but hang down below it like a loose and, continually increasing in length as the rolls are approached and the sheet becomes thinner. When the sheet is sufficiently thin it is only necessary to slit it and detach it from the roll. Several mechanical devices have been devised for carrying this idea into practice, and some ingenuity has been required to arrange the rolls, the method of supporting them and of enveloping one of them with the cylinder of lead. Letters patent have been granted for a process for restoring their shape t steel springs, the novelty in which consists in binding or clamping the spring into a mould after it has been hardened and the temper drawn; it is then, while still on the mould, dipped into a bath of visible metal and the proper temper given to it. By this process, truss and other crooked springs of the like character, maybe obtained with great certainty in any variety of shape, and as they are not secured on the mould or pattern until after they are hardened, all danger of unequal tempering arising from the water not having free access to all surfaces of the steel is avoided. A patent has been secured for certain novel ties in the method of moulding iron pipe, which consists in forming the cores and moulding of the patterns by means of machinery. The cores are formed between four wooden surfaces, constituting when forced together a cylindrical core box. The sand is thrown on to the bottom strip of wood and between the two side pieces, the top is then forced down towards the bottom, and the two sides are pressed towards each other. It should have been premised that the precise qu an 58 X. city of sand necessary to form a core of any given size is determined by experiments, and this quantity thrown in by measure as before described. The patterns are placed on bottoms, or secured to match plates in the usual manner; the cope or drag turned over them, and a quantity of sand determined by measure thrown in, which is then compressed by machinery into the flask. It is obvious that this process must necessarily be confined to pipe of small calibre, and it is stated that gas or water pipe, for house service and the like purposes, may in this way be cast with great cheapness and sufficiently strong and neat. A process for welding or attaching pieces of wrought iron or steel to iron castings, during the process of casting, has been discovered and patented. In the ordinary method, pieces of wrought iron are heated in a furnace, and while hot are placed in proper position in the sand forming the mould. This process is difficult of execution, for two reasons: first, that the heated iron is difficult to handle, and to be placed in position with accuracy; secondly, that, during the handling, and the time necessary for closing the flask, the wrought metal becomes so much cooled as to render the process uncertain. These difficulties have been obviated by placing the wrought iron in the flask while cold, and constructing in the sand a cavity, one side of which is formed by one or more surfaces of the iron that is to be attached. A gate and outlet are provided to this cavity and melted iron is poured in, and re poured, if necessary, until the heat it parts with in cooling sufficiently heat sup the wrought metal which is to form apart of the finished article. Two patents have issued for improvements in bending the s help, or ribbon of metal, from which iron tubes are to be formed by welding their edges together. One process consists in attaching behind the finishing rolls that form the s help, two pieces of metal, which are so shaped and secured to each other, that a straight horizontal slit is left between them at the ends nearest the rolls, while at their other extremity the orifice is circular, with a core or mandrel in its centre. The straight slit changes gradually in the interior of the tool to a semicircular one, and here the core commences also semi cylindrical, and is gradually changed into a cylinder, as the slit by degrees en compasses it. The s help, as it leaves the rolls, is by them forced through this tool, and when it leaves. it has the shape of a tube with a slit extending its entire length; it is only necessary to weld the edges together and the pipe is completed. The other method consists in passing theskelp between the jaws or dies of two tongs, as it is drawn from the heating furnace. The novelty consists in the shape of the dies, which are so constructed that they, by their joint action, shape the tube, which is passed through them, not only as it would be if clasped in ordinary tongs, but also at right angles to that direction. It is difficult to give any clear idea of the shape of these dies without the aid of a drawing or model. The use of wrought iron tubes is daily increasing, and numerous efforts are making, both in this and in other countries, to simplify, X. 
59improveand cheap en the process of manufacturing them. Old gun barrels were, in the first instance, and at no remote period, bought up and used as gas and water pipes, but, at the present day, iron tubing has been applied to so many useful purposes, that large manufactures have been constructed solely for this particular branch of the iron trade, and the size of the article has been increased from that of the ordinary musket barrel to that necessary for the flies of marine steam engine boilers. Numerous improvements have been made in locks, fastening of all kinds, hinges and springs; some of them complicated, others simple; some of them, on their very face, showing that much mechanical skill was required for their invention, others slight variations of single ideas, which nevertheless serve important] purposes when used in practice, whether considered with reference to facility of manufacture, or as adding to the convenience of the consumer. Two powder proof bank locks come under' the former of these divisions. One of them has circular, the other vibrating tumblers in one, the key is pushed in and turned round on the inner periphery of an iron ring, before it begins to act upon the tumblers or bolt; in the other, the key is completely covered by the handle or knob before it commences to shoot the bolt; in both it is impossible for a lock picked to try the tumblers, and keep a constant pressure on the bolt at the same time, thus presenting one great obstacle to their being picked. In both of them, the latter particularly, the exterior openings are so arranged and so minute, that it seems impossible to introduce a sufficient quantity of powder to blow the lock from the door. In another lock, for the same purpose, highly magneticed tumblers are used, placed with their opposite poles in contact, and by virtue of their magnetic attraction and a peculiar spring shape given to them, so combined that it is difficult to move any single tumbler with a false key, without forcing the one with which it is haired into the same position. Two front door locks have been patented, with numerous ingenious contrivance for safety, but too complicated to be understood without the aid of drawings. Notice should also be taken of what is termed a portable lock, intended A be fast ended to any door by means of a screw attached to it, for which and another screw serving as hasp, the lock itself serves as a driver. This lock, when so adjusted, may be locked and unlocked in the usual way, and detached from the door at the pleasure of the owner. I t affords additional security to travellers, and must come into use in those sections of the country where hotel doors with permanently attached locks are as yet a rarity. Several patents have been granted for sash bearers, sash fasteners, door springs, &c, some of them simple, compact and convenient, but not demanding a notice in detail. A convenient, combined blind hinge' opener, shutter and fastened, has been patented. This contrivance is so arranged that the me returning of a knob inside the house opens or closes the blinds and fastens them in either t position. The knob is connected by a rod60Ex. passing through the wall with a saucer shaped piece of iron, which surrounds the spindle of the hinge, and is situated between the upper and lower hinge. The upper portion of the hinge is provided with a friction roller that travels upon the saucer, and spring bolts falling into catches are attached to the blind, or catches are provided into which the blind itself may drop. Of the blind be closed and fastened, the knob is turned in such manner as to tilt the saucer above described, so that a portion of its periphery nearest to the point of meeting of the two blinds is elevated. This motion lifts the blind out of the catch which holds it shut; the blind then rests through the roller upon the saucer, which is now a circular inclined plane, and the roller running down, it opens the blind and throws it against the wall, where the spring bolt catches and holds the leaf open. By reversing the motion of the knob, making the opposite portion of the periphery of the saucer highest, the blind is lifted, the catch last mentioned is disengaged, the leaf closes and falls into the clasp holding the blind shut. Among tools and cutlery, two improvements demand notice; one being an improved french, by means of which a cylindrical bar or nut may be turned The characteristics of the implement, are first, the peculiar form of the inner face of the outer jaw which is hooked shape; and second, the method of securing the inner and move able jaw in its position. The last is secured to the slide r by a pin, so that it may be moved outwards a certain distance from the french handle in such a way that a line passing through its centre shall be inclined to a line passing through the centre of the handle. The face of this jaw is not perpendicular to a line passing longitudinally through the handle, but inclined in such a manner, that that part of its plane farthest from the handle is nearest to the outer jaw. Of a cylindrical rod be grasped between these jaws, by means of the screw common to all wretches, and the french turned towards them, the bolt is then tightly gripped and forced to revolve; when the french handle is turned in the other direction, the nut or rod slips down the inclined plane above described, the swinging jaw turns towards the handle, and the french moves over without turning the rod. The improvements referred to in the construction of table cutlery, consist in shortening the blade of the knife, placing the bolster at the end of the blade, and then making a short sang which forms the connexion between the blade and the handle. In the finished article the blade and sang together are of the same length, as the blade in the old fashioned knife, but the bolster is so much nearer the centre of the whole article, and the distance from it to the end of the handle is so much greater than usual, that the knife is what is technically termed a balance knife, without the necessity of weighting the handle. Expense in manufacture and risk of splitting the handle while in use are thus avoided. The improvements made in screw machines, consist generally in modifications rendering the machinery less complicated; and those in nail, rivet, and spike machines are not such as can easily be explained in a mere description. A new feature has been introduced into one of the bolt machines, in which the bolt, instead of being x. a. 61 headed by one griping and compression, is successively acted upon by the header and side holders, thus imitating in a measure the method in which bolts are formed by hand. A very singular horse shoe nail machine has been patented, in which the heated rod of iron is passed between rolls having a combination of a sort of groove and indentures on the periphery which gives shape to the nail. But these grooves are not formed in the roll itself, but in sort of states or segments, the breadth of several of which is not greater than the length of one nail. These states are shaped, with the end of one arm fastened to the heads or ends of the rolls, and the other arm resting on their peripheryes. As the rolls revolve, the outside right angled corner of these L strike came of friction rollers, which force the states on the top and bottom roll towards each other, and the nail is formed; two of its sides from the compression due to the main rolls, the two other sides by the pressure arising from the states being forced towards each other by the friction rollers above described. In the class of steam and gas engines, patents have been granted for an improved condenser something similar to the well known one brought into use by All, as far as the condensation of the steam without the use of injection water is concerned. The tubes of this condenser are arranged something after the manner of a worm, and a partition is placed in the cistern near its top; above which one or more coils of tubes or their equivalents are situated. Later is kept on top of this partition, which is renewed from time to time, and a connection is formed between the water there contained and the lower part of the worm, while below the partition water is kept in continual circulation for the purpose of condensing the steam. The action is as follows, it being premised that the condenser is to be applied to marine engines using salt water in their boilers: As the steam passes through the tubes above the partition it heats the water surrounding them, a portion of it is converted into steam, which passes through the, connexion above mentioned, and is condensed along with the steam escaping through the exhaust valves. It is obvious by this arrangement, a continued supply of fresh water may be furnished to the boilers without any additional consumption of fuel. A patent has also been granted for a method of setting steam boilers; the novelty consisting in a peculiar arrangement of the fire bridges, and in the introduction of currents of air through small apertures in the same, and in the side walls of the furnace beyond the bridges. By these currents the gaseous products of combustion are kept in motion in such a manner that they pass to the rear and return again to the front of the boiler, without the necessity of employing return flies, while at the same time these gaseous products are almost entirely consumed. Economy in fuel is promoted, and the annoyance arising from smoke in a measure prevented by this apparatus. Patents have been granted for a water door applied to boilers, and for various cut off; also, for a method of regulating and controlling steam power, by means of which the force furnished by62Ex. steam can be applied (with the intervention of only a cylinder, piston and piston rod) directly to punching, working valves, bending iron, and the like purposes. A patent has also been obtained for applying to a useful purpose the force furnished by the rush of cold water towards the vacuum in a condenser, when condensation is effected by injection. In the class of navigation and marine implements, a patent has been granted for a new theory for determining the models of vessels. In vessels constructed on this plan, all the curves that run fore and aft along the line of the dead wood are either circular or elliptical, and all the curves composing the outsides of the timbers or cross sections of the vessels are circular or elliptical; the theory being further limited by the fact, that the timbers of the mid ship section have in themselves the shape of every timber in the vessel or, in other words, suppose frames precisely alike set up along the top of the dead wood, and their tops s awed off to correspond with the line of s hear, and the vessels planked up on such timbers. Patents have also been granted for pro pellets of various kinds for methods of steering vessels without the use of tiller ropes; and for inter losing springs to de aden the shock arising from seas striking the r udder, and for an improved gun harpoon. A life boat is also deserving of notice, the sides of which a reformed of flexible material, and double, thus permitting the boat to be folded and packed into a small compass, while at the same time the double sides are distended, and the interval between them is filled with air when the boat is opened out and ready for use. In the class of civil engineering and architecture, patents have been granted for a canal lock and appurtenances, so arranged that by pulling a line leading along the tow path to some distance from the lock, water wheels are set in motion, which open and shut the gates as may be required. Also, for a compound break joint railroad rail, which seems well adapted to prevent jar upon cars and locomotives; and which also admits of the removal of the old and putting on a new upper surface, whenever such surface is worn out. A railroad draw bridge has been patented; it is on the swinging principle, and each particular string piece is hinged to the augments, while the cross pieces are fastened on them in such manner by pilots that their angle of position to the strangers may change. By virtue of this arrangement the strings lie against each other when the draw is open, and occupy far less space than when arranged in the customary manner. Patents have been granted for door springs, weather strips, and bell telegraphs; also for rock drilling machines, excavations, and mud machines. In the department of firearms a patent has been granted for a very simple breech loading gun, which caps itself as the breech is brought into place. In this arm the breech isa solid piece of steel, which is forced upwards, between the end of the barrel and the stock, after the cartridge has been placed in position, shearingEx. 63 off the end of the cartridge as the breech rises. This breech is wedged shape, and will keep tight even after long use. Another gun has been patented in which an endless chain of cartridge boxes, each containing a single cartridge revolve over rollers on the stock. Each box, as it arrives opposite the open breech, has a cartridge forced from it into the barrel, the breech is then closed, the gun fired, and these operations repeated at will until the cartridges are exhausted. An ingenious machine for charging percussion caps, too complicated to be explained without the aid of drawings, has been patented. Also an apparatus for stopping shot holes in the sides of vessels under water; this machine is like an umbrella, strongly formed, and covered with water proof canvass. It is forced while shut through the hole from the inside of the vessel, the handle is then drawn back again, the apparatus opens, and the pressure of the water forces the canvass close against the sides of the ship, effectually plugging the hole. In the class of general miscellaneousa patent has been granted for a process, by which the fine dust and refuse coal, so abundant in the vicinity of coal yards, mines, and other places where this fuel is handled, and which is now useless, may be converted into a good fuel. The process consists simply in subjecting the small particles to great pressure, after they have been placed in moulds; and from the specimens deposited in the office, it is perfectly evident, that even anthracite dust will after subjection to compression adhere together, and form a lump of as great specific gravity as the coal itself. All of which is respectfully submitted. Henry B. Renwi Of. To the On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. G. Of R: In accordance with your instructions, I here with communicate a report of the history and present condition of the business of the office committed to my charge. I received from you on the first day of July last, the appointment o of examiner of patents. But in consequence of the appointment of several assistant examiners made about the same time, who had not yet been initiated into the duties of their office, considerable time was necessarily consumed in aiding them in the first steps of their duties. I did not, therefore, take my room and enter upon the duties appropriate to my department as examiner, until the twenty second day of August, 1848. Previous to this date, however, many cases were acted on and disposed of as will appear in the tabular view here with presented 64 X. a. The classes that have fallen to my share according to the present distribution are the following 1.  Agriculture, including all instruments and devices for horticulture, agriculture, collecting and preparing for the market the various products of the soil from the animal and vegetable kingdom 2. Chemical processes, including manufactures and compounds in dyeing, color making, dis tilling, manufacture of soap and candles, and all chemical manufactures 3. Weather, including fanning and dressing leather, the manufacture of boots and shoes, saddles and harness, and such other articles as are generally made of leather, with the tools and machines for their manufacture 4. Household furniture, including machines and implements for domestic purposes, as washing machines, bread and cracker machines, feather dressing machines, and out household articles of every description 5. Hearing apparel, articles for the toilet, and instruments and machines for their manufacture. At the time of opening the books of my division as examiner, I received as my share of the cases then on hand in the office 230. Since that time I have received 167 new applications. But previous to the above distribution, I received and acted upon 11 other cases which have not been included in my monthly reports. These were all completed actions. Three of them were ordered to issue, and eight were rejected. Give other cases not included in my monthly reports, were also acted on by me previous to opening my separate books; these are still pending. Of the 397 cases received by me at the time, and since the distribution, 80 were patented and 98 rejected; 46 are still pending, and 168 still un acted on. The following tabular view will show the history and present condition of the work done, and to be done, at my desk. Distribubefore ti on on .district- 22d Dug. It ion. -a. Dug.

65Up .to the 22d of August, this, with all the other classes now in my charge, was in the hands of Dr. Age, and will be reported on by him. There will be, therefore, an apparent incongruity in the reports of the present year, from the fact that some applications in each class of inventions distributed to the newly appointed examiners will be found in the reports of at least two examiners. Of the patents granted under agriculture, seven were for modifications of the single plough; one for a combined plough; one for a double plough; two for hill side ploughs; five for cultivates; six for seed planters; one for a bog c utter; five for grain and grass cutters three for horse rakes, and two for corn shelters. The character of the inventions is somewhat local, adapting itself in each case to the wants of a section of the country only. The cultivation of the river bottoms and prairie lands of the west and southwest presents wants different from those of the rough and rocky soils of the New England States; and machines and implements well adapted to the former would be totally unfit for the latter. In this country, and especially in the newer parts, when compared with the older European States, labor is more expensive, land cheaper, and animal power easily obtained and supported. The desideratum, therefore, s seems to be labor saving machines worked by animal power, adapted more especially to bottom lands and prairies. Hence, we find the scythe and the sickle, the he, the rake, and the flail, of the New England hills, giving place to the seed planter and the harvester, the threshing machine and thecultivator of the western plains. The plough, which, previous to 1848, had been so varied in its construction as to form the basis of claims for between three and four hundred American patents, still continues to present slight modifications. But of the eleven applications patented during the year most are for minor points of invention. One of the most interesting of this class of implements is the combined plough, remarkable for its number of adjustments for the various purposes of sloughing and cultivating the soil. The instrument is susceptible of change from a combined plough into a cultivate or, and with devices for several changes even a; a cultivate or. As a combined plough, it consists of a frame work of wood for supporting the standards for the change able reversible shares or teeth, the outline of which is of a rhomboids l shape; the bottom edges of which shares' are horizontal, and the forward points of which are turned to the right or left, inward or outward, according to the direction in which the soil is to be thrown. A vertical cross section through the share gives the form of the letter S, so that, when; running in one direction, it scrapes the soil up, and when reversed back side before, its operation is to smooth it down, answering the purpose of a roller, such as used for covering planted grain. The share part has an upside down adjustment to fasten it to the standard, so that when the bottom is worn out, the share part may be inverted, and used again for the same length of time. Of used as a, gang plough, it has an adjustable land side to be attached to each share, so as to guide the plough and prevent it from running to the right 366 X. for left, as it might otherwise do. When the instrument is to be used as a cultivate or for pulverizing the soil, the land sides being removed, the teeth or shares may be set, s one inclining inward and some outward, so that the forward teeth may throw the dirt inward, for example, and the rear teeth throw it outward. When the teeth have been set to work as a cultivate or, and it is required to use the instrument as a roller, or as a substitute for the harrow, for covering in or pressing down the grain, the tongue is reversed, and the instrument becomes a substitute for the roller. Although this instrument possesses a great variety of changes and adjustments, only a limited claim could be granted for it. A minor improvement has been added to the plough for sloughing among corn, which consists of a common plough having across beam fastened near the forward end of the beam, and twocultivator teeth projecting downward from the ends of the crossbeam, for the purpose of tearing up and loosening the soil. Between this cross beam and the plough, and partly over the anterior part of the mould board, and in a direction oblique to the line of the furrow, there is arranged a strip of wood or metal called a guard, the object of which is to prevent the large masses of earth thrown up by the plough from falling upon the young plants. This furrow guard is so elevated as to be above the ordinary level of a small furrow, and its chief merit seems to consist in its adaptation to sloughing among corn while the plants are so small as to be liable to be covered up by the ordinary plough, when used without such protection. Cultivatorsfive patents have been granted for cultivates; but no prominent new feature or combination of features has been presented, if we except, perhaps, a single case, in which a kind of crank axle is so arranged as to elevate and depress the teeth of the instrument to any given depth in the soil. For the accomplishment of this purpose, at each side of the dultivator frame the axle tree is bent twice at right angles, forming a crank on each side of the frame, and between it and the wheels. By the semi rotation or vibration of the said crank axle, by means of a lever over the frame moving in a vertical arc and alongside of a disk piece of metal provided with holes and pin, the teeth of the cultivate or are set to any depth in the ground by turning the lever, or when not required to cultivate, as in returning from, or going to, the field, the teeth are raised quite above the ground. Need planters Six instruments of this description have been patented in my division. These are all for minor points of improvement. One contains a kind of skeleton frame. going immediately before the seed dropping apparatus to prevent clouds from falling upon the planted grain, but to allow the fine dirt to pass through. Another has a device for striking a bell at each deposit of the seed in the hill. Another still accomplished the same purpose and gives the signal of the time of dropping the grain by the rotation of a hand or x. a. 67 pointer over the figures on a dial plate, which figures correspond to the holes through which the grain is dropped. Harvesting . Machinesfive instruments arranged under this head have been patented; some designed to cut grain only, others to cut grain and grass, and others to cut, collect, and deposit in bundles or bunches ready for binding the cut grain One of these machines possesses two somewhat novel devices as applied to such purposes. The first is designed to give horizontal movement across a platform with a rotary rake, so as to take the grain cut by the sickles or any other cutters to the back part of the platform for the purpose of binding it. This device will be readily understood by supposing a rotating rake suspended horizontally over the middle part of the platform of an ordinary reaping machine, and so arranged as, while the machine is moving forward, the rake by rotation first sweeps the standing grain against the cutters, and when severed by them, it is still carried backward to the rear of the platform where it is delivered ready to be bound in bundles. To give the rake a horizontal motion from the front to the rear of the platform, it is necessary that the rake head, which is attached by p end ant arms to the rotating axle, should be somewhat elevated in the central part of its sweep across the platform. To accomplish this elevation the pen went arms are made to slide in the axle just sufficient to allow of the required elevation, and on each end of the rake head is fitted a wooden roller, which runs on a horizontal guide rail, by means of which the teeth are kept just above the platform and have a horizontal movement. To secure a rapid motion in the rake head in the first part of its sweep and drive the tops of the grain against the cutters, and to diminish the said movement near the end of the sweep, and thus avoid throwing the grain too far over the platform, it was necessary that the hearing should be so arranged as to accomplish both under one. The device for this purpose consists of two eccentric opinions, one an ellipse on the rotating axle of the rake, and the other circular, a little smaller, with its axle a little on one side of the centre, so that the cogs of its longest radius shall mesh into those of the shortest in the el lip tic opinion. By this arrangement is secured an alternate slow and rapid movement twice in the complete revolution of the rake. Horse rakes Three patents have been granted, only one of which claims special notice. The improvement in this machine consists in the device for the independent movement of each tooth so that, if the rake should meet with obstructions, so many of the teeth only as are involved in the obstruction would be elevated and ride over it, while the rest. would retain their position upon the ground. The design of this rake is executed by so constructing it that each rake tooth has a o handle or arm of suitable length, through the end of which a hole is bored horizontally, and through the hole a rod of proper size and strength is thrust. To s tt up a horse rake of the desired dimensions, a light pair o, 68 X. wheels and axle tree are provided, and a sufficient number of the rake teeth and handles are strong upon te rod above named, which rod is placed horizontally over the axle tree and acts as a hinge joint to all the rakes, the teeth of which rest on the ground behind the wheels. The use and application of this machine in rough and irregular ground is obvious to all who inspect it. Worn shellersOnly two patents have been granted under this head. Worn shelters have usually been constructed in one of three modes: in the first, the shelling is performed on the periphery of a cylinder; in the second, it is done on the sides (one or both) of a wheel; and in the third, it is done by forcing by means of a mallet or hammer the cob surrounded by the corn through a hole sufficiently large to admit the cob only. The sides of this hole are called th'e strippers, and are often arranged in radial sectional pieces of four, six, or eight, each acting concentrically against the corn or cob by the force of a spring or some substitute; behind. To this last kind of corn shelters there have been raised several objections, the most prominent of which is, that in the opening of the radial sections by stripping the corn from the cob the kernelsoften become entangled and wedged between the radial sections, and prevent some one or more of the sectional pieces from acting upon the rows of corn to which it may be opposite. To obviate' this difficulty is the design of one of the patents now granted. The device consists in so arranging four strips of metal in the form of the cross and acting concentrically, that where the strips meet around the hole they shall so overlap each other as to prevent the occurrence of any space between them for the lodgment of corn. Each strip is, as usual, pressed against the corn by a spring on the periphery of the disk or table. Dog cutters Only or ne instrument of this kind has been patented in my division. The device claimed is for a minor improvement. Chemistryunder this head 14 applications have been patentee and 24 rejected. Although no great discovery has characterized 'this branch of science during the past year, yet several of the improvements herein contained involve matters of considerable interest in the arts, and indicate the onward progress of knowledge. The' applications in this class that have been patented are distributed throughout a large range of the arts. Nothing of hemp, manufacture of alkaline chromatic, slate pencils, I indian rubber, buckwheat seizing, vinegar, fish blue, klux for reducing ores, and a metallic allow, are the principal subjects. Hemp rotating apparatus one increasing demand of this article for many years has led to various devices for rotating and otherwise preparing it for the market. Several devices have been patented in former years for processes of rotating the hemp, some claiming the temperature alone, some x. a. 69 claiming the use of warm water, others water from the temperature of 600 to 120. The subject of the present patent is an apparatus the design of a which is both to shorten the process and diminish the expense of the manufacture by heating, rotating, and drying, by a single fire, and by arranging the rotating and drying apartments side by side, so that the hemp as soon as rotted can be moved forward to the drying room, where the process is finished and the article prepared for the break. For the accomplishment of this purpose, a suitable fire grate, surrounded with a coil of hot air pipe, is set upon one side of the rotating room, and the drying room on the other side the three being in a line. The hot air pipe commences at the furnace and leads off horizontally through the lower portion of the rotating room and terminates in the lower part of the drying room, where the heated air is discharged, and where ascending through the loosely packed hemp in a gentle current carries off the moisture rapidly, and soon dries the article, and thus renders it fit for breaking. The rotating room is made to perform its part of the process asfollowsThe lower portion through which the hot air pipes pass is made water tight and supplied with water, which is heated by the pipes to the desired temperature for promoting the fermenting process. The hemp is placed upon a grating a little above the vats, where the moist air and steam together act upon it, hastening the decomposition of the nitrogen compoundscid127To regulate the temperature and keep it within the limits required, a small, vertically placed iron cylinder, open at top, is set oh the grating in the middle of the rotating room, with a piston rising upwards, and so connected with the damper of the furnace and stop cocks of the hot air pipes, by means of levers and cords, as to control the combustion and the amount of hot air delivered through the pipes, and keep the it at a uniform temperature. A fellows or fan b lower is used to keep up a sufficient supply of hot air from the furnace. Manufacture of Alkaline Chromatesthat is, the chromatic of potash and soda, by exposing the sulphates and m urate of those alkalies, respectively, with what is called ch rome ore, (a mixture of the oxide of ch rome and the oxide of iron) at a red heat, in an atmosphere of air and steam, by which process the oxide of ch rome receives additional oxygen, converting it to chromic acid and which then by its superior affinity unites with the alkaline base and forms a ch rotate of potash or ch rotate of soda, according to th.ekind of salt used. To render this subject perfectly plain and intelligible, it is necessary to refer to a discovery made by the same gentleman, and noticed in the report of 1847. It was there referred to as the discovery of an American citizen, then residing in England. The discovery alluded to is the power of steam in a current to take up and carry away the acids of certain salts when brought 70 X. into contact with them at a strong red heat, as in passing over them, or in forcing its way through them. Thus, if a current of steam be forced through fragments of plaster of Paris, (sulphate of lime) at a heat just below that at which the material would melt down, the acid will be de composed, and the sulphur out acid might be condensed and converted again to sulphuric acid, as in the ordinary sulphuric acid chamber. Again, if a muriateas the m urate of potash, or of soda is to be de composed, it is heated so as to be converted to vapor, and while, in this state, and mingled with steam at the same temperature, it is forced through a cylinder filled with fragments of alum in a, also at a high red heat when the acid escapes through the mass, and the all ali, whether it be potash or soda, combines with the alum in a and may be easily separated. Thus the play of affinityes is modified in almost every compound submitted to the agency of steam at a high heat. The case under consideration in the present report is one in which a new play of affinity is introduced, and a new process of manufacture, by the agency of steam brought into contact with the materials at a high temperature. In the common method of the manufacture of alkaline chromatic, especially chromatic of potash, which are generally used, the process consists in first roasting the ch rome ore with notre in a reverberatory furnace, by which the oxygen of the nitric acid is transferred to the oxide of ch rome, converting it to chromic acid, which acid immediately unites with the potash, forming the ch rotate of potash. In the new process claimed steam is brought in as an element of the process; and the oxygen required to convert the chromic oxide into chromic acid is obtained from the atmosphere, instead of the notre used in the old process. The inventor is enabled in his process to dispense with the notre, an expensive salt, and substitute a cheap material, such as the m urate or sulphate of potash, in the manufacture. The process is deemed so important to the arts, and the specification presented in language so concise, that I give the principal part of it in the words of the inventor: "by invention consists in using as the source of the all ali in the manufacture of the chromatic certain salts, which contain it in combination with an acid' so powerful as not to be destroyed by heat, but which, by the use of certain substances to combine with or carry off their acids, will leave the all ali free to unite with the chromic acid produced from the ch rome ore The salts which I employ are the sulphates and m urates of potash and of soda, the delicate of potash, and the sulphates andmuriates of baryta and strontia. The substances I use to combine with and carry off the respective acids of the several salts, are steam and lime in the case of the sulphates and m urates of potash and soda, lime in the case of the delicate of potash, and steam in that of the sulphates and m urates of baryta and strontiaoEx. a. 71 When the sulphate or m urate of potash or of soda is to be used, I mix intimately one part, by weight, of ch rome ore with two parts of the sulphate or m urate and two parts of lime, all in fine powder, and expose the mixture to a red heat for eighteen or twenty hours on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace, while currents of heated steam are thrown upon in surface from pipes coming through the root of the furnace. The atmosphere in the furnace must be always kept in an oxidising state by the admission of a sufficient quantity of air through openings above the level of the fuel, and the charge should be frequently stirred to expose fresh surfaces to the steam and air. The lime is not absolutely required in the above mixture, as the ch rotate will be produced by the action, at a high temperature, of steam upon a mixture of ch rome ore and the sulphate or m urate of potash, or of soda alone; but 1 prefer to add the lime, as it aids the action by combining with the impure ties of the ore, and also renders the charge more porous. It is already known that a ch rotate can be produced by heating together ch rome ore, sulphate of potash or of soda, and lime, without the use of steam; in which case the sulphuric acid of the sulphate forms a combination with the lime, which is troublesome in the subsequent extraction of the so ruble ch rotate; but when steam is employed as above described this acid is vol utilized and carried off during thecalcination. When the charge is found by the usual tests to contain a sufficient quantity of the alkaline ch rotate it is withdrawn, and the so ruble part extracted by water in the usual way. When the m urates of potash and of soda are employed, as they are volatile, at high heat, a portion of them will be carried off with the gases of the fire' When it is desired to avoid loss from this source, the product of combustion should be passed through suitable condensers before escaping into the atmosphere. To obtain chromatefrom the delicate of potash I use the native double delicate of potash and alum in a, or common potash fields par, and I prefer that which contains the largest proportion of potash. One part, by weight, of ch rome ore is intimately mixed with four pats of fields par and four of lime, or an equivalent quantity of the carbonate of lime, all in fine powder. The mixture is spread on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace and kept at a bright red heat for eighteen or twenty hours, and stirred frequently, so that all parts may be equally exposed to beat and air. An oxidising atmosphere is press ved by the admission of sufficient air into the furnace. The heat should not be permitted to rise high enough to cause even incipientfusion in the charge, which should be kept in a porous state. When an examination of the charge in the usual manner shows that it contains the proper quantity of alkaline ch rotate it is withdrawn from the furnace and lixiviated with water, as in the common process." When I can procure a limestone sufficiently plastic to make a ball of the mixture hard enough to stand burning in a kill, without crushing and choking the draught, I prefer that mode of calcis nation as more economical. For this purpose I use a kill of separate72Ex. lateral fires, so that the fuel is kept from touching the charge and yet the products of combustion pass through it: "the materials made up with water into balls of three or four inches in diameter, and dried, are placed in the body of the kill and withdrawn from below when sufficiently fired: as in the reverberatory furnace, care must, be taken to preserve an oxidising atmosphere, and to prevent the charge from fusing by too high a heat. To obtain the chromatic of baryta and strontia from the sulphates and m urates of those bases, I mix the ch rome ore with double its weight of the sulphate or m urate, all in fine powder, and expose them on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace to a high heat and a current of steam, as before described for the sulphate of potash. A high red heat will be found advantageous in treating the salts, of baryta and strontia. The ch rotate of baryta or ofstrontia thus produced will be mixed with the residual under composed ore and sulphate or m urate, and may be used as a source of chromic acid have thus fully described the nature of my said invention, but do not confine my claim to any particular form of apparatus, or mode of working, or proportion of ingredients; but what I claim is making the chromatic of potash and soda, by exposing a mixture of sulphate or m urate of those alkalies, respectively, with ch rome ore, either with or without lime, at a red heat, to a current of steam and an oxidising atmosphere. I do not claim makingchromates of potash and of soda by heating together the sulphate of potash or soda, ch rome ore and lime, without the use of steam no  also claim making the ch rotate of potash by heating to redness a mixture of potash fields par, lime, or its carbonate, and ch rome ore, in an oxidising atmosphere. I also claim making chromatic of baryta and strontia, by exposing a mixture of the sulphates or m urates of those bases, respectively, with ch rome ore, at a high heat, to a current of steam and an oxidising atmosphere. Composition for slate pencils his invention is a valuable improvement on the article in general use for this purpose. It sheds a sufficient amount of the material to give a clear white trace on a slate of the ordinary kind, is sufficiently soft to make its marks with no more sound than accompanies the writing of an ordinary lead pencil upon paper, and is a valuable addition to that branch of the arts. It consists of a mixture of equal parts of pure fine clay or alum in a, and of French chalk or pulverized soap stone in combination with water sufficient to make into a stiff mortar or cement, which is forced through apertures of the proper size for slate pencils which are cut into convenient lengths and dried, and subsequently baked in a kill to the proper degree of hardness. Composition and process claimed. Elastic I india rubber cloth, designed as a substitute for the ordinary stirred I india rubber goods t is prepared in the following manner: A muslin of cotton, or any other texture, is stretched on a suitable frame in a direction diagonally between that of the warp and woof, so as to give the diamond form to ax. square piece of goods. While the cloth is strained on the frame, in the manner stated, I india rubber threads or sheets, free from tension and covered on both sides with a cement or solution of I india rubber, are laid upon the cloth, also diagonally, but in a direction parallel with the shortest diagonal of the diamond. Having placed the rubber in its position upon the strained texture another piece of muslin of the same form and size, and stretched in the same direction, is placed over' the rubber threads or sheets, so as exactly to cover the lower piece of goods the whole is now firmly compressed into one fabric, so that the cloth on both sides of the rubber shall touch it in every part, and the cloths shall touch each other at the intervals between, the strips of gum or rubber whenever it be laid in strips. The materials being put together in the manner stated, the cloth in the direction of the rubber strips will be capable of elongation sufficiently for the rubber, in drawing it back to give it all the elasticity required for any purpose whatever. The inventor claims the process of preparing the cloth and placing the rubber obliquely between the thicknesses as described. New composition in the manufacture of I india rubber goods The invention consists in the mixing and duly incorporating with the rubber while in the plastic state a given quantity of some salt of zinc, or combination of zinc, as the carbonate, sulphate, or oxide, with sulphur. The inventors prefer the native carbonate (lapiscalaminaris) and give the following proportions as the bestCaoutchouc dissolved, 56 pounds, and gradually add with heat carbonate of zinc, 56 pounds, and flowers of sulphur, 3 pounds 8 ounces. Claims the use of carbonate, and other salts of zinc, with sulphur as described. Buckwheat seizing for yarns n tended as a substitute for the wheat flour size used in the manufacture of cotton goods. The following is the mode of preparation: I n to an open tube, of the capacity of seventy gallons, one hundred pounds of buckwheat meal are put and forty gallons of water at the temperature of 1300Fahrenheit are added. 'the room is to be maintained at the temperature of 800 or 90 for seven or eight days, or until the compound is sufficiently fermented. In the meantime the mingled ran and glum ten which rise to the surface are to be removed by a summer; 'and at the end of the ferment at ion the clear water is decanter or drawn off by means of a spoon and the g luminous mass is left in the bottom of the vessel. Sufficient clean water is now to be added to enable the material to pass through a fine wire si eve into another tube, where it is to remain two days for the solid matter to have time to settle to the bottom. Again skin off the impure ties and decent the clear water as before. Dissolve eight ounces of super carbonate of soda in one gallon of water and add the solution to the g luminous mass and mix thoroughly, and transfer the whole to a suitable boiling vessel, adding al the same time sufficient water to make in all 140 g allons. The boiling is recommended to be done in the same manner as that in common use for boiling starch. The contents are 74 X. brought to the boiling point as soon as possible, and thoroughly agitated during the operation. The boiling once commenced is continued slowly for about three hours, when the contents are drawn off into tubs holding about seventy gallons each, and when cooled to the temperature of the atmosphere is fit for use. Claims the composition and process as described. Material to be used in the warm blue, or past el vat his constitutes a part of the operation of dyeing by indigo. To explain the use of the material which is claimed, it is proper to state that indigo is insoluble in mostmenstrua, and in order to bring it into a state suitable for its use as a dye, a preliminary process is required. This is effected either by exposing it to the action of bodies having a superior affinity for oxygen as certain metals and metallic oxides; or, secondly, by mixing it with some organic matters containing sugar, mucin age, and other ferment able materials or, thirdly, by subjecting it to the solvent power of sulphuric acid. In acting on the indigo according to the second process, the fermenting materials generally used are word, prepared by ferment at ion or merely dried and br an of wheat. The inventor proposes to substitute, as the fermenting material, the young shoots of the common carrot and of the par s nip, prepared in the following manner: To prepare a vat, take of the stems and leaves of the common par s nip or carrot, or the young sprouts of the same, 4,480 pounds and pass them through a crushing machine, or otherwise reduce them to a high .degree of, comminution, and throw them into a heap upon a suitable floor in a warm room and stirring the mass thoroughly once a day by a spade or any other suitable instrument for three weeks or until fe lamentation has taken place throughout the entire mass. Next add a pint and a half of all ali, (or a pint and a half of a combination of fifteen parts of lime to one of sal ammonia c) to every two hundred pounds of the material, and thoroughly incorporate it with the mass, and occasionally work it over until the acid ferment at ion has become neutralised. The compound is then fit for use, but continues to improve by age for some time. The inventor states .that he does not always intend to employ the all ali, in the exact proportions named, although they are well adapted when it is desired to shorten the time of preparation of the materials. But he believes that, when a very long time may be allowed to the mass to lie exposed to the air and suitable warmth, the all ali may be dispersed With altogether. Claims the composition, material, and the process as set forth. Manufacture of I chthyocolla or fish glued his manufacture is chiefly confined to the eastern parts of Massachusetts and the neighboring coast, and constitutes one of the products of the cod fishery; the sounds of this and some other species are made into what is called ribbon blue. The process is as follows: The sounds duly separated from other parts are soaked or moistened with water, and reduced by suitable means, as chopping, and beating to a proper consistence, are run through rollers and drawn out into long ribbons or strips, and sub x. 
75sequently dried for the market. In running this material through the rollers, it is found, where the work is done on a large scale, that both the material and the rollers become heated, and the present invention consists in an ingenious device of hollow rollers so arranged and connected by hollow journals and pipes that a current of cold water is kept circulating through the rollers, having its entrance and exit on the same side of the machine, by which the material is kept cool during the operation of manufacture. The inventor claims the several devices in combination. Manufacture and refining of lamp black and of colophaneTheinvention claimed is an apparatus for the manufacture of lamp black, of colophane, and for refining lamp black all in one, the main features of which consist in a horizontal cylindrical cast or wrought iron retort, arranged in a furnace with a funnel and feed pipe for the melted resin at one end, and a corresponding discharge pipe for the gas generated at the other. I immediately under the discharge pipe and through the bottom of the cylinder, there passes out a pipe vertically downwards for the discharge of the un consumed resin, called colophane, or colophany, which pipe dips into a reservoir of the same material and prevents the passing out of any gas through the colophane pipe. The lamp black is prepared by burning the gas issuing from the discharge pipe from several burneds placed within the first of a series of vertical flies, supplied with a limited quantity of air. The flies stand side by side, and are so constructed and arranged that the draught ascends the first blue, descends the second, ascends the third, descends the fourth, and, ascending the fifth, passes out at the top of the chimney. I immediately over the row of burned sin the first f e is arranged a metallic cylinder, with convenient doors for opening and closing on the outside, which cylinder is designed for refining the product collected from the several flies, by heating it sufficiently to drive off all the volatile matters it may have absorbed during its condensation. Manufacture of Vinegarthe chief point in the invention in this case consists in the application of a material in the manufacture of vinegar not hitherto used for such purposes. The substance claimed is the s will grains or the exhausted liquor of distilleries. In all operations conducted in the large way, and especially where there are chemical processes depending on affinity, and that again on slight changes, such as strength of the materials, temperature, and other modifying causes, the chemical changes of one stage of the process are rarely completed before another is commenced; and thus more or less material is necessarily lost in all great manufacturing establishments. Thus in distilleries which to be profitable must be conducted on the large way, the ferment at ion of the grain, in order to save the largest amount of alcoholic liquid, is disturbed before the process of ferment at ion is completed, and consequently a portion of sugar, of starch, and of doctrine, are left in the waste liquor or s will after dis tilling off the alcohol, which if allowed to ferment again by a moderate temperature, will soon run into the ace tic ferment at ion and vinegar will be produced. Hitherto the 76 X. Doc. No. 9.swill has been used only for feeding cows and swine; the inventor however, availing himself of the new German, or quick process of making vinegar, has been enabled by devices for separating the solid matters which would otherwise c log the apparatus and impede the process, to convert the s will into a pass able vinegar that may, be used in the manufacture of white lead, sugar of lead, Paris green, and in other salts called acetatis. The merit of the invention is believed to consist in the several devices for clearing the liquid from the sediment, by means of subsiding vessels, having at different elevations a series of cocks for drawing off the clear liquid, and then filtering it upwards through a suitable filtering material and in a suitable tube for the purpose. When the material has been run through the filter, it is ready to be subjected to the common operation of manufacturing vinegar from a mixture of whiskey and water, by allowing it to trickle through cases of shavings suitably arranged for the purpose. Weather, and articles manufactured from it 11 patents have been granted, and 14 applications rejected. Of the patents granted in this class, three are for riding saddles, two for harness saddles, two for harness buckles, one for a bridle, one for a boot tree, one for begging shoes, and one for a boot crime. With the exception of the last two named, the patents were granted for minor improvements which require no special notice. The boot begging machine, above referred to, contains several ingenious devices, some of which are believed to be entirely new, and others, though not new in themselves, are new in boot begging machines. The invention requires some notice; and yet, from the complication of the machine, I can hardly hope to convey an accurate idea of all its parts. In its outline it consists of a rectangular frame, the movements of the parts within are driven by the connexion of a driving pulley at one end of the machine with any suitable power. The boot or shoe, with its sole upwards, is placed horizontally and length wise in the central parts of the machine. The devices for the accomplishment of the work, are chiefly four: First, a charge r to hold and deliver the pegs one at a time to be driven into the sole; second, the guide tube to receive the pegs from the charge r, and enter their points into the sole; third, the awl and punch, one for making the hole, and the other for driving home the peg; fourth, the guide movement of the sole to give a new position of the last for each peg that is driven. The charge r consists of a disk of metal with a flat rim, the whole having the appearance of the cover to a common pill box, and having within a spiral strip of metal coiled up like the main spring of a watch, with one end made fast at the centre, and the other at the circumference. The space between the several strips, coiled upon themselves and forming a continuous passage from the centre to the circumference, constitute the reservoir of the charge r, which, at the commencement of the operation of begging a sole, is filled with pegs; and these are delivered as they are required at the circumference, by means of a little metallic finger or pus her, which x. starts at the centre, and, following around the spiral channel, drives the pegs before it, so that as fast as one is delivered or handed over to the guide tube another takes its place. The charge r is placed on its edge directly, over the sole, and rotated on an axis which runs parallel with the length of the machine. The construction of the guide tube may be understood by supposing a steel wire, a little larger than the ordinary knitting needle wire, laid across the frame just under the, charge r, and capable of vibrating or rotating backward and forward a quarter of a circle, and having a horizontal hole through its middle, just large enough to receive a peg split to the exact size. While the hole of the guide tube is horizontal, the pus her of the charge r throws forward a peg that enters it, when the guide tube rotate for vibrated a quarter of a circle, and brings the peg with its point, downwards vertically over the hole just made for it by the awl in the sole, when the punch comes down from above and drives it home. The devices for making the holes and driving the pegs, consist in two vertical rods passing through guide s lots in a horizontal cross bar, and moving with a vertical motion. One of these rods, sharpened at the point, makes the hole in the leather, and while rising the guide tube presents the peg with its point over the hole, and the other rod with a square face upon its end, comes down upon the peg and drives it home. Both the rods are worked by levers moved by came on the main or driving shaft. The device for moving the last or sole, so that every part of its surface may be brought under the awl and punch successively, is the same: that used in machines for turning irregular bodies, in which a pattern on one end of a lever guides the motions of the last or sole on the other end. A patent has been granted for the combination of devices forcrimping boots, in which the combination of the screw and inclined plane with segment al sliding pieces along the back and bottom of the form, enable the operator to strain the leather of the fore part of the boot in a backward and downward direction very forcibly, and yet with comparative ease to himself. The application of the inclined plane may be understood by supposing the boot form to stand in the natural position of the foot upon the floor, having the back in a piece separate from the front, and the parts in contact between the back and front being inclined planes running from the front backwards and downwards at an angle of 45 degrees, so that by forcing the back piece downward by means of a thumb screw on the top of the back piece, to which is confined on both of its sides the leather to be cramped, the back piece is made to ride out backward and downward on the inclined planes, and thus the leather becomes sufficiently strained to bring the upper of the boot into its proper form. The bottom part of the foot has also the same arrangement of inclined plane, and is connected with the back piece of the leg at the heel by means of joint, so that when- the back piece is thrown downwards and out x. wards, the bottom piece of the foot, to which the upper over the foot and ankle are attached, is also drawn downward and backward. Thus, by merely turning a thumb screw at the top of the form, the whole work of c limping is performed. The inventor claims the combination of the several devices referred to. Household Furniturefourteen patents have been granted and twelve rejected. The subjects of the patents are considerably diversified. embracing refrigerators, window curtain fastening, cracker machines, extension tables, book safes, knife polisheds, plaiting machines, sausage suffers, and smoothing irons; only three or four of which require particular notice. A cracker machine has been patented having a novel contrivance for clearing the scraps from the cut dough, by means of an extra endless apron which projects under the cutters at the proper time and receives the dough cut and pricked ready for the oven, and by a reverse motion carries it away to be delivered to the baker. The main or principal endless apron receives the dough from the kneading rollers and carries it forward to the other end of the machine, where the cutters are. The cutters are of a circular form, and have a novel contrivance within for the purpose of retaining the dough when cut until the extra endless apron, which lies outside of the machine, is thrown forward under the cutters to receive it. The cutters are made of thin cylinders of steel with a cutting edge at the bottom, and having within an air tight piston working with packing, and armed on its bottom with the necessary sharp points for pricking the crackeds. The design of the pistons working air tight is that the biscuit or cracker, when cut, should not fall out of the c utter until the extra apron is presented to receive it. This effect is accomplished on the principle of a partial vacuum within, aided by the external atmospheric pressure. The piston being drawn up while the cut dough covers the whole inner space of the cutters, the dough so cut is sustained within the c utter by the pressure of the atmosphere without, until the proper time, when a little pus her comes down upon the cut dough and forces it out upon the extra endless apron before mentioned. Smoothing I rose patent has been granted to a lady for an improved form of this instrument, on which both sexes so much depend for personal neatness. The merits of the invention consist in so forming the instrument as to present the greatest variety of surfaces that may be required to "iron" articles of wearing apparel, and is, at the same time, easily managed by the operator. Some idea of the shape of this article may be obtained by supposing the metal of which the "iron" is made, while in a plastic state, to be in the form of the hens egg and lying upon a smooth surface with the smaller end forward. Of now another plane surface be brought down upon the egg shaped material, so as to flatten it out to about half its original thickness, but making the posterior part thinner than the anterior, we shall have a form closely resembling the in x. instrument referred to. The anterior portion of the instrument, it will be perceived, is considerably heavier than the posterior, with the idea that the greater mass of metal will retain more heat. The upper part of the handle has also a backward slope, to aid in pushing it forward and prevent unpleasant strain upon the hand and wrist. Hearing apparel Under this head seven applications have been patented, and three rejected. In ong the former we find an instrument for shaping hats, a lock for umbrellas, a device for the manufacture of artificial flowers, a device for a fastening of pantaloons straps, a method of making razor straps, a process of manufacturing hats of gutta percha solution, and a tailors s hears. Of the devices referred to in this class only two require particular notice-one for an umbrella lock, and the other for a process in the manufacture of hats. Umbrella lock, designed for umbrellas or parasolsThis invention consists in a device to render the umbrella or para sol useless, if borrowed without consent of the owner, by a locking contrivance contained within the handle. The handle consists of two metallic tubes, one within the other the inner one of which is turned by means of a key fastened to the end of the handle, which key may be removed by un screwing, and be carried about the person when not in use. The lower end of the inner tube is closed by a metallic plate, and a small hole is made on one side of said plate, near its circumference, to receive the end of the catch spring which keeps the umbrella closed. By turning the inner tube with the key screwed on the end of the handle, the spring catch is thrown out and the umbrella is locked; or, by turning the key in the opposite direction, the catch is drawn back and permits the umbrella to be opened. The catch spring is covered by a plate on the sliding scale, so that it cannot be pressed from the outside or drawn inwards without the key. The use of gutta percha in the manufacture of hats The spirit of the invention in this case consists in the shortening of the process in the manufacture of hats by substituting the use of one article in the place of three, formerly used. The usual practice in the manufacture of hats consists in stiffening the body with shell law, and after it is dry ironing it on the block, and then coating it with a seizing of blue; and after this giving it two coat% of seed law varnish; and when dry the plush of silk, or other material, is put on and the hat finished. The imperfect sons of this manufacture are first, in order to make the hat keep its shape, it must be made heavier than would otherwise be required. Second, free perspiration in the wearer penetrate the substance of the crown and brim and gives a spotted or greasy appearance. Third, if the hat becomes wet from exposure or accident, the blue size will draw to the surface of the plush and stick the nap fast to the body of the hat, and thus injure its beauty. From both of the last two causes the plush, it is said, becomes separated from the body, and the hat becomes soft and loses its shape 80 X. a. The process consists in the use of a solution of gutta percha for stiffening the hat body, and the same material is also used for sticking the plush to the body. Claims the use of the material and the process as described. Respectfully submitted. L. D. Gale, Examiner of Patents. To man. Edmind Brake, Commissioner of Patents. H. A Synopsi Softhe Stati  Sti  Cal Of Storyof Thepatent Offi 1. Abstract of legislation in relation to patents and the Patentoffice from 1790 to 1849.2. Table exhibiting the financial history of the Patent Office from 1790 to 1849.3. Table exhibiting the progress of invention in the United States from 1790 to 1849.82 X. a. No. 1.. Abstract of legislation by Congress in relation to patents and the Patent Face from the commencement of the government to the present time. The granting of letters patent by the federal government was contemplated from its foundation. The framers of the constitution, convinced of the necessity and justice of protecting the rights of men of genius in the fruits of intellectual labor, introduced intothe first article of that instrument a clause granting power to Congress, "to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries." This clause is the foundation of the copyright laws, and of the present patent system. The power thus granted was first exercised by Congress in 1790,the third year after the signing of the constitution. By the law of April 10, 1790, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Attorney General, were constituted a board, any two of whom could grant letters patent to "any person or persons" who had "invented or discovered any useful arts" &c, or any improvement therein not before known or used." To restriction was made as to the qualifications of persons to whom patents could be granted; citizens, aliens, and foreigners were placed, in this respect, upon equal terrors. The conformity of the patent to law was to be certified by the Attorney General, and the instrument was to "bear test" by the President of the United States. The record was to be kept in the office of the Secretary of State, and the model and drawing to be deposited there. The fees required were small; no oath was necessary, and no examination, in the present meaning of that term, as applied to patents, was had. This law was repealed by the act of February 21, 1793. The act of February 21, 1793, was more stringent in its requirements than that of 1790. It restricted the granting of patents to citizens of the United States. The Secretary of War was no longer required to act upon applications, that duty being assigned exclusively to the Secretary of State. The patent, as before, was to be certified, as to its conformity to law, by the Attorney General, and to "bear test" by the President. The applicant was required to swear or affirm" that he believed himself to be "the true inventor or discovered" and to file his specification, drawings, &c, in the office of the Secretary of State. The right of assignment was given to inventors, a forfeiture imposed for using patented invention six. a. 83 without leave, and the sum of thirty dollars made the uniform fee in all cases. An act supplementary to this act was approved June 7, 1794,roviding for the revival of suits under the law of 1790, "which may have been set aside, suspended, or a bated by reason of the repeal of the said act The law of April 17, 1800, extended the privilege of obtaining patents to aliens "who, at the time of petitioning, shall have resided for two years within the United States" provided such petitioner made oath that the invention had not "been known or used in this or any foreign country? The privilege was also granted by this law to the legal representatives of a deceased inventor. The act of February 15, 1819, gave to the circuit courts of the United States original cognizance in equity, and at law, in controversies respecting the right to inventions and. writings, and provided an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States "in the same manner and under the, same circumstances as is now (then provided by law in other judgments and decrees of such circuitcourtsBy the act of July 3, 1832, provision is made for the renewal, extension, and re issuing of patents, and the forms of proceeding in these cases prescribed. And in case of the death of the inventor or any assignment made by him of the same patent, the right, in these cases, was vested in his executors, and administrators or as signs. The privilege of obtaining patents which had been given to aliens by the law of 1790, denied to them by the law of 1793, and restored to them by that of 1800, was still further extended by the act of July 13, 1832. Residence in the United States at the time of making application, and a declaration of intention to become a citizen, were the only conditions required to place an alien on a level with citizens of the country. But the patent was to be void unless the invention were introduced into general use in one year from its date, and if the patentee failed to fulfil his declared intention of becoming a citizen of the United States. Hitherto the duty of granting letters patent had been assigned to the Secretary of State, either alone or in conjunction with the Secretary of War; and the incidental business connected with them confided to a subordinate clerk ship in the State Department. I n 1821, the clerk having charge of it received, by courtesy, the title of Superintendent of the Patent Office, and his salary was fixed at fifteen hundred dollars; but the office, by that title, was first recognized by law, and made the object of a special appropriation, in April, 1830 The amount of business connected with patents had vastly increased, and soon demanded more liberal provision for its transaction. By the law of July 4, 1836, the Patent Office was erected into a separate bureau, and the appointment of a Commissioner of Patents provided for. The office, as organized by this law, consisted, in addition to the commissioner, of a chief clerk, an examiner, three subordinate clerks, (one of whom must be a84Ex. Doc: No. 59.competent draughts man) and a messenger. These officers were required to be sworn, and the commissioner and chief clerk to give bond. A special seal was provided. One patents issued were required to be under the seal of the office, signed by the Secretary of State, and counter signed by the Commissioner of Patents. The details of organization as prescribed by this law are substantially those under which the office is at present conducted. Perhaps the most important feature of this law is that which relates to the examination to which applications are required to be subjected. Prior to its passage the examinations consisted merely in a comparison of the specification, drawings and model, to ascertain that they agreed together and with the claim made; but the law of 1836 required the examination to enter into the questions of novelty, utility, and priority of invention a provision which largely added to the labors and responsibility of the office. To facilitate the discharge of these duties, a library was provided for. Since the enactment of the law of July 4, 1836, other acts have been passed regulating the details of the organization and business of the Patent Office. An additional examiner, and the employment of temporary clerks, were provided for by the act of March 3, 1837, which also required the commissioner to report annually to Congress. The appointment of two assistant examiners, and the collection of agricultural statistics, were authorized by the law of March 3, 1839. The right to patent designs was granted by the act of August 29, 1842. These laws also define the rights of patentees, prescribe the necessary forms of proceeding in procuring a patent, provide for the adjudication of conflicting claims, and impose penalties for infringements of patent rights. Notwithstanding the additions thus frequently made to the force of the office, it found itself unable to transact its rapidly increasing business, and obliged to apply to Congress for additional aid. His was granted by the law passed at the last session of Congress, which made provision for two additional examiners, two assistant examiners, and two engrossing clerks. The officers of the Patent Office, as now constituted, are as follows Commissioner, Chief clerk 4 examiners 4 assistant examiners, Draughts man, Machinist5 salaries clerks 4 temporary clerks, Messenger. The following persons have been at the head of the Patentoffice, from 1821, when 94 x. a. Remarks Of The Tabular Esti  Mate. In presenting again the estimates of the principal crops of our country, and before entering upon the history of their progress, there are some general remarks which claim our attention. Heretofore, for the sake of comparison, uniformity of arrangement has been attempted. This course, while it possesses its advantages, is likewise attended with some serious defects, and it is believed that a modification of the former method may be useful. It is proposed therefore, now to adopt, a plan which, though in the main agreeing with that of the previous reports, may still possess certain new features. A right conception of the object in view is important at the outset, and a few remarks on this point are the more so, as it would seem very mistaken views have been entertained by individuals on this subject. The old maxim is a good one, that "none can compass more than they intend" and for want of observing this in their judgments, or rather from a want of clearly apprehend ing the design by which the mind has been led, undeserved censures have been put forth on the result of these labors, that a more accurate discrimination would, no doubt, have spared. There are two principal objects which an agricultural report should aim at the accumulation and suitable arrangements of facts, and the illustration of their true bearing on the prosperity of our country. I n the prosecution of such a design, it is important to notice the progress of the principal 'crops, improvements in cultivation, and to furnish an abstract of the most useful and interesting facts, relating to the science and practice of agriculture. In other words, an agricultural report should embody a yearly summary of the condition of the staple crops and their cultivation, and of collateral branches of agricultural industry in our own country, together with a condensed view, so far as practicable, of the chief advances made in the science and practice of agriculture in foreign lands. Agriculture, by the ablest writers on the subject, is now made to embrace not merely the actual practice or tillage of the soil, but it comprises the doctrine of the nutrition of plants, the raising of stock of all kinds, the mutual relations of this branch of industry to others, as developing the wealth there is in the soil, and the applied care and labor by which its *fertility is brought out and directed to the welfare of mankind. It is in this extensive sense the agricultural report which emanated from the Patent Office, where are centred the records of the various improvements in the sciences and arts, should be attempted. While it should lay hold of every real acquisition at command which science gathers from its wide field to prof for to the husband man, and, as far as possible, place it within its reach, it should likewise reap a rich and varied harvest from the experience and treasured facts of practical men of good judgment in every part of our land. Hints and suggestions, or more enlarged description of methods of tillage and their red x. 
95Sults; the opinions and arguments of those observers, within their own limited sphere, whose good sense entitle them to be heard, and who yet otherwise might never favor the public with their views, may most appropriately find a place in the pages of such a document. It is by comparison that truth is elicited. Thebaconian mode of induction of facts is one of great importance in a subject so closely affecting, as does agriculture, the lives, health and prosperity of a nation. The question of the influence of the great staple products of our country on the world, is one which would admit of most interesting development; and it is one, too, which might not undeservedly command the attention of the ablest of our legislators and statesmen. It would be easy to refer to many an example by way of illustration. To instance, however, but a single one ireland who can fail to see how" closely interwoven with her agricultural position is her political one, and the bearings of her crops on the present and future state of her civil and moral freedom. To amelie ration can ever be permanent which does not reach her agricultural development. Of the <a name="potato2"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is continually diseased, and yet is successively relied on for support, it is not a free parliament or any modification of laws and political relations which can save her people from famine and want. Of course, it is not meant here to assert that the sole or chief evil lies in that cause, and that a change of agriculture alone would be a sufficient remedy, but that its influence is one which is great and ought to be regarded. It is a wise foresight which acquaints ones self with, his own resources; and the truth is equally applicable to nations as to individuals. He has been said to be a public benefactor who makes two blades of grass grow where but one grew before; and especially is this the case if he not only effects such a result, but if, at the same time, super adds increased and more valuable nutriment to both the products of the former blade, as well as of the new one. He who can plant a new terminating principle, and train forth one new shoot of kindly feeling between citizens of the same country, deserves a still higher meed of praise. It is not, it is believed, claiming too much to say that the tendency and operation of the labors and co operation demanded and encouraged in this annual summary of results in agricultural industry is of this salutary kind. From the review, year after year, of a correspondence conducted with every section of our common country, and from the expression of feelings indicated by the agriculturists with whose minds we are brought into contact, the conviction has deepened that the placing thus in juxtaposition the recorded results of the operations in this peaceful and invigorating pursuit of life, which have been collected from every section of our land, is exciting no contemptible influence to bind them together in one united aim the general weal. The agricultural element is one of vast importance to our country. This, indeed, is beginning to be more and more realized with each successive year; not only the great numbers, the large proportion of the agricultural class of the community, render it so, but also the96Ex. diversified relations and bearings sustained by those who compose it, and the products of their industry to our general prosperity as a nation. Sub tract from our resources our agricultural productions, and we at once see what a wide void is made. The true question, then, is, whit will best promote our prosperity as an agricultural nation? Without mixing up our thoughts with the different theories which are advocated in their great political bearings, there can be no doubt that the highest development of our resources in the products of the land is the great desideratum. To far as science, gathered from other fields and brought home to the knowledge and every day use of our farmers and planters, can do it, this means should be used. To far as inquiry into the condition or amount of the various articles which come into the aggregate c an aid in the object, this too is worthy of careful attention. I industry, collaterally interwoven with the direct topics of such investigations, may likewise claim to be regarded. The great difficulty in all these efforts, however, is the want of accuracy the neglect of precision on their part on whom we must rely for information. It can scarcely be imagined what an influence this exerts in these matters. Of hazard an expectation 'that such a result can be secured, except in a long course of years, if ever, would be a most idle phantasm. New have the anal y tic power, perhaps, to undertake, certainly not to devise, the processes of its execution; yet by persevering and patient study, advances may gradually be made, and means may be prepared and methods invented, by which vast accession to our knowledge on these topics may be secured. The people may thus be trained to observe and judge, not by a first conjecture, but with some reference to the elements that should have their proper weight. A system of closer approximation maybe introduced, and by its aid materials may be gathered, which, when condensed and set out in their appropriate bearings, will indicate the great results sought. It were well worth the attention of legislators in all the States, to provide the means for so noble an object. Under regulations fitted to accomplish it, every State in our Union might thus, at a moderate expense, become possessed of the knowledge of its own resources, intrinsic ally and comparatively, which it could use both to direct its own measures and to exchange for similar information from the sister States and foreign countries. Of the question were asked, what is it that is now giving these United States an increasing importance in the view of the nations of the earth? the answer is ready: It is the increasing knowledge these nations are gaining of the elements of our prosperity and the use we are making of them; they are becoming better acquainted with us. Now evident, then, the vast bearing of all collected facts relating to our resources on the influence of this country try abroad. Met the immense extent, the variety arid quality of our resources, the elements of our industry, the channels furnished for our future development, all be laid open, spread out before thevWorld, not in the spirit of self glorying, butt in the sober statement x. a. 97 of facts and reasonings on facts, and leave them to find their way to the minds and hearts of our fellow men in every c lime. Met them stand forth, if, they may, to invite investigation to prove that whatever be the risings of passion or the gush and outbreak of excited party feeling, we are mutually dependent, intertwined, and embraced, every State with its sister hood; and that with a wise foresight of our relations to each other, our motto, "E Pluribusunum~ was rightly chosen, and must ever be the watchword borne by our national eagle." Long be our fathers' temple ours, Toe to the hand by which it falls ;departed spirits "watch its towers, "while living patriots "guard its walls t may not be improper to glance back over the various labors and products of efforts connected with these reports, and, without assuming to judge from our. own convictions, to state certain facts, and leave to others to estimate the value of the results. In the course of seven years or more of these labors by this office, there have been issued from the press some 250 to 300,000volumes of reports. Now if it should be allowed that no more than one half of the whole had found their way to the people, yet, as these could scarcely have been per used in part or whole by less than 1,000,000 of readers, it cannot but be supposed that a very considerable influence has been exerted in this way on the industrial classes of the nation. The calls for the reports, and the gratification expressed at obtaining them, show that they are prized by the farmers and planters of our country. It would be in our power to produce testimonyes from many of the most intelligent among these classes in proof of this assertion. In the interior of some of the States it is a known fact that has fallen under the observation of the office, that its reports have .been leaned and read till literally almost thumbed out. Admit, then, that the expense of collecting materials and printing this document may have been equal on an average to 40 cents per copy, the whole would be some                                       $300,000 in the course of say seen years, or about                                    $40,000 per year. This estimate is placed at the very highest, and beyond all doubt far higher than the actual cost. Taking it, however, at its full extent, and can it be deemed a waste of money? To political or party bias, no sinister ends to be answered, can be charged on such an attempt to diffuse useful information. All political parties, all sections, have lent their voice in its favor, and the more so just in proportion as there has been reason to believe they have been brought within the reach of its benefits. Of from any cause they have not shared in the distribution, the office, nor the national legislature, are charge able with the fault." The information has been collected and embodied; it has been in compliance with the order spread upon the pages of Congressional documents for the use of our fellow citizens. Thousands of copies have been sent forth by this office, and by members of both branches of Congress. Copious extracts from, the most useful and interesting portions have been trans fred toZlMUM98 X. Dec. No. 59.the agricultural and other public journals, and have been read many of the suggestions embodied in these documents have been practised upon, and who that knows anything of the influence of knowledge communicated on the minds and actions of a community, can doubt that the effect has been great ?different persons will estimate this influence, whether salutary or not, according to the view from which they contemplate it. We shall content ourselves with c iting only a few testimoniesfrom persons who, both from their position as recipients of the opinions of numbers suitable to form a judgment, and also as the collectors and dispense is of various information, may be supposed to be fully competent to know, as they have, too, the candor to acknowledge, the beneficial effect of these labors. The editor of the New York Agriculturists speaks of the report for 1847 as "a very elaborate Congressional document, of some 600.pages, illustrated by several wood cuts and steel engravings. His report, we are happy to state, in our humble judgment, has been got up with more care, more ability, and has more intrinsic merit, than any other document of the kind that has preceded it. In addition to the sub reports of the examiners of patents, which relate to matters a p pertaining only to the Patent Office proper, the volume contains a vast amount of agricultural knowledge, both practical and theoretical, as well as statistical, that reflects much credit upon the industrious and talented gentleman at the head of this department, and upon those who have so ably contributed to his aid5The Cultivator, published at Albany, says: " The report for the last year is a document which reflects credit on the Commissioherof Patents, and the individuals from whom the valuable materials, of which it is composed were obtained. It forms a volume of 661 pages, comprising a greater amount of useful information than, any previous report from this department. In addition to much statistical intelligence of a general nature, in regard to the products and trade of the country, there are several original papers, on various subjects, drawn up with care and labor The Congregation al Journal, printed at Concord, New Hampshire, speaks of the report as " of great interest l and that ' great industry and intelligence have been shown in collecting the materials, and good taste and judgment in arranging them the Miles Reporter, Michigan, calls it " a truly valuable report The Cincinnati Inquirer states, that 1 it contains a mass of valuable statistical information, well arranged." 'the Boston Most says: "is a book of reference, to be kept in all public and agricultural libraries, its value must be undoubted" Now such a mass of facts, of science, and observation, could have been gathered in less than a year, amid the multifarious duties of the Patentoffice, is hard to conceive n the Washington News is the following commendation: " I t contains a mass of information which cannot be too highly estimated by all who feel interested in the prosperity and progress of our othcid127) great count rye s Condensation characterizes its pages; a tax. the same time the subjects are given with a sufficient comprehensive ness to answer all the purposes of instruction and ability5The American Farmer, a long established agricultural paper published at Baltimore, says: "besides the usual quantity of matter connected with the Patent Office, it contains many valuable articles upon the subject of agriculture, and comprises a mass of agricultural statistics of great interest to the country at large, demonstrating as they do its immense productive resources. The commissioner will accept our thanks for his very acceptable present and without intending to flatter, we may be permitted to remark that he deserves the acknowledgments of the American husbandmen as well for the matter as for the skillful arrangement of hisbookThe Tennessee Farmer, also edited by an able scientific agriculturists, gives as his opinion, that the -volume reflects credit upon the commissioner and other officers of the department from which it emanated, and is in many respects superior to any preceding report. It em bodies a vast amount of statistical information relative to the trade and products of the country together with several original papers of great value. The report has evidently been prepared with much care and labor, and a regard to accuracy. The agricultural intelligence, and statistical information c, embraced in its pages, will render the work interesting and valuable The Ohio Cultivator thus speaks of the report: " From a perusal of most of its contents, we are persuaded it will be found a work of great interest and value to the agriculturists, and especially to writers on agriculture and the kindred arts. It gives a concise and valuable summary of the condition and progress of agriculture in the several States of the. Union, with estimates of the crops, population, &c. It also contains a number of essays on important subjects which contain valuable, information, and will doubtless be widely re published. As a whole, the volume does great credit to the able Commissioner of the Patent Office, and also to Mr. E. Good rich Smith, who has the principal charge of the agricultural and statistical department, and for whose fitness for the station this report affords conclusive evidence Similar notices were contained in the, Prairie Farmer, and other agricultural papers, as well as the most prominent public journals of both political parties, but they have been unfortunately mislaidand cannot now be inserted. We may also refer to the expressions in its favor contained in many of the replies to the circular of the office, some of which will be found in appendix No. 3, besides the virtual testimony furnished in the willingness to cooperate in the object, thus shown. We have deemed the above c stations and remarks a proper reply to the attempts -which have been made by some studiously to disparage the labors of this branch of the office, and consider it justifiable to have presented thus much in our own vindication. We might, had we chosen, have said even more. A second topic which may claim some notice in this connexion, is the annual distribution of <a name="seeds6"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. It is impossible to say how many thousand packages have been distributed in the course of the100Ex. last seven years, as no precise account has been kept; but probably, were it to be put at more than 250,000, it would fall below the truth. These, too, are all included in the previous estimate of expense, as they were purchased with a fraction of each annual appropriation. Should it be admitted that not more than one half, or scarcely one third even, of those <a name="seeds7"><mark>seeds</mark></a> vegetated, yet 100,000packages of <a name="seeds8"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, many of them choice selections, and scattered in every part of the land, could not but produce some favorable results. The fact that it has been so has been averted to in the case of certain kinds introduced and approved, and the progress of which has been noticed in the former reports of this office. For the want of sufficient care in the cultivation, others may have been lost; but this again is not charge able as a fault of the office. Any species or varieties might be enumerated which have thus been distributed. It is sufficient to allude to but a few only of them. Among the rare kinds are the multi come rye, cold a, s pelt, bassano sugar be et, Oregon wheat and Oregon corn, Cuba and California tobacco, &c. We have not the means of ascertaining the influence of the introduction of these various plants on the products of the country. Would their silent bearing be accurately traced, we cannot doubt, from even isolated case- that have fallen under our observation that it would be found to be far more extended than many suppose. Some mention will be made hereafter in its place of the multi come rye, which is favorably spoken of in some parts of the country. By letter by J. Ville, Esq, of U burn, New Work, we have a statement of his success in raising the be et, &c. He says: "is to the be et, I now give you an account of what I have done, the past season. In the month of June I prepared one acre of land by maturing well, and then plowing it three times, and also by narrowing it three times, which made the land as mellow as an ash heap, as the saying is; then planted in drills 21 feet apart, so that the ground could be cultivated with a cultivate or, which was done three times; the drills were after each cultivating passed with ah oe to straighten it up, if needed, needed clean. They grew well, and have done as well and. better than I expected. When harvested they produced 1,020 bushels, which were estimated by measuring one load, and by estimating by load. This is what I call a great yield, which I am satisfied can be obtained every year with, proper attention, and perhaps considerable increase. My cattle are very fond of themes regards the English barley, I have grown it the past seasons own half an acre the past spring, which was well got in and in good order. At harvest it was kept by itself. It produced 25 bushels of good grain, which is at the rate of 50 bushels per acre, which will always make a good crop. I now use it for feeding, in order to ascertain its value for this purpose, and find it excellent feed third collateral benefit, which must not be passed over wholly unnoticed, is the collection of books on agriculture in the library of this office. Any works of tis description are highly useful tax. 101 the office, even if there were no duty imposed of making this annual agricultural report. But there are others, also, which are more closely connected with these particular labors. Works of great{ merit have thus been gathered at a very moderate expense in various languages, which are believed to be the sole copies found in this country. The ablest writers on agriculture. of Germany and France, thus contribute the results of their laborious lives, as well as the best authors on these subjects in England and Scotland. Such pains has been taken to make the collection a really choice one; and it is believed that, for the number of volumes on these subjects, it is by far a more valuable collection than is to be found in any library in the United States. It is also believed that this isa subject of importance and interest, as thus the results of long years of experience and devotion to agriculture, both scientific ally and practically, are brought within the reach of persons for consultation who may wish to avail themselves of such a means of improvement. The course adopted has been to purchase none but such as are known to be deserving, or which are highly recommended by the best judges in the foreign periodicals. The time will. come when the rich treasures of these volumes will be more fully laid open to the agricultural public, and their influence be very considerable in regard to their application to this great element of our national prosperity. Some changes have taken place the past year in the agricultural periodicals of our country. Among these, we may mention the union or merging of that well known and useful one, The Farmers' Cabinet" of Philadelphia, with the "american Agriculturists" of New Work. We shall miss the fan ii liar face of the Cabinet" which we have ever counted as a journal of much merit; but it is a matter of gratification that so able a work as the "american Agriculturistoccupies its place with its subscribers. The 66 Missouri Farmer, also, has ceased to be published. It was but a beginning, and, therefore, it could scarcely be conjectured what it would have been. Among the new works of the kind, we have observed the "pennsylvania Cultivator" published at Harrisburg, and the " Vermontstate Agriculturists" published at Burlington, in a handsome quart o form of sixteen pages, monthly, at the price of one dollar per annum." The Farmers' Library" a monthly, heretofore issued at Newyork, has also closed, and its veteran editor is now conducting anew and promising monthly work at Philadelphia, which bears the comprehensive name of 1 The Slough, the Room, and the Anvilat three dollars per annum. The agricultural journals exert a very powerful influence on the advance of this science and improvement in practice throughout our country. They deserve a better patronage. The money paid for their weekly or monthly visit, laden with stores of selected knowledge and the fruits of able thinking, is well expended. The farmer and planter may not be aware how much what he has read has shaped his opinions; but could their whole connexion and bearing be traced outs no doubt it would be seen they have moulded102Ex. and modified his plans, and added much to his means of agricultural prosperity. The more full the patronage, the more valuable will these journals become. The editors are men who are well trained to their profession, and have a love for the object which they are so variously promoting. The progress of agricultural education seems also on the advance and it is believed and hoped that the experiments making of well conducted lectures on this great subject in our colleges and academies, promises success. Future years will unquestionably show a rich hart est of results in these begun enterprises. The influence of the professors, and the pupils trained under their teaching, will be, it is confidently expected, to diffuse more correct views of the scientific relations of agriculture; and the original investigations thus prompted and secured will rebound in many an honorable tribute to the talent and experience of our fellow citizens. Very successive year thus may multiply almost in a geometrical ratio the benefits; and ere long, over every part of our land, will be found men whose sound practical and scientific knowledge on these topics will guide the opinions of yet more and more of our husbandmen. It is an attribute of extended intelligence to impart more liberal and expanded views; and minds thus acted on will be less liable to feel selfish ends. The cooperation of such men has been most willingly tendered the office, and we are indebted to many of them, not merely for their countenance and expression of approbation, but also for counsel and aid in conducting the business placed in our hands of gathering results from every part of our country. Did we follow out the dictates of our feelings, no slight expression of our thanks would be the one we feel bound to render to many .who have entered with earnestness into the work, and performed the requested labor and furnished the aid which has so essentially contributed to give value to our annual summary of the progress of agricultural industry. The communications of our correspondent shave not only been more full, but evidently show a much greater care in their preparation. Any of them contain most interesting developments of the state of agriculture in the different parts of our country, and exhibit suck an excellent state of feeling in reference to future efforts, that not our thanks only, but those of all who may prize these collections, are due to them. We have placed quite a number of them, more or less full, from different States, with the circular in appendix No. 3, as they furnish many details which could not be brought into tabular form, and so far as they go, enable us to form a comparative judgment of the crops, of the modes of tillage, and a variety of other particulars relating to agricultural industry. One of the most elaborate reports, from J. Cela field, esq, President of the Seneca Countyagricultural Society, of New Work, which has' afforded us much valuable information, had been already sent into the New Yorkstate Agricultural Society, and has not made its appearance in their general report. X. a. , 103 t may not be improper here to avert to the course adopted in securing these contributions to the object. In March last the names of the presidents and secretaries, and other officers of agricultural societies, farmers' clubs, &c, as well as of men of known character as intelligent farmers and planters in every State of the Union were obtained, To these persons a circular, prepared with much care, and embracing a gate at variety of particulars, was addressed, requesting their aid in filling the blanks with the needed information. This call has been more promptly responded to than has been the case to any previous one, and, by the help of the details given, a number of valuable summarise have been prepared, which will be found in their proper place in this report. These are condensed by the col nation of a great number of such minor reports, and, though occupying in their present form but some few pages, have been the labor of days, and have been collected by the most careful transcription, and averaging and combining of particulars, spread over many sheets of manuscript. They are, as to their extent of induction of facts, certainly new in this country and, if regarded as the beginning, furnish an exhibition of possible results most promising in any future pursuance of the same system of means. To render this statement more clear, we would refer to the form of the circular in the appendix 3, as well as to a number of the replies of our correspondents, which from their value we have also annexed to this report. We have reason to believe, that the aim of those who have contributed their aid in furnishing the facts, on which this report is based, has been to avoid all exaggeration, and it may generally be assumed that they have fallen short rather than exceeded the actual results. The figures of the census, which is so soon to be i taken, will show whether or not we have been so very wide of the mark, or if anything, if our error has not been on the safe side of falling short rather than going beyond the actual truth. One or two instances we have noticed which may help us to judge in this matter. In certain cases pains have been taken to ascertain the amount of some particular crop in a section of the country, and a comparison of the statements with our own has convinced us that if we have erred, it has not been in exaggerated estimates of the crops, considering the census of 1840. as the basis for other years. To avert to a few of these which may make this fact more apparent. In some of the States there have been enumerations taken, by direction of the legislature since the general census of 1840. Comparison of these reported results, with those of the census of 1840, in many cases shows a vastly greater increase than a proportionate part of our estimates would give, so that were the same percentage to be adopted for the whole State, which is that of a particular county quoted, below, the amount of the crops would vary much in our favor from those in our tables 104 X. a. Thus in the county of Putnam, I illinois, the amount of products by the census of 1840, was heat. .a. .a. 40,885 bushels. Oats .a. .a. .a. 46,572 do indian corn. .a. 71,273 do The amount of products of this county for 1848, is thus given by an intelligent correspondent after a careful investigation, and based on the State census of 1845 heat .a. .a. .a. 150,000 bushels. Oats .a. .a. .a. 60,000 do indian corn. 300,000 do his increase is far. larger than we have allowed in estimating the crops of the State for 1848, based on the census of 1840. In the Prairie Farmer of September, we find a statement that the assessor of the county in the spring took measures for ascertaining the number of bushels of wheat, &e, raised there in the previous year, 1847. The following is the result heat. .a. . .a. .a. .a. .a. 82,552 bushels. Worn .a. .a. .a. .a. .a. 850,180 do The same products are given by the census of 1840, as follows heat. .a. .a. 10,111 bushels. Worn .a. . .a. . 398,690 do n the October number of the same periodical, Fulton county is said to produce the following crops heat. .a. *a* *a* .a. 1,000,000 bushels. Worn .a. .a. .a. .a. .a. 2,000,000 do Oats. .a. .a. 500,000 do n the census it figures thus heat. .a. .a. .a. 105,000 bushels. Worn. 608,886 doSOats .a. .a. .a. 127,059 do Even should we admit the statement in the last case to be perhaps somewhat conjecture l, yet as' put forth by responsible persons in the county itself, who seem to have taken pains to form a correct conclusion, it must be supposed to approximate to the truth; and should we apply these rates of increase to the crops of the whole State in reference to the census, it will be seen that the result will far exceed our highest calculations. Take the case of Sussex county, Virginia. According to the census of 1840 it stands heat .a. .a. . .a. 18,777 bushels. Oats .a. .a. .a. .a. .a. 103,986 do. I indian corn. .a. 404,793 do. The estimate, by a gentleman resident there, for 1848, based on x. a. 105 an actual examination of a school district, and a comparison of the various districts in the county, is as follows heat .a. .a. .a. 25,194 bushels. Oats .a. .a. .a. .a. . 91,200 d do indian corn .a. .a. .a. .a. 300,735 do Carrying a similar estimate or per cent age of decrease over to, the State, and it will be seen, in comparison with our own, that we have placed the crops lower than we might have been justified in doing, We might cite other cases, but they would be only multiplying the same kind of facts. We have, perhaps, offered enough to answer our object of vindication, so far as needed. With reference to population, the same remarks will probably .be equally applicable; as a single instance we may refer to the case of Arkansas. The governor, in his late message, estimates that, in 1850, the population of that State will reach 300,000. This is afar higher estimate than ours would make it. To that it may be safely assumed, and we feel confident the results of the census will confirm it, that the annual estimates have fallen below rather than exceeded the truth. This is as we have intended, and the country is actually more capable than we have stated. Another fact has not been sufficiently averted to by some, who have claimed an error in our estimates. It was noticed in our last report, but perhaps not sufficiently elucidated. The cotton crop, it is known, is one of the most difficult of all to give with, accuracy at the time when our report is presented. Sufficient attention has not been paid by objectors to our estimates to the particular objects we have in view. It is not to give the amount which actually finds its way to the market, but the amount produced. The amount collected at the various southern ports is known in the course of the year with great exactness, but to quote this amount as the true result of production is by no means so decisive. To allowance is thus made for what is used in all the interior of the States where it is raised, and which never finds its way to these ports. When, again, the loss in various ways, by fire and other means, deserves to be taken into consideration. Of this no account is taken in prices current of New Orleans, and other southern cities. Does not, also, another portion, small no doubt it is, pass over into some of the more northern States, as Ohio, I n diana, &c, without appearing in any of these tables, being in such away of trade that no notice is had of it at any of the points whence the accounts are gathered? Add together the cotton which, may fall under these items, and will there not be sufficient, allowing for the slight difference occasioned by presenting the estimate in pounds instead of bales, to 'account for the excess of our estimated crop, over the result as exhibited in bales in the various southern ports, This last method of gaining the result, indeed, is of essential importance, to enable us to form correct views of the drop, when 106 X. taken in connexion with other means of information. It must ever be the case however, that it will not exhibit the precise result of the product. A portion of a former years' crop may be kept back and mingled with that of the current one in the market. The census, on the other hand, if correctly taken, would exhibit the true results of production, not of domestic export. The same applies, likewise, in still greater force to the estimates of the wheat, e crop, or that of I indian corn, or <a name="potatoes4"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, from the amount that is concentrated at particular ports. This method of estimate is the one which is mainly relied on by many. Were there such a system in operation as prevails in Great Britain, and presented irs the dark Lane Express of London, by which accurate reports are furnished from every part of the whole country weekly, no doubt great reliance might be placed on them. But there is not, and the quantity arriving at the Atlantic by no means forms a fair exhibit of the production of the country. There are many causes which operate to prevent even the proportionate quantity, which shall be the ex potent of the whole crop, from being found in the market, often till long after the confident opinion is expressed by way of censure on our report By watching these statements, and -recurring to the opinions gathered from correspondents in all parts of the country, as well as by condensing the results given in the journals of those regions which furnish the various crops, we are well satisfied of the position we have taken. Great allowance must no doubt be made for a defective mode of taking the census, and the errors which have been the result' But if accurate, taken as a basis, and proper care being given to the collecting and comparing information on the subject, it is believed a fair approximation may be secured. The reports of former years, have so fully pointed out the elements to be used, and the labors employed in reaching the result of the estimate made, and procuring end condensing the various information included in such a public document, that it is believed unnecessary to avert again particularly to these topics. As a natural consequence these must increase the more extended the investigation becomes, and very considerable attention has been paid the past year to German and French works on statistics for the purpose of enlarging the field from which this aggregate of facts is to be gathered. Were still greater efforts and more care directed to its execution, the census would secure this object. Among the various topics which it is desirable to have brought out, are the amount of the cultivated or uncultivated lands, whether woodland, pasture, or plow land, gardens, nur series, &c, and the quantities devoted to the several crops of tilled land; the average crops, taking one year with another for several years; the average consumption sub divided into that used by man or by the animals for food, or for seed, or for manufacture, the value; and similar particulars respecting which at present almost all are so very ignorant. X. a. 107 n an able German publication, statistics are divided into theithydrographic relations, the geographic and geological. The climate and weather, amount of population difference of classes, the agricultural population, and divisions of the crops c, are recommended as objects of attention. The un productive soil is divided into land and water, ponds and rivers, brooks, marshes, &c; stony, sandy, petty, rocks, woodlands. The agricultural or productive, into tilled, meadow, pastures, orchards, gardens, &c. Count Aspirin, in his valuable Hours d Agriculture, of which the first four volumes have been published, considers it in the most extended sense as comprisingAgrologie, which includes an examination of the nature of the earth in regard to its products. Rural mechanics, which develop e the means we must employ to lay open and divide the earth i. e. first, the instruments; second, the forces to put them into motion. Hydraulic mechanics, which relates to the provision of water either from the earth by capillary attraction, or by instruments required; also carrying off the excess of water in any case desired. Horticultureagriculture, as it relates to gardens, &c, embracing the proper supply of heat, light, &c. Rural methodology embraces the operation of the seasons, weather, &c, on cultivation. Rural architecture The means of preserving crops gathered against the influences of bad weather, &c. Agricultural chemistry, which relates to the nutrition of plants by means of manures, &e. Rural economy embraces the relations of agricultural to government, trade, manufactures, &c, &c. It cannot be expected that the report now prepared should enter largely into all these topics; still, as the division is a good one, and comes to us recommended by so high authority, it will be useful to bear it in mind. Considerable progress has been made in gathering a comparative table of the season for sowing, harvesting, with the amount of seed and the average product per acre; the kinds and varieties most successful, and the soil favorable for the purpose. It has been combined by collaring several reports from a State, and the various averages have been made with care and reflection. The proof of the correctness of the table may be found in the fact we can state, that there has been very great coincidence in the several independent reports in respect to these topics; far more so, indeed, than we had any reason to expect; and this is the more remarkable, also, as the attention of many of our correspondent s seem to have been now called for the first time to the topics suggested. Some attempts have also been made to ascertain the proportion of cultivated land in different parts the country; the most approved rotation, the value and amount of fodder of corns talk and straw fodder and the proportion this bears to the grain, as well as the prices of various agricultural products. Viewed as a beginning 108 X. the result of this effort has been encouraging; and it is hoped that hereafter a ore ample collection of materials will be obtained for the same p one. We have been thus enabled to present the comparison of agriculture as it is practised in nearly all the different States of the Union. At a glance, as it were, not only may the productive ness, but also the value of crops which are raised be ascertained, and a basis is furnished more complete than has heretofore been at command for deductions in regard of this great branch of our national industry. In almost all the instances we have reason to believe that these details, if not precisely exact, are yet fully reliable; more so, indeed, than at any previous year, since they are compounded of a greater variety of communications, and the experience of the past has been brought in to aid in their preparation. A greater number likewise of estimates respecting the cost of raising corn and wheat has enabled us to give a comparative view of this point in economical husbandry, while the suggestions as to the modes of cultivation will no doubt be acknowledged as another, valuable accession to our former materials of interest to the farmers and planters of our country. In comparing the statements respecting the planting season, it will be seen that there is, between the extremes of our country Florida or Texas, and Paine, Wisconsin and I own at least two months. This may be observed in respect to the I indian corn crop. Thus, in Texas the time of planting is stated to be February and March, while in Paine and I own it is given in May. Of course, the time of gathering differs in a similar manner. From these two points we notice a regular g radiation. Judging from the accounts, there appears to be little variation between States in the same parallel of latitude in these particulars. There is one point of advantage not so apparent now as it maybe hereafter, when the lines of communication shall have become greatly multiplied, in those sections where the same can be planted and so gathered in advance of the other, it can be earlier in the market. Thus, <a name="potatoes5"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be supplied from the more southern point to the more northern one for perhaps a month before the crop in the latter is ripened, fit for use. Numerous details have been gathered respecting the state of the weather, and they have been used for the purpose of preparing a condensed statement on this subject. It will be noticed that the circular of the office, embraced this particular in reference to three periods, of planting, growing, and harvesting or gathering seasonal so, with reference to the mean temperature for the different months, and the amount of rain which fell. As the attention of the farmer has not been generally directed to any such records nd they are un provided with means of forming accurate conclusions on the subject, it was hardly to have been expected that we should have been successful in procuring replies to these questions. It was thought proper to include them among others, as they might excite an interest, and turn the thoughts of some to observant. a. 109 t ion, who might thus hereafter afford valuable assistance in this respect. We have been favorably disappointed in regard to the notice taken of them by our correspondents, and augury favorably, from this indication for the future. Though not sufficiently extended to embrace the whole of our country, so as to present a complete weather table, yet we have derived many valuable hints from them, by which we have been enabled to give, as it' were, at least a more accurate view of the subject. In our observations on this topic, we shall avail ourselves of these authorities, without deeming it necessary to enter into exact specifications. Dividing the season, therefore, into three periods, we shall commence with what may be included in the growing period of wheat sown in the fall, and which has to endure the winter. Taking the whole country through, the winter season of 18 1748 was a mildoneoComparatively little snow fell in those sections where it might have been expected, nor was there extreme cold, nor much rain. Thus the Prairie Farmer, of February, states that there then had been only a few days of cold weather in December, and snow had fallen only enough to cover the ground about two inches. Correspondent of the same paper, from Dubuque, I illinois, speaks of the winter as an unusual one, much rain and little snow, and mentioned that " bees had been flying about every week during the winter 5 Similar testimony is given respecting the weather in others of the States in the higher northern latitudes. In New Hampshire, in the vicinity of Charles town, an intelligent observer informs us, that the winter was "unusually mild and broken n Massachusetts, near the seacoast, though the snow continued somewhat longer than common, it, however, disappeared in the month of March. In Michigan, and the northern part of the State of New Work, the winter was quite mild. The proper planting season in the .northern section of our country, which begins in April, and extends into May, and when the principal crops are sown or planted, appears to have been most favorable. We can but allude to a few of the numerous proofs we might here cite in this respect. Thus the Prairie Farmer, of May, states that " the season has been more pleasant than any of which we have any recollection, since our residence in I illinois 5" The month of March, and the first part of April, are said to have been without exception uninterruptedly mild and beautiful, and the weather, though not very warm, is declared to have been clear and steady, with a few refreshing rains. In Putnam .county, I illinois, the season is stated to have been a remarkable one for planting. The winter was mild, March and April a little too dry, but May with its gentle showers supplied the deficiency. In I own, too, the weather at the planting season is said to have been rather cool and dry, but in the main favorable to 110 X. the crops. In Michigan, the weather is described as being dry and cool at the planting season. In It. Lawrence county, one of the most northern in the State of New Work, at sowing and planting in spring, the information is that the season was warm and dry, just rain enough to cause the seed to ve get ate, the thermometer ranging at about 60. In Windsor county, Vermont, the state of the weather at seed time was very favorable for that climate. Though April was dry, yet after that, there was no want of rain. In New Hampshire, we are informed that the spring came on pleasantly with abundant rains, the warmth did not increase with the length of days, May was unusually cool and moist. Still further east, also, in Piscataquis county, Paine, the weather is characterised as having been cold and wet in May. Taking a somewhat lower range of latitude, we find the winter and spring in the main corresponding to those of the States just mentioned, The indications are perhaps, however, of greater frequency of snow. The Ohio Cultivator, published in Columbus, presents some details on this subject, from which we derive the facts, that in most of the States snow fell to the depth of a foot on the 18th and 20th, of December, and remained with very cold weather for about ten days, then there came on a sudden thaw. The Ohio and its tributaries in the middle of December. flooded the adjoining levels, and did great damage. Now again fell in the early part of January to the depth of six inches, but it lasted only about a week, and then there was another thaw; the weather was cold, the thermometer being at Columbus at zero, and in Chillicothe at 8 below it. The winter is, however, said not to have been unfavorable to the winter crop. The latter part of March and in the early part of April, the weather is stated to have been remarkably fine and warm, the vegetation rapid, though so dry as to need rain, and towards May becoming cooler, an inch or two of snow having fallen on the 19th of April, followed by two or three frosts. In the month there was a sufficiency of rain. A favorable spring or planting season is also noticed in Newyork and Pennsylvania, though some apprehensions were expressed respecting the dr out in the latter part of May. As mentioned in a report from Delaware county, Pennsylvania, the number of days of rain during the months of April and May, the grass season, was only six. In New Jersey. it was rainy during the planting season. In Lancaster county, I A, the state of the weather in the winter and spring, is described as having been more dry than for many years past, very little snow the winter past, the ground not being thoroughly soaked in spring as usual, and no fresh its having occurred. The ground and the weather were both in fine state for putting in spring crops, and even the dryness which prevailed is said to have injured no crop seriously. A similar testimony as to the mildness of the weather in the winter, and the favorable character of the planting season, is very x. 
11Jgeneral in Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, and Florida. In western Virginia, the early part of the planting season is described as dry and favorable, the latter part moist, and the same favorable report is made of eastern Virginia and Maryland. To in South Carolina, a report from Newberry district informs us the season was good at the last planting time, and continued thus till about the 1st of July. In Georgia, we are told that it was a remarkable season for planting. The winter was mild, March and April also, though, perhaps, a little too dry, and May succeeded with gentle showers. In Harbour county, Alabama, the spring was unusually forward and favorable, warm and dry. The copious rains in May, are mentioned in an Last Florida journal, as having refreshed the finishing earth, and invigoratedthe crops. In Mississippi the planting season is characterised as being very fine weather, while in Tennessee_ it is said, 'there was a moderate winter; the first of it (probably about the same time as mentioned. above in Ohio) the rain was so abundant, that the Cumberland and Taney forks were swollen higher than they had been since 1826; the latter part of the winter was mild, yet very wet the spring opened early, giving an opportunity for early planting in the first days of April' The whole season was favorable, and the latter part of May was dry. In Texas the winter was mild and the spring early. It will be seen, therefore, that, with the exception of some .few localities where they might have suffered by being winter killed, the crops so far as being well. planted, were most promising up to June. June, July, and the early part of August, covers the hay and grain harvest in all the States where these c rows are raised in the largest quantities, while they may be considered properly the growing season of the corn, cotton and tobacco, <a name="potato3"><mark>potato</mark></a>, hemp, and sugar crops. We will, therefore, briefly take a survey of the weather during this period. Beginning, as before, at the northwest section of our country. The early part of June appears to have been dry and somewhat cool; the latter portion of the month and July more rainy, but still cool. Taken as a whole, however, the harvest season was a favorable one. In Michigan, indeed, we are informed that there was an uncommon amount of rain, which commenced the 4th of July, and produced a wet harvest. I need, it is said that season has not been so wet since 1836, and even that is thought to have been less so. The rain in Michigan, in one account, is stated to have been in July 11.38 inches. A similar state of the weather is mentioned a shaving ;been experienced in I own, northern I n diana, It. Lawrence county, New Work, New Hampshire, Piscataquis county, Paine. There was some differences, however, as to temperature; for, while in I own we are told of its having been unusually cool, in Paine and in New Hampshire, in It. Lawrence county, New Work, the thermometer ranged from 75 to 80 degrees of Fahrenheit. Further south, comprising the State of New Work, Pennsylvania1112 X. a. Ohio, and down to Virginia, during the harvest, the weather for the most part was side and very promising. A sufficiency of rain i general is mentioned. In some parts of these States there were diversities; but, as a whole, the testimony is as we have mentioned. It is deemed unnecessary to go into particulars, as the statements, in most cases, are so nearly similar. In the southern and southwestern States, the month of June and the early part of July were warm growing periods, very favorable to the progress of the crops. Some of the accounts describe the weather as most delightful, with a sufficiency of rain, in gentleshowcrs, to promote the advance of the cotton and other products of the earth. In July, however, a drought commenced not only in this section of the country, but through the middle and eastern portions of the northern States, which reached into and through, in some cases, the month of August, and till the middle of September. It was for some time feared that the corn crop, which felt it, especially toward the latter part of its continuance, would be materially injured by it. Everywhere along the sea coast great complaint was made of the pastures and brooks drying up, the extreme dust i ness of the roads, and all the usual indications of protracted heat. It is remarkable, however, that in other portions of the interior, especially in the States of Ohio, I n diana, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and in Western Virginia and Pennsylvania, as well as in Alabama, in the middle and latter part of August, mention is made of damaged one to the crops by the excessive rains which had fallen. The drought broke up, in the places where it prevailed most, about the last half 'of September; and, as there were no early frosts, the corn, although stinted in some measure by the action of the excessive heat, proved to be a very fine crop, though not by any means equal to, the promise of the earlier part of summer. The warm weather may yet have been favorable, on the whole, to the <a name="potato4"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. In the communications of our correspondents, in the Appendix will be found statements and hints respecting the season and quantity of rain, &c, embraced under this branch of the report. We insert a few which we have extracted from them. In Rates county, . New Work. Month. April 0. May. Quite .a. July. Mean annual temperature, 58,Baron On Humboldt, in his Bosoms, alluding to the variations of temperature and the causes which influence them, attributes much to the influence of the sea in equal iting temperatures. He says on this subject: "I t moderates both the asperity of winter and the heat of summer; hence arises a second important contrast that between insular or lit t oral climates (enjoyed also in some degree by continents whose outline is broken by peninsulas and bays) and the climate of interior of great masses of solid land." He addsLeopold On Each was the first writer who entered fully into the subject of this remarkable contrast, and the varied phenomena resulting from it; its influences on vegetation and agriculture; on thetransparency .of the atmosphere and serenity of the sky; on the radiation from the surface; and on the height of the limit of perpetual snow. In the interior of the Asiatic continent, Podolsk, Burnaul on, the B i, and I r kursk, have summers which in mean temperature resemble those of Berlin and Hunter, and that ofCherbourg, in Normandy; and during this season the thermometer sometimes remains for weeks together at 86 or 87 8 Fahrenheit but these summers are followed by ,winters in which the cold est month has the severe mean temperature of 0 4 below, to 40 abovecypher Fahrenheit. In this connexion he remarks: "I have in no part of the earth, not even in the Angry islands, or in Pain, or in the south of France, seen more magnificent fruit, especially grapes, than at Astrakhan, near the shores of the Caspian, in l at 460 21, with a mean annual temperature of about 48 Fahrenheit, which is that of Bordeaux; while not only there, but also still more to the south, at Millar, at the mouth of the Were k, (in the latitude of Avignon and Aiming) the thermometer sometimes falls in winter to 130 to 220 below cap her of Fahrenheit n our remarks on the progress of the crops it is not intended to go very minutely into details. We have. a vast quantity of materials, which would fill pages; but as the ground on which our estimates are based, after being so distinctly stated in former reports, may be presumed to be well understood, it seems unnecessary to do much more than give the general results. We rely as before mainly on agricultural sources; that is, the agricultural periodicals 116 X. and correspondents who are practical farmers and proprietors of crops, as well as of others who, from their opportunities of knowledge, form the safest guides to whom we can refer. Before a more particular consideration, we will just give a glance at the principal crops as a whole, in order to present at one view the general aspect of the great agricultural products of our country. The wheat crop, as a whole, is believed to have been a good one. The breadth of land sown was probably larger than ever before sown. This was owing partly to the increased market, and partly to the new lands for the first time brought under cultivation. The success of the crop in the main, was favorable. Some complaints of its being winter killed were made in sections of the wheat growing districts, and now and then, also, it appears to have suffered from insects and rust, but on the while was quite free from these evils. The amount raised per, acre compares well, also, with that of former prosperous years. In most cases it is thought to have been more than an average crop. The condition of the grain in general is described as being good. The state of the weather at the harvest secured its being got in in a fine state of dryness; and though the straw was heavy, yet the grain also was well filled, and of a proper color and weight. To far as can be ascertained respecting barley and rye, which are but partially raised, these crops also were above the usual average for the amount sown. Oats succeeded better than common, and the crop is a satisfactory one. Buckwheat is but little noticed, but is believed to have been an improvement on the crop of last year. I indian corn, notwithstanding the fears which were entertained respecting it at one time, and the partial injury it may have sustained by the drought, has proved to be a very great crop in some, portions of our country. It is a favorite crop, and admits of being applied to so many uses for stock, that it will probably be always one of the main reliances of the farmer in our country. The increased quantities which are raised in the West are easily accounted for by the little labor it costs to raise it on a large scale, and the vast amount which is consumed for the feeding of hogs, which form so large a proportion of the animal stocks of the great farms there. The prospect of its becoming a better article for exportation has likewise stimulated to higher efforts at its production. Estimated at a moderate price, it will be seen that the millions of bushels raised must reach to above                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100,000,000, and thus form salary- item in the agricultural wealth of our country. Of turned into pork and land the value is yet more enhanced. The <a name="potato5"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop has suffered as in former years by the rot, but the evil has been more local, and would seem to justify some hope that it may gradually pass off in its progress westward. Side from this, the amount of bushels raised is very considerably larger than last year. Experience has taught our farmers, if they cannot x. a. I1twholly avoid the evil, yet to guard in some degree against its worst effects. May is fully an average crop. The moist season of the spring appears to have been favorable, and- the warmth of the summer both brought it forward and enabled the farmer to secure it in good order. Considerable hay may have been consumed in those parts of the country where the drought was severe st, and where, from the drying up of the pastures, farmers were obliged to keep their stock by foddering; but this extremity was local, and perhaps has not exercised any important influence on the crop, as a whole. It is difficult to get at a correct account of the hemp crop. I t would seem, from the best view we have been able to obtain of the matter, that less attention is now paid to it than a few years since, and as there was a less breadth of land occupied, so the crop has not yielded as largely as in some previous years. Perhaps the pierre may be said of tobacco, especially in those States where it has formed a staple product. The attention of the growers of tobacco seems to be gradually withdrawn, or rather turned to wheat or corn or some other product. This fact, in the Atlantic States, may have arisen in part from the competition opened to the west in this product by the increased facilities of transportation. Cotton still continues to be the great crop of the south, even at the almost ruinously low prices that have prevailed of late. The crop of this year though subject to the usual vicissitudes and in some places cut off, yet on the whole is believed to have been as large as the previous year, and above an average one. An increase of the Texas crop may be expected in future years, and this fact, as the country extends its population in the cotton growing sections, will have a tendency to render the competition of the Atlantic States less able, and finally perhaps force them to resort to a change of crops, at least to a greater variety of the same The rice crop was a good one and well secured. Of sugar it is almost too early to speak as yet, but we hope to be able, before the close of this report, to furnish as accurate an estimate both of this and the cotton crop as is in our power to obtainWheatNew Work, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Northcarolina, may be regarded as the great wheat growers on the Atlantic slope, while Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, I n diana, I illinois, and michigan furnish the largest portion of that which is raised in the west and northwest. A reference to the more prominent of these tin tracing the particular history of this crop, may be sufficient. In a country like ours, it will doubtless always be found that the accounts will vary somewhat, even in the same State. Certain low cavities are more liable to be affected by the frost and cold of winter than others; and it will ever be the case that more or less grain is winter killed. This was the fact during the last winter, though the evil was comparatively very limited. We begin with Ohio. The editor of the Ohio Cultivator, (a good authority) under date of February 15, 1848, states, that in travel118Ex. fling from Columbus to Cincinnati, via Penis, and back by the way of Portsmouth and Chillicothe, the wheat fields generally presented a healthy appearance, giving little evidence of injury from the winter. This route would take him through the southwestern tier of counties. The same appearance of the crop is also mentioned in that portion of the State a 'month later. The dry weather had prevented the heaving usual, and to be expected. At a month later still in April the reports from the central portion of the state were also favorable. The northern central counties, Our on and Erie, and the northwestern counties, however, seemed to indicate more failure. Any fields were thought to be winter killed, especially on the more moist grounds. In the north eastern section, around Columbia na county, the crop looked well, except on the wet lands, while the rich lands of southern Ohio exhibited it as very forward. As it advanced towards the harvest, in the month of May, we are informed that the wheat crop of Ohio never looked better, or gave better promise. In the great counties of Take, Hayne, inRichland, Ash land, Knox, Picking, there was said to be scarcely a bad looking field; and the same was the case with the eastern and southern range of counties; while on the northwest it was nearly as promising. Thus it continued; and in June, (the middle of the month) it is noticed that the wheat crop in Ohio was approaching to maturity, with the finest possible appearance; and in southern Ohio was considered almost past danger. In Delaware, Rich land, Dorr on, Ash land, To rain, Cuyahoga, Take, Eau ga, Ashtabula, Trumbull, Mahoning, Columbia na, War roll, Tuscarawas, Coshocton, Muskingum, Picking, and Franklin counties, -it is pronounced to be remarkably fine as good as in 1846; and in some counties, even better. In the eastern portion of the Reserve, the quantity might perhaps not be so great as in 1846. A smaller amount had been sown, and the fly had somewhat lessened it from what it would have been. But in Columbia na, Tuscarawas, Muskingum, and picking, the straw was remarkably bright, and the grain bright and handsome. It would appear, therefore, from this authority, (and we could have none better) that up to the time of harvesting, the progress of the wheat crop in Ohio had been unusually satisfactory. There is much less complaint of blight, rust, or fly, than in many years, and perhaps than the general average of seasons. Even a slate, too, as the 1st of September, when the harvest had been secured, we learn from the best of sources that the wheat crop of Ohio, from all accounts, was harvested without as much damage from the rains as many had anticipated, though considerable quantities had suffered a partial injury. The progress of the crop, as gathered from other sources, is similar. Local journals notice its promising appearance in terms like this, in April: " We have made frequent inquiries of farmers and others from different sections of the country, as to the prospect of the winter wheat crops, and hear but one reply: that they are good, and that every thing now indicates a large yield x. a. 119 Again: t the prospect of the coming wheat crop in this section of western Ohio never was, at this season of the year, more favorable than at this time." This remark is applied to the counties ofLorain, Sort age, Hayne, Stark, Holmes, Columbia na, and War roll, and so of others. In June and July, it is said of the harvest in theMiami valley, that the wheat crop comes in finely. The yield is more abundant than usual, and the merry generally better than it has been for years. I need, from all the numerous journals we have examined to obtain a proper view of the progress of the wheat crop in Ohio, the testimony is so uniform and similar, that it does not seem necessary to quote from them more minutely. The section already pointed out, it will be seen by a reference to the census, comprises by far the largest portions of the wheat growing districts of this State, which is such an extensive producer of this grain. We therefore only refer to the testimony which is furnished by the replies to the circular sent from the office, and various correspondents. In some instances, we have had the opportunity thus to compare two or more independent accounts from the same sections of the wheat growing districts, and have been pleased to see the evidence of correctness which is given by the mutual confirmation of each others statements. Thus we find it stated, that, according to the estimates of our correspondents, the increase has been large. In High land county, for example, it is judged to have been' equal to 50 per cent. I lRichland county, in one portion of it, about 20 per cent; and il i another, although perhaps not an average crop, yet owing to a driver winter, and not so severe a frost, the advance was fully equal to 5 or 10 per cent. The ratio of increase is, in many cases, estimated still larger even double the crop of 1847, on account of the season. In Hayne and Defiance counties, about 25 per cent a full crop, compared with that of 1847, in Hayne and 5 or 10 per cent in Organ county. We might go on; but probably the abstract of the returns to the Agricultural Board of the State, which will be found in an appendix, will enable any one to form a conclusive judgment on the subject. Of we pass over to I n diana, the history of the wheat crop is quite similar to what ,we have already given in respect to Ohio. In March we notice statements that the wheat in the upper part of I n diana was generally uninjured by the winter, so far as could be judged. In April the crop was said to promise a good, yield in this State. Such continued to be the case for the most part through the month of May, and in June. As the harvest drew on, in central I n diana especially, we are informed that it was thought to be superior in quantity and quality to any before harvested in that section of the State. It did not stand so thick on the ground as it should do; but the head was remarkably full and heavy never, indeed, more so. Some fields were threatened by rust; but it was hoped that they would eventually escape it. There was likewise, here and there, appearance of insects; but these cases were rare 120 X. a. After the harvest, also, the statements were equally favorable. Thus, in one account it is that the fall wheat harvest was an average crop much better, indeed, than had been anticipated at the commencement of spring. The harvest of spring wheat, which is often relied on to make up any losses of the other crop, presented a fine growth on the whole; but considerable complaint was made, in certain sections, of rust. Some pieces were materially injured, while others were entirely destroyed; and others yet not at all affected. A new disease in the spring wheat, called the scab or spot, is noticed in Take county; and the chin ch bug had made its appearance. The reports which have been made in reply to the circular of the office respecting the wheat crop in I n diana, correspond well to the above notices. The increase of the crop is estimated at from 10 to 20 per cent, and the favorable season is generally assigned as the cause, of course allowing for the greater quantity of land, which is continually brought into cultivation. In some of. the counties it is also sub joined, that there was no injury from insects. I illinois, with the bordering States of Missouri, and Wisconsin and I own, are more particularly noticed from time to time in the Prairie Farmer, on the accounts of which much reliance may be placed, both from the high character of this agricultural journal, and also the facilities enjoyed of obtaining correct information. While as early as March, the accounts from portions of Wisconsin, represent the wheat, so far as could be judged, generally uninjured by the winter, in the northern parts ,of I illinois and middle Missouri, fears were expressed that owing to the constant thawing and freezing, considerable injury might be experienced. All the journals in the Lock river region, represent it as injured from these causes, and also, by want of snow. The Hessian fly was likewise said to be present in great numbers in the vicinity of Chicago similar complaints continue in April. But the prospect changed in May, and we are told that the wheat crop, which at the close of winter appeared worse than ever before, had started into vigorous life, and was so far as heard from in a finer condition than usual. In the western central portions of the State it is also 'aid never to have looked better. In July and August, when the crop was gathering or already harvested, the testimony respecting it is very similar. It is said to be a fine yield, and the grain of an excellent quality to be abundant, prospects favorable for a superabundantharvesta full average crop, and but for the damage by the rust it would have been much larger; 20 per cent, 50 percent. more than for the previous year. This was likewise the case in portions of Wisconsin. At the general result was favorable, even if not equal to the view taken in the I own Farmer of the prospect from the number of acres cultivated. It is said there, that it was estimated that Wisconsin would send to market one half more than in any previous year, and from the same journal, we learn in July, that the wheat crop came in tolerably full some fields were indeed as good as at any former year, while others proved a failure. T, 'he injury sustained by the winter wheat was repaired by the x. a. 121 sowing a large quantity of spring wheat. In one of the replies to the circular of the office we are informed that, in southern I illinois, in consequence of the settled demand for some years past, the farmers every year sow more, and consequently the crop is more. The wheat crop of Union county, I illinois, for 1847, was estimated at 75,000 bushels for exportation, and for 1848, owing to the additional ground sown, it is estimated as furnishing, for the same purpose, at least from 10 to 20 per cent. more. A similar ratio is given in a report from I own. Michigan is every year rising in importance, both as a wheat producing and a wheat exporting State. The crop of the present year (1848) seems to have been a good one. I to early appearance was promising. Thus it is stated, in the latter part of March, that even those fields which i had be on deemed 'ruined had recovered and looked well, and that there was reason to anticipate a larger crop of wheat than Michigan had ever before furnished. Met later, in May, the Michigan Farmer says, we continue to receive favorable accounts of the wheat crop from various and distant parts of the State. The present appearances wear the most encouraging aspect. In July a correspondent of the same journal states that, in travelling from that place to It. Josephs county, the wheat promised to afford an average yield; there were a greater number of first rate pieces than of poor ones. An intelligent correspondent states that, from the best information he could obtain, derived from observation and the practical cultivates of the soil, some portions of the State have been more highly favored than others. For the counties of Oak land, A comb, A peer, Tennessee, from good authority it is stated, he says, that there has been harvested from 20 to 30 bushels per acre, while in the counties of Hayne, Washtenaw, Monroe, there has been a falling off of some 30 percent. In the counties of I no ham, Baton, Clinton, long a, Went, Livingston, Shiawassee, the crops are stated to have been good with an increase of acres above the previous year. In the counties of Jackson, Calhoun, Kalamazoo, Branch, It. Joseph, Pass, Lenawee1illsdale, 'illegal, An Buren, Carry, and Her rien, the crops will exceed that of the former year, although the early sown wheat has suffered by the insect, while that sown after the 15th of September has produced a good yield. Therefore, taking the crop of the whole State with the progress of improvement, the amount must exceed that of 1847; as signing, as a reason, that there was no sleep in winter, and no fly, better season, and change of seed. Others speak of the per cent age of increase at 30 to 50 per cent, 100 to 200 per cent. The foregoing, we believe, is a correct view of the wheat crop of Michigan, and can hardly doubt that should the next year prove equally favorable, it will be found from the result of the census, that we have under rated, rather than overestimated tlyiamount raised. It will be recollected that for the past year or two there has been a very considerable influx of foreign emigration into this enterprising State, and 1 large public works are also in progress, and all these things, if it did not multiply the producers, have to a great extent increased the number of consumers 122 X. a. The State of New York still continues to maintain a high rank among those States which grow wheat largely. The wheat of this State, too, is regarded among the best of the northern States, and the attention paid to improving it has rewarded the cultivated r with many a rich crop. The usual complaint of winter killed was heard in the early part of the spring, but as the season advanced and the harvest was close at hand, the prospects seem to have brightened. This was the case in the western part of the State, where such large crops are produced, while in the vicinity of Tompkins county, about the latter part of June, it is said there had not been a time within ten years when the wheat crop promised better. To during the harvest the advices are, wheat, both spring and summer, looks uncommonly well and yields abundantly. Again, the quality of the present wheat crop is excellent and the kerseys are mentioned as remarkably full and plump. The commencement of the harvest is also noticed as being earlier than usual. Again, in reference to to this crop, it is said in an agricultural journal: The wheat harvest in the western part of the State is in active progress. The product is abundant and of the best quality. In some counties, as Rensselaer and Sullivan, great complaint is made of the fly. This insect, sometimes called the weevil, seems to have gained such a hold in particular districts, as to have led to an extensive abandonment of the cultivation of this species of grain. Taken as a whole, however, it is believed that the injury received by its ravages was comparatively very slight. The general estimate of the reports place the harvest considerably higher than that of 1847. The increase is put at from 10 to 20 per cent. and sometimes even higher. Thee New Jersey crop, also, although comparatively a small one, is considered as better than that of the preceding year. The causes assigned are a better season and improved culture. Pennsylvania produces a large wheat crop. As the spring opened the appearance of the fields is described as being promising. Month later also, in June, we are told that glorious reports of the, wheat crop, which is now to a great extent harvested, are received. The rains, in some instances, produced rot, and thus a portion of the grain was lost; but in many of the counties the crops appear to have been the best ever known. The replies to the circular correspond to the above. In Lancaster, Adamsdauphin, Delaware counties, the increase is estimated at 20 to 25 per cent, and the grain is spoken of as of a superior quality. Some, fields suffered from the old enemy the fly; yet, on thewholeithe season was so much more favorable and in some cases there was so much less injury from insects, that the crop largely exceeded that of the previous year. In but few instances only do we notice any indications of decrease from rust, and the whole of he unfavorable results are so rare, compared with the general success, that we believe they will not essentially affect the conclusion to which we have already arrived.  We have ample notice respecting the progress and results of the Maryland wheat crop; but, as they are very similar, it will not be x. 12 necessary to refer to more than two or three in each period. The prospects of the early spring appear to have been highly promising. In the month of May we meet with apprehensions entertained respecting the fly. In June, however, as the harvest commenced, the weather being fine, the accounts are all encouraging, and speak of the crop in various sections of the State as most abundant, unprecedented, never known to be better a better appearance than for many years. The harvest is said, in some of the journals, to have been the earliest ever known, and the yield to have been not only an abundant one, but the grain itself of an excellent quality; and the heads are noticed as being heavy and well filled. In some instances, that which was left on the, stalk appears to have been injured by the wet weather so that it sprouted, and partial loss is mentioned from this cause; but in general it was evidently a very large comparative increase. The estimates given by our correspondents vary from 10 percent, and upward. The early appearance of the wheat crop in Virginia is stated to have been very favorable. In the public journals allusion is made to the "magnificently green fields promising a glorious reward" to toil; the prospect is said to be "cheering" and the wheat is noticed as having "come out of the winter we ill. The progress of the crop was rapid and most favorable, and, as the harvest drew on, it is described as promising to be extensive. The harvest, as in Maryland, was earlier than usual and the accounts given of it, in general, represent it as a large one-one of the best and most abundant harvests gathered in the State for many years past. The quantity and quality is said to be fair, even where at first complaint was made of the fly. The replies of our correspondents at a later date concur in the above view of the harvest. In some counties it is estimated at 5 per cent; in others from 10 to 25 and 30 per cent. The reasons assigned are an increased demand, better season, &c. In the James river it is said to have been not as large, on account of a fresh et, the greatest one since 1795, and several hail storms, which in May destroyed the wheat in some places. The wheat crop in some of the southern and southwestern States appears to have suffered from the fly and rust. We have notices of these injuries, especially in the upper part of South Carolina and portions of Tennessee; in the latter of which, also, mention is made of loss from back water of the streams. In Alabama and Georgia it appears to have been an increased crop. In Kentucky, also, there seems to have been a gain on the previous year. As the amount raised in the more southern States, as well as in New England, is comparatively small, it is not thought necessary to enter into detail in the history of its progress. Behave not sufficient means of information to enable us to decide with respect to this crop in Texas and Oregon, though it is believed, from all that can be gathered, there has been an advance on the crop of 1847. Taking the ,whole country through, such, in our judgment, was the case for the general crop, and we have placed it accordingly 124. X. a. As has been before observed) the prevalence of rust seems to have been limited far more so than usual; and the injury of the fly, though the subject of complaint in some quarters, yet as a whole was comparatively small. It is still a desideratum to prevent loss from these causes; and, as we have already done in former reports, we sub join such observations on these topics as have fallen under our notice. The superiority of the Mediterranean wheat appears to be maintained in portions of our country; at least, we may quote here two notices on this subject from the Ohio Cultivator, both of which relate to former years; but they may serve as testimony as to the general excellence of this variety of wheat for the purpose. In the account of the best and most successful kinds used, which have been collected for the table found in the appendix and another portion of this report, the jvlediterranean is most frequently mentioned in many sections of the country. In general, it would appear to have been remarkably successful. The first of the notices above alluded to is that of Martin Amble, Run roe county, I n diana, and is taken from the number of the Ohio Cultivator for January, 1848, page 4. He says that he sowed his Mediterranean wheat on "a part of afield of wheat stubble, plowed in lands 8 feet wide, the soil rather sprout and inclined to wet." The rest of the field, he owed with common variety. He then states the fly destroyed almost entirely the whole field, except the Mediterranean, which escaped the fly and stood, the winter better than any he had. It also weighed 64 pounds to the bushel, while the common variety weighed only 61 pounds per bushel. He considers it better adapted than any other to that part of I n diana. The second case referred to we take from the same agricultural journal for May 1, 1848, page 69. In this the experiment lasted 3 years and with repeated success. In the fall of 1845, one bushel and a half of Mediterranean wheat was sown in one corner of a field; the remainder was sown with the white chaff bearded variety. The ground was plowed twice, and the seed sowed and dragged in the first week in September, all at the same time. From the bushel and a half, he cut 54 bushels, while from the other, from a bushel and a half of seed, he had but half the quantity. In the fall of 1846, he sowed his Mediterranean wheat after the middle of September; in consequence of which, the wheat did not spread as well, and produce as much to the acre as before; but in this case, its proportional increase was equal to that before, when compared with the common variety. Of the next trial, which was not determined when the communication was made, he speaks, encouragingly; for, though the fly had injured wheat there in the fall previous, he says he could never discover any insect in the Mediterranean, even when sown in the same fields with the other kinds which were attacked. X. 
125Alluding to the reports that the Mediterranean wheat would not produce as fine flour, he says that the kind there has been fairly tested, and there can be abundance of proof that it will make as much and as white flour as any other wheat in that place. He also states that it weighs 6 or 8 pounds more per bushel, it roots deep, grows rank in the fall, stands the frost better, is harvested about two weeks earlier, and on this 'account is not as liable to rust. He supposes the unfavorable report respecting the flour not being as fine, may have arisen from there being two or more kinds there passing under the same name. The same reason may perhaps, be assigned for the apparent exceptions in some parts of the country, with respect to its freedom from the fly. The following method of remedying the evil suffered by' the Hessian fly has been sent us by Mr. Charles Pale, of Hilton, Northumberland county, Pennsylvania. We give it in his own words. He says: "I have been a farmer for the last forty-six years, and as have severely suffered for some years from the ravages of the Hessian fly, I became very much discouraged. Having at length, by, close observation, discovered that wheat sown about the 1st of October generally escaped the attacks of this destructive insect, I adopted that season for sowing, viz: from the 28th of September to the end of the first week in October. This plan had the desired effect, and only in two instances has it failed for the space of nearly forty years, and in this instance it was attribute able to extraordinary seasons, for the heat of summer extended into late autumn, accompanied with drought; 1847 was the last of these seasons when, in consequence of too early sowing, a warm autumn, and a drought, with very warm weather in the spring, the crop of 1817 was the merest trifle that I every remember He also recommends a a cheap top dressing for wheat, which is very efficient, to sow half a bushel of Genesee plaster as soon as the wheat, is up in the fall, or very early in spring not later than the first day of April earlier if possible. The suggestions of Mr. Pale would seem worth the trial f as they are based on so many years' experience; and even if successful but in one half or two thirds of the instances, would be, no doubt, a great saving of wheat in the whole country. Of it should prove equally so as in his own case, many farmers would feel that his alone would amply repay the country for the whole volume of our report. One of our most intelligent correspondents remarks, that the fly does not work in cloudy weather. Possibly this fact may suggest something in the method to be adopted for the prevention of its ravages. The following method of preventing brand or rust in wheat, is taken from that most excellent German periodical, the Oekonomische Neuigkeiten, of Prof. Hlubek. It is given by a distinguished agriculturists, a correspondent of the journal just mentioned, Drobnik, of Bremen. He says, for thirty years I have found the following successful Place the sheaves of winter wheat, perfectly ripe, from the stand126Ex. king haul m to the hard grain, upon a thrashing floor, the ears upwards; beat them with a stick, and then throw them aside into an empty space; of the grain which has fallen upon the floor, perfectly ripe, and well filled out which must first be thoroughly shaken up and t leaned in the granary take the quantity necessary fr seed. Some hours, at the longest six or eight hours, before sowing, prepare a steep of, three measures of burnt lime, reduced to powder, and ten measures of urine of cattle, so that two quarts of this steep may be poured upon one peck of the seed, and by stirring it up with a spade be thoroughly incorporated together, and every berne l be entirely covered over white by it. By using seed so prepared, rust of wheat of every kind will be avoided; and I have often noticed, that while in the neighboring fields, a greater part of the crop is affected by the brand, in mine, lying close to it, not a single ear so affected could be found. The high character of the journal and its correspondent entitles this recommendation to attention. It is believed that similar steps may have been used, though possibly not in the same proportions, in this country among our farmers. The method of obtaining the grain, by knocking off the choice kerseys from the sheaf before it is subjected to the steep, m in perhaps be new, and deserve trial. In one of the numbers of the Prairie Farmer, we find a suggestion which seems also worthy of notice. The writer says that it may be well to. save wheat that has remained good, from the fields destroyed in a great degree by rust or insects, for seed; and that perhaps some peculiarity in it may make it rust or insect proof. The hint is a good one; and in cases where the grain all around has so suffered while it has been untouched, it seems to indicate strongly that it is a harder variety, or less susceptible of damage, than its neighbors. It is easily ascertained, and requires only a little more than ordinary care in selection, should it be found to be effectual. The papers of our correspondents, in reply to the questions in the circular, and which l are inserted in the appendix, No. 3, are so full of various suggestions respecting the varieties of wheat, modes of culture, cost of raising, and other particulars, while others, also, are embraced in Professor Necks introduce tory remarks to his report of the analysis of wheat and flour, (appendix, No. 1,) that it may not be advisable to dwell further on the usual topics that have heretofore occupied this portion of our report. A species of spring wheat is mentioned as having been introduced into the northern part of I own and Wisconsin from the He driver settlement, in the latitude of 450 to 51' north, which is recommended as worthy of attention. I to grain is said to by equal to winter wheat, and the crop is more certain, so far as it has been tried; and it is likewise thought by some that it would answer well further north' Among the <a name="seeds9"><mark>seeds</mark></a> distributed from the office this year, are three kinds of wheat from Syria, brought out by Lieutenant Lynch. One of them is said to be fromKerak, the ancient capital of To ab, another from Damascus, and a third from Charon) in x. 
127Palestine. It is hoped that some of these may ve get ate, and thus their character and adaptation to our country may be ascertained. These varieties are all spring wheat As other varieties, which are embraced also in the selection of this year from our own country, are a kind called Florence wheat, taken originally from the straw in which Greenoughs statue of Washington was packed at the time the box containing it was opened, it is, therefore, undoubtedly of I italian, and probably Florentine origin. A good account is given of it as a fair, handsome wheat, that promises well. There are also a choice spring wheat, and the best white flint variety that could be obtained from the western part of New Work. Barleyso little barley is raised, and, in many cases when it is sown, more for the purpose of 'a green r crop or feed out to stock, that it seldom is noticed even in the agricultural journals of those States which furnish the largest portion of the whole crop of the country. We have, therefore, found it exceedingly difficult to obtain any replies to the questions relating to it in the circular. Usually it is said but little is raised, or passed over without the slightest notice. To give anything of the history of a progress of such a crop would be a vain attempt. The attention of some in the south appears to be turning to it as a valuable crop, and by individuals it is praised as equal to oats. This is a reason stated for its increase in certain portions of this section of our country The variety of the Cheltenham black skinned barley, distributed this year from the Patent Office, which has been obtained from England, if it should fulfil the promise of its growth in that country, described in our last report, pages 120, 121, may prove a valuable acquisition. It is described as remarkably productive, and yielding an excellent flour, and is said to have originally come from Abyssinia. Now far it may have suffered in coming across the ocean, we cannot say; but as <a name="seeds10"><mark>seeds</mark></a> undoubtedly do sometimes thus injure, the want of success on the first trial should not be taken as sure proof that it is, useless. Possibly, too, it may require various trials to ascertain the precise adaptation of season for sow it, and its best culture. A change of it from such a climate and soil as that where it has succeeded in England, to a different one in our own country, may prevent its entire success, and yet, further researches or ex peri cents might show that it is eminently fitted to take its plan e among out products if tried in a more appropriate time and place. In distributing it, such directions have been added as could be obtained from the valuable English f journals, where it is described and commended. Two kinds of barley are likewise among the <a name="seeds11"><mark>seeds</mark></a> received through Lieutenant Lynch from n Syria; One of these is from Aingaddi, and the other is noted as being from Syria merely. He may, likewise, mention here, as a kindred grain, the hour a or mill et from Syria, which belongs to the same selection. Of care is 128 X. 4 taken, and the seed should not have been injured by transmission, possibly this grain may thus be introduced into the country, and prove of value as a subsidiary crop. Barley is recommended very highly in. the South Carolinians as a suitable crop for the south. The writer says it is the only grain which will mature a crop in the south from the winters moisture in the earth, and being originally cultivated in the hot climates of Arabia; Persia and Egypt, is admirably adapted to the climate of South Carolina. It is subject to no disease save an occasional head being blasted, and no other insect but the Hessian fly attacks it. It has long been cultivated, he states, in Lexington and Newberry districts, and has produced 72 bushels to the acre, a product secured by the use of a' com post of cotton seed, de composed in the mule stables, and stable manure. Of sown successively from September to the month of February, it will afford a succession of the best soiling material as food for, horses and much cows from March to the 1st of June, and thus supplies that trying time, which is so disastrous to stock, with goodnutritious herb age. It is thus fed off till the beards become too hard and the barley which is mowed before it rises into joint, will make a good crop of grain, while that which has not showed its heads, but merely jointed before being mowed off, will push up an irregular crop, which, when ripened, makes a capital summer pasture for hogs, just as they require extra attention. The writer also pronounces barley " a better food than corn for horses, mules, cattle and hogs, as well as furnishing the best of food for poultry, if ground into coarse meal, such as is commonly called chop sand mixed with cut straw or fodder, it is un rival led for working stock. It fattens all animals fed with it with great rapidity. While in i New Work, I n diana, corn usually commands fifty cents, barley rates at sixty cents per bushel. The writer declares further, that as much barley can be grown there on any soil as of I indian corn, while it is not so much labor to reap and thresh it out and, independent of this gain in labor, there is a clear gain of 16 in the value of the crop over a corn crop. Another writer in the Alabama Planter, concur ring in the above statement there quoted, also remarks, that letting it go to seed, cutting it just as it is turning from the milky to the hard state, and curing it as oats, when cut up in a chaff c utter, with a small addition# of chopped stuff, as a most superior feed for horses, mules and oxen; an acre is certainly superior to two acres of oats used in the same way. Oatsthe o at crop experienced some of the same vicissitudes as did the other grain crops; and in parts of the country suffered from the drought. It is doubted, however, whether the injury was so extensive in regard to this crop as with respect to I indian corn. At least the notices which have met our observation do not warrant that conclusion. The crop is a very large one, both on account of its being cultivated in nearly every State, and also from x Sac. Com 59. 19th being. one which is raised everywhere in considerable quanti nm any parts of the country its progress was rapid and successful. The season was favorable, a larger .breadth was sown, and it was gathered in fine order. It is not thought necessary to go into much detail. In New England and the Southern States, the extremes, it is mentioned as having 'been good n New Jersey, part of Pennsylvania, New Work, Maryland, ,and Ohio, complaint is made either ,of drought, or too wet weather. But in by far the largest breadth of land, the account is most favorable. In a few instances, s the increase is rated as high as 70 or 8.0 or even 100 per cent , in some others 40 or 50 per cent while in the most of the States the usual estimate is from 20 to 25 per cent. gain. The ratio of decrease given is much less in these cases, where it is considered as having fallen off. The cultivation of oats appears to be increasing in Michigan, and in some parts of Georgia and Alabama. The replies of our correspondents, inserted in the appendix, and to which reference has already been made, render it less necessary that we should go into detail. The quality of the grain in those cases where the crop did not suffer by the rains or the drought, is spoken of as better than usual; in some cases 15 per cent. better in this respect than the crop of the year previous. Eyes t is not easy to form any satisfactory conclusions respecting this crop in our country. Though limited to but a few States, yet even in these so little attention is paid to its appearance, it is so seldom noticed in the accounts of the growing crops, that the materials for the estimate are, at the best, extremely scanty. For do we find much additional aid in the re, p lies of our correspondents; the general answer is, but little raised, some is grown but we cannot form any judgment, or something similar; so that we are at fault and left to gather up a few fragments and from them deduce our estimates, on which we cannot place equal reliance as on some other better known crops. In glancing over the collection we have made from the letters of our correspondents, we have been led to the conclusion that iniNew England the rye crop the past year was more successful than the preceding one. In some parts of these States there was not so much sown; in others more attention was given to it. Themiaximum of increase in these States, as well as in Ohio and Pennsylvania, does not appear to have exceeded 10 per cent, except in a single county of Michigan, and another in Ohio, where it is high as 25 in the former and 40 per cent. in the latter case. The amount, however, in both cases, was quite limited. In Massachusetts, our intelligent correspondent supposes that there was not more than three-fourths of the number of acres sown; but the crop was very fine. To in Vermont, it was a good crop; better than in 1847. In eastern Massachusetts a medium one. In the southwestern corner of New York 10 per cent. more, on account of the fly in the wheat for two or three years past; fully equal to last5130Ex. year. In New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio, where noticed, it is thought to have been 10 per cent. better; the dry season being favorable to its growth. In some parts of Maryland it is thought to have been 20 per cent. better. It is also reckoned as an average crop in South Carolina; while in Georgia, Alabama, and Texas, somewhat more attention has been paid to it than in previous years. Thus in Alabama it is stated that it grows well on all lands in the region of Jackson county, and is a good crop every year. I n Walker county, Georgia, the increase is placed at 10 per cent, as there was more planted. In Robertson county, Texas, it is thought to have been double the crop of 1847. The Multicole rye which was distributed from this office some years since, is apparently gaining fast in Vermont. The editor of the Vermont State Agriculturists praises it; and, though his experiment was not as full as he could have i wished, alludes to its name, and says that it stools out more perfectly than any other grain he ever met with. From 10 to 20 s talks grew from every seed that had vegetated, and one sort in particular, he says, numbered 31 s talks; each with a good head on it, the aggregate length of which was 14 feet 3 inches, and the number of grains 2,128, The heads of the entire crop, he further states, averaged about 4 inches in length. In one of the replies to the circular from Vermont, we find this grain also alluded to thus: "the new kind (of rye) called theMulticole' has been introduced amongst us the past year, and is highly spoken of both on account of the quantity of the crop and the quality of the meal. I am informed that it produces, without any extra preparation of the land, from 40 to '50 bushels to the acre. It would appear to be well adapted for the higher northern latitudes in our country, and may yet prove a most valuable addition to their productsBuckwheatThis, again, is one of those crops so little raised as to render it almost impossible, without an actual estimate, to fix the amount even with approximating reliance. It is highly commended by many as a manure for other crops, though, in this respect, not equal to c lover. It allows, however, two such crops to be turned in a season, and on this account may prove a valuable aid to the farmer. With respect to the amount raised for seed, there was a better crop than ordinary in some of the Western, States, where it has not heretofore received much attention. It seems to be now more in demand, and, therefore, more is planted. In the interior, which did not suffer so severely from drought, the crop succeeded much better than along the coast. This cause probably lessened the amount considerably in portions of the two largest of the States where it is cultivatedNewYork and Pennsylvania. Taken altogether, therefore, it is doubtful if it was more than an average crop. In western Massachusetts, Vermont, western Newyork, in parts of Pennsylvania, and I n diana, and I illinois, it is placed, in replies to the office circular, at an advance varying from x a. 131 10 to 25 per cent; while in New Jersey, and other portions of New Work, the drought is supposed to have lessened it from 10 per cent. to one third of the whole crop; and in I own, the crop also was short, on account of the weather it experienced. The demand of this grain for market is quite limited, arid, therefore the inducements to engage in its cultivation are small. Most of what is raised is consumed at home, and hardly a wakens observation. In some of the replies from portions of the country where it is not raised, it is suggested that it would probably succeed well; but, till a greater demand exists for it, it is not likely that it will be attempted. A description it, called the blue buckwheat, has been mentioned as yielding better than the common species, besides, also, making superior flour. Some of this seed has been procured for distribution. Baize or I indian corn his is always a large crop. It forms so much of a staple in many States, and is so relied on for the feeding of various stock, that there will be in every season a large amounts own. Probably the increased and still further expected demand of the previous year, operated to make the agriculturists of our country lay out a still greater breadth of their soil than usual in this favorite crop. In some parts of the country we find complaints of the dryness of the spring; in others, that the weather, soon after it was planted, by its coldness retarded the early growth. Still, however, it seems on the whole to have been very promising, till into June or July; the na severe drought retarded its growth in many sections of our country, and great fears were excited lest it should be permanently injured. This drought was very extensive, especially along the Atlantic coast. In the interior it does not appear to have been felt with sq much severity. Happily, however, the rains commenced just as it was on the point of withering, and restored it in a measure, though no doubt a considerable diminution of the crop from what it would have been was occasioned by this drought. The crop, even with this drawback, was doubtless larger than ever before gathered, as the number of acres devoted to it had been so large. We will glance at the various stages of its growth in different sections of our country. In the northern extremity of our country, I own and Michigan, western New Work, Vermont, New Hampshire, Paine, Massachusetts and other New England States, the accounts represent it as promising in June and July. The I own Farmer says, the corn crop is described as most promising. The other journals in the northern States use similar language, and throughout nearly the whole of this extent, in the replies to the circular, we have it estimated at 5 per cent, 10 percent, 15 per cent, 20, 25, 30, 40, and even in some cases up to 75,nd 100 per cent. advance on the crop of 1847. By others it is represented as having been a good crop both in quantity and quality large; a large increase; first rate everywhere; a heavy crop. Generally, the favorable season is assigned as one cause, and 132 X. Doc. B. 59. More planted" is also among the common ones. Thus, in Newhaimrpshire, the early spring, it is said, allowed planting in, good h season and the great and steady heat in August brought it to per feet maturity. In taking the next line of States, including those from Missouri illinois, through I n diana, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Newyork, and the other Atlantic States, as low as Virginia; we find the accounts both early and late, very similar, though perhaps admitting of more varieties, owing to the greater breadth of the Atlanticcoist, The drought of the latter part of the season of its growth more sensibly affected the progress of this crop along th' coast than in the interior. ,speaking of southern Ohio, it is said in the Prairie Farmer, the cold dry weather that continued told the middle of June, checked the progress of corn, but the rain and worm weather that succeeded caused it to push up rapidly. To the I indianapolis State Journal, of June, describes the cornfields as having never exhibited a fairer prospect, and states that they are one or two weeks earlier than usual. The dry weather is said to have been favorable, while the draining of the clay soil in mi any places has enlarged the crop by developing new corn fields which have been brought under cultivation. Somewhat later, the Ohio Cultivator, mentioning the crop, says, The corn crop bids fair to ripe n in good season, and the yield will be large The Lexington (by) It las, speaking of a personal observation of the corn crop in the: counties of Gazette, Franklin, Woodford, Shelby, Pence r, Jefferson, in the month of April, says it will beunprecedently fine. In the earlier part of the season such seems indeed to have been the aspect of this crop very generally throughout the whole of this extent. The New Work, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland journals allude to the forward and excellent state of the growing corn but the drought was peculiarly severe in the eastern sections of the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and eastern Virginia, bordering on the coast. During the months of June, July, and August, we find frequent allusion to this evil. One says, if the present drought continues, we shall have but a sorry crop of corn; another calls it very un propitious; and similar language is found in the various public journals. Met, amid these discouragements, we meet also with declarations in the early part of August, in portions of these very States thus suffering, which mention that the corn crop will be overwhelming, and what is more, singular, fears are expressed that the exceeding wet and rainy weather-nine days of constant or intermittent reins, &i may injure the corn in low swamp y grounds, and hopes are entertained that in others it will prove of great benefit. Looking at the estimated results of the corn crop in the same great sections of the country, as furnished in the replies of x. 133 our correspondents, we find a very general agreement that the crop was a large one, and an increase above that of the preceding year. The increase for I illinois varies from 10 to 15 and 20 percent. more. Of I n diana, the estimates place it, in a few cases, at about 10 per cent, but most frequently as high as 20 and 25 percent. increase. It appears to be the universal belief that more was planted. To in Ohio and Kentucky it is called a good crop, an increase; 5 per cent, 10 per cent, 20, 25, and even sometimes 75 percent, is supposed to be a fair exhibition of the rate of the gain over the, crop of 1847. The impression is likewise evident that a greater breadth of ground was allotted to this crop, the past year, than previously. In the large States of New York and Ohio, the increase is regarded as having been very considerable; 15, and up to 25 per cent is a common estimate of the gain over the previous year; and it is only till we begin to approach the coast in eastern New Work, Newjersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, that we find a falling off of 5 per cent, 10 per cent, and in one or two cases rising as high as 50, or half the crop, from that of 1847. The southern corn crop is much earlier, perhaps by a month or two months, than of those States we have before referred to. I to early promise was good. Even as far south as Last Florida, it is mentioned in a local journal, on the 25th of May, that a large quantity of corn has been planted this year. In Alabama, the 6th of June, the corn crop is stated to look remarkably well, and to premise a fine harvest. In Louisiana, on the 27th of May, the weather is described as having been, thus far, the most propitious for the corn crop. The State Gazette, of Montgomery, Alabama, early in June, says that the corn crop has been a little injured by dry weather in May but the recent showers are stated to have revived it, and it promised well. In the interior, near Watched, we meet, in the middle of May, with complaints of drought, which has impaired the prospect of the corn crop. At a later date, about the middle of July, we find mention made in North Carolina -of the recent rains, by which the corn crop has, improved very much; and it is said, though the cool weather of April and May was unfavorable, yet it is believed there will be an abundant yield. It would be easy to quote many other statements of a similar kind, but we will refer to the various reports in the appendix already mentioned, and merely gather up a few of the estimated results in the answers to the circular of this office. The upper and eastern section of North Carolina is thought to have suffered a loss of from one quarter to one third of the growing crop. In South Carolina and Georgia, the increase is variously estimated at 10 or 15 per cent, while, in other cases, it is considered a fair average crop. In Alabama, there was a gain of 5,10 or more per cent; and the causes assigned are, that the spring was forward and favorable; the planting early, and the lands in fine order134Ex. a' In Tennessee, though complaint is made of local cause, yet it is judged to have been a larger crop than the year before. 'I n Mississippi, it is said to have been good; while in some of the counties of Texas the gain is put at 50 per cent. on the previous year. It is not deemed necessary to enter into further detail. Enough has been ascertained to convince us that though the early cold drought of April and May in some sections, and the still later and hot one of June, July, and August, in others, reduced the corn crop from what it would have been; yet, with all this lessening, it must be reckoned a heavy crop, much above the average of one year, taken with another, and an advance upon that of the preceding one. The appearance of it in many of the States where the drought was afterwards felt, as we know from personal observation, was uncommonly promising as late as August; the s talks vigorous and tall, while the ears appeared to be forming unusually well. A variety of corn has been procured from Richard Rouzie, esq of Tappahannock, A, which is said to possess some excellence is. He states that it is the result of experiments for thirty-two years in a like number of varieties, foreign and domestic, and adds, "I consider it the most productive corn I have ever seen, yielding to the acre, more in corn, and to the bushel more in meal than any of the varieties experimented in. Some of my neighbors who have obtained seed from us say they think their crops have increased one third over other varieties they have cultivated. The cob is generally red, the fangs of the berne l, therefore, partake of its color, and does not give it in bulk the pearly appearance the grain would have from a white cob. Some of our most intelligent farmers, however, value it more on this account, as they are of opinion that on the red cob corn matures more rapidly and perfectly than on white ones You will perceive" he adds, some of the ears are more remarkable for their circumference than length, whilst others are the very opposite; when obtained by me, I remarked to the gentleman from whom I obtained them, that I should separate the varieties; he advised me not to do so, stating that he had obtained them from different sections, and that they had never intermixed; this appeared to me incredible; nevertheless, I followed his advice, and in fifteen years' cultivation find them as distinct as they were when first obtained. In relation to the time of planting, I am of opinion that the first of April, for our latitude, would be early enough." In the subject of seed corn, Mr. Rouzie further says: "I would advise the strictest attention to its selection. By this, varieties will improve, and without, will certainly deteriorate. My plan has been, at shocking time, to select an ear of my choice, and to give it to the hands for sample; all such ears as they find in shocking are thrown aside for seed, and perhaps three or four times the quantity  need; this is kept till planting time, when I attend in person and make a farther selection from it, enough for my purpose Specimens of the above described corn will be distributed among x. 135 other <a name="seeds12"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, to the members of Congress and prominent agriculturists of our country, in the hope that it may be a valuable addition to varieties already found in our country. It is probable, however, that the success may be greater in the southern than in the northern sections of the country, as being better adapted to the warmer than colder climate. A variety of corn, called the improved early Button, from Mr. Des, of New Hampshire it and Oregon corn, will be embraced likewise in the list of those distributed. Of this improved early Button, Mr. Mass Des, of Newport, I N. H., says: 'I It had been acclimated in the northern part of the State of Paine, and brought back here about ten years ago; and I have each year since that time saved and planted the earliest large ears, and, as I think, thereby improved it. One year I planted it the 27th day of May, and being a very warm season, it was ripe in ninety days from planting." It is prolific in ears, and one peculiar excellence of the corn is, that the s talks of the corn are very small compared with the size of the ear. In usual seasons, when it is planted about the 20th of May, it will be fit to harvest in one hundred days. It should be planted on a rich soil, because the ears, being large, require more nourishment than, the small crowed Canada corn. It is mentioned by gentlemen from the south, that the you rd seed variety, when planted in the uplands, often becomes the flint corn. Specimens of ears exhibiting this change have been presented ta the office; and while the you rd seed is a long, fine ear, the specimen of the flint, from similar seed raised in the upland, is a much shorter ear, and contains twenty rows, giving a large number ofkernels to the ear. <a name="potato6"><mark>Potato</mark></a> crop For some years past, it is well known that the success of this crop has seemed to depend on the point, whether or not it is affected by the disease that is termed the <a name="potato7"><mark>potato</mark></a> roth n reviewing the history of the <a name="potato8"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop during the year 1848,so far as we have been able to ascertain it, we have come to the conclusion, that while in portions of New ~england and the middle States considerable loss was experienced from the <a name="potato9"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, yet, on the whole, it was not as great as in the preceding year. In the northwestern States, the evil prevailed more than ever before. The rot did not, probably, destroy, as many <a name="potatoes6"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in paine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut, as in the earlier years of its appearance. Other causes, such as the season, lessened the quantity raised in some portions of these States, and the proportion of loss is variously estimated at from 20 to 59 per cent. Thus, in Essex county, Massachusetts, the crop is said to have been unusually light not more than half a crop; this was not owing to the rot, as they were rotted but little. The blight struck them about the first of August, and a total failure was expected, but they turned out better than was anticipated. In parts of New Jersey, there was a larger prop than that of the previous year. In Pennsylvania, it is believed that the rot was not so severe as generally, but the discouragements of the former years may have prevented so many from being planted; there are, how 136 X. never, some cases where the increase is noted as probably 10 percent. or more. As we proceed westward in northern New Work, the disease is said to have been worse than ever, and so in other portions more central and western of that State. Met in some cases, here too, we observe an increased crop. notwithstanding the injury sustained by the rot. Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, I own, I n diana, and I illinois, appear to have had the heaviest portion of the disease. In almost all the reports from these States, it is mentioned as prevalent with more or less intensity, in such language as this: nearly a total failure, 75 per cent 50 per cent, down to one quarter and one third less than in 1847. In one of the reports from I n diana, it is stated that both kinds, the sweet potato, as well as the common or I wish, were affected by the rot, a fact which would seem to be vi by unusual, for in all the States in which the sweet potato is raised largely, we do not recollect of ever seeing any mention made of its thus suffering. He find no statement respecting the prevalence of the disease south of the Ohio river. I need from the returns thus far, we have not noticed it as extending lower down than Picking county, in Ohio. As it was very severe here, however, the presumption is, that it reached further south. It does not appear to have been felt in the southern States, and but little in Virginia. The sweet potato crop in general, was fully equal to that of the past year, and in some cases larger. In Texas the <a name="potato10"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop appears to have suffered more than usual from drought, and in some counties the estimate is, that, it was less by one half or two thirds than in the previous year. Taking the whole crop through, the evidence furnished us as to its state is, that there was a gain on the crop of 1847 not large, but still enough to encourage the hope, that in a few years the disease will have spent its strength, and the <a name="potato11"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop may resume its former place of comparative productive ness. We shall look with interest to the results of this crop furnished by the next census. <a name="potato12"><mark>Potato</mark></a> rot is regards the disease, we do not propose to go into a lengthened review of the same. It may be proper, however, to place together such new facts as we have noticed since the last report. One or two points seem to be well settled, that the best course to be adopted is to plant early, that the tubes may have time to become well formed and partially matured before the period at which the attack commences. This, as has been shown in former reports, varies from the middle of July to the middle of August. There appears to be a general concurrence, as to this, in the replies which have been furnished to the circular. From Vermont, we are informed that the <a name="potatoes7"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> do best on grass lands, and old pastures ploughed in the spring, and with little or no manure. In Maryland, the remedy recommended is sound seed; early planting, and early securing them. In Essex county, Massachusetts, it is said the early planted, and least manured, succeeded best. X. a. 137 striking fact, in relation to the preservation of some <a name="potatoes8"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> partially diseased, is mentioned in a report from Range county, New Work, It took place the war previous. Mr. W. H. Fenton, of Os hen, it is stated, having lost most of his crop the year before last, the next year raised about thirty bushels Mergers, upon a spot of rich, sandy soil. He put but one half in his cellar, the most of which spoiled; and the other half he buried in his garden, and in the spring following, supposing that they had, of course, shared the fate of the others, he examined them, and to his great surprise discovered that they were sound, and in first rate order. The question arises here, what was the cause of this preservation? Was it simply burying them, or was there some peculiarity in the nature of the garden soil, which thus operated to prevent the spread of the evil. The same fact is also said to have been realized by other gentlemen in the same neighborhood. One of our correspondents, writing from It. Lawrence county, New Work, says: " <a name="potatoes9"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> planted as early as the middle of April on dry ground, are nearly free from the rot. I selected three acres of side hill, broke it up in September, manured it with well rotted barn yard manure, at the rate of twenty loads to the acre, last fall, ploughed and dragged it, and fitted it for planting in the spring, and planted it from the 8th to the 10th of April. While planting, the weather became so cold that I had one man cover as fast as another dropped the <a name="potatoes10"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, lest they should freeze. The ground froze more than an inch deep. But the <a name="potatoes11"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> came up and grew well. We finished hoping them the last day of May. They then looked finely That very night the frost killed them down to the ground. Again they grew to about the same height as before, and again the frost killed them, down. They were hold the second and last time, the 20th of June. They appeared tolerably well, but not so fine as at first About the 20th of August, the tops indicated disease and soon died down to the ground. All the potatos were fair, smooth and sound, except where the manure was not thoroughly spread. I n such places there would be two or three rotten <a name="potatoes12"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a hill should not think there were three bushels of rotten <a name="potatoes13"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on the three acres. The writer says farther, I attribute the disease to an atmospheric cause, and infer that my <a name="potatoes14"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had so far matured, before the disease commenced, as not to be destroyed by it6But still it is difficult to account for the diminution of the crop. Had only two hundred bushels on an acre. In the same ground, with the same cultivation, five or six years ago, I should have expected a much larger crop5There are some points in the above account which may plain j our attention. Did not the manure in this case prove beneficial, because of the extreme cold weather? and had it been warm n, instead of frosty, might not this addition have rendered the crop more liable to disease? '2d. Now far di the dying off of the tops operate as a preventive against this disease? The loss of them may, perhaps, account for the diminution of the crop, or rather the cold238Ex. weather which cut them off may do so. To draw any decided conclusions from the facts, it would seem necessary that the experiment should be repeated in similar and also in different circumstances. To many things concur red in this instance that it may be difficult to separate out the precise bearing of each particular to the general result. It is, however, a case of interest, and may well be placed among the facts which have been collected in such variety and quantity on this subject. It is the same hard task now as it has ever been to reconcile all the recorded facts with one theory. Any have done speculating on the nature of the disease, perfectly convinced that the cause will never be discovered. Still there is an advantage in watching the progress further on from year to year, and it is hoped, in those places especially where it is but recent or has not yet appeared, its aspect will be carefully studied and the facts recorded, particularly those that are in any measure different from what has been elsewhere observed. It may be well, also, to notice if new phases of the disease shall be assumed in those places where it has been longest known. In the Transactions of the N. Y. State Agricultural Society for 1847, we find an essay on the <a name="potato13"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, by C. E. Good rich, ofUtica, in which the writer lays down these two propositions. 1st. The immediate cause of the <a name="potato14"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease is sudden and extreme alterations of weather occurring at critical periods in the growth of the plant. 2d. The remote cause is the exhausted energy of nearly the whole species, cultivated in Europe and the Unitedstates. These positions the writer endeavors to sustain, with much ingenious adaptation of facts and plausible argument at ion. He has, since the publication of the essay, also expressed his firm conviction of the correctness of his conclusions, drawn from facts of after occurrence. It appears to us, however, that, like all the theories which have been b reached, this, too, is liable to some serious objections, It might for instance be asked, how is it that varieties of weather so directly contradictory should produce the same effect in different places? or, why the same sudden alternations of weather, which must more or less have long before existed, should have left the <a name="potato15"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop uninjured? or, if the period of the exhaustion of energy had not before been reached, how the <a name="potato16"><mark>potato</mark></a> introduced at such diverse periods into different countries should have so simultaneously had its energy exhausted? or, yet a harder question, whyseedlings from the native country of the <a name="potato17"><mark>potato</mark></a> should have like vise suffered? These could not be comprehended under the same category of exhausted energy at one and the same period, It is alleged, indeed, that the disease is confined to northern climates. But the writer seems not aware that in Europe this has not always been the case, as it was also felt in the southern countries of that continent. And it should also be recollected, that but very few, comparatively, of the common <a name="potato18"><mark>potato</mark></a> are raised in our x. a. 139 southern States. Of course there is but little material to keep alive any epidemic, and it has not ground upon which to operate. The facts in relation to the alternations of the weather, which, are relied on for proof, will be found to correspond only with the state of the case in particular countries or sections of the same country, While the directly contrary ore existed in others. Met anyone look over the vast mass of reports from Europe and this country, and try to square the statements of the weather with those noted by the author as having fallen under his experience and observation, and we believe he will be convinced it is a perfectly vain attempt, The writer speaks of a sandy soil as unfavorable; yet, in a vast number of statements, it is a sandy soil which is thought the best. While he re lies on the fact with him, that shading from the cold words injures the vines, others adopt the directly contrary conclusion. We might refer to the statements respecting the disease in France, by M. May en, found in the report for 1845, page 666, and also to report for 1817, page 142, and Count Gasparins opinion, on pages 147, 148, of the report for the same year, to corroborate some of the objections we have just stated to Mr. Goodrichs theory. Any other pages also of the reports could be quoted, in which facts are stated which do not t ally with his views. The more we read and study the accounts from all quarters, which have passed under our eye, attempting to attribute the disease with any degree of definiteness to some particular general cause, the more we become convinced that the objections are too numerous to allow of its adoption. The facts as to the appearance of the outward or internal structure cf the sound or diseased <a name="potato19"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the changes which it more or less gradually undergoes, and the probable immediate causes of these changes in the individual cases, are interesting subjects of record, and may help us to understand the history of its almost endlessly diversified phases. It is believed that probably a greater mass of material on this subject has been collected for these reports than at any other place in the United States; and our conviction has grown deeper from year to year, that the true cause will probably never be discovered. The researches made in Europe have been with no sparing of expense, and conducted by some of the ablest scientific investigator of the age; but the point of discovery seems only the further removed by the development of new facts as the disease proceeds from year to year. In the Genesee Farmer for September, the following information respecting the disease of the <a name="potato20"><mark>potato</mark></a> is said to have been communicated by Mr. F. J. Debts, of Newburg, to the late meeting of the executive committee of the New York Agricultural Society. He says: I have this year planted <a name="potatoes15"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in my forcing house, which ripened some three weeks since, and upon digging them, I found several entirely rotten. I deem this fact of some importance in ascertaining the nature x. of the disease, as it certainly refutes some of the theories sin respect to it. The house is kept at as even a temperature as practicable, without the use of artificial heat, and the ground is continually moist neither sudden alternations of heat, therefore, nor sudden changes from dry to wet, can be the cause of the disease. The soil is made 31 feet deep, very rich from the admixture of well rotted manure, much and shell mary, and limed very heavily. Similar facts have heretofore been observed in Europe respecting plants raised in conservatories, and where an even temperature was maintained n the American Farmer for September, it is stated that in Fenton  Maryland, on the borders of the Shop tank, the <a name="potato21"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot is unknown. The land there is high and sandy, and the writer seems to suppose, that the high sandy soil may be the cause. Unfortunately, however, in other counties the disease has prevailed in such soils. Among some of the new observations to which we may refer, we translate the following from some of the German journals of the highest authority Thus in Lloyds Austrian Journal, we find it stated, that "TheRussian Journal of the Minister of the I interior, contains a pretty circumstantial account of the <a name="potato22"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease so far as noticed in Russia. It had already, in previous Years, attacked the crop inCoCurland Livonian, Esthonia n, and the governments of Mohilew, and this year (1847) has extended itself over the whole northwestern portion of Russia, the government of Livonian, Esthonia n, Kownowilria, Vitebsk, Inst, Mohilew, Volhynia, View, Show, and Stpetersburg. In Livonian, the plants were destroyed in a state of blossom, in the middle of June; the s talks withered, the leaves dried up, and notwithstanding the warm weather, they were affected as if after a cold night. In the contrary, in the government of Mohilew, up to the 15th of August, (old style) and so to the end of August, no sign was seen of the disease, but then it broke out suddenly and spread itself daily." Were we have, therefore, two different kinds of processes, which only render the matter so much the more inexplicable. The ad munitions how the <a name="potatoes16"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be managed in seeing, and the attempts at explanation areas useless here as elsewhere. In an article in the Central Platt of the Bavaria n Agriculturalsociety, for March last, we find the following remedy by Dr. Veins ch. After describing the internal structure of the <a name="potato23"><mark>potato</mark></a>, he says: "his degeneration of the <a name="potato24"><mark>potato</mark></a>, depends on nothing else than a laceration of the cellular bags, which contains particular substances, and upon the mixture of heterogenous substances produced thereby, which cannot thus mix together with mutual decomposition. This affects not only the tube, but the whole plant, as is exhibited by the withering and rotating of the stalk, producing of bad seed, &c." I e illustrates his views by supposing in a vessel a number of little silver or glass balls, the latter of which, if filled with nitric acid, and then kept still, areExI a. 141.preiserved for years, but if the vessel be shaken so that the glass, balls should 'break, then the nitric acid becomes mixed with the silver, balls and these .are !rapidly dissolved, according to the well known phenomena of decomposition. Very <a name="potato25"><mark>potato</mark></a> may this, th essays, b be considered such a vessel, in which in place of little silver balls, millions of grains of starch meal are preserved, near which are nitrogenous substances enclosed in little bladders, as welLasalbumen, &c, and probably cells' which contain vegetable lees. Acid 127) the editor of the journal above mentioned, from which we have translated this view, observes i in a note appended: :he will barely  remark, that the 'fact of the original cause of the laceration of the cells, (the thinness of the cellular walls and the excessive filling of the cells) being now so abundant after more than a hundred years cultivation, is the first etiological point of importance which, above all things, deserves to be most closely examined Different remedies continue to be proposed in Europe, among which may be mentioned those by Mr. Wander Rapp e, of Wesselprussia, and the more celebrated one of Dr. Clots ch. Thee mode of cultivation adopted by the former gentleman has not l been published. 'he asserts, however, that he planted on er half of a large pile of <a name="potatoes17"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the usual way, and another half according to the plan 'which he had discovered. The <a name="potatoes18"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> cultivated in the common way were diseased, and the leaves withered and dried up at an early period, while those which 'were r managed after his new plan, were successful and continued green till late in the autumn, The tubes so proved s und, and the yield as largeThetubeao rsoandheyiedaslargeheexperiment was so decisive that a committee was appointed to examine into the facts, which, it is stated, they' have published officially, and recommended to have the secret made known. The method of Dr. Clots ch has excited more attention both in4hisown country and elsewhere. His ,high standing as the keeper of the royal herbarium, and, his' reputation as a distinguished vegetable physiology st, together with his success, seemed to entitle his opinions to more 'than common weight. The minister of the interior of Russia referred the question to the allege of Agricultural Economy by whom it was again referred to their president. Dr. Clots ch made a full exposition of his method to this gentleman, and he speaks of it in the following laniguagecid127ase :find it in Dr. On Lengerkes Anna len, vol. Xli, p. 197: " This method is not a merely fortunate chance, but Dr. iKlotschhas been led to it by his general opinions on the subject of 'vegetable physiology. He already employed it in :the year 1846 successfully; and in a renewed experiment, made ,both on a larger scale and comparatively this year, (a, 1847,) as he asserts, he obtained a more decided result' He adds, ' Driklotsch has a high reputation in Germany as a botanist and vegetable physiology st, and in! England is quoted as authority. He is as very clear, sensible, and prudent man. His proposal t guarantees every possible security, "i &c; and closes 'byismsying that the is inclined to regard the method as ain effectual one. 142 X. a. It is stated that the college concur red in the report of their president, and the trial was undertaken. The report of the experiment we have not yet seen. The following is the method of cultivation recommended by Dr. Clots ch, which we find also in the same journal. We give here only the substance, reserving the full description for the appendix, if thought best to insert i the sets the tubes as usual, and in the 5th, 'th, and 7th week after the setting of the same, and 4 or 5 weeks after the planting the germs with the roots, at which time the plants may be 6 to 9 inches in height above the ground, p inches off the end points of the branches or twigs, say for half an inch from the top; and this course is to be pursued on all the branches and twigs in the 10th and 11th weeks. The time of the day to do this is not mentioned this, he asserts, will check the too great development of stalk and its branches, and by increasing the nutrition matter increases the number of the branching stems, and also the ability of the root, &c. Of t might seem, from the high character of the discovered, that this method would prove a remedy to the evil. We find, however, in the London Gardeners Chronicle, of September 2, p, 590, this mode\ has also, in some cases, proved unsuccessful. In a communication there, signed M. J. B., and supposed to be from Rev. Of. Berkeley, the distinguished mycologist and warm advocate of the fungus theory of the disease, it is said, "or. Pain wright of Rush ton, Northamptonshire, has tried Dr. Klotschs plan of stopping the <a name="potato26"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, and gives the following as the result of the expert in en t; . Now in which the leading shoots were cut off: Produce, 70 I is sound, 14 lbs; diseased 56 lbs; diseased \when (leg, 14 lbs; after being dug, 42 lbs. ;now in which :the leading shoots were untouched: Produce, 86 les; sound, 23 lbs; diseased, 63 lbs; diseased when dug, 11 lb s after being dug, 52 lbs. ,giving an excess of diseased tubes in the former a stance, in the proportion of 344 to 317. The produce, however, in the former case, Was of the finer quality. The results of two weighings drive 98 lbs of sound to 111 jobs. diseased, and 46 lbs. sound to 328 lbs. diseased. In one of the communications -i made respecting the <a name="potato27"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease in Scotland, the mode in which the first appearance of the disease on the stem shows itself, is thus given The writer says: "very little rain having fallen, the fields are exceedingly dry, and though the putrid like spot on time seem is seen, yet the leaves seem most affected; and this is not occasioned by the friction of one on the other by wind, nor is the general slackening caused by frost; it comes often in the centre of the leaf, and thence extends outward, both surfaces being affected. When it first appeared it spread rapidly for two days; after that two weeks elapsed with almost no apparent increase; a further increase of the influence was again apparent, and during other two, X. 143 days the later varieties became slightly affected. During these last 8 days almost no increase has been visible; but the tubes of those first attacked are becoming affected. A dry clear air, with the soil poor, dry, and porous, with the situation and the lie of the ground open and exposed, appear to offer the greatest obstacles to its progress n the London Gardeners Chronicle, for 16th September, the following facts are given in respect to the utility of ear thing up, <a name="potatoes19"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as a means of preservation from disease. The writer says: "'I put in hillocks, on the 11th of February, four whole <a name="potatoes20"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, (farmers' Glory) a yard and a half apart, 9 inches deep, on a little stable manure. As soon as the haul m appeared, (about the middle of April) I began ear thing them up, and continued to do so until the end of Junethey were screened on the north by a hedge, and on the west by some Jerusalem artichokes and a hedge open to the east and south. The soil stiff, rich, and clay by. About three weeks after the leaves began to show blotches, and to day when dug the haul was entirely perished. I ought to have stated that only three of the four set came to anything, some sheep having eaten off one. The produce of the three <a name="potatoes21"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was 18| pounds, many of the <a name="potatoes22"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> weighing 1 pound and a little more not one diseased. All my other <a name="potatoes23"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been very bad n appendix, No. 4, will be found a few additional papers on this subject. May crop The amount of hay gathered in many of the largest States by no means affords any full criterion of the quantity of grass consumed for feeding cattle. In the western States especially, with their vast prairies, comparatively small crops of hay are reported. The stock consume what is turned to hay elsewhere in grass. Were this to be added to the tons actually cut and dried, it would, make an increase of many millions of tons. This is important to be kept in mind, as we give a slight survey of what may be called the hay crop proper. While in some of the States, where attention is paid to this product, there appears to have been a partial lessening of the amount on account of the cold dry 'spring, in others again the nature of the season is assigned as the reason for its advance over the crop of 1847. In the New England States the crop, as a whole, was probably better than in the previous year. In Paine, although complaint is made of the c lover being much cut off, yet the gain of the whole hay crop is set at about 10, to 15, and even 20 per cent. The same was the case, too, in New Hampshire. In Vermont, In general, the crop is estimated at an increase of some 10 per cent, and even in cases where it is otherwise, as in Windsor county, where was a slight falling off from the previous year, yet it is described as being a very good crop. In Massachusetts, along the coast, the reports are favorable. In Essex county, it is spoken of as unusually good 25 per cent. above the usual crop. In Plymouth county, 15 per 144 X. cent l more than in 1847. In the western portion of the State, intBerkshire county, our correspondent says that the crop was a short one compared with the average. Still he judges that there was an increase over the crop of 1847 of one quarters o one third, owing partly to new stocked meadows and the favorable weather in May which was cold and wet. In the upper part of the State of New Work, in It. Lawrence bounty, the estimate is less favorable, and it is supposed to have been 7 per cent. less. The reason assigned is, that the early part of the season was so dry as to retard the growth of grass; those Who cut theirs the earliest, had the lightest crops; so in: Jefferson county, it is said that this crop was extremely light. In Suffolkcounty, Long I s land, the rains are mentioned as the reason for the increase of 10 per cent. given. In Sullivan county, it gained 25 per cent. The same is the case, in regard to Chautauque county, where the estimate is carried as high as 35 per cent. over the crop of 1847. The hay crop is pronounced to have been less than the usual crop in Madison county, in the central part of the State, and also in the western one of Niagara. In the latter, it is supposed to have fallen one third from the crop of 1847, by the drought. In the former case, our correspondent says, " Our hay crop has been a rather short crop for the last two years, owing to some cause not exactly understood. The grass will start early, and look fine and promising for a short time; but when it should head out, not one in ten make their appearance; this last season has not been so bad as that of 1817, and the crop has been all of 25 per cent. better." In Seneca county, it is said, the favorable state of the atmosphere during the spring months and the season' of the hay harvest, enabled the farmers to secure more than an average crop of hay, probably one third more than the previous year. An annual loss is incurred on this crop by the too late in gathering of Timothy hay. As the grass ri pens here generally at the period of our wheat harvest, it is cut too late, that is, not until the seed has nearly ripened, and when the straw and leaf has parted with most of the nutritions power. In New Jersey, the supposed advance, ranges from i 20 per cent up to `a` and -of the crop. There would seem to have been a more than average crop in Pennsylvania, and in cases where the drought greatly injured the hay crop in 1847, the gain of 1848, on the former year, is placed at 30 or cent. I h those portions of Virginia, where it is noticed as among their crops, the replies we have received place the gain on the former year at from 20 up to 25 or more per cent. The good season is assigned as the cause of the better crop. The same was the case in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In the first of these States, the supposed increase of the hay crop of 1848, is differently fixed at 5, 10, 15, 20 per cent, and as high, in some cases, as 25 per cent. The season is noticed as having been much more favorable. With this agrees, also, the summary of the ab strict of returns to the Ohio board of agriculture. In examination, we perceive but three counties where hay is mentioned, in x. a. 145 Which the average product per acre for this year is not above that of the average of the five or six years. In I n diana and I illinois, so far as noticed, it is favorable to an estimated increase. In some cases, owing to more having been sown, the gain is put as high 50 per cent. Michigan yields considerable hay, and from the reports of this year the crop is advancing, as it is pronounced to have been a fine crop, excellent, 20 to 25 per cent. more. In I own, though the di ought in the early part of the summer affected it in some parts of the State, and rendered it light, still there was a very fair crop, on account of the increase of meadows, and the gain is put atl10per cent. In some of the States, as for instance in portions of Ohio, while the quantity is thought to be less, the quality is much better the c lover, especially, was started early, and ripened in season for a good yield. It would seem as if some valuable addition might be made to our stock of native grasses from California. In his work entitled, " That saw in California" Mr. E. Bryant says of the grass of that country: " The varieties of the grasses are greater than on the Atlantic side of the continent, and far more nutritions. I have seen seven different kinds of c lover, several of them in a dry state, depositing a seed upon the ground so abundant as to cover it, which is tapped up by the cattle and horses, and other animals, as corn and oats, when threshed, would be with us. All the grasses, and they cover the entire country, are heavily seemed, and when ripe, are as fattening to stock as the grains which we feed to our beef, horses, and hogsHempI n giving our estimate of this crop in the last years report, we relied on the information derived from an intelligent source from the west. We see, however, that the editor of the Western Journal, published at It. Louis, inclines to the opinion that our view of the quantity was erroneous, and indeed too large an amount was assumed. There ever has been a considerable diversity of opinion among good judges in the Western hemp growing States respecting it, and whatever be the quantity estimated, it would doubtless find some to differ from it as too. high or too low. Judging from' the best information we have been able as yet to obtain, the hemp crop was lighter in 1848 than in the previous year. In some portions of Kentucky it was equal to an average crop, in others fell short of it. Thus the Lexington It las, in August list, speaks of it: "I n the county of Woodford the hemp crop will be nearly an average one, while in Gazette, Franklin, Shelby, Pence r and Jefferson, it will fall far short. Our correspondent at It. Louis states, as the result of his inquiries, that the crop of 1847 was about 51,000 bales, or some 7,000tons, and the crop of 1848 is estimated as about equal in quantity, though the quality it is said will not be so good; thus showing adeterioration for the last three years successively." The Lexingtonatlas, in August, quotes from the letter of an intelligent farmer5146Ex. from A Gazette county, in Missouri, who says: "although there was nearly twice as much ground sown in hemp this year as last in this county, yet we really do not think there will be near so much hemp made. I have seen some pieces of hemp that positively will not be worth cuttings Kentucky and Missouri are the two States from which the largest portion of the hemp crop is derived, it is evident that we must set down the quantity raised as below the average crop. -he shall be obliged, however, to await the result of the next census before we can ascertain, with any degree of precision, what the amount is of hemp raised in the United States. By the following description of a new mode of preparing cordage, it would appear that one great difficulty which has existed respecting the application of American hemp has been obviated, and if the account proves correct, it is probable it may create a better market for this product of our soil. We had the promise of some articles on the subject of hemp which have not yet reached us. They may, however, be in time for a place in an appendix, and if so, will be there inserted. Of indestructible cordage The Cincinnati Gazette of Monday, speaks as follows of the new article of cordage manufactured by Messrs. J. T. Rook, of Last Days ville. We are glad to see it attracting the attention of business men at important points, and sincerely wish the enterprising manufacturers the most substantial success they could desire." From the manufactory of J. T. Rook & To, at Days ville, we have received a sample of cordage, manufactured by them, of rotted hemp, so kyanized by the use of antiseptic substances as to render it, they assure us, indestructible when exposed to the weather. Cordage, prepared like this, has been buried in a fungousneap, filled with decaying vegetable matter, for five years, without showing the least sign of decay. In respect to the manufacturing of cordage, they say 'I n preparing this cordage in this country we are compelled to use the un rotted hemp, since it is an established fact that antiseptics will not prevent the decay of vegetable matter, when decay has actually commenced, as is the case of our dew and water rotted hemp. The Russia hemp, in not being carried to the ferment ing point in rotating, is not, like our water rotted hemp, affected by decay, and is capable of being kyanized like the un rotted hemp, as has been successfully done in England, by the use of suitable antiseptics. The comparative value of different sorts of hemp as it regards durability, is easily and speedly tested by any one, since nearly all kinds are very short lived when exposed to causes favorable to decay. The Vanilla will last some four or five months as used in the summer season upon our steamboats the His al, which is often sold in the west as Vanilla, will not last much more than half along the Russia hemp, when kept moist and warm, will lose its strength in about three weeks the American water rotted in two weeks, and the dew rotted in from five to ten days. The unrottedEx. a. 147 hemp, without being kyanized, will not last longer than the dew rotted, and will even show more signs of putrefaction before losing its strength t 'you will perceive that the color and appearance of this cordage is similar to the Russia or water rotted hemp. The strength is greater than either, while it is not 'frayed down' like Vanilla, by friction. Other specimens of various sizes may be seen at the warehouse of Campbell, Metcalfe & To, Pain street, near Columbia, who are our agents in Cincinnati for the sale of our cordagescid127A process for preparing hemp is believed to have been lately discovered, which, should it prove all it promises, may yet render this crop of much greater value than it now is in this country. Mr. C. L. Leishman, to whom the country is indebted for his able report on German wool and other articles of interest in Germany in the last years report, and for the interesting one on sugar, to be found in the appendix of the present report, believes that he will be able to, accomplish the rotating more successfully and in a much shorter time than is now allotted to it, besides obviateing the difficulties which have existed. He is about to take out a patent for the purpose having entered his caveat, and intends to prosecute experiments on the subject. It would be a good appropriation were the Navy Department to have a course of experiments tried by Mr. Fleischmanfor this purpose, as his discovery, if it succeeds, will doubtless relieve the country from the necessity of importing hemp from Russia. Flaxtaking the whole country, considerable flax is raise do indeed, much :i ore than a person who has not examined the returns of the census, or the estimates in various counties of some of the States, might be willing to admit. Such a lessened view we know to have 'been the impression on the mind of the editor of the Western Journal, published at It. Louis, who expressed his doubt that even 1,000 tons of this crop is produced in the whole Unitedstates. Met, in the single State of New Work, as appears from the returns of the State census of 1845, not less than 46,089 acres were devoted to flax, producing at least 2,897,062. lbs. In the Ohiocultivator, also, for 1st of September, 1848, p. 134, we find the following statement: " A highly respectable and intelligent gentleman, residing within forty miles of Cincinnati, stated a few weeks since that 100,000 bushels of flax seed were raised last season in his county; and that nine tenths of the stalk was thrown away, the seed being got out by threshing machines, or the tramping of horses, either of which modes of course destroys the fibre. His seed produced the growers about                   $65,000, an I had the lint been saved, properly prepared, and sent to Liverpool, or even Newyork, an additional product, to the value of at least                                                                                                                                                                                   $150,000above all cost, would have been the result; and this is only one out of some twenty counties in this State where flax is extensively grown, This is only a proof how little aware persons are of the productive ness of our crops, who measure them simply with reference to 148 X. some particular product in their own vicinity. The more extended our means have been of getting acquainted with the various results of the yea is' harvest throughout the whole country, the more decided is our conviction that the full amount is hardly ever assumed as the basis of calculations by those who take only some one element of estimate, and whose knowledge of every section is in a great degree limited. In almost all cases where we have been led to revise our estimates, in consequence of their being so disputed, we have had our belief strengthened that we are nearer to the truth than those who have more hastily drawn up their conclusions. In appendix No. 5, will be found an interesting account of Last india hemp, communicated by a missionary in that country to the Louisville Journal, from which we have taken it. The same difficulty to which we have, referred as belonging to hemp is also found to operate against that enlargement of the flax crop which would otherwise undoubtedly take place; we mean the preparation of it for the market. Of the best process could be discovered for rotating it, or if it could be converted into fabric s cheaply without rotating it, then, no doubt, it would soon become a favorite crop in many sections of our country. A progress seems to be making towards this desirable result, and it may be hoped that the time is not far distant when both of these products will figure largely in our markets, as well as become articles of export, and thus the "fine linen" of ancient times be equalled by the greater abundance of our own more recently settled land. In the former report, (1847) an extract was given on page 165,from Professor Johnstons remarks on flax, containing an analysis, of this plant. An error occurred in transcribeing or printing, which it is deemed best to rectify here by an accurate quotation of the figures from the English journal whence it is taken.

The reason of this is to be found probably in the fact of the exhaustion of the lands devoted to this product in the largest tobacco growing regions of the Atlantic States; especially of Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, while there has not been, as in the case of the cotton crop, sufficient additional lands in the other parts of the country brought into cultivation to supply the deficiency. Still it is undoubtedly true, that the attention to this crop in Kentucky, Ohio, &c, has had some influence likewise to lessen the profit of the same in the former States. This reason we, find sometimes assigned in the replies from the tobacco growing sections of Virginia. It may also be that some of, the attention formerly here given to tobacco has been directed to the bread stuffs, especially during the call for them from abroad, and in consequence of the injury sustained to the tobacco crop by the worm for two or three successive years. But whatever be the cause, it would appear from the answers of our correspondent s there has not been that increase pin this product which there" has i been in many others, and in many cases a positive decrease must be allowed. Whether the whole crop will be found to fall below that of the census of 1840, may perhaps be questionable, for should the returns be taken with greater accuracy, it is not unlikely more will be reported than before, as no doubt portions of the crop may have escaped i notice. There still continues to be some attention paid to the raising of tobacco in Massachusetts and Connecticut, and, though less than in these, also in the State of New Work. It is probable that on the whole the quantity raised is increasing. Still the amount forms but a very small item either in the general aggregate of this crop or in comparison to most other crops. In the great tobacco growing States along the Atlantic the crop is believed not to have been equal to an average crop in good years. I nBuckingham county, Virginia, the decrease is thought to have been twenty per cent. A correspondent speaking of the tobacco crop of Virginia, remarks: "the crop of tobacco made in Virginia in the year 1847,Was far below the average, being only about 36,000 hogs heads, butt his was not owing to the season, but principally to the price of corn for exportation, which induced the planters to reduce their tobacco crop and increase that of corn. From the best information I can obtain, the tobacco crop made this year in Virginia will not much exceed that of 1847, as the season for planting was unfavorable, and the crop consequently late. I suppose the quantity made will not exceed 40,000 hogs heads. The present year there was a plenty of rain for planting tobacco in May, but the month of June was dry, and consequently much of the tobacco was planted in July, and therefore the crop will be less than an average one. From this it would appear that the estimate of the year 1847 proved to be too high. We have followed the conclusions of our correspondent, whose means of knowledge appear to be good, preferring to fall short 150 X. rather than to exceed the amount. Taking the census as the basis, we suspect he is too low in his estimate. The amount inspected in 1847, as last reported, was in Virginia more than 51,000 hogs heads. In Kentucky, complaint is made of the state of the weather as affecting the tobacco crop. Thus the Howling Green I ntelligencersays, on the 9th of August: "owing to the long continued wet weather, the growing crop of tobacco in this section of the State has suffered materially, and should the rain continue a week or two longer, the crop would almost all be lost The crop in Green up county in the same State, it is thought, is about the same as in 1847. In Tennessee the accounts vary, some making the crop about equal to the previous one, except in the quality, which is stated to be not so good in consequence of the excessive rains in the summer, while in other sections it is said to have fallen off some twenty-five per cent. from the want of plants and the absence of early planting seasons. Judging from the information obtained from Ohio, I n diana, and I illinois, where, however, the crop is not a prominent one, the same vicissitudes prevailed. In a few instances the amount raised is reported as on the increase, as more is planted; in others the quantity was probably about equal to that in 1847, while in others there has been a very considerable decrease. The bad season is assigned as the cause of that ill success, and so great is the falling off in Organ county, where 600 hogs heads were raised, owing to the bad season in planting in '46 and '47, the crop has been cut down it is said from 600 hogs heads to 40 or 50. Attempts have been made to procure some genuine Cuba or Havana tobacco from Cuba, and it is hoped it may yet be received, but no intelligence has yet been had respecting the commission. During the past year, by a letter from John P. Grown, esq. S. consul at Constantinople, we have been advised of the seed of several samples of Persian tobacco being on the way to the office. Mr. Grown, in his letter, says, it is called in the east, tombakkee, and suggests that probably tobacco has derived its name from this species. His design in transmitting the seed was that experiments might be made on it in some of the tobacco growing regions of this country, and he observes: ("I was struck with the quantity of tombakkee carried through Erzeroom, visited by me a year or two ago, from Persia to Turkey, and procured at Trebizond, its place of shipment on the Black sea, the following items on the subject, which I believe, may be relied on: "was shipped at Trebizond from Constantinople, tombakkeeI n 1846, 18,756 bales, weighed 60 to 70 ones, value from 8 to 10 cents per one 1847, 17,642 ' " c c c c " c c The one is 2 lbs, and reckoning the bale on an average at 6, or                                   $30, an idea will be formed of the amount of trade in this article. The best kind of tombakkee is raised at Thirds in Persia, and retails in this city (constantinople) at from 25 to 40 plasters, at                                                                                                                                                             $1 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.75, the 2 I lbs. It is used entirely for smoking in theMarquilay or water pipes of the inhabitants. The seed which I X. 151 have the honor of sending you is, however, not from Persia, but from Egypt, where it is successfully planted on the estates of the viceroy, I br a him Each a. The preceding amounts quoted, are only what is shipped to this place; but the tombakkee is carried inland to all the greater towns in the interior of Asia Minorthis seed, amounting to some three pounds, has been received and distributed among those prepared and sent abroad from the office, through the members of' Congress over the whole country. Another valuable variety also, comprised in the same distribution, is some choice seed from Ataxia, Syria, and brought home by Died t. Lynch. It is hoped, that these <a name="seeds13"><mark>seeds</mark></a> will be successfully cultivated, and should this be the case, they will doubtless be considered a most valuable acquisition by our tobacco growing States. Cottonthe cotton crop, though one of great importance, embracing as it does the interest of so many States and affecting the markets at home and abroad, is yet one respecting which, at this early period, it is exceedingly difficult to form very accurate conclusions. Even those who reside in the very midst of the great depots of the product do not agree respecting the quantity that may eventually be included in the gathering for the year. But in addition to what is reported as actually brought to market, the census undoubtedly contemplated the obtaining the amount raised and consumed at home on the plantations and in the vicinity. Doubtless there are many small proprietors who raise a small quantity each for his own family use, and these small amounts so multiplied form a very considerable aggregate which should have a place in the general estimate of the crop. We have no means of ascertaining the proportion this bears to the whole, but it may be sufficient to occasion some variation from the estimates which are based solely on the amount received at the seaports, in the way of trade. The early prospects of the cotton crop appear to have been favorable. This continued to be the case through the growing season. During the summer, anticipations were entertained that the amount raised would exceed that of any year before. Thus it is stated early in August in one of the journals: "A planter says that he has been in Alabama thirty years, and never yet saw such a cotton crop as the present promises. He will make a half a crop over the average, and it is the same with his neighborhood About Georgetown, S. C., too, it is said the rich heads are large and promise well. A similar report is made in July of the crop in other portions of South Carolina. Farther to the west more complaint was made; and about the middle and latter part of August we meet with notices which are less favorable. Heavy rains are mentioned as injuring the crop. Thus it is stated, August 17: "the accounts from the interior of Alabama are not so favorable for the cotton crop. The rains have been heavy, producing ver min and choking the plant." Again, August 24, "the late immense quantity of rains at this season, "says the Alabama Journal, "have, we learn, seriously affected the prospect of the cotton crop. The low cotton lands are flooded 152 X. a. The cotton crop in Baker county, S. C., is much injured by worms, so that not more than two thirds of a crop will be secured. Again, in September it is said, the prospect of the cotton crop in Greene county, Alabama, is not so good as it was three weeks ago. The Greensboro Deacon says, that within the last fifteen or twenty days the ball worm has appeared in such numbers as materially to change the prospect. In some places, we have information that the crops have been cut off one half. A writer from Clarke county, in the Alabama Planter, alluding to the injury by the ball worm, says: The worm here, called the ball worm, is correctly the "form worm" and its attacks are in the bud of the form or square. There is another worm known as the ball worm, which attacks the green ball when maturing and destroys its fruit; but no worm of this description has made its appearance in this section, nor will it do any injury to the crop. He goes on to observe further in reference to the prospect: Of I am not disappointed, we shall receive in Mobile for 1848 and 1849 the largest crop yet sent to our port. In my travels, I have met with a number of gentlemen from different parts of the State, all of whom are of opinion, that if the season continues favorable, the yield will be larger than that of any previous crop. The editor of the same paper, after speaking of preceding un unfavorable accounts of injury from the worm and excessive rains, observes: " In some sections, we are inclined to think that the accounts have not been exaggerated, but at the same time we have not adopted the opinion current in some quarters, of a short crop in the aggregate." He also speaks of the arrivals of the crop and prices, as indicating that the prospects of the growing crop are satisfactory, " and leading them to the belief that the yield will be much larger than last year it a later date, on the 12th of October, a' letter from Sumter county, Alabama, thus speaks of the cotton crop in that region: " The unusually favorable season will cause the cotton crop to exceed the expectations of the most sanguine a few weeks ago. I am beginning to think that it will be a fair average; and you know, from my former guesses, that my opinion is worthy of regard, because, for the last three years my estimates, made as early as the middle of November, have been every year within less than 3,000bales of Mobile receipts, except that after the great flood last year in December. In consequence of that calamity, I amended my estimates by 30,000 bales The Watched Courier, Mississippi, remarks in reference, to this crop in September: -in the whole, the accounts are very flattering, although, in many places, the ball worm has dole, and is doing considerable damage. All our planters now fear, is a continuance of rainy weather. S'" Clear and a un shiny weather is all they require to make an excellent crops n Tennessee, while it was thought, about the last of November, at Nashville, that "the present crop will not be equal to the last in quantity" it is at the same time asserted, that it will be vastlyEx. To. To. 59. 153 superior in quality, "and this is attributed to the fall being remarkably dry and favorable for picking, and the staple is also pronounced to be of good length, clear of, stain and leaf The reports which we have received, respecting the cotton, we regret to say are not numerous enough to afford any very sufficient data for estimates. This is owing to the fact that a large portion of the crop remained un gathered at the 'time they were made, and as so much depended on the weather to be experienced, great variations might take place. In the upper districts of South Carolina, it is thought to have exceeded the crop of 1847 by 10 per cent in consequence of the former season having been too wet. I nNewberry districts of the same State, the gain is placed as high as 25 per cent. In Lancaster district, 5 per cent. more, as the season was favorable till July. In Charleston district, about 20 per cent more, owing to the driver season. In Georgia, An cock, and the adjoining counties, the report says: " The cotton crop may be put down at 10 per cent. over a fair average, and 200 lbs. of lint as the average yield per acre. The cotton crop opened early, and the season has been favorable for picking. Consequently the gathered crop will be over an average. In Pass county, the crop is estimated as about the same as that of the previous year. In Walker county, the low price of the article prevented so much being sown, and consequently there was thought to be a falling off of some 40 per cent. In Jackson county, Alabama, there is believed to have been no great variation from the crop of the preceding year. The report from Harbour county, in Alabama, states that the crop is not a full one, having been injured by the ball worm and rust" The early season was favorable up to the 5th of July. The we edges up rapidly, and the bottom crop was a full one; the middle and top were seriously injured by the above named disasters. But there will be more cotton made in the county this year than in 1847. I n relation to the crop of this State, the accounts are very conflicting, and as yet no satisfactory results can be obtained." Our correspondent adds: "I n my opinion, I do not think that the whole crop of the cotton growing States will turn out more in quantity than in 1847, for they complained of no disasters the last year, while in the present, we have observed in the papers, from all quarters, complaints of the ball worm and rust. In 1847, south Alabama was more troubled with disasters than anywhere else, while in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, and Mississippi, a regular favorable season was experienced throughout, and heavy crops made. The impression now is that the crop of 1848 will be 2,600,000bales. But whether it is 2,000,000 or 2,600,000 bales, the prospects are gloomy and disheartening to the cotton planter. From all sources we learn that prices will range low in Texas there has been a considerable increase in the cotton crop over that of the year 1847, owing to more having been planted. I need in some counties it is estimated as high as one third or one half, while in others some 300 or more bales are mentioned as the first crop raised for exportation. The yield varies from 800 to 2,000 pounds per acre 154 X. a. The report from Missouri is an average crop, though injury by the ball Form is complained of. A writer in the Alabama Planter, under date of October 30,speaking of the whole cotton crop of the United States, observes: "judging from the crop in this region, I doubt not but the entire crop of the United States will not fall far short of 2,350,000 bales, and but for the ravages of the probe worm and rust it would not have fallen far short of 2,700,000. But, during the months of July and August, the rust, accompanied with the worm, were more destructive than the latter was in 1846; but fortunately, and yet unfortunately for the planter, the fall has been very favorable for the top crop, which is now making very rapidly and promises an average crops n a letter received from M. W. Phillips, of Mississippi, he says, under date of November 6, respecting this crop: .last years placed the crop at 2,200,000 bales, and that of New Orleans at1150000 bales. The extraordinary fine weather, and a late killing frost, 20th November, made the crop to exceed my expectations, but it only reached say 2,300,000 in all, and about 1,220,000in New Orleans. My impression was that Mississippi would make one half of what was sent to New Orleans, but I did not think the New Orleans crop would go so high. Mississippi is the largest cotton growing State, but she will fall short of the last crop; and I place my figures now, for the United States at 2,300,000 bales, and that of Mississippi at 525,000 bales. In 1848, the census of Mississippi gave 213,000 slaves; of these 40,000 were under 5 years of age, being 173,730 over 5 years. He duct from these 53,730, as too young and too old to work, as house servants, &c, and add only 10,000 whites who labor at cotton, it will give 130,000 employed in cotton planting, at an average of 4 bales, and we shall have 520,000 bales." Further: "I think the crop of Mississippi may have exceeded this last year, but the unfavorable seasons for cotton, though very fine for gathering, with an early killing frost, November 2, must reduce the crop; and I should not be surprised if the receipts at New Orleans fall under that of last year by 100 000 bales; the effect on the low grounds has yet to be seen before we can form a fair opinion From the price current, it would appear that the receipts at the various ports up to the 30th of December, since the 1st of September last have exceeded those of the former year by over 372,000bales, and this notwithstanding the extraordinary low price of this product. To that, if this is to be regarded at all as an indication of the amount of the crop, and it is generally thought to be an important element for the estimate, the cotton crop of 1848 must be fixed considerably higher than that of the previous year. Some varieties of cotton are mentioned by M. W. Phillips, Esq in his letter to the office, who says that they have been on trial from two to four years, and so far they prove all the introduces promised. These are the " sugar loaf' " ices 100 seen and" Dog an seed." He says: " The first is the earliest maturing, and easier to pick of any I have tried, yielding as well per cut. of x. 155 lint (better from the field) as the first Petit Sulph; the balls are rounder and of thinner hull than of any other variety; the balls growing on the sides of the s talks, limbs in clusters of two, three, or more. Kicks 100 seed is the result of the most patient, persevering, and scientific selections from the field, and a judicious selection in the house as to staple. It is Mexican or Petit Sulph highest improved. The production is better than Mexican, giving a fair. yield of lint, and better in maturing and picking qualities. The Dog an exceeds all in productive ness and yield of lint. I have not planted it, but visited the largest patches of it grown a few miles from me for two years, and it holds its own. I may be deceived, but I am willing to risk a trial. 'there is no deception in yield or quantity of lint thus far, but it may fail as. others have done. He likewise ,mentions the Banana cotton as being much recommended by some persons, but says that the price of the seed,                                                                                                                                                             $1.00per bushel, precludes all further trials at present till this fall. Methinks the product as good as Organs. Of the Grown seed, he remarks: I planted a few seed to test it with the sugar loaf, but prefer the sugar loaf. Another of the same family, Parr or seed, from Alabama, was also planted with Grown and sugar loaf, but neither of them yielded equal to the sugar loaf. Pitts prolific is likewise alluded to, and Mr. Phillips says, though he has never seen it, he has heard from others that it is the best yet known. He thinks it not improbable that when the prices fall to                                                                                                                                                             $1 9 there will be found to be only two varieties of the six, and the names are the result of competition. Some cotton seed from Mississippi is embraced in this years distribution, and one or two of the varieties just mentioned form part of the same. We have also distributed a small amount of cotton seed from Syria, brought out by I eut. Lynch, and though it is hardly probable it can be equal to the best varieties of our country, it may be worth trying how far it would succeed here. There is reason to believe th-t the increase of the cotton crop of Texas will be much larger hereafter. We observe that the receipt at New Orleans of the year 1848,up to a given time, compared with that of the same period in 1847,from Texas, was 74 7 bales against 32. At present, however, the quantity is so small in the aggregate that it can make no great difference in the general result. Vice. As nearly all the rice raised is in the single State of South Carolina, it is comparatively easy to ascertain respecting the appearance of this crop. We rely as usual on our valued correspondent, R. F. W. Boston, of Georgetown, South Carolina, corresponding secretary of theWinyaw and All Saints Agricultural Society. He says: "our rice crop is large, owing much to the previous dry winter, which enabled planters to put their lands in fine tilt h. This depends very much on draining and em banking. In these respects we can furnish some models for the inspection of the agricultural surveyor156ExDo. Doc. N. 59. The season for planting was propitious, with genial showers and a good river, which continued through cultivation. The season for harvest was very wet and warm, one of the most trying I have known in 20 years; in consequence of this, the quality of the crop, generally, has not been prime, though there are many exceptions. He estimates the increase, n the past year at about 8 per cent. The average product is about 40 bushels to the acre, though Mr. Ills ton says his own crop will average 55 per acre for 700 acres. The amount of seeing he gives at 100 lbs, or 21 bushels. We perceive by occasional notices that the attention is turning somewhat more to experiments in this crop in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, and very probably more may be done in this respect hereafter. Allusion has been made in some of the former reports to the wild rice which is found growing in the lakes and streams in the northwestern section of our country. Some of the seed of this indigenous plant will be distributed this season. It has been furnished by Professor And all, of Cincinnati, who has lately come from the Minnesota Territory. It is considered by him superior in taste, and far more nutritiousthan the southern rice; it grows abundantly as an indigenous production, and can be cultivated to almost any extent in the rivers and lakes that abound in that territory. After the rice is ready for gathering, the tops are tied up in small sheafs as it stands growing in the water, and then the I indian in his canoe passes through it and beats off the seed into his canoe, by bending over the canoe the tops so that the seed may fall aright. An I indian squaw will gather from five to ten bushels per day. It will grow in water, we are informed, from six inches to five feet deep, when it finds a muddy soil. I to stalk, and the branches or ears that have the seed, are described as resembling oats, both in appearance and manner of growing, the s talks being full of joints and rising from one half to four feet above the water. Professor And all, it is stated in a western paper, is inclined to think, that there is as much rice land water in Minnesota as in the same area of the States of South Carolina and Georgia, and that the Minnesota rice ground produces as much to the acre, and will at no distant period compete with the southern production. Behave tried it boiled as usual, and have found it very pal a table. The specimen, however, in appearance is not inviting, as the outer skin of the pulled rice is dark colored, though the inside is white as the southern kind. This may be owing to some difficulty in preserving it, and probably if more completely pulled the objection would disappear. The seed distributed is from four different places, but probably does not differ as to its nature and quality, as it appears in a great measure similar in all. Sugarprovision having been made for an extended report on the cultivation and manufacture of the sugar crop, and some remarks on this subject also being comprised in the communication x. 157 of J. D. B, He bow, esq, which will be found in the appendix, it seems hardly necessary to dwell on the appearance and progress of the sugar crop. It is universally agreed that the crop for 1.47could rot have fallen short of 240,000 hogs heads of 1,000 pounds each. It is believed, also, that the product of the year 1848 will somewhat fall short that of the previous year. The season generally appears to have been favorable, and though we meet with exceptions which speak of the cane being small and dry, yet it is reported, also, to be very ripe and juice. The amount raised in Texas has probably more than doubled. A crop of 5,000hogsheads is mentioned as anticipated in the Galveston Journal. Attempts have been successfully made likewise in portions of Alabama and in Florida to raise the cane, and it may be that there will be more attention hereafter paid to this crop in those States. It is, however, principally in Texas that we are to look for any considerable addition in the course of a few years to the quantity raised in Louisiana. The facts contained in Mr. Fleischmans able report will no doubt evince that a still larger increase may be anticipated. The improvements of machinery, the clearing and adapting new tracts of land, will have this tendency. Complaint, however, is made that the frost affected the cane, and in some cases, it was believed that not more than one third of a crop would be secured. In the absence of very definite information we have ventured to estimate as we have done. Mr. Fleischmans report, which will be found in appendix No2will be one of great interest to those who are now engaged in this business, or who may be turning their attention towards it. He has visited many plantations, and observed and gathered much valuable information; and, although it is but a partial report, in consequence of his commission not having been undertaken soon enough in the year, yet it will present the details of cultivation and manufacture to a degree which could not have been anticipated. What adds much, also, to its value, is the drawings of the appearance of the cane, and especially a microscopic examination of the same by the distinguished Word a, whom Mr. Fleischmanwas so fortunate as to meet, and receive from him his aid in Neworleans, while engaged in fulfilling the commission of the office. Word a had letters from the celebrated Humboldt, commending him to this country as a man of true science; and it is a matter of much gratification that the Patent Office report of this year can be thus enriched by his labors. Other drawings, too, of inventions for mills, &c, and extracts of specifications, add to the interest of or. Fleischmans able report. Large quantities of map le sugar continue to be made, nor have the experiments respecting sugar from the corns talk, or obtaining at least molasses in this way, wholly ceased. Met we have seen no recent results. One person at the west, in one of the agricultural papers, expressed his determination to enter upon it seriously and on a large scale; but we suppose it will not be before another year that the success of the trial or otherwise will be ascertained 158 X. a. The improvements in the manufacture of map le sugar are now carried to such a height of perfection that, as stated in the communication of B. P. Johnston, esq, secretary of the New York State agricultural Society, premiums were given at the late fair of that society, ad judged by merchants of Buffalo, for sugar from the map le, considered fully equal to the best refined sugars by Stuart orWoolsey of New Work. Other samples also were equal to the best sugar of other descriptions from the West I n dies. Though the amount in many cases is small, yet, no doubt, many millions ofpoundksof map le sugar are consumed in families where it is made, in the place of West I india sugar. It would seem, from accounts from the West I n dies, that the sugar crop of the islands is shorter than usual; so that the Louisiana crop of sugar will, no doubt, find a ready sale. We have only entered the Louisiana crop in the table this year, leaving till the census to take up map le sugar anew. The extreme difficulty of gaining anything like correct estimates of the amount of silk in cochons, or manufactured into raw silk, has induced us to drop this article from the table this year. The census will, no doubt, give an approximation on this subject. I tis, however, believed, from the best information that can be had, that the quantity has rather fallen off than otherwise. Not so much attention has of late been directed to it. And yet, we doubt not, the time will come when it may occupy a large place among our products. I individual experiments have proved eminently successful. The recollection, however, of the multicaulis losses has had its effect, and it can hardly be expected that any who have sunk capital in those experiments will be otherwise than slow again to engage in them. Other products From the answers to the circular of the office, as well as various other information, it is evident that a large variety and amount of other crops are raised in the country, which do not enter into the usual estimates made of our agricultural resources. The root, the god, and the cabbage fruits, as well as the products of the orchard and woods, add very considerably to the means at the command of our farmers and planters. Still the knowledge we have been able to obtain has no basis on which to found any approximating estimates on which we can feel prepared to place much reliance. We find, on turning to the State census of New Work, in 1845, that the number of acres of turn is reported, is given as 15,322-,! and the quantity raised, 1,350,332 bushels. Of peas, not less than 117,379 acres, and 1,761,503w- bushels. Of beans, 16,231.!, and 162, 1872 bushels. Ships example is sufficient to show that the entire aggregate, could it be calculated, would be much larger than many would be disposed to admit. Meets andturnips, and other similar vegetables, enter into the statistics of France and other European countries.  The effect of these various plants on the feeding of stock is very important. In some instances we have reports of 1,200 bushels ofturnips, and 800 or 1,000 of carrots to an acre, and although these are not common crops, and very far above the average, still, the quantity of food thus supplied in the aggregate must be large. I tax. a. 159 is not deemed necessary to enter with any minuteness of detail into these crops. The letters of our correspondents, in the appendix, may supply some hints on the subject, and it is to be hoped that the next census will be so arranged as to include these important products in the returns. In the Ockonomische Neugkeiten arid Verhandlungen No. 19, for 1848, we find some remarks respecting the culture of carrots, which, as coming from such high authority we think may be use fully quoted. Dr. iHlubeck, the author, says: "the culture of the carrot as an interval crop, among rape, winter and summer barley, &c, in consequence of the failure of the <a name="potato28"><mark>potato</mark></a>, has been extensively adopted in Steiermark, Carinthia Alsace, and indeed this culture cannot be enough record mended, as they yield, besides the main crop, an attendant crop of 100 to 200 weight per yoke in roots, which not merely afford an admirable vegetable, but also an excellent food for cows and swine. The seed is sown in the spring over the main crop; the stubble at harvest is left somewhat higher, in order that the leaves of the carrot may not be injured, then drawn out, ploughed up, the soil loosened and the crop of carrots gathered at the end of October or beginning of November. The English agricultural journals are filled with articles relating to the culture and management of the turn in, as this product is of such vast importance to that country. At present, however, it occupies but a comparatively slight space with us. And, therefore, it is not deemed advisable to make any additions on this subject, to those in the report of the former year. In some of the former reports, the article of artichokes has been alluded to, and information given respecting its productive ness. We have sub joined in an appendix a translation of a report on this subject by two French professors of agriculture, taken from theCultivateur, a French agricultural periodical of merit. The statements given may no doubt be relied upon, and it would seem that the culture of this vegetable is deserving of more attention. It has not been attempted in any systematic form. to any considerable extent in this country. The great advantage stated of its being adapted to such varieties of soil, and also so easily kept through the winter, renders it valuable for many parts of our country; the main objection seems to be as to introducing it into any rotation on account of the extreme difficulty of eradicating when it has once obtained a hold in the soil. It is hardly te expected that so long as good hay is largely raised with grain anal indian corn, for the food of stock, that our farmers will be disposed .to make the trial of the s talks of the artichokes, notwithstanding the strong testimony in favor of their value as dry fodder, especially ,for much cows and sheep. In one of the numbers of the London Gardeners Chronicle, (october 7, 1848,) vegetable marrow is highly recommended as a plant which, sown among <a name="potatoes24"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, would prove very favorable for the wood of swine. These plants are said to contain a rich, sugary, and farinaceous matter, and to be an excellent dish for the table. The writer says: "the <a name="seeds14"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may be sown among early <a name="potatoes25"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 160 X. about the 1st of May, and in the open ground in any warm corner, When transplanting time comes, the <a name="potato29"><mark>potato</mark></a> will not be near ripe, but proceed thus: lift a root of <a name="potatoes26"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> every five or six feet apart in the row, leaving six or eight rows of <a name="potatoes27"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> between the rows of marrows, and so on. I find that with moderately rich land can grow twenty tons to the acre easily. When ripe they can be stored away anywhere, and may be boiled along with other food for pigs, for all pigs' food ought to be boiled. The cottage r may grow marrows where other things will not grow, as on walls, treatises, poles, &c. There is no mistake about ripe marrow being first rate food for pigs 5. The plant here mentioned belongs to the cucurbita kind, and is cultivated like the common pump kin and s qu ash. I to fruit is described as being of a pale yellow color, of an elliptical oblongshapethe surface having irregular longitudinal ribs, uniting in a projecting apex. When full grown, it is about nine inches in length and four in diameter, and is by far the best adapted, it is said, for c urinary purposes, of any of the you rd tribe. It was brought from Meant, and has been but recently introduced into Europe. The flesh is said to be of a peculiar tenderness and softness, and from this circumstance it has received its name, it much resembling the battery quality of the burrd pear. As a vegetable, it is pronounced to be most decidedly superior to all others of its family. Bryant, in his "that I saw in California" speaks of a root which he met with on the great prairie, and which he calls by the name of the prairie <a name="potato30"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which he considers, in many respects, superior to the common <a name="potato31"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and which it might be useful to introduce into cultivation. In some of the reports mustard was favorably mentioned, and the case of Mr. Parma lee, of Ohio, was alluded to. By a letter from Samuel A. Parker, esq. of Mcconnelsville, Ohio, we learn that the success of Mr. Parma lee was confined to but a single year. At Mrtbarkers request, we have given his letter a place in justice to Mr. Parma lee, who was thought to have conflicted with some others in the former report. Mr. Parker says as follows n your report for 1845 there are very favorable notices of the mustard crops, given in this and the adjoining county of Muskingum, by Mr. R. Rout y, I. He ely and J. H. Parma lee. Mriparmalee took the lead in this business, and having a season, in every particular, suitable for the growth and harvesting of his crop, cleared a few hundred dollars on a crop of 27 acres. His was in 1844. In 1845 many others embarked in the business, but few, however, succeeded. In the same land, with a few additional acres, Mr. Is crop was less than in 1844. In 1846, all who had tried a mustard crop appeared to be discouraged, except Mr. Parma lee, and the field was again left clear for him. He rented 30 acres of land near his residence, and close by the German laborers whom he had previously employed, employed them again, planted, tended and harvested his thirty acres, as he had done before, and cleaned up seven bushels of seed. His loss on this third crop was x: 161 nearly twice as much as he had made on the two preceding ones. He assigned all his property to his creditors, and was left penniless by his experiments in raising mustard seed. I have never known any other person attempt to raise a secondcropThe last report contained an essay on the cultivation of mad derby M. B. Late ham, editor of the Ohio Cultivator. We have this year sub joined in the appendix No. 7 a translation of a valuable treatise on the culture of this plant in France, by the most distinguished agriculturists and author, Count Aspirin, and which has been extracted from one of the first agricultural journals of France, edited by the gentleman whom we believe was named the minister of agriculture and commerce under the new government of the French republic, Ilio. This treatise enters very fully into the history of the cultivation of this valuable dye plant, and minutely describes the best methods of raising and gathering, and as it never has been before translated, will probably prove an interesting document to our farmers, and hereafter, when the attention is more directed to experiments relating to this crop, be still more prized as a guide in respect to this subject. Another dye plant which might engage the attention of some farmers in our country, -is saffron. In the London Gardenerschronicle for October 7, 1848, we find quoted from the Pharmaceutical Journal, the following interesting account respecting the culture, &c, of this plant Saffron was not cultivated in France before the crusades; the bulb (cor mi) from Avignon were introduced towards the latter end of the fourteenth century, by a gentleman of the family ofPorchaires, who first planted them on his estate at Corner. Thebotanical characters of the crop us satin us autumnal is, are well known. The same bulb or corpus flowers once only; and as soon as the flower is withered a bud (cain) appears, which, after having produced several flowers in the autumn of the second year, also dies. After the third year the bulbs should be transplanted. Dark, somewhat loose, sandy soil, in a sunny situation, suits it best. Heavy, wet, clay by, and freshly manured soils are unfavorable for its cultivation. The usual manure is the mare of the grape. The bulbs are planted at the beginning of July, about twelve to a square foot. A temperature of 140 Fahrenheit is very injurious to them, in case the snow does not lie very high. In the Gatinoisthe saffron herb dries up in May, but it is collected for cows. When the flowers are gathered, the stigmata (la june) are plucked off, dried, and preserved in dry wooden boxes, for when protected from dampness, the saffron keeps for years. Saffron is adulteratedby mixing it with say flower, marigolds reddened by salt, and shreds of beef (la rou else de bc if. Saffron is employed in dyeing, in cooking, in parma cy, and in medicine. In France and Pain a balsam or saffron ointment is prepared from it under the name ofcrocomagna, or crocinium. It is also used as a prophylactic against sea sickness162Ex. a. The saffron of Power Austria is the best and most costly in Europe, but the produce is scarcely sufficient for home consumption, and therefore saffron is imported. It is chiefly produced at Ravelsbach, Lessen, Eggendorf, Birch beg, and Wagram. Most of the saffron gardens have a sub stratum of loam, covered about a foot high with mould. Heat fields are best adapted for the cultivation of saffron, the produce being threefold that of wheat. The garden should be placed dry, exposed to the sun, and towards the south, and protected against northerly winds. They should not be shaded by forest trees, nor be too much elevated and exposed to the wind Districts favorable for the cultivation of the vine suit best. Oh, e flowering season begins during the last week of September, and ends in the first week of October; but it sometimes lasts till the beginning of November. The soil is prepared after three methods; the first is similar to that of preparing garden beds. By the second method the field is ploughed in autumn after the harvest, the same as for wheat, only somewhat deeper and narrower. According to the third method; the field is ploughed immediately after the harvest, (whether of wheat, rye, or oats) and then rolled and narrowed. Three days before planting, the field is trimmed. The manure is only added during the planting, but so it is well covered with earth, and does not come in contact with the bulbs. This method requires the best soil and the smallest and best manure, as sheep manure. The saffron bulb is called in Austriakiel. It is of the size of a walnut, surrounded by ten or twelve bass like membranes, of a cinnamon brown color, which terminate at the top around the gem, in capillary threads called pollen, but in such a manner that only about three of them reach the top, the others being shorter and finer. The multiplication of the saffron proceed from these bulbs; (field) no case is known of a flower producing seed. Each bulb produces within half a year, namely, between autumn and the end of spring, from one or two, or from three to four new young bulbs; but the parent bulb perishes in the meanwhile every year, and nothing remains of it but some coarse, blackish brown membranes called pollen, and a dried hardness (the platt el) on which the young bulbs are seated. Before the bulb s are planted they must be cleared of all membranes remaining of the parent bulb of the platt el, &c, and all damaged or diseased bulb rejected. They are st owed away from three to four inches high, in a dry, airy place. The sowing is performed by two men, one making with a he furrows of eight inches depth, the other placing the bulbs three inches apart and pressing in the ground so that they are half covered. The saffron flowers appear before the leaves and can easily be removed without disturbing the bulb; the best time for gathering them is early in the morning while they are closed. When gathered they are spread in a cool room, on cloth or straw mats until fit for picking. The picking (called saffron lose) consists in separating the tr if id stir ma from the style and removing it from the flower. This is done the day after the gathering, and must be performed without separating the parts of the tr if id stir ma (called the jungle in or little tongue) from on Ex. 163 another. These should remain adherent, or, as it is said, "the back should be entire." Little or nothing of the style should be left attached to the stir ma. In this way the saffron has a better appearance, and fetches a higher price. In the following day it is dried on a hair si eve over a charcoal fire, and placed in boxes without compression. After a few hours it becomes oily and flexible, and can then be pressed into well closed boxes. Most of the Austrian saffron is sold at Krems on the 28th of October. 'I to price is from 30 to 32 ll. [3 638 ll, 24 Or. Cherish] per lb. After the crop of the first year the green leaves are left growing till the spring of the next year, and in June when they begin to either and become yellow at the top, they are removed as food for cattle. The little bulb (knoll when) which in the first year had formed itself on the parent bulb, and from which a little tube, or without a flower had already grown in the autumn of the second year, goes on swelling till the spring. About Whitsuntide the new bulb (kill called kind el is perfect. Of everything goes on well, the saffron garden in the autumn of the second year contains two or three times the quantity of bulbs (each bearing two or three flowers originally planted. Of the bulbs are left for the third crop nothing else is to be done but what was required after the first; namely, mowing the grass and carefully removing the weeds in July. It is, however, remarkable that neither bulbs nor flowers multiply in the third year. The bulbs having now yielded saffron for two, three, or four years, are removed about Whitsuntide, when the new bulb kill) is perfect, the saffron grass gathered, and the bulb has quite disappeared. By means of a coarse si eve they are cleared of the adhering mould and stored up in an airy barn or loftAppendix No. 12 contains, among other particulars, some estimates respecting the proportion of corns talk and straw fodder, with their value. Although the replies are limited to a few States, still enough can be ascertained by it to show that these are important articles to the farmers in some portions of our country. Amid the rich profusion) of the west, comparatively little may be thought of these means of feeding stock; but in the eastern and middle Atlantic States, we find that the value put upon them renders them equal in many cases to two thirds or one half of the hay crop by the acre. I need, in some cases, our correspondents appear to regard them, when cured in the best manner, equal for the acre to the hay crop. Any persons are not aware, till they make such an examination as we are compelled to make, how vast is the quantity consumed thus in some of the States. Farmers, in- not a few cases, rely much on these articles as sub si diaries to the other means of fodder at their command. They are so fed out likewise that what is not eaten is turned to good account by being thrown forth for the production of manure; and in this have a greater value than they would if left wholly upon the field. The subject of fruit is attracting increased attention in our country. During the past year an important step has been taken in the Domo logical convention, held at Buffalo, at which were assembled large numbers of intelligent fruit growers and connais 164 X. spurs of fruit, who engaged in discussion respecting a great number of varieties of apples, pears, peaches, cher rise, &c, and adopted certain rules which might hereafter aid in giving uniformity to the naming of the varieties existing in the different parts of the country, and render the kinds cultivated more choice and profitable. Vast amount of information was thus elicited by the free interchange of sentiment, and' a regular society was formed and rules adopted which, together with the accounts of the proceedings of the convention, will be found in the appendix No. 3, in the communication from B. P. Johnson, esq, secretary of the New York Stateagricultural Society. In the spring of 1848, a circular was addressed to individuals in the principal cities of this country, to obtain, if possible, estimates or records of the quantity of strawberries and other small fruits which were brought into market in the season. The difficulty of attempting it, it would appear, seemed so great in most cases, that we have been unable to present any such returns. We hope, however, we may yet succeed in procuring something on these from Cincinnati, as the possibility of acquiring the information there seemed to be more likely. Of not in time to occupy a place in the body of the report, it may yet find one in the appendix No. 8. " The comparison of the prices reported from the answers to the circular, in the appendix No. 12,will be interesting. In some cases, the high price of these fruits may astonish many who have not turned their attention to the subject. Though holding but a minor place, yet at the prices in different parts of the country, there can be but little doubt, that were the whole aggregate known, it would form a considerable item of receipts by those who carry them to market, while, as a pleasant luxury at home, it forms an agreeable addition to the means at the command of the farmer, who may so independently rely on the products of his own fields and woods for both his necessary food and many of the additional comforts of life. The p each crop this year has been very large. I immense quantities were brought into the markets of New Work, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and further south, and the fruit was also for the most part excellent. We see that the Delaware crop is estimated by our intelligent correspondent at 500,000 bushels. This is a large amount for so small a State. Of there were added those raised in New Work, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other States, the aggregate would be very largely increased, and some calculations might be made on such data, as to the value of this single species of fruit to its producers. The number of persons who supply the great quantities consumed in the markets of the Atlantic cities is comparatively few, but it shows what persevering industry and skilful adaptation will effect, when urged on by energies such as are -possessed by the proprietors of x. Docno. 59.165others this season. It may be desirable, therefore, to sub join here some notices respecting it. We have taken from the Prairie Farmer, the following account of it, with a statement of its advantages, drawn up by Professor J. B. Turner, of Jackson ville, I illinois, who appears to have been unusually successful in its cultivation: " (cid127The Usage orange, the favorite hedge plant of the Unitedstates, has already become too well known to need any particular description. Of t grows in the wilds of North America, in regions further north than New Work, and further south than the Carolinas. It is usually in this country from 10 to 15 feet in height, though, like the English thorn, it is said sometimes to attain, in its native soil, a height of 50, and even to 60 feet* Its utility, as a hedge plant, is no longer an experiment. Edges of the rare st beauty and excellence have been growing in Boston, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati, in Kentucky, Tennessee, and northern Missouri; and, in short, in all the middle and southern States. Some of these hedges have been standing for 10 or 12 years; they were planted by gentlemen of wealth and taste, around their favorite walks and grounds, at a time when the plants sold at the rate of                            $5.00 per thousand. Among all who have written on the subject, no unfavorable account has ever come to the knowledge of the writer. Great losses have been incurred with th- seed, as might be expected; but the plant and the hedge are universally .admired and commended; and it is confidently believed by the best judges that it will double the real value of any farm it surrounds. But the community must first learn that there is as much difference in the quality and comparative value of hedges and hedge plants, as in houses, or dry goods, or anything else onsaleRecent writers thus enumerate its many advantages: "1st. I to tenacity of life is scarcely equalled t is a native of the prairies, and will grow on any soil where common prairie grass will grow. Overflowing the land does not harm it; it will live for weeks and months entirely under water. The dead wood is exceedingly hard and dura be, and fresh shoots from the stump soon supply the place of all which have been killed by fire or cutting 2d. I to protection is perfect t is armed with a very sharp, stout thorn under each leaf. I to dense iron branches soon become so inter locked that no domestic animal, and not even a common bird, can pass through it; both its thorns and its bitter acrid juice prevent all animals and insects from browsing or feeding on its branches. I to seed is like the orange, and its roots like the hickory; consequently it can never spread into the field either from the seed or from the root, but keeps its own place, growing stronger and thicker year by year. It thus perfectly secures orchards, fruit yards, stables, sheep folds, and pasture grounds from all thieves, rogues dogs, wolves, &c; and one good gate, well locked, makes a whole farm secure from all intruders of whatever description. It may be trained so high as to afford shelter to stock, and break x. off the rough prairie -winds from all grounds needing such pro, section. Plants may also be prepared so that it can be set in the open prairie, without fence, with perfect success 3d. I to beauty is unrivalledI to dense mass of dark green leaves, its flowers in spring, and above all, its golden orange fruit throughout the fall months, make this hedge the most beautiful one ever beheld. It is now so cheap as to lie within the reach of every farmer in the country. Select plants have been advertised for sale in some of the eastern cities at                                                                                                                                                                                   $12, and in the west at                                                       $25 perthousandThe modes of setting and trimming heretofore proposed both in the east and west, necessarily require five years to perfect the hedge. The writer is satisfied, from actual experiment, that his mode of planting and trimming will make a hedge in this country more perfectly secure, especially against swine, in three years time, and at about half the cost and labor Professor Turner offers to sell plants ready for setting, so that the hedge ready set will not cost more than                                                                                                                                                                              $15 for 80 rods. In a letter from Walhonding, Ohio, the following method of making a hedge of American thorn has been communicated to the office by, Mr. Li Nicholas. He says: I consider the American thorn will never be extensively cultivated and profit ably used as a hedge plant, until the plants are set about two feet apart and the space between filled about twenty inches high with stone or brick, flag stones edged being the cheapest, and next a rough wall of that height. All attempts to make American thorn grow thicker than this will en feeble the plant and finally ruin the hedge, but stone and thorn will make a cheaper and better fence than either, separate. When he gives an account of an experiment with another plant. But the experiment which I value most is a new article, the dog wood (corn us florida) set in a new way. Mr. Nicholas mentions his intention to prosecute his experiments further in order to provethepracticability and cheapness, and as he may, perhaps, seek to make it the foundation of an application for a patent, the method cannot now be described. To far as his trials have been made, he appears to be sanguine of complete success. Edges are of importance in many parts of our country where, timber and stone are scarce for fences; though many writers on agriculture seem to doubt much the utility, on the whale, of partition fences, as they harbor so many insects, in -some cases interrupt the more easy sloughing and occupy considerable room. Mention was made in the last report of the grapes of Texas, and among other varieties, one called the must and was stated to promise to become valuable, and deserve the attention of those who cultivate the grape We notice that, by a late experiment on this grape vine, it proves to be an excellent one on which to graft other species. The Lavacca Herald speaks of a case of this kind, and mentions that Captain Dutch en grafted a species of the English on a vigorous vine of the must and, and so great was the life and vigor in fused into the young graft by the parent stem, that, in166Ex. a. 167 the course of one season, it entirely covered a large oak tree, around the trunk of which the wild vine had been accustomed to cling for support. The young v in, bore the first season, at the lowest calculation, 600 bunches of grapes, Other excellent varieties of the grape may, no doubt, be introduced into the Atlantic and Western States from California, which is said to abound in this fruit. The more the attention of fruit raisers is turned to this subject also, it is probable that the characters of our native grapes in all parts of the country will be developed, and experiments tried to improve them by cultivation. It is believed that many varieties exist in the larger settled States which have not been examined, and which may hereafter become valuable. The following statement respecting the grape crop of Ohio, is from a communication of N. Long worth, esq, to the editor of the Cincinnati Gazette. The editor of the Gazette had thus described the prospect: "the vantage on the Ohio has commenced, which will' last for two or three weeks. We are glad to hear that the damage ,to the grape crop has proved very light to what was feared. Any vine dressers, who, a few weeks since, expected to lose two thirds of their crop, will not lose one-eighth. There are how several hundred acres in this county alone devoted to the vineyards, and the amount of wine made will be quite large, for which a sure demand exists n reply, Mr. Long worth says: I regret to say that you are under a mistake when you say that 'the grapes in our vicinity have not been seriously injured' My tenants, about two months since, confidently calculated on making 25,000 galls. of wine; but the rot came, and they have, on an average, lost two thirds of their crop, and they will not make more than 8,000 or 9,000 gallons. One of the vineyards, adjoining others similarly located, escaped entirely. It is worthy of note that in general, grapes in the bottoms, or near the bottom of the bill, escaped; but our grape culture has increased so much of late years, that I presume the quantity of wine made this year will be greater than in any former, year. The fruit ri pens from three weeks to a month earlier than in any former year. In some vineyards, the grapes ripe n badly. The cause is evident. In Europe, to ripe n the grape well, exposure is necessary, (to the sun) and when about to ripe n they cut off the shoots and leaves. In our hot climate some protection from our hot sur i is necessary. Our Germans most generally do just as they did in Germany. But from adherence to this rule, good sometimes arises, and there is an instance that may account for the grape rot. I believe the rot rarely occurs in a gravely soil. In the top of the hill at Tusculum, I have seven vineyards in bearing, and six of them suffered more or less from the rot. Any of them lost more than two thirds. Those escaped most where the hill was steep, and the water passed off quickly. One of them was in charge of a German uncommonly dull, who dug his ground just a she did it in Germany. He trenched the ground into beds about twelve feet wide, and raising the ground some 18 inches, or two feet, in the centre, and sloping to the sides, where there is a gully 168 X. that speedily passed off the water. He has not a rotten grape in his vine yard, which covers nearly seven acres The grape culture is carried on to some extent also in Missouri. We find it stated in a public journal, that farms in the neighborhood of Her mann, Missouri, have risen very much of late in consequence of the increased cultivation of the vine. A Mr. Poeschel, who has a vine yard of not quite an acre, which was planted with the Catawba grape, in the spring of 1845, made from it this year 1000 gallons of wine, and the value of the whole produce was                                                                                                                                                             $1,700. Among the plants which seem to promise to become an object of interest for cultivation in the United States may be mentioned the tea plant. By the enterprise of Dr. Genius Smith, the experiment has recently been begun in South Carolina, under circumstances which would indicate that the question of its success may soon be decided. Partial attempts have before been made by planting a few seed. But Dr. Smith has brought out plants of seven years growth, and only a week or two since announced to the New Yorkfarmers' Club that it is in blossom. In his letter respecting this fact, he says: That on the 15th and 16th of December, 1848, he planted out at Green ville, South Carolina, the tea seed which he carried with him, and went to work preparing the ground for the reception of his tea plants, which, he adds, " was no slight labor in this hilly, rocky, stumpy, root y domain." His packages of plants arrived some time after him, and in opening them, he says several of his plants were in full bloom, with their leaves fresh and green, as if growing in China; others with the blossom bud just showing its ivory breast ready to develop e all its beauties." You may say, therefore, that the tea plant is in blossom in South Carolina. In Tuesday the 26th of December, he planted out the first tea shrubs ever cultivated in the United States for agricultural and commercial purposes. But of five hundred plants he found but five which he thought of doubtful vitality, and these he transferred to the infirmary, and subjected them to vigilantnursing7We have deemed this event of sufficient importance to be thus distinctly chronic led in our report, as should the attempt not disappoint the expectations of its enterprising project or, the period of the introduction of the cultivation of the tea plant in this country will be an era deserving remembrance, and the name of the introduced will be associated with those of similar benefactors to their countrymen, who have, by their enterprise and talents, added greatly to our resources and prosperity. There is a large tract of our country which falls within the latitude in which tea is most successfully raised in China, In Dr. Smiths pamphlet on the subject, he says it grows there most luxuriantly between the parallels of 20 and 450 north latitude. "I n the geographical and physiological views of that portion of the United States, presumed to be best adapted to the growth of the tea plant` he says: "he may assume the latitude of 40 as the northern, and the Gulf of Mexico as the southern limits of the tea x. 169 growing districts. The extent of country lying south of 400 north latitude embraces Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, Kentucky, and partially the four States of Ohio) I n diana, Pennsylvania, and Missouri, and all the States south of these. The northern portion of Newcastle county, Delaware, he states, is parallel with He kin, one of the finest tea growing districts in China. Parts of Maryland are also thought to promise well, being parallel with another tea growing country in China. In the upper country of Southcarolina, he states, we are parallel with three of the most abundant tea growing provinces of China. Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky, are also mentioned as possessing more or less adaptation to the culture and growth of this exotic. The annual consumption of tea in the United States is about 11,000,000 pounds; and or. Smith remarks, that upon the hypothesis that the average product of an acre of land is 547 pounds, it will require the cultivation 'of 20 109 acres of land only to supply the present consumption of the United States. Allowance of course must, however, be made for the increase of consumption which, for many years, will probably be in advance of the amount that can be furnished at home, so that, should the attempt to introduce the growth of it among us be crowned with success, there will be a wide field opened to supply our own wants, to say nothing of the foreign market that may open to us. In this view of the subject, the enterprise is one which must warmly enlist the best wishes for its success of our fellow countrymen; and the day may not be far distant when they may have the pleasure of regaling themselves with cups of delicious tea made from the fresh products of their own soil and industry. A writer from China remarks, in reference to fresh tea: "he drank some green tea in less than thirty-six hours from the time the leaves were plucked from the plant. There is hardly any thing so delicious as fresh green tea drank, as the Chinese always drink it, without sugar or milk. You must come to China, if you wish to taste this luxury, for all green tea loses much of its flavor by being kept; and the finest kinds will not bear to be transported across the ocean t is well known that the tea plant has been introduced into Brazil with some success. In Is sam, the British government has so far determined the question of practice ability that hopes are entertained of ultimately being able to raise enough to supply the English market. The dairy and its products is every year becoming more a subject of interest to the farmers of our country. Great advances have been made within a few years, and new information is continually elicited on these important topics. In many of the agricultural f airs, and the reports of agricultural societies, these articles hold an important place. Observations respecting them will be found in the communications in reply to our circular, placed in the appendix No. 3. We propose, also, to sub join, also in an appendix to. 9, some of the best drawn up statements as to the manufacture of butter or cheese, and which have appeared since the last report 1 0 . X, a. A new method of increasing the quantity of cream produced from milk, and preserving milk, has been discovered by Francis Gerard Bekaert, a citizen of Belgium, and we find it thus describedinNewtons London Journal for January, 1848, in an account of a patent for the purpose, taken out in England: " The invention consists, firstly, in a method of increasing the quantity of cream produced from milk, by the addition of one table spoonfuls of the liquid, hereafter described, to every quart of new milk; the milk is then stirred once or twice round, and left in the pan or vessel; and the swimming may take place at the expiration of the usual time, b ut the patentee prefers to delay it a little. He states that, by the application of the liquid, a much larger quantity is forced to the surface of the milk than can be obtained in the ordinary way. The liquid is prepared by adding to one quart of water, one ounce of the carbonate of soda, one tea spoonfuls of a solution of turn eric, or curcuma, and three drops of marie old water. When making large quantities of the liquid, it is not requisite to weigh the soda, as the same purpose is answered by putting such a quantity of soda into water as will, when dissolved, on application of a Salometer known in Belgium, by the denomination of a " A6reset, is how a density equal to ten degrees. The soda is first mixed with the water, and then the solution of turn eric and the marigoldwater are added The patentee claims, under this head of his invention, any salt of soda, when mixed as before stated, and applied to milk, for the purpose of causing a larger quantity of cream to rise to the surface the milk than is procured by the ordinary process. The soda and water form the basis of the improvement, the solution of turmericand marie old water being only used to improve the color and quality of the butter made from the cream, and not being essentially necessary to effect the increase of the cream. Although the patentee finds the use of the soda most convenient, he claims any other all ali when applied in a similar way. The second part of the invention consists in the following method of preserving milk: One table spoonfuls of a solution of soda, made by dissolving one ounce of carbonate of soda in a quart of water, is introduced into a quart bottle, nearly filled with new milk, only sufficient space having been left for the spoonfuls of liquid; after which the bottle is corked, and a piece of string put round the cork to prevent it from flying, and then the bottles are put into a copper or other vessel containing cold water, which is to be gradually brought to the boiling point, When this has been effected, the fire is to be withdrawn from beneath the copper, or the vessel, if move able, is to be taken off the fire, and the water and the contents of the bottles are allowed to cool; the bottles are then taken out of the water and packed awaycid127We have seen no account of the testing of this process, andihavequoted it as a method .with can be easily tried. Possibly there may be something of value in it. The use of all ali in milk fort various purposes has been common before; but the precise mode of application may perhaps be new. X. a. 171 t is also mentioned, in some of the foreign journals, that a chemical i] process has been discovered on the estate of Count Ballot, Box all, near It afford, England, which, when used with milk at the milking, will keep it fresh and good for a long time. It is also said to render the conversion of milk into butter and cheese easy, but the particular method is not given; it may possibly be the same, or a similar one, with that we have already quoted. In Pieces Hoch en Platt is an article by C. Chintz on the testing of 'milk, from which we translate the following remarks: " The testing by the police of the milk brought for sale to cities is commonly done by the araeometer; and this instrument, in connection with the judgment afforded by the color and fluid it, is sufficient to prove, superficially, the quality of the milk' but the araeometer may give occasion to error, as the milk is the lighter the more fat it contains. It is, therefore, worth the pains, at least, to possess a method by which, in no long time, and without expense, a positive result may be obtained as to the proportions of the milk. : Some investigations and experiments, made for this purpose, have brought me acquainted lately with the method of Or. Said len, in Stuttgart, as a simple and pretty ready one. And a sit is a subject of interest to agriculturists to know the quality of milk according to the fodder, the following communication will not here be out of place. It is known that milk has the peculiarity of foaming up very much in boiling, and covering .itself with a thick s cum; but this so hinders the penetration of the milk with steam, for the purpose of separating the water from the solid elements, that we can in this way reach no accurate results. This now is simply and conveniently attained, if we put in a little shallow force lain saucer J of an ounce of finely pulverized gypsy m, and pour over it one half ounce of the milk to be examined. Is soon as this mixture becomes warm, the milk is quickly de composed. Utter, and cheese attach themselves to the gypsy m powder, and we can then let it boil quickly without any danger of losing any port on of the solid substances. We may, therefore, conduct this operation in the most convenient manner by placing the saucer on, sheet iron, under which is set a little common spirit lamp. When the contents of the saucer has reached to a doughy consistency, which takes place in a quarter of an hour, then 'must the heat be diminished in order that the organic elements of the milk may suffer no elementary decomposition. A vapour bath is appropriate for the drying of the paste in the best and simplest manner, and the most compendious arrangement consists in placing beneath the force lain saucer another similar but somewhat deeper one, made of copper, which is partly filled with water. The gypsy m paste becomes gradually changed into a large, grained, dried powder, so that it is easy to perceive when the water has elaborated. We then place the saucer in the scales, note the weight again, return it to the vapor, and after some time weigh it again as soon as the two weighings successively are equal, we may then take it for granted that all the substance of the water is lost, which it can lose at 3000 of centigrade172Ex. a. Of the weight of the empty saucer has been before accurately noted, then from this the proportion of solid elements in the milk can be easily computed. The gypsy m which is employed for this purpose is burned and again dissolved, and then dried in the form of powder at 100' cent i grade, and kept in a well closed flask. Of also we wish to know how much fat is contained in that portion which contains the solidresiduum, it can be readily seen if we extract the powder in it by means of sulphuric ether; the loss of weight thus occasioned then gives the quantity of fat which is contained in the milk. In an average, milk contains 10 to 12 per cent. of fatty matter but milk which is designed for market is commonly robbed of its creamy quality, so that it often contains only 6 per cent. of solid parts, and that which is bought at double the price of milk for cream, I have found contained 14 per cent. The araeometer used for measuring the quality of cream, mentioned by the author above, is thus described: The arreometer or gage is a every deceptive instrument for the purchase of milk brought to market, as by a double adult e ration the original weight may be again restored, when, by swimming off the cream, the milk becomes heavier, and by the addition of water is rendered lighter again. Besides, the usual areometer cannot be used for the purpose, as the range of the different specific weights to be here met with is only from 1 to 1.04, so that for example, in Beckcid127) arsometer, for heavy fluids, only the degree of 17 comes into consideration; in such an armometer therefore to be made useful, it must be read off at least by quarter degrees. But, provided with a scale of this Sort, the arzeometer can only be profit ably used for judging of the quality of milk, when we either know beforehand that the milk has received no addition of water, in which case it allows you to conclude on the greater proportion of cream the lighter it is; or, if s dimmed milk is subjected to examination, in which case it may be regarded as of better quality the heavier it is found to be. Any valuable observations might here be introduced from a volume procured recently from Germany, bearing the title of Diemilchwirthchaft, in I inner grosser State ut rd dere n na chester Umgebung, or the Hairy in large cities or their vicinity a manual for dairy men, by Joseph Bitter von Schrieber. This work is highly commended in the German agricultural journals. Of is, as it professes to be, "a guide to the choice of animals, with a constant regard to a near and large place of consumption according to the best observed and latest experiments, with the advantages thereto belonging, and how to feed, take care, withhold and protect from accidents, also to manage the products, and in the most profitable method impart to them a value n the prosecution of this design, he discusses withcid127) much ability a great variety of topics connected with the general subject. He can but glance at a few of these, but should there be sufficient time to do so, may add something further to the appendix. In his first chapter, he treats of the stalls for cows 1 and enters with part x. 
173ticilarity into the mode of, construction and their external situation, dwells on the chief requisites, air, light, space, and points out how the various desirable objects may be secured. He urges strongly that the stalls should be from 10 to 12 feet in height, so as to allow full and free ventilation; that it be maintained, if possible, at an average temperature of about 600 Fahrenheit, as the degree proved by experiment to be the best. He considers light also to be very necessary, and a space for each head of 7 to 8 feet long by 31 to 4 feet in breadth should be allowed. He likewise gives particular instructions respecting the rack or manger, accompanied with many sensible suggestions. The next principal topic which engages his attention is that of the choice of a cow destined for milk. Were he examines into the different races, and notes the methods on which some degree of reliance may be placed, and after speaking of Guenons method, admits it to be ingenious, but deems it for the most part impracticable, or so complicated in its details as to be of little use. The peculiarities of the various races are distinguished as to hair, color, bodily form, &c. He mentions here the Miirzthal cow, which, it may be recollected, was recommended by Mr. Fleischmann in the last report, and the notice of which, at that time, appears to have excited a wish in several of our stock bleeders to import it to this country, an object, which it is hoped, may be effected. As this part of our authors remarks may be interesting to our countrymen, we will quote it: "he   t is raised in the charming border territory of Upper Steiermark, which reaches from Power Austria, beyond Homme ring, along the course of the little rivers Our z, opposite the bridge which crosses at Our. This beautiful breed, like the lovely country itself, appears to have been produced, as already mentioned, as one from the first stock or race. The whitish, grey cow of southeasternEurope, by the influence of cultivation, but especially by the enjoyment of aromatic pastures on the mountains, sometimes their resort, have become very greatly improved, and established a middle race. Their original peculiarities of bodily form have, under the advantageous circumstances of centuries, raised them up to the noblest representatives of the first stock breed. In bodily structure, the Miirzthal breed have assumed an entirely different, rounded, and agreeable form; their skin and hair have become more elastic, finer, softer; the color itself has changed from smut ty white into slavish grey, and often in the case of bulls, the cattle are wholly dark. The peculiarities too, which, in the' original stock were defective, have also undergone a change, but those remain which were valuable in the former; the capacity for milk is maintained, while on the other hand the capacity for fattening is not lost From Muirzthal, this breed of cows have spread into the neighboring country of Power Austria, especially in the two forest regions, where the cultivation of fodder, and particularly of c lover is carried to a large extent, and where in the vicinity of the resident population of nearly a half a million, the new milk business must174Ex. be c n ducted with energy. By crossing also the same with the, native cows, a generally lighter colored breed passing into a slate grey is formed, which with good feeding, is rich in milk, large and stout for draft, and easily to be fattened. We may call them in general, Austrian native breed. Since the existence of the exhibitions of 'horned cattle of the I imperial Agricultural Society at Vienna, and distribution of prizes to the country, these cows have improved in a very satisfactory manner. The efforts of the villagers to procure good bulls, partly from Mirzthal itself, and partly by in breeding, has been followed by the most profitable results; we already see with pleasure whole herds of beautiful approved cows on the pastures, and only here and there is there an individual which, on account of the poverty of its owner, is deficient in food. The' not unfounded preference for a light color, causes the farmer to choose in the raising of calves those of this kind, and we find by far the greatest numbers of the whole, white, passing into pale yellow, light brown, or slate grey; the latter color, for the most part, predominates among the but locks. This breed often endures admirably the rough and rapidly changing climate of Austria, succeeds with suitable care, and in the course of years standing in the dark stalls of the/ city, not a little of its usefulness The Murzthal breed has spread out of Austria into many parts of Germany. I h ve met with some pure herds in Bavaria, Wurtemburg, Silesian, &c. In such cases they have not fulfilled the high expectations which was formed of their milk product, because the altered mode of treatment and fodder did not agree with the animals that were accustomed to, their so richly aromatic mountainpasturesThe Jfurzthal cow is then peculiarly the invaluable source from, which the cow bleeders of the provinces, and contiguous countries, derive fresh blood for their native breeds; it is the valuable race which serves for a constant demand of the low lands lying in the vicinity, more for the object of recruiting their stock than for purebreedingMr. On Schreiber next lays down his rules for the selection of single animals, alluding to the bodily form under the the particulars of bony system, horns, hide, hair, and size of the body. Very part of the animal is considered and portrayed, then those indications which are useful for judging as to the capacity for milk. He gives the method for raising the calf and also of doddering and taking care of the much cow, and under this head offers many valuable suggestions, the result of long experience. The following are his signs of a good cow Signs of a good cow Bodily form desirable. This is expressed first, by the bony structure, by the condition, form, and position of the loins, y the state of the hide and hair, and by the size of the body. The bony structure should be firm and compact. Great thick bones are mostly of a spongy kind, and betray a similar peculiarity of all other parts of the body; especially must the head be light x. a. 175 and fine. The judgment of the head in battle is of the greatest importance; a practised cattle breeder .will be in a situation to form a pretty correct judgment of the worth of the animal by the mere sight of the head. With cows, as with bulls, a fine and little head, and also clear large eyes, and widely opened nostrils are desirable. Next in importance is the build of the chest and of the breast. In the customary space in the hollow of the breast depends the normal functions of the lungs and heart. This should, therefore, be sufficiently wide and deep, as a continual contraction disturbs, to disadvantage, all the other functions of the animal organization, And, at the same time, the assimilation of fodder, and hence, for milk. In calves, tenderness and whiteness of flesh may be distinguished by the light color of the hair, and, therefore, white calves are preferred before dark colored ones; but white calves are only to be expected from light colored cows. The value of a cow for milk depends essentially on her age. The highest degree of capacity for milk, normally, is with the third calf, (in general in the fifth year of her lifeSchreibers marks to choose a good much cow are the following 1. The udder. By feeling, ascertain whether the size is owing to superfluous flesh or not. It should be examined both before and after milking. Before milking, especially in the morning, because then the most milk is collected, it should be full; not hanging down between the feet, but wide and broad, extending on the belly, and hard and almost shining. After a clean milking out, it should be soft and appear like a large empty bag. Flesh udder s may be known by the want, of this criterion. As for the t eats, all four, the usual number, should be milky, so as to be able to change the two and two in milking; if one of them with holds milk, the udder is defective. There are udders which have two little t eats, and so in all six t eats; but these two small ones are not capable of being milk ed besides I have only met with this appearance in good much cows. It is desirable that all four of the t eats together should form a square and be of equal size. They should not be too broad and thick, but long and thin. Very excrescence on the that, whether a wart or other prominence, or a crack, is a defect, which impairs the milking while it occasions pain to the animal. It is also a good sign when the udder is almost wholly without hair, or covered' only with a few short, fine, shiny hairs 2. The milk veins that is, those organs which form the blood channels, and run along on both sides of the belly in two main branches, are not less decisive proofs of the value or little worth of a much cow. Of they run on clear, full within and strong, or are they crooked, serpentine, knotty and confused; if, further, there are openings, gaps, at which the milk veins on the belly end little milk pits especially those on the left sides, and they are large and distinct these are marks of a strongly developed milk system which is favorable for the secretion of milk; and, besides176Ex. indicate that the cow may, by good food, afford a milk product in large quantity. Were is the place to oppose a delusion which I have often met among cow bleeders: they give great value to compactly expressed milk veins, as they believe that these milk veins conduct the milk to the udder, and accordingly maintain the fluid running in the milk veins (the blood) to be milk. But they should know that these so called milk veins have scarcely any direct relation with the milk and the udder; but they are the canals which conduct the blood from the breast to the veins of the groins. Besides, the two milk veins are not equally strong usually the left one is the stronger, which is therefore called the main milk vein. Of these two great milk veins are branched into smaller milk veins, with little Separate pits, before they end on the belly, this is regarded as an admirable sign of capacity for milk 3. The state of the outer cover, i. e. the hide and hair, presents also a mark by which to ascertain the capacity. The hide should, be thin, light, supple and greasy the hair short and fine. A thick, stiff and coarse hide, and bristly hair, are poor signs for the milk capacity of a cow, as well as in general to be but little commended 4. The bony and bodily structure, finally, must not be too strong, the bones not too thick; on the other hand, the neck and snout long, the rum p broad, the fore part lighter, the tail long and thin. Line and shining horns many persons also consider a property of good much cows. The first and main impression which an animal rich in milk makes on the be holder must be a certain feminine type a female, I might say, softer form of body which expresses itself in all parts of the animal structure of the members. A longer practice of the eye places us in a situation to form this impression at once; and this it is which will not deceive us, except in a very few cases, and the less when also the signs heretofore mentioned give a favorable indication. In the subject of feeding, the author lays down some rules and, although this might be introduced in another part of the report, yet it may not be inappropriate here. They are of a general character, and apply to cattle as well as to much cows 1. The animal needs for its sole support of life for every 100 pounds of bodily weight (live weight) 1- pounds of hay or fodder, which is reduced to hay value. All above this may be termed production fodder 2. We should feed cattle to their full satisfaction' The proof of this in good health is that they will eat no more, lie down and begin to ruminated. In adapting any quantity computed as fully satisfactory, regard should be had to the bodily appearance of the animal; if we perceive that it is comfortable and thrives, together with a perfect fulfilment of the object of its keeping, the if we should continue this method of feeding, unless there be others of still greater profit in view. X. 1774. The quantity of fodder must be taken in the ass according to our purpose, together with the greatest possible profit from milk, also to obtain a value in flesh 5. In an often unavoidable change of feed, we should ascertain accurately the proportion of the value of the substituted fodder to the former one, in order that the same quantity of nutritions matter may be appropriated to the improvement of the animal. Together with the above we find some maxims also laid down for the better carrying out of these rules. But to dwell on these particulars would occupy too large a space. As to the method of feeding, he presents three points as essential To be kept in view the proper time; the preparation corresponding to the object and the quantity of the various portions of the fodder. In winter he recommends the first meal to be given at 5 o clock in the morning, divided into portions; after milking, between 6 or 7 o clock, e gives the second portion; between 8 or 9, the third; between 11 or 12, the second meal for the first portion; between 2 or 3, the second portion of the noon allowance about 4, the third. Before milking, between half past 5 and 6 o clock, the first division of the evening fodder; about 7 o clock, the remainder, until the vow indicates that she is satisfied and wishes rest. In the summer he would begin with green fodder about 4 clock in the morning; give, especially of green c lover, frequent and small portions, until she begins to be satisfied and ruminated. Of driven to pasture, fodder, once before driving, then the green foddering will be begun timely, and go on in small portions, uninterruptedly, till the time of evening. After milking, fodder out the remainder until there is an excellent desire for rest. The pasture cow must, on its return home, find the little portions of green fodder prepared for her. He indicates strongly, also, the necessity of punctually in observing the hours of fodder, and remarks on the size of the portions to be given, and the importance of drink, salt, the preparation of the bed, &c. In the management of milk there are many valuable observations as to the question, when and how often daily the cow should be milked? he says it is determined by experiment, that by milking three times a day, always taking for granted that there is equal state of foddering, there is a gain in quantity, which is to be attributed to the repeated excitement of the milk organs. But in proportion a sit gains in quantity it falls off in substance, that is the fatty or creamy contents; the milk is so much the more watery the greater the quantity is. The milk of cows which gradually fall off in production of milk, is more fatty than of those which secrete the greatest quantity of milk. The additional labor of milking three times also is a consideration. Of three times of the day is adopted as on the whole the best, he recommends these to be at 6 in the morning, 12 noon, and 7 in the evening, as this will bring the milking and foddering into proper connection. He enters minutely into the description of the kind of pails, pans, &c. to be used, the material6178Exi. Doc. No. 59.form, size, &c: as also with reference to the milk room enforce s great attention to cleanliness in all the various arrangements and operations. A mode of preserving milk from a work entitled "11 late e suviprodotti del Vol tore Antonio Cattaneo" (milk and its products, by Doctor Antonio Cattaneo) is thus described: " Will the fresh milk from the cow into new glass bottles that have not been before used; stop them up with corks dipped in fat fasten them with a wire, and then place the bottles so stopped up in a kettle, the bottom of which is covered with a layer of straw, and in which straw is placed on the sides and between the bottles to prevent them from breaking. Next fill the kettle with water and let it gradually boil. After the kettle is again removed from the fire, and the water is cooled, the bottles are again taken out and set in a cool place. After six months the milk will be found to have kept perfectly good may Us sac proved by experiments, that if we expose good and pure milk gradually to a heat of 100 cent i grade, and this operation be repeated in the winter for two days, and in the warmer period three days, it can be kept without pouring for two months. The use of the rapp anus raphanistrum or' hedge mustard, mixed with distilled water, is said likewise to preserve milk for eight days, and the separation of the cream is prevented without any disagreeable taste for this time. In the question relating to the quality and quantity of milk as affected by the different kinds of fodder, On Schreiber gives the following list of articles of fodder in three classes 1. Those articles of fodder which have a beneficial effect on the goodness and quantity of the milka. Baize in a green, juice state, i. e. at the time of its blossom b.

All the articles of fodder in a very fatty state, for instance drink of oil cake and br an. I n: respect to butter, he states the general rule to be that 7 x. measures of milk will produce one measure of cream, from which may be obtained one pound of butter; and closes his remarks on this subject with the celebrated Vol stein description of good matter: " Beautiful and specially good butter must be wholly free from all cheese particles, all milk and they and all water; must form a homogeneous mass throughout, which is thoroughly solid but not dry, and must have little appearances called lack berlin; it must be all of one similar orange yellow color of an agreeable fresh, nut like, sweet aromatic taste and smell peculiar to itself The rule which Cabs t, a distinguished German agricultural writer, lays down as regards the production of milk, is reckoning as the daily fodder 31 to 6- lbs. of hay value for 100 lbs. bodily weight, and says we may expect 40 lbs. of milk 16 quarts for 100 les. of hay value. But as half of the fodder is production fodder, we may reckon for 100 lbs, in hay value, of production fodder, 80 les. of milk; and, besides, the cow will furnish one calf in the year. According to these rules of foddering, there must be on the 100 les. of bodily weight, yearly, a milk product of 500 lbs. A cow of 500 lbs, therefore, will give 2,500 lbs; a cow of 800 lbs, 4,000lbs. of milk; one of 1,200 lbs. will give 6,000 lbs. of milk. He considers the milk which will produce one pound of butter for 28 les. of milk as of medium quality for goodness; the proportion of cream to the milk in this kind is 12 to 14 per cent, with inferior it sinks as low as 10 per cent, and with the superior rises to 18 per cent. The general rule given is to use about 1, to 2- quarts of cream for one pound of butter. As the allowance which Hope gives is 12 to 14 quarts of milk for one pound of butter, the yearly product of a cow at this rate is 1, l 1 to 2 cut. This is stated as an average, though there are cows in Germany as well as in this country which yield a far larger product. In On Weckherlins valuable work on agricultural animal production, he has devoted several pages to the subject now under notice, and given some tables which it may be interesting to quotehere4Ex, a. The author observes: "I t is not uninteresting to notice the above comparison. Thus, the product in a large average of one cow considered without regard to the quantity of fodder, according to table I., is 1,004 ma as, (the ma as being estimated at 4 lbs) According to table I I .a, 1,030 ma as; the highest average product, according to table I., 1,950 ma as; according to table I I .a, 1,637 ma as; but in particular animals, according to table I I .a, 1,860-2,200 ma as, besides the milk allowed to the calves After all that I have observed, in actual production, far and near, the continued average milk product per cow, and by the year must be set at from 1,600 to 1,800 ma as, at 4 lbs. each, and with rich fodder as the maximum on which there may be an increase in the whole cow race; all that is above, are exceptions of individual animals in particular years." According to table I., on a daily foddering of 22 lbs, reduced to hay value, for one cow of seven hundred live weight, therefore, with a yearly foddering of eighty hundred, hay value, there is produced for each head 894 ma as of milk yearly, or for one hundred of collective fodder 11- ma as of milk. According to table I I .a, we estimate on a hundred of collective fodder 11- ma as, which exhibits an interesting close agreement from the most diverse circumnstancescid127I n the Transactions of the agricultural society, Essex county, Massachusetts, we find a number of statements respecting the productive ness of much line, which show that in this country the quantity of milk and butter obtained is much larger than in Germany, according to the statements, and the table we have quoted. A two year old he ifer, half native and half Durham breed, five weeks after her first calf, gave ten quarts of milk per day, and six pounds of butter were made from her in one week. In another case, a he ifer three years old, gave from March 1 to September 15, 4,280 pounds 12 ounces, and one pound of butter was obtained from 28, pounds of milk. In this latter case the calf also weighed 146 pounds, and sold for                            $5.84. Another still is mentioned, from which, in June, from one weeks milk, at ten to twelve qu arts per day, was made eight pounds of butter, and in September eight quarts of milk per day, four days of which being set, produced four pounds of butter. Of the cows which obtained premiums, the first was six years old, and from the third of June, the day on which her calf was taken from her, till the third of July; thirty days, she gave 1,291pounds of milk, or an average of 43' pounds per day. A quart weighed 24 pounds, so that the average yield per day was equal to 18 quarts. Men pounds of butter were made from her in one week. The next one, eight years old, is said to have given in thirty days 1, 255 1 pounds, and as 43 ounces measured a quart, it gives an average of 15 quarts and a pint for each day. From 422 quarts was churned 56, pounds of first rate butter Other months also yielded largely, and from 121 days' product of milk, was obtained 192 -1 pounds of butter Of another z the statement is that from July 1 to Septemberex. 1852 8, 89 days, the yield of milk amounted to 3,186, and from 306 pounds of milk was made 15 pounds of butter. Another, eight years old, gave from April 28 to September 28,2,405 quarts of milk. Another, nine or ten years old, from April 25 to September 26, gave 6, 122 1 pounds of milk to 2, 448 4 quarts, or 15.71 quarts per day, and yet another, ten years old, in 11 months gave 5,562 pounds, or 2,384 quarts, in which* time the amount of milk sold, 2,000 quarts, at 5 cents per quart, gave                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100. We have inserted these statements for the sake of comparison with the various estimates in last years report, as well as with the foregoing extracts from the German journals. It is evident, from a review of various agricultural reports, and the statements made respecting the amount of milk from cows offered for premium, that the quantity of milk used in the country, and that also applied to the purpose of butter and cheese, must be very great, more in the aggregate than hardly any one has the least idea of. We have no precise data on which to found an extended estimate, for in none of the census returns of the States do we find the number of much cows specified. But in the state of New Work, in 1845, the amount of butter reported as made was about 80,000,000,and that of cheese 36,000,000 pounds. Were we to allow for every pound of butter 25 pounds of milk, which is probably a low average, and reckon these at about 10 or 12 qu arts, this would give 800,000,000 or more quarts, or 200,000,000gallons of milk. But considering the proportion of milk used for butter as one half throughout the whole State, and this would give for the single State of New York not less than 400,000,000 of gale ons of milk used, besides what is applied to butter and cheese; and were this reckoned at only 2 cents per quart, would be the sum. of                           $32,000,000, while the butter at only 10 cents per pound, and the cheese at 5 cents per pound, a low estimate for each, would amount to                      $8,000,000 for butter, and the cheese to                                                                                                                                                             $1,800,000, making the aggregate of the milk product of the single State of New York at a very low estimate at least                                    $40,000,000, equal to two thirds of the cotton crop of s the United States. According to the census of the United States in 1840, the number of neat cattle, including all kinds, was for Pennsylvania and Ohio each about one quarter less than in New Work. As it is believed that the number of oxen used in New York is greater than in Pennsylvania and Ohio, supposing a similar ratio to hold good, and modified by this last consideration in these two States with respect to much line, we may probably consider the milk product of each of the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio, then at about one fifth less than in New Work. It is very probable, however, that the proportion would be less with respect to Ohio at the present time. But, allowing it as we have mentioned, we must consider the milk products of Pennsylvania and Ohio equal to at least                  $64, 00000,00 and the aggregates for these States and New Work would be equal to over                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100,000,000. Were this estimate to be extended to the other States, the amount in value must be enormous 186 X. a. In addition to these products, we have made no account of the quantity of milk consumed by the calves, and the value of these calves thus raised, many of which bring from                          $3 to                            $5 or more apiece. We believe, indeed, that the increase since 1845, has been large in the State of Tea) York and all the States, not only of the amount, but also of the value of the milk products. The railroads opened to market and other causes have probably affected the price, and our valuation has been placed lower than the average prices returned to our circular. Some valuable publications on raising of cattle, or agricultural animal production, have been received the past year from Germany, but they were not in season to be sufficiently examined for the report; though it is hoped we may be able to add something to the appendix from these volumes, which have never appeared in English, before the report is published. Very important question in reference to breeds, influence on climate, on races, the quality, quantity of food, modes of feeding, care of the animals, economical results, &c, is discussed, and a vast amount of interesting facts derived from experiments condensed in these investigations. It is true that, in the present state of our husbandry, and furnished with the means which our country possesses, many of the details are less useful here than they are in those countries where these works are written. But even to our own farmers these discussions would no doubt prove eminently instructive, as they present the results of scientific and practical knowledge combined, and most important hints might be gained from them. They are, however, now locked up in a language inaccessible to nearly all, and as there is little prospect that they can ever reach our agricultural public in any other way, we feel more desirous, if possible, to accomplish so desirable an object. One of the treatises to which reference was made in the last report, that of On Manner has not yet been completed, and it is not, therefore, thought advisable to give it in part. But the able work of A. On Webkherlin, "lie Landwirthschaftliche Thierproduktion) (agricultural animal production) we have in the library of the Patent Office, and from this we may derive some extracts. In this able production, he has embodied many suggestions and views from Euers Dietetics or preservation of the health of the horses, sheep, and cattle, which he regards as one of great practical interest to the stock breeder. Of On Weekherlin himself, as an author, we may quote Dr. Lengkerkes opinion, who, in his survey of agricultural literature, alluding to an earlier volume on the breeding of cattle, says: "The best and, we may add, standard or model work in its kind is that of On Wecklherlin, director at Cohnheim, who, in the most comprehensive manner, has treated this subject of the highest importance for agriculture, according to previous personal examinations in all !parts of the country, with as much knowledge\ of the matter as sound good sense, and gives us suggestions for improved x. a. 187 cents, the suitable ness of which is so apparent, that they must be admitted by every candid reader, and have already for the .most part been adopted by the royal government5The importance which On Weckherlin attaches to this branch of farm husbandry may be understood from the following paragraph: "very particular cases excepted, the raising of cattle should constitute the beginning, as well as the end, in the designed improvement of agriculture and its net product at the outset, in respect to the increase of manure in which the quality of the stock bred may be less regarded; but, especially at the end, when the land is once properly strengthened, in respect to quality; because the increase of income of the vegetable production finally reaches its limits, but the increase of quality, and thus the net income of animal production, scarcely has any limits' " I must, therefore, regard it as a main object of my system of animal production to furnish whatever is further adapted to the increasing improvement of the raising of animals of every kindle divides the means of nutriment into those of intensive and extensive. Under the intensive are comprehended all those which produce much in organic stimulus, provided with highly developed animal capabilities; for example, the nervous matter, brain, powerful muscles, &c. Under the extensive means of nutriment, are included those of the raw product, which is of less importance, on structures provided with less animal capabilities, while yet the organism becomes more voluminous than in the former case by the increased development of the common organs, as, for example, masses of bone, hair, claws, hoofs; a lo fat, milk, &c. According to the greater proportion of inferior nutritions elements, the means of nutriment exert a stronger stimulating power on animal bodies, exciting the organs of digestion to activity. Thenutritious elements standing low in the scale of improvement, are their most essential stimulating substances; and the excitement produced thereby, though in different degrees, is indispensable to nourishment. The g radiations of the most common nutritions elements into which organic chemistry especially divides the means of animal nutrition, from the most common to the most i reproved and refined kind, and so of the strongest to the weak est stimulating substances, are Acids, (sharp substances Bitter extract i ve substance, tanninVegetable slime at, oil and wax Green sediment are powder, and vegetable resinGumSugarStarchAlbumenGluten of the meal y <a name="seeds15"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. Respecting the above, he remarks that the effect of the acids188Ex. was, for example, in <a name="potatoes29"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is to keep down the activity of the nerves. ,they are the occasion of powerful watery secretions in the body. The use of such food as contains too much acid produces diarrhoea. In general, s ich food is not readily eaten by the domestic animals. Under certain circumstances for example, with heat, the use of water, &c, on account of antiputrescent effect, limiting the dissolution of the juices they may be very beneficial, and thus sought for by the animals themselves. As to the tanninfor instance, in a corns, leaves, straw, &c the effect of the bitter extract i ve substance consists in this, that it raises the mot ability (activity) so that the means of nutriment, which is mixed with it in suitable quantity, becomes, in consequence, a powerful nourishment. Masses indicate it by their (bitter sweet) harsh, a stringent taste, more than c lover does; it increases the contraction of the animal fibrous system; gives to the parts more firmness, (tone) and, therefore, is well fitted to operate against many injurious influences. Used with lax active food, it acts very beneficially. Vegetable slime, as in oil cake or gum. I to effect consists in lessening the extension of the fibres, which is followed by the frequent lax ness and the scanty formation of the animal sized juices of the body. The means of nourishment in which it predominates for not give much strength and solidity. Fatty oil, as in oil cake, is indeed nutritions, but is assimilated with difficulty by the domestic animals. Used in large quantities, it is followed by a relaxation of the muscular fibre and the intestinal canal. In fattening, it gives a liquid fat and soft flesh. The sac charing substance, as in bees, is an easily digested, mild, but not strong nutriment, which appears to be converted into a slim y, moist substance, then fibrous matter anti red blood; it therefore operates for the thinning of the juices. The sediment are powder, or starch meal, especially in grain and <a name="potatoes30"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, is not only very nutritions, but also good for digestion. It assimilates perfectly, so that scarcely any excrements are secreted therefrom. For the animal that eats plants, it furnishes a very proper substance for food. I to nourishment, when given in combination with other means of food, goes mainly to the higher organic formations, without exactly including the addition of fat slime and other inferior products. Vegetable albumen, so ruble in water, but by boiling heat, acids c, brought into a coagulated state, is found chiefly in large quantities in cabbage, c lover, white turn is, tube vous plants, &c; and, like glum ten, so does it, especially in grain, in its chemical action, act entirely like animal substances. This means of nutrition, very powerful but very difficult of digestion, favors the formation of fibre. Those nutritions substances in which glum ten predominates very much, easily offer occasion to inflammatory diseases. One of these substances, how nutrition so ever, if given alone, can sustain the life of the animal; on the contrary, a mixture of x, 189 many is suitable to this object. Hence arise the different opinions and the uncertainty as to apportionment of any one of these substances in the nutritions power of the particular means of fodder. All natural means of nutriment of animals, even those apparently the most simple, consist of a combination of many of the above mentioned nutritions and stimulating elements, involved and interwoven with fibrous tissue, (vegetable fibre) which, for the most part, resists the gastric juice and is insoluble in it and so is notnutritious. The mechanical influence of fibre, especially in straw, on the organ of digestion of the rum in ant animal, is not unimporportant. All the means of nutrition with a moderate portion of the least nutritions elements are indigestible or most difficult to digest for this reason they require, as in the rum in ant, a complicated formed stomach and longer, intestinal canal; and also on this account, because a greater volume must be given. To the nutrition elements which are difficult of digestion belong, further, those which need to dissolve them the addition of many acids in the slime of the stomach, as glum ten, coagulated albumen, raw starch; while raw albumen, boiled starch, the varieties of gum and slime, bitter- extracts and sugar, as well as other nutritions elements so ruble in water, are easily digested f a food is hard of digestion, the more lively function of the organs of digestion, which is requisite in addition to the vital power employed, calls for many nutritions juices; which is far less the case if, with the means of food easy of digestion, the process of digestion may go on quietly with much less exertion. Hence it is assumed that the same proportion in nutriment of indigestible means of food, generally, without regard to the kind of combination of the different means of food, will yield from 10 to 12 per cent. less than the means of food which are easily digested. Besides, it is to be noted that it is a very common opinion that means of food easily digested are also the most powerful; but this is not universally true; for example, plants in the green state area more easily digested than in the dry. Experience also reaches us that those which are foddered green operate much more rapidly to produce corpulence than when fed out dry; but the product of the food is very different. Cry food demands more bodily strength, exerts a powerful excitement upon it, and therefore is more perfectly animal sized, as during the longer chewing it is more mixed with saliva. Green and liquid food, indeed, furnishes much blood, but less animal sized fluids; therefore it is not so well adapted to be rapidly converted into the superior animal formation, but operate s more for the production of fat and milk slime, while the compact, firm, muscular flesh is of greater consequence for work the more vigorous, enduring constitution. This bearing it has with many other means of food; for example, slops, mixture of grain and liquid, boiled fodder, &c, which are known to promote fattening. We have drawn somewhat copiously from On Weckherlins view of food; because it presents in a small compass much that is valuable as respects the physiological operation of various kinds on the animal system, and by his close observation and practical knowledge he is190Ex. well qualified to instruct on these subjects. He considers the different modes of preparation of the nutriment its relative value asnutritious and stimulating which he pronounces to be very different from the absolute value that is based on chemical analysis, and on this subject quotes from Euer, who says: " It is a pity that chemistry has taught us to know with any certainty so little comparatively of the means of food of our domestic animals." He guards, also, against the two extremes, as he observes: " It would be as faulty to acknowledge the relative value, which the means of food often exhibit only in a single aspect, for a universal standard as it would be incorrect to wish to make the absolute always to be such a standard, "I n his further examination he keeps this distinction of absolute and relative in view. Under the latter head his inquiries are directed to ascertain a. Whether an article of food is more extensively or intensivelynutritiousb. Whether more or less stimulating c. Whether more or less easily digestedd. The proportion of volume e. The proportion of watery parts f. Now far after all, particularly with reference to the combination with other means of fodder, it is adapted for the different species of animals, and the object for which they are kept These points will show with how much discrimination and care the subject is treated. The particular i ties of the different animals, and the quantity and quality of food, the profit of its application, are all elaborately described, and much valuable matter reduced in illustration of the various topics, and did our limits allow, many most interesting extracts might be made from this able author. A question has sometimes been raised as to the comparative superiority of large or small cattle for the purpose of fattening. I na foreign journal we find mention of some experiments, which we have translated, and which seem to settle it in favor of small cattle. It may be different, however, with different breeds; and it is desirable that accurate trial should be made to see how far any principle can be settled on this subject. The nature of the kind of food also may exercise an influence, and to make the result more conclusive, not only this but the quantity given should be stated. We give the account, however, as it appears in the German journal from which we quote itReviere, in He san, near Lyons, together with On Schottfeld, a scholar of the younger Her, and a conductor of a farm, tried many experiments respecting the foddering of large and small cattle, and always found that the latter paid better than the former. He supposes that the value of fodder for fattening small cattle is one third to three fifths better than of large cattle given for the same object. Severe made a contract with a butcher, according to which, the latter left to him every head of cattle bought by him for fattening, two and a half months, then every pound of live weight that it had gained above what it weighed when taken was x. a. 191 to be paid for at two silver gros when. The cattle were weighed twice, once when taken, and then at the end of the period. It was found now that according to the agreement, the butcher had to take back every third head of the larger animals, because it did not fatten enough, or at least did not repay enough for the fodder. Of the smaller animals, however, on the contrary, scarcely the twentieth or thirtieth was required to be taken back, and the gain in fattening was almost always in inverse proportion to the size. But it must be mentioned that Severe has hitherto tried his experiments with a single breed, a native one in that country The use of, salt used in fattening animals has excited considerable discussion, and as the results are different in different instances furnished by able investigators, perhaps it is still to be regarded as a looted question. We have heretofore alluded to this subject in the former reports of this office. We add now two others taken from the Oekonomische Neuigkeiten. I" Experiments respecting the influence of the common salt in the fattening of sheep by Mr. Mainly. The experiments were tried with three wet hers, of which ten had a portion of salt and ten had none in the fodder which was furnished them in quantities which satisfied them, consisting of after path, <a name="potato32"><mark>potato</mark></a> refuse, injured hay, and husks of corn s talks. The division which received salt consumed more fodder than the other; bu' the difference was so slight, that computed in money for 87 days and for ten wet hers, it amounted only to one france, 56centimes. These animals had during their fattening, 21,750 kilograms of salt of which the price then was .07 6 francs. The very accurate weighings gave the following increase Division with salt in the fodder. Division with usual fodder 1st month, 35,50 kiiogrammes. 10,50 kilogrammes/ 2d " 29,00 C 31,50 "3d " 20,00 " 34, 0084,50 " 76,00 "these show 8,50 kilogrammes in favor of the division which had the salt, (which, reckoning the kilogramme of live weight, at 73,30centimes, as the animals were sold) makes 6 fr. 23 men times, The increase of cost of the fodder in comparison with the other division amounted to 4 francs 82 men times, not reckoning the, salt at any expense. The division with salt, drank during this time 533 litres of water, the other only 256. The whole experiment gave for the division with salt a profit of 41 francs, 47 men times, and for the other of 51 francs, 37 men times. The former division gave 48.13 of flesh and 5.10 of tallow for the 100 pounds of live weight; the second, 45.4 of flesh and 4.86of tallow on the 100. But this division is merely to be regarded as a matter of fact account; for in order that a precise view may be formed concerning the192Ex. foregoing questions, yet further experiments in the same circumstances are necessary The articles in the appendix of the last years report on the breeding of cattle, by Theodore On Manner, will not doubt be recollected by many. The following embraces an account of experiments on the influence of a certain quantity of salt in raising the value of fodder, by Theodore On Lannerthe last winter, I made an experiment for determining the influence of increasing dozes of salt on the appetite of horn cattle in the case of two lean oxen of 1,740 live weight, on about 700 pounds of flesh weight and about 5 per cent. of tallow. For two weeks these two oxen received, twice a week in the evening, per head, cloth (11 oz) of salt, with which both oxen consumed, daily, 34 pounds of choice hay, on an average. After this, the two oxen received the above mentioned portion of salt daily, for ten days, in which, on an average, they both together ate 401 pounds of best hay. With the same daily portion of salt, the two oxen consumed in the next nine days, on a daily average of 461 pounds of best hay, and with the same daily portion of salt, their daily consumption in eleven days more, amounted to 514 pounds of best hay. Afterwards, the two oxen for 18 days, received daily, twice the day, the usual quantity of salt, ind their consumption of fodder rose on the average daily to 55 j pounds of best hay; then they received the usual quantity of salt daily three times in the day, their averaged daily consumption fell to 51 pounds of best hay; this portion of salt thus appeared to be too large, and they were given again for 16 days the usual dose of salt once a day, on which their daily consumption, as before with the same quantity, reached the average of 511 pounds of best hay. The daily consumption of 34 pounds of best hay rose, therefore, with the daily dose of salt to 51 pounds, and with the twice a day portion of salt to 533 pounds of best hay, while, by its being given three times a day, it sunk to 51 pounds of best hay for the two oxen From this exhibit it is evident how important is the furnishing of a proportionate dose of salt with horned cattle, especially when coarse hard hay or much straw is foddered out The subject of sheep was so fully treated in the last report, especially in Mr. Fleischmanns report, that it is less necessary to spend any time upon it here. Some of Mr. Fleischmanns views have been objected to, but evidently from a his apprehension of them. In the appendix No. 10 we have placed the communication of Markcockrill, esq, of Tennessee, on this subject. The points aimed at by or. Cockrill are evidently very different from those of Mr. Fleischmann. The question is not whether in some individual place there may not be found specimens of the finest wool, but whether it maybe called of a thorough and constant character; whether the degree of fine ness is spread over the whole flee ce, and tried by the same modes of measuring fine ness and excellence as were described to be in Germany, it could stand the test. Viewed in this light, we believe x. 
193Mr. Cockrill in the wrong; andy while admitting that some beautiful samples may be and have been produced in this country, were inclined to think with Mr. Fleischmann, that the specimens brought out by him and distributed to the different States form a higher standard than could be obtained from any flee ce in this, country; allowing it to be fairly characteristic of the flee ce- It isa well known fact that Pain has yielded the point of superiority to Germany by seeking to improve her own breeds by importation from the progeny, at a far remove, of some of the very sheep which she formerly sent to Germany. In Europe, we believe, it is undoubted that Silesian and other portions of Germany stand at the head of the whole continent for a fine and constant character of the flee ce. The reference which Mr. Cockrill makes, therefore, to undoubted me rings and individual cases of fine sheep does not meet the question raised, and he is, we think, most decidedly mistaken in the idea expressed that as good bucks can be bought in this country for                                      $50 as those which bring 1,500 to 2,000 six dollars in Germany. We have deemed it proper to make these few remarks in referring to Mr. Cockrillps communication, from the belief that he has, we think un designedly, left untouched the true issue, if any one should be raised, between himself and Mr. Fleischmanns statements. By looking at the matter in another aspect, he not only his construed, as we conceive, but unfortunately his represented the views of the able writer of the report on German wool and sheep in the last years Patent Office report. Mr. Cockrills letter contains many excellent remarks, and will no doubt be found interesting to many who may read this document. We have not received as yet the report on the how crop of the west, which we have been hoping to get before the close of the report. Relying as we have done on the faithful description of this most important product by one every way qualified for the preparation of such an article, we have not made such arrangements as might enable us to present the desired facts. We trust that, before the report goes to the farmers and planters of our country, we may receive the article mentioned, and place it in an appendix No. 11. According to the returns of the assessors of the State of Ohio for 1848, the number of cattle was 983,822; of sheep, 3,677,710; of hogs 1879 589; of horses, 492,509. By a letter from one of our correspondents in U burn, New Work, we learn that a large business is carried on in that region in the buying up and for varying to New York and Boston, by persons from those cities, on the line of railroad, of large quantities of pork. He states that last season was the first of the business, when about 200 tons were bought up it the how. This season, he adds, the pork business commenced November 18, 1848, and up to January 18, 1849, two months, there had been bought 4,398 dressed hogs, weighing 1,139,522 lbs; being 5 69 tons 1 522 lbs. of pork in the how, the price of which was                         $4.50 to                            $5.50per 100 lbs, averaging at least                            $5 per ton thus making                             $56,966y1,P7Ex. said ou at for pork. He expresses his belief that this amount will he further increased during the winter to at least 600 tons; besides this, that 300 head of cattle and 200 sheep may be added, and large quantities of butter. As the business is but just commenced, it is but reasonable to suppose that it will be greatly increased, and thousands of tons before many years will thus be bought up by agents from the Atlantic cities and transmitted to these ports. A similar state of things may be anticipated with respect to Newhiampshire and Vermont, when the great lines of railroad now in the course of construction are completed, and thus the channel of communication to market made much more direct and easy and cheap. In the Comptez Of end us for October, 1847, we find a report giving an account of a successful experiment, in domestic ating the Egyptian goose in France. The writer, M. I s adore Geoffrey It. Fili are, says: "the beauty of this fowl has made it an object of request as an ornament for our gardens and parks, and it has been proved that it can live and reproduce, itself in the north of France and England. We have succeeded after a number of trials, and we now possess not only a great number of individuals, but also isa true characteristic of a complete domestic at ion of a race, truly distinct, a French one. Up to the present, at least, this race has preserved always, with few light spots, the rich colors which render the Egyptian goose one of the prettiest of the we booted kind known; but it has also become larger and stronger more remarkable effect of the influence of the climate and of its captivity is the following: Under its own native sky, by reason of the extreme mildness of the temperature in the winter, the Egyptian goose lays towards the beginning of the year; the individuals on which we have experimented, up to 1843, according to the habit use of the species, have laid towards the beginning of January, or at the end of December; and the care of the young must thus be in the severe season. But for the same individuals, and for their progeny, the layings reported in 1844 were in the, month of February, in 1845 in the month of March, and since then in April, so that the watching takes place now in the most favorable season. Thus have been removed the worst of the difficulties which seemed to stand in the way of the propagation of this, beautiful species, and we may hope that the famous chenalopex, of Greece, and the sacred fowl of the Egyptians, will, in a few years rank among our birds of ornament, as formerly the Canada goose was become among our fowls for food na Bixios Journal dAgriculturae Critique et Jardinage for April, 1848, we find a statement of the poultry and eggs of France in which, alluding to actual statistics, he says: We have found 120 000 fowls for 85,685 inhabitants; and these 190,000 fowls give, alum ally a product of 14,400,000 eggs, or 166 eggs to a person a year. Extending this calculation to the whole of France, he says: We find that the proportion of population to the number of, fowls is that of 1 to 440. Now the population of France, according to the last census, was 34,230,178 inhabitants, and thus it will x. 195 follow that, in the actual state of affairs, France feeds, by methods evidently defective, 47,938,628 fowls, which, at 120 eggs each for a year, will give 5,752,635,360 eggs, which, at 4 francs per 100, is, equal to 230,100,414 francs, equal to                            $46,021,082.80, (above forty-six millions of dollars, allowing 20 cents to the france) Adding the excess of 30 eggs per fowl as the result of artificial heat, there would be 150 eggs per fowl, (12 fowls, placed in a little court without any other heat than from that of manure, laid each 153 eggs, on an average, in 1846;) this would give a general total of3396931400 eggs, of the value of 287,631,768 francs more, (equal to 57,000,000 of dollars he have heretofore averted to the vast number of eggs consumed in our country. In the replies to our circular, we find Variety of estimates; and it is evident that in many sections of the country both the fowls raised and the eggs consumed is very much larger than in others. In one day from Cincinnati, Ohio, it it i stated in one of the public journals, there were shipped 500 barrels containing 47,000 dozen of eggs. In some of the States, the poultry business appears to be much on the increase. Thus we are informed that in the region of U burn, N. Y., where, as we have before noticed, the pork business has recently sprung up, there has been bought and sent forward 15 tons of poultry, at 7 cents per pound, or                                                                                                                                                              $190 per ton, making                                               $2,100 paid out for poultry. In the last report reference was made to the views of Liebigcid127and the refutation of some of his positions, by the able scientifieagriculturist of Germany. Since then we have procured a very elaborate work, highly commended by the best agricultural writers in the German journals, in which, under the title of "her odercid127Liebig~ Prof. F. G. Schulze, of Jena, has entered upon a scientific examination of Liebigs theory of agriculture, especially that relating to mineral manures. In this volume, while he concede slight merit to Lie big as a chemist, he pronounces his method a false one, as being a speculative in opposition to the inductiveone, and shows that, according to the rules of the great masters of logic in Germany, as well as the views of Humboldt, his ground is up n tenable. Of n laying down his tests by which to decide respecting the subjects of his remarks, he points out the difference between the $ Progressive or synthesis, and the progressive or anal y tic processes under the latter or anal y tic process :in includes the species of theories which is termed regulate ve, or relating to those theoretical or experimental sciences in which mathematical principles cannot be employed or are insufficient, and ranks chemistry among these sciences. As the regulate ve process is the most complicated and difficult of all, hence he says it is liable to the most errors. The means of the oTegulative theory being induction and hypothesis, much of course depends on the character of these in conducting us to the true conclusion. In reference to agriculture, he says: "the special science of agriculture is therefore an individual natural science not an additiiva196Ex. merely of chemistry, physiology, &c not a science which a great chemist, botanist or zoology st can combine by his knowledge of the rich treasures of his own science. It has, indeed, for its perfection to borrow chemical, botany cal, and other principles from other natural sciences; but it by no means follows, therefore, that a great chemist can be fitted, and is called to form a theory of the cultivation of plants, any more than we must suppose a great philosopher or mathematician could write a theory of chemistry, because chemistry is founded on philosophy and mathematics. It is not a science which can be found perfectly in the writings of learned men, and the advances cannot be judged by the list of new publications, but it lives in the minds of all agriculturists who busy themselves with due consideration in, turning vegetable and animal life to their objects. Agricultural science is of so peculiar kind, that it must be studied according to particular rules. It cannot be learned from books and lectures alone, but there belongs to it also the active participation in agricultural occupations, careful observation in the great laboratory of nature, and the most earnest practice in the use of theory n view of Liebigs contemptuous observations respecting the agriculturists of his own country, Professor Schulze retorts upon him by the following sentence from his organic chemistry, where, speaking of the botanist who does not properly regard chemistry, he says: " They act like illiterate persons who place the value and use of the knowledge of a foreign literature the lower, and judge of it the more deprecatingly, the less they understand it for even those among them who do understand it they are unwilling to heed." Conducting his examination of the subject under discussion still farther, he says: It is most dangerous for the chemist, not properly assured by logic, to undertake to propose a theory on the culture of plants and breeding of animals, although chemical powers indeed operate in this domain of nature very decisively. Still there are besides many others at work, the character of which is wholly unknown, so that the appearances belonging thereto can only be treated according to a combination of observations. Hence it is that the chemist, in his science, is wont to adopt only those rules for which he can give reasons; he intends merely to investigate the nature of things, not the prescriptions of a business calling. The agricultural theorist, on the contrary, in his science, has to introduce, for the wants of the practical man, many rules from empiricismthe reasons of which are yet unknown to him. In this account the rational agriculturists is much inclined to confess the deficiencies of his knowledge, and to acknowledge the dignity of other sciences. Referring to the peculiar language and nomenclature of chemistry, he adds: As to these peculiarities of chemistry, and especially as regards organic chemistry, I consider it very necessary to warn against the false use of. the same, and then quotes from Baron Humboldts I inquiries respecting Excited Muscular and Nervous Fibre, viz: " In all these questions, chemistry gives us hitherto no information, Of 197 and as it answers so little, the practical physician would do better to proceed on his previous empirical method than to endanger the life of man by the use of imperfect theories. Of the conditions are not all discovered under which a phenomenon is seen, the disregard of a single, often apparently trifling one, may so change the course of nature that exactly the opposite may take place of that which art would desire to introduce." In this, Professor Schulze says his warning respecting a false and premature use of vital (organic) chemistry appears to me the more necessary here, as the voice of the age is unquestionably to despise what is gradual, and to urged forward, impatiently, everything." He also illustrates his position by examples of gross errors, to which the false and incorrect use of chemistry has led, in which there is much instructive history, reducing his instances mostly from the science of medicine. While rejecting the false tendency of chemistry to agriculture, he, however, admits the aid that "i be rendered to be in the highest degree important, and specified among other things the following, respecting which this is true: "1. Without the help of chemical doctrines we cannot explain inmost cases the phenomena of agriculture, and cannot know the grounds of the correctness of rules for the culture of plants, and breeding of cattle, empirically discussed 2. Chemical fundamental doctrines belong to those leading maxims which, as agriculturists, we hold to be especially needful, in order by combined and experimental observations of nature to collect scientific experiments. Particularly we thus use the knowledge of the elements of the air, soil, sub soil, manure, plants, &c 3. Physical philosophy, methodology, physiology, also mineral ogg, which are requisite to the foundation of agriculture, cannot be studied and farther improved without chemical knowledge 4. Chemical knowledge is likewise peculiarly necessary for the preparation of butter, cheese, spirit of wine, beer, sugar, &c, and in general, the technical industry which is often conducted by the farmer. The opinions which have been recently expressed by educated men, that chemistry is of no use to practical agriculture, and that the most useful theories of agriculture may be devised without any help of chemistry by agriculturists, have been induced by the excessive claims and errors of some particular agricultural chemist he gives Air Humphry Navy as a fine example for chemists to follow, in his lectures on agricultural chemistry, which Her had translated and published with his own notes in 1814, and quotes from him the following passage in proof of his views: When I stated that carbonic acid was found in the venous blood in the processes of life, I meant merely to say that this blood, in consequence of certain changes, became capable of giving off carbon and oxygen in union with each other, for the moment in organic matter enters into the composition of living organs it obeys new laws. The action of the gastric juice is chemical, and it will only dissolve dead matter, and it dissolves it when they are in tubes of metal as well as in the stomach, but it has no action up sn living matter198Ex. a. Respiration is no more a chemical process than the absorption of chyle; and the changes that take place in the lungs, though they appear so simple, may be very complicated; it is as little philosophical to consider them as a mere combustion of carbon, as to consider the formation of muscle from the arterial blood a crystal ligation. There can be no doubt that all the powers and agencies of matter are employed in the purposes of organization, but the phenomena of organization can no more be referred to chemistry, than those of chemistry to mechanics; and again: 1 In announcing even the greatest and most important discoveries, the true philosopher will communicate his details with modesty and reserve; he will rather be a useful servant of the public, bringing forth a light from under his cloak where it is needed in darkness, than a charlatan exhibiting fireworks, and having a trumpeter to announce their magnificence. That he should be humble minded, you will readily allow, and a diligent searcher after truth; and neither diverted from the great object by the love of transient glory, or temporary popularity, looking rather to the opinion of ages than that of a day, and seeking to be remembered and named rather in the speeches of historians than in the columns of newspaper writers or journalists Professor Schulze goes on to examine Liebigs agricultural system in general. We will quote here a few sentences from the part in which he speaks of Lie big as a chemist, to show that he has no, desire to under value him, but is disposed to concede to the distinguished chemist his merit in this, his own branch of science. He says: "is Lie big belongs to the most famous chemists of our time, and as his reputation is especially founded on his labors in the domain of organic chemistry, we were justified in expecting much from his work' Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology' I need, Lie big has, where he has, confined himself to the province of the chemist, communicated much which may be very instructive, at least for the reader conversant with chemistry and agricultural science. We find in it many important results of investigations which have been made recently by him and other distinguished chemists on these subjects, and many successful experiments to explain certain phenomena in agriculture by means of progressive chemistry, better than had been before done." But he adds: "Lie big has, in this work, transcended the limits of chemistry and undertaken to, enter as a reformer into the province of agriculture. The new agricultural system, which he builds up in it, consists especially of theories of maturing, fallows and rotation of crops' Leaving the examination of these, Professor Schulze directs his attention immediately to the examination of the method according to whichLiebig has constructed his system of agriculture. "his examination" he remarks, "I consider the most important, because the method of the system is far higher than the system itself, and because a system with a false method is far more injurious than ax. 199 system which, indeed, contains false positions but yet is arranged according to a correct methodLiebigs theory of agriculture is related to that with which, after the example of Her, the educated agriculturists of Germany have been occupied as in the history of medicine the numerous chemical and mathematical systems are to the more certain method by Hippocrates of the observation of nature. It is an undertaking to produce, merely on chemical principles, a theory of vegetable culture which must be unsuccessful to the greatest chemists and the most talented systemizers, because this theory, at least so far as it is connected with chemistry, is not mathematical, but regulate ve, and because in it we can reach the end only by the (progressive) or anal y tic, not by the (progressive) synthesis course." "with reference to the logical doctrinescid127' says Professor Schulze, "I can thus point out briefly and clearly the defects of this new theory of agriculture, viz: I to author does not proceed in the right way of the regulate ve theory, especially not that of the combining and experimental observation of nature, but in the false one of the dogma tic theory; he is not sparing of hypothesis, but very lavish, and often deduces from hypothesis principles which are in contradiction with agricultural experiments drawn by induction from phenomena5As an example of the difference between the process which the educated agriculturists have pursued, under the guidance of Her, in the o rising respecting the cultivation of plants, and the method of Lie big, he selects the theory of maturing with gypsy m. In this subject he says that, according to Hers example agriculturists have proceeded thus: "they strewed gypsy m on young c lover and observed a more luxuriant growth than on clever not so manured. The same was the case with ulcer ne, sainfoin, peace, but on the other hand no effect was observed in thus maturing wheat, rye oats and barley; and on meadows, with the exception of those on which c lover, ulcer ne, and similar plants grew, there was no influence by gypsy m on the growth of the plants. By the help of botany, the experimental conclusion was drawn from induction, that the papilionaceous flowering plants are fond of gypsy m as ai manure, and the rule was adopted to straw gypsy m on papilionaceous flowering plants." From chemistry, which reaches that gypsy m consists of lime and sulphuric acid, and that sulphuric acid is the combination of sulphur with oxygen, and keeping in view that many plants thrive, on soil containing sulphur, the hypothesis was formed that thepapilionaceous flowering plants need sulphur for their nutriment and the phenomena of the effect of gypsy m was explained far better than otherwise by assuming that the gypsy m operates by its facility of attracting water. Now useful to the agriculturists was such a theory, formed by the help of the knowledge of plants and chemistry, the following facts show: The agriculturists learns by botany that the fetch belongs to the family of the papilionaceous flowering plants, and therefore200Ex. concludes that maturing with gypsy m will also agree with it. In experiment proves the correctness of his supposition. Further, we find by experience, that manure of burned carbonate of lime is far more useful than the manure of unburned lime. Any agriculturists burned gypsy m, others, on the contrary, neglected it, and found that the unburned operated as strongly as the burned, and thus saved the cost of burning. For this saving they were indebted to chemistry, which told them that lime became caustic by burning carbonate of lime, but not by the burning of the sulphate of lime. The chemical doctrine that gypsy m consists of sulphuric acid and lime farther served as a guiding maxim in the investigation whether acid might be employed as a manure. By it was occasioned the discovery that we can promote the growth of c lover with sulphuric acid as well as with gypsy m. But Lie big proceeded in an entirely different manner. He did 36 go upon observations r petting the maturing with gypsy m, but on chemical principles, which he used not as guiding maxims, but as mathematical principles. The progress of ideas in this theory is the following n the soil richest in hum us, the development of plants cannot be supposed without the introduction of nitrogen, or of a substance containing nitrogen, (this is the main hypothesis) Nitrogen in the air cannot be rendered capable by the most powerful chemical process of entering into combination with any thing else' beside oxygen, (this was the first subsidiary hypothesis) The development of glum ten, rich in nitrogen, stands in a certain relation to the quantity of nitrogen taken up in the form of ammonia, &c, (the second subsidiary hypothesis) therefore, plants need ammonia to furnish them with a sufficiency of nitrogen The atmosphere and rain water are the sources whence plants derive their nitrogen in the form of ammonia; as now, gypsy m consists of sulphuric acid and lime, and sulphuric acid has a closer affinity to ammonia than lime, so lime serves to fix the ammonia of the atmosphere, and to obtain the same quantity of nitrogen which is elaborated in the soil to which gypsy m has been applied with water; hence the rule follows, that we must manure meadows with gypsy m in order to aid the development of the varieties of grass, and to bring the meadows to a luxuriant growth of plants. But this rule, so discovered, stands in direct contradiction to general known agricultural experience, that gypsy m is not useful for all plants, especially not for the grass kinds, and that treating 3 meadows with gypsy m is a vain labor, the case above mentioned excepted. As it is here, so everywhere, a dogma tic use of chemistry leads the agriculturists inevitably into false measuresLiebig, in a later editioncid127) says Professor Schulze, "attempted to obviate these objections by the change of some terms, using instead of grass kinds many species. of plants, and for a meadow, afield; but, as he still retained the false method, the great error yet continued." Professor Schulze goes on to array a formidable statement of objections against Liebigs principles, which he supports by quotations from the works of the distinguished cher x. 201 mist, but we have neither time nor room to quote them in particulars, and shall, therefore, only allude to them in brief. In this connexion, he says: " Whoever theories according toThaers mode may give up the hypothesis used without destroying his theory; but whoever adopts Liebigs theory, must give up his theory, with the abandonment of his hypothesis." He objects, also, that the spirit of dogmatism exhibited in the new theory of agriculture, shows an enormous self confidence, and is evident in the para does and sophisms employed, of which examples are given, and alludes to the unlimited extent which Lie big gives to his imaginative faculty, an instance of which is cited, in what the chemist says: "that the excrements of animals are the ashes of plants burned in the bodies of men and animals, or the process of putrefaction is a process of combustion The manner in which Lie big treatsoSprengel, and others of the ablest scientific agricultural writers of Germany, is likewise averted to as proof of the same spirit resulting from his method. Professor Schulze also concedes that the followers, or disciples, of Lie big have carried his principles still further than Lie big himself, and instances Professor Petzholdt, whose lectures have bee a so highly extolled in some quarters in our country, of whom he says, 'a~ he has gone still further into a labyrinth of sophisms, hypothesis, and principles, standing in the most glaring contradiction to experience, than even his master, professing to be able, by the use of mineral pouirettes, to dispense altogether with carrying out the usual manure n proceeding to examine and compare Hers and Liebigstheory of maturing, he succinctly traces the history of the subject from Her onward, specifying Navy, Rome, Firhoff, For te, lermbstadt, Schuyler, and others, as persons to whom agriculture has been largely indebted for the valuable instruction they gave in reference to it. Jordan, Trautman, Larger, likewise, are honorably mentioned. He attributes to Air Humphry Navy the merit of having first spoken with definiteness of the nutritions power of mineral bodies, and considers Karl Sprengel to have exerted great influence on the history of the theory of manures by his doctrine of the hum us acid; for, although Her alluded to the coil trust between hum us acid and the alkaline substances, and to the capacity of the latter to render hum us so ruble, yet it was Carlsprengel who showed that in the decomposition of hum us a peculiar acid is formed, which could promote in many ways the growth of plants, especially by its combination with the bases of the hum us acid salts, which he considered the means of the nutriment of plants. Sprengels theory, supported by the concurrence of Berzelius, Dobereiner, Mitscherlich, Wackenroder, and other celebrated chemists, soon spread among agriculturists. Still later, also, Boussingault and Under have, by their writings, in a distinguished manner promoted the theory of measuring, as another branch of the doctrine of agriculture and agricultural chemistry. This theory is called Thaers theory, because Her first treated202Ex. the subject soundly, and in the use of chemistry, physiology, and physics, in agriculture followed the true method The agriculturists who would form himself as much as possible in accordance with this method, in reference to the theory of manure, should proceed thus: first let him collect observations and experiences respecting manure, while he bares a share on the estate in the business of agriculture and raising of cattle, and also uses for this purpose rules and written communications. When let him endeavor to elaborate this empirical knowledge by the help of leading principles into the ore tic, while he combined the phenomena by comparison and grouping together. Met him likewise make experiments, partly to prove the correctness of the rules given, and partly to discover new rules. The principles which should guide him in this work are. Philosophical and meteorological and metaphysical; for example, every change must have a cause. The fundamental principle must be a deduced, not merely in oral and written instructions but also should operate in secret. I mention this because Lie big sometimes puts it as a principle, accord ant to experience, at the head of his theories. I I . Principles of experience which relate to natural science, especially chemical, physiological, physical, botany cal, miner a logical, geognostic, &c. These principles, accord ant to experience, are 1st, those the correctness of which are acknowledged by all natural philosophers; 2d, those the correctness of which are yet in doubt; universal principles of experience of the first kind are those by which the combination of agricultural experiences give a higher degree of certainty to a theoretical form and the general rules of science. To this belongs e. g. the following principles of the doctrine of manures a. The organic constituents of plants, namely, those which we wish to produce by the rural culture of plants, as starch, sugar fatty oils, wood y fibre, &c, consist of four elements, carbonate, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Besides these elements, plants also contain sulphur, phosphorus, potash, soda; s iliac, limb. All elements come into plants from without; no element can be produced by means of the plants from other elements. We name the substances which plants must receive for their development means of nutriment, and these principally consist of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, and besides, sulphate, phosphorus, potash, silicacc. These substances are found not only in the soil, but also in the water, and in the air. Hence the earth, water and air are the the three sources from which the agriculturists may draw by cultivation of plants, the substances for the production of starch, meal sugar, oil, and other vegetable productsd. All contradictory effects in the ground are produced by means of the contrary operations between the ground, water, and air, occasioned by the light of the sun; particularly vegetable life depend six. 208 on the circulation of water, which is produced by the sunlight on the water. Knowledge of this kind is now much diffused by educated agriculturists; by it they explain for themselves many phenomena in vegetable cultivation; by it they prove the correctness of the general rules in a very simple manner, one with more and another with less clear consciousness of the same. With these general principles relating to natural science, there are, besides, many special ones, which are likewise of certainty. By the aid of these special theories are devised, for instance, the theory of maturing with gypsy m, by the aid of the chemical principle that gypsy m consists of sulphuric acid, lime, and water ofcrystallization. The principles of chemistry, physiology, and the other systems of nature, (the correctness of which is yet very doubtful) the agricultural theorist of the old school uses as little as possible, and whenever he uses them, he presents them only as hypothesis which he is ready to give up as soon as the phenomena can be explained more simply and certainly by other principles. As his theory approximately combined of agricultural experiences by the aid of general principles of the highest certainty, so they continue, though the hypothesis should be proved false by natural philosophers. Proceeding in this way, the theory of maturing advances gradually, but surely forward. In dividing Liebigs theory in the same manner as that ofThaers, Professor Schulze thus refers to it. Philosophical principles. Lie big sometimes uses philosophical principles, %f the correctness of which every man is convinced, as though they were the principles of experience at the head of his theories; other teachers, likewise, propose these truths impliedly. For example, Lie big makes use of the philosophical principle, "every effect has a cause" in the letter in which he proposed his theory briefly to the English Agriculturists recommending a maturing poudrette. Hence his theory has the appearance to many readers of being the more solid and true c" The cause of this defect in Liebigs method does not lie, according to my conviction, in the purpose to deceive his reader, but in the authors ignorance of philosophy, particularly of logic. I the had acquainted himself with this, he would not have explained a general law of reason as an experimental principle, nor used it as a constitution or mathematical principle, but have known that it is a law, without which no experiment is possible a law which one must necessarily employ as a regulate ve principle, in the discovery -of all experimental truths were, also, belongs the intimation of the principle "that the art of agriculture depends on the restoration of disturbed equivalents I . Experimental truths relating to natural science 1. Those of the correctness of which there is no doubt. Lie big, uses general experimental truths of this kind, but they do not play the .part in his system they do in Hers th.eory. X. a. Thus he assumes, as every educated agriculturists has been wont to do, that plants need as means of nutriment, especially oxygen carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, and also phosphorus, potash soda, s iliac, lime, and other similar in organic elements that these substances cannot be produced anew in them, but must be derived from without; that soil, air, and water, are the sources from which these means of nutriment may be created. But the main principles on which his system of agriculture is especially built are 2. Those principles of natural science, especially the chemical, which can now be regarded only as hypothesis. These hypothesis and their consequences, are the principles which we shall have to examine more closely when we wish to test Liebigs theory of maturing. In the want of a logical order of the doctrines put forth by Lie big, it is not, however, easy to discover his course of thought. From these two brief hypothesis, Lie big advances. The carbon of plants is derived from the atmosphere, not from the soil, nor from water. B. The ammonia of the atmosphere furnishes to plants their nitrogen; it is not the soil nor the water that does it. From the main principles deduced therefrom, I will quote a few a. Relating to manure. The stable manure which agriculturists furnish, essentially aids vegetable life, only by what it contains of alkalies, lime, silicaand other mineral elements, not by what it contains of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, for these substances plants can obtain from the air, as an inexhaustible source. As now in stableiianures, the mineral elements bear the proportion of some two to seven per cent. of the whole mass, so the agriculturists, who yearly brings on his fields 100,000 cut. of stable manure, carries out 9 3000 to 98,000 cut. in vain. It would be far more simple and less costly to give the plants only mineral manures, and to leave them to acquire their organic means of nutriment from the air. In the burning of plants, the organic, not the in organic portions, are dissipated. Hence the agriculturists can burn his crops, namely, his straw, and yet continue his fields in the strength hitherto possessed, if he only carries on the ashes acquired by such burning. But if circumstances do not permit him to manure the plants th such ashes, yet can the same object be attained, if by the aid of chemistry he will examine into the ash* constituents of his harvest, and carry the mineral substances corresponding to his analysis upon his field. To of fallow and rotation of crops; which, as they are probably familiar to agriculturists, from Liebigs books, do not need particular consideration Prof. Schulze confines himself to a judgment respecting the first main hypothesis, and the manure theory derived from it n reference then to his hypothesis that the carbon of plants is derived from the atmosphere, it may be said: "1. Lie big holds that the atmosphere contains 28,000 billions of is, of carbon, and by means of the life of plants and beasts, by x. putrefaction, combustion of the same, and other processes, continued growth is maintained, so that we may regard it as an inexhaustible source of carbon 2. Currents of air from north to south, and back from south to north, and currents of air from below upward, conduct the carbon of the air to plants. Of these points it is observed, "other natural philosophers have given far lower numbers for the proportion of the atmosphere. I attach no value to it, but readily grant that the atmosphere is an inexhaustible source of carbon; we should reflect, however, that plants cannot create it at pleasure, that particularly agricultural plants reach only some feet distance in the air with their absorbent vessels." The motion of the air, by which plants continually obtain new carbon from a distance, Professorschulze pronounces a product of a too lively fancy, and Professorschleiden, in his criticism on it, says: " Must we here adopt ignorance of physics, or a wholly thoughtless insertion of it as a cause of this monster of the wind theory 3. Liebigs next position is, that hum us cannot furnish carbon to plants, because a. Sum us acid, by drying up and freezing, loses its solublenessb. Sum us acid, alkalies, and earths, are certainly so ruble in water, but by a c amputation in reference to hum us acid, lime, Liebigwould prove that rain water is not sufficient to dissolve so much hum us acid as plants need to obtain their carbon c. Of hum us were a food for plants, then must the petty soil, rich in hum us acid, be very favorable to the growth of plants, but no plants particularly succeed there ind. Sum us acid and hum us acid salts do not in reality exist but only in the imagination of certain chemists, for were hum us acid salts in the soil, then must the stalactites formed in the sta lactic caverns contain hum us acid, and have a dark color, which, is not the case in the above, Professor Schulze remarks: "that Lie big here brings forward to justify his main principle, is only of a negative kind, and refers merely to Sprengelps doctrine of the hum us acid, He seeks indeed to show that plants cannot take up all their carbon, in the form of hum us acid. In this it may be observed a. Sprengel does not mention that plants acquire all the carbon they need in this way, but only a portion of it. According to his theory, plants also derive carbon from the air and water, especially in the form of carbonic acid b. Lie big selects for his c amputation exactly that particular hum us acid salt, which is least so ruble in water, and only brings rain water into the reckoning; had he chosen the very solublehumusacid, ammonia, which Sprengel declares to be the most important me as of nutriment among these salts, and had he to rain water added also other water which the dew, mist and snow bring to the soil, \then would the c amputation have proved very favorable for Sprengels theory c. Now Lie big can maintain that no plants grow in pe at soil is x. inconceivable to me. This soil, indeed, is commonly called un fertile, because no wheat, barley, and similar plants can be cultivated on it; but reed grass and bull rushes grow most luxuriantly s pon itd. The proof in reference to the formation of stalactites, adducedfor the non existence of the hum us acid salts in the soil, is without force, as indeed the precipitate on of carbonate of lime, of which the stalactites consist, result from the escape of the dissolving carbonic acid, and therefore no evaporation of water is needed. But, in such cases, water does continually drop from the stalactites while they a reforming themselves; moreover, in Thuringia and elsewhere, the stalactites are not usually white, but yellow, and natural philosophers, o serve in the stalactite caverns a mud like smell, and a substance like hum us, and have found in stalactites that, when heated, they, i eve lope an empyreumatical smell, and when dissolved in hydrochloric acid leaves little brownish spots un dissolved 4. Lie big asserts that the carbon produced by the manured land is in no greater proportion than the carbon of an equal space of land fit for cultivation un manured, and whether planted with turns, grass, or other fruit, produces an equal quantity of carbon. In this point Professor Schulze says: "is to the strangeness of the opinion, that the soil, whether manured or not, whether it bear rye, turn is, wood, or grass, or other fruits, yields always an equal weight of carbon in the crop, Hlubek has proved the error of this opinion by numerous passages from the experience of agriculturists and foresters. Even Lie big himself struck it out in one place in the fifth edition of his work Therefore' says Professor Schulze, "I will only observe in answer to the question, Now could Lie big put forth an opinion so notoriously false, and in contradiction to an universally known agricultural experience? that unacquainted with practical agriculture and its literature, he probably asked how much wood, hay, grain, andturnips, were cropped upon a Hessian morgen of the medium soil. It was answered 2,650 lbs. of wood, 2,500 lbs. of hay, 20,000 lb sheets, 2,580 lbs, of rye; and Lie big, by c amputation, found an equal quantity of carbon in all these amounts. The answers andcomputations were right, but the question was too indefinite, for a medium soil of the golden Due is more fertile than the best soil in the Gutenberg heaths; and land, which here gives the highest product, would not there be reckoned to the middle class, &c 5. Again Lie big says: We every year take a certain quantity of carbon from meadows and woods, without carrying on manure, containing carbon, and yet they are no poorer in carbon. There fare, we need not manure the fields." In this Professor Schulzeobserves, that "it is not the case with meadows; that, if un manured, they always yield rich harvests, but only those which are overflowed or artificially irrigated; where, neither by slime nor water, utritious particles are brought to the plants, maturing is necessary. And because woods grow without being manured, it does, not follow that grain and other plants would succeed without manure containing carbon, for trees reach from 20 to 50 times iMrSEx. other with their leaves into the air, and penetrate further with their roots than those plants Having thus examined Liebigs theory of manure, Professorschulze next makes some observations, in which he alludes to the defects in the conclusions of the main hypothesis on which Lie big built his theory of manure, and which is found to be withobtfoundation1. In that tie big rejects the principles of agricultural experience, that stable manure is necessary for the fields, and many other rules of field culture, confirmed by thousands of years' experience, because these principles are opposed to the hypothesis of the assimilation of carbon; he transgresses against the four chief rules which Newton, and, after him, all the masters of logic, have given for the treatment of the experimental sciences 2. In opposition to the doctrine that mineral manure, or the ashes of manure, are sufficient, and that it would be foolish to furnish them with manure containing carbon, may be a deduced, not only the un tenable ness of the hypothesis from which it is derived, but also the following particulars a. The ash analysis of the chemists, according to which the proportion of plants in mineral elements, and their need, of mineral manure, is determined, is in part very problematical; for instance, Lie big says of C. Sprengels ash analyses, that they are entirely false, and deserve not the slightest confidence; and yet Berzelius, I Dobereiner, and other distinguished chemists, have often acknowledged Sprengelps analyses to be correct. By what ash analyses no shall the agriculturists mix his manures b. But the ash analysis also, which Lie big quotes as correct, exhibit very different results. For example, the ash of a pine contains in 100 parts, six of magnetic, another scarcely any magnetic. Heat kerseys (red) examined by Fresenius, contain 31.12 per cent of phosphates of soda, and in the other kind, by Will, (white wheat 0. per cent. Other examples are likewise quoted from various chemists; and then he adds: "for the formation of salts, bases must always exist, but these bases represent each other wholly, or partially; for example, potash, soda, lime, magnetic; but this representation has its limits. As now, no one yet knows anything definitely respecting it; how far the bases may represent each other, so it is clear that the ash maturing theory and its artificial estimates, wholly fail in solid foundation c. This relates to Liebigs classification of plants, according to their mineral elements, and as the agriculturists often cultivates grain plants for straw, as well as for grain, but the grain analysis classes them with phosphates plants, and the straw analysis amongsilicious plants, the question is, in selecting his manure, shall h regard it as a si vicious or a phosphates plantd. In regard to Liebigs assertion that the roots of plants absorb all so ruble substances without distinction, it is remarked by Professor Schulze, that "the roots may absorb useless and pernicious bodies, and therefore, if we i manure with a loud rete, according to   $08 X. the ash theory, we shall bring on the soil partially useless and pernicious substances e. Professor Schulze objects, that allowing the want of in organic, manure to be determined, as the quantity is so small, (not more than 300 weight for a morgen) to mix with the soil, there is difficulty of putting it on, so that the root of every plant may have its supply. Gypsum, in powder, is thrown on the plants, and not on the soil itself 3. As Lie big cares too little with respect to carrying on carbon, so in respect to his care of mineral manures, he is much too anxious, although agricultural plants need ten to twenty times more labor than mineral substances. He does not reflect, that of the very small quantity which plants need, an important portion is furnished by nature, in water and in the air. For water passing through strata of the earth dissolves many mineral substances; then rising by capillary attraction, brings them to the plants, and the more the soil is dried by evaporation, the more the water rises from the depths. Spring water contains 'oz o to W.; brook and river water by of its weight of carbonate of lime, carbonate of magnetic, gypsy m, s iliac, various phosphates and nitrates, organic matter, ammonia cal salts, and other bodies. Grande found in 1,000,000 grains of rain water in January6510in February, 3 510 of fixed substances, as gypsy m, m uratic acid, carbonic acid, sulphate of ammonia, &c, and reckoned that on a morgen yearly, by rain alone, 598 lbs. salts. Others reckon the solid substances which atmospheric water furnishes to a morgen at 455 i lbs. To the dust which falls from the air, too, belongs many mineral substances. It is found that in places protected from wind and rain, the dust which falls in a year pressed together, forms )a) of aline in thickness; therefore, in a Russian morgen, about 610 of an acre, there falls yearly 60 cubic feet or some 30 cut. of dust. Met if we should reckon it at 15 cut. only, this is a quantity five times larger than Liebigs manure that is to be carried on. In the artificial c amputations on the quantity of the soil abstracted by the crop, and which must be restored by maturing, the considerable quantities brought in by water and dust are wholly overlooked. Practical agriculturists should not, therefore, arrange their planting according to these c amputations, but according to their experience 4. Professor Schulze urges that Lie big and his followers scarcely notice, or very little, the physical properties of hum us and stable manure. They do not reflect that it often operates not less beneficially in the cultivation of plants physically, than by the furnishing the means of nutrition, particularly by attracting moisture and retaining it, loosening clay, binding sand, warming cold soils, and refreshing heated ones. Of the capacity of hum us to attract moisture from the air is so important in our climate, as it is maintained to be' by agriculturists and chemists, the simplest standard of fertility might be arranged thereby. X. Dec. No. 59.201We shall conclude our extracts from Professor Chum ze with the comparison or re capitulation of the two theories of Her and Lie big, and a few notes of his defence of the hum us theoryCOMPARI Son Of Thaer And Of Ebi G S Theori Of. Respecting the mode of procedure 1. We theorise after the example of Thaeras to maturing, proceed analytically from agricultural experience, and employ the principles of natural science as leading maxims to elaborate these experiences scientific ally 2. We found our theories, not only on chemistry, but also on physiology, physics, methodology, and other natural sciences 3. We especially use those principles of natural science which are of the greatest certainty, and free our theories as much as possible from the hypothesis of natural philosophers.  We prefer to leave phenomena unexplained, than to make an imaginary representation to ourselves of the connexion between cause and effect. We choose to follow only rules discovered empirically, rather than those which are artificially derived from uncertain hypothesis 4. Our theory is so simple it may be understood, and further carried, out by the agriculturists who is no learned chemist, but has only pursued the study of chemistry as a subsidiary one 5. The teacher of the old school wishes not to give the thing itself to his students, but only the right way to the thing 6. Our theory is yet very defective, but the defect is known, and gradually it is becoming free therefrom; so that its main principles shall stand, for these consist in sure agricultural experiences 1. Lie big and his followers proceed synthetically from the principles of natural science, regard not the experience of agriculturists, and employ those principles as constitutiveor mathematical 2. Lie big regards chemistry as the s ok ground of a correct theory 3. Liebigs theory is particularly founded it hypothesis. In it, phenomena, are sometimes explained by imaginary representations, and rules laid down in opposition to agriculture experience, and derived from chemical hypothesis 4. Liebigs theory is so complicated that the agriculturists can only become aoquaintadwith it who is a learned chemist; and his followers appear to have had the purpose that none but chemists by profession should undertake and use his theory, for they project the erection of factories, in which chemists should manufacture the manures for agriculturists, and the appointment of itinerant chemists, who shall direct agriculturists in the business of maturing 5. The teacher of the new school wishes to give t el. thing itself 6. Liebigs theory imagines itself top near the point of perfection. As its main defects are acknowledged, it must fall together therewith, for these form the chief support of the system. Respecting the contents 1. We assume that plants must derive all 1. Lie big and ,his followers assume the their elements from without, and cannot pro- same due an element in any other way. But the elements which they derive from without are carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, and also sulphur, phosphorus, potash, soda s iliac, lime, &c 2. These elements plants derive as means 2. The same of nutriment from the earth, air and water and, indeed, so that the same pass into their roots and leaves in a fluid form, either gas form or in form of vapor, or fluid that can be dropped 3. The combined substances which serve 3. The same. But Lie big appears to re plants for food, are, especially, carbonic acid, hard the air only so far as nutriment as it 210 X. Doc ammonia, water and air. Besides, plants take up watery (fluids that can be dropped solutions. Train and other agricultural plants use carbon in large quantities; for, on an average, it is 44 per cent. of the dry substance by weight. Agricultural plants derive carbon from the soil, from water and from air, in the form of carbonic acid, carboniced water, and hum us, extract 6. We must, by means of manure, bring to plants not only the so called organic elements, carbon, nitrogen, &c, but also the so called in organic, as, for example, solicit acid, phosphorus acid, lime, potash, soda, &c 7. The nutritions elements which we abstract from the soil by the cultivation of plants, we must restore to it again. But now as we do not actually know what substances plants abstract from the soil, so we carefully collect on our estates cultivated vegetable substances, as, for example, wood litter, pe at, and bring them upon the soil in the form of manure. 8. The rotation of crops can be dispensed with by maturing, only in rare cases 9. The growth of plants is not merely dependent on maturing, but also on the state ofanoisture of the soil and air, and other physical peculiarities: No. 59.contains carbonic acid and other chance elements; not in respect to its essential elements, nitrogen gas and oxygen gas 4. In Liebigs Organic Chemistry, the, meed of carbon is given as nearly as great but he maintains that an equal extent of cult iv able land produces an equal quantity of carbon. Plants derive carbon only in the form of, carbonic acid, and only from the atmosphere. Young plants only are excepted, for these obtain this carbonic acid by means of putrefaction of hum us and manures 6. The introduction of the so called organic elements is the sole object of maturing with vegetable substances, because plants can easily derive the other substances, namely, carbon, from the air. Animal manure is used, also, in the formation of ammonia 7. The nutritions elements which we abstract from the soil by plants, we must return to it; but the replacing of carbon is not necessary, but (especially) only the replacing of the so called in organic or mineral elements. We can, therefore, have or sell the straws cropped without any danger that the soil will become enfeebled, if we only manure the soil with the ashes of burned straw, for this contains all the mineral elements. I instead of this ash, we can also use mineral manures prepared by chemical art 8. By the use of Liebigs mineral manure one can raise wheat and similar fruits every years. The effect of this manure cannot be diminished by different states of moisture, different localities, &c. In plants fully developed, it will not be checked by the perfect dryness of the soil. Respecting the result or success. The fitness for use of our theory has been Liebigs theory is, to my knowledge, no proved for fifty years by the experience of the where yet used by any agriculturists proprietors of lands. Germany has, in a great measure in consequence of its use, doubled and trebled the rough and net products. The conclusion, from all the foregoing extracts and statements, seems to be clear that Liebigs theory is liable to some fundamental objections. And now can the hewn us theory of Her, held by Professor Schulze, be maintained against the objections by which it is met? This is the point lastly to be considered. In this subject Professor Schulze says: "from the comparison of the theory of manure which the educated agriculturists of Germany have followed hitherto, with the theory of Lie big, it results that they greatly err who suppose that the difference between the old and this new theory consists in this, that Lie big has proposed a new view of the means of nutriment of plants, or discovered a new source of those means of nutrition2No, the difference is to be sought especially in the method of the prizing; but as to what relates to the subject matter, the difference relates chiefly to the manner how plants derive their carbon. X. 
211Beside what has already been offered, the following things may, serve for a justification of our theory in respect to this point: He maintain that our agricultural plants, together with carbonic acid, air, water, ammonia, and in organic salts, also take up hum us extract organic nutriment) from the soil, and in this extract obtain apart though only a small part of the carbon necessary. Liebigon the contrary, maintains that plants derive their carbon only from carbonic acid. In the testing our theory in this respect three questions may be proposed. I s there a hum us extract containing carbon 2. An such an extract soak into the roots of plants 3. An the plants use for their object the carbon from the hum us extract thus soaked inns to the first question, Lie big, indeed, rejects Sprengels doctrine of the hum us acid salts, which may be dissolved in the hum us extract; but the existence of these salts generally, their containing carbon, and their solubleness in water, no one will wish to deny, as Berzelius, Dobereiner, Wackenroder, Mitscherlich, Of Under, and other distinguished chemists have declared themselves for it and it can easily be proved by experiments. Lie big says that the root of a plant in the earth is to all solublesubstances like a sponge, which sucks up without distinction the, fluids and all that is in it. He must therefore answer the second question affirmatively, and admit that the roots bring the hum us extract into the interior of the plant. The comparison to a sponge, however, gives no correct idea of the mode how the plants take up fluids, deductible to drops, by their roots. Such reception does not result from the laws of capillary attraction, but according to the laws of the so called endo smoke, and, indeed, so that the plant is de composed at th same time it is introduced in the cells. Hence, it also happens that the interior of the root contains not a brown, but a% color less fluid. From a similar cause the liquid formed from the green food paste of the stomach in the lymphatic ducts is not green but white. Consequently, Lie big can only allege against the old theory, that plants are not able to assimilate the carbon taken up by the hum us extract, but must secrete it. It would be strange, indeed, if the creator of the vegetable organism had so arranged that it should be able to appropriate to itself of substances taken up in the fluid form deductible to drops, s iliac, lime, potash, soda, nitrogen, and all other substances, except only carbon, which it needed in large quantities. But we are the more justified in holding to the view that our plants need beside carbonic acid, &c, also hum us extract (organic nutrition) containing carbon, as the universal experience speaks in favor of it. In a soil in which all in organic means of food are found, grows no grain, no c lover, no rape, if the hum us be not mixed therewith. In consequence of Violent rains in our valley of A al, fields and meadows are often scattered over with clumps coming from Mus4chelkalk mountains, rich in organic matter of all kinds; but we212Ex. cannot prosecute the culture of plants in them until we have mixed therewith stable manure or earth rich in hum us. Further: it has a thousand times been experienced that darling, by which especially in organic means of nutrition are brought to, plants, will only produce a rich crop continuously, when the carrying out of stable manure is not omitted. Hence it is the fact, that many fungus plants derive almost no other nutriment except organic sap, which they draw out of the another plant. This is most evident in those fungus plants, the vascular system of which branches forth from that of the mother plant, as for example the sarcophyte, and in those in which the roots of which reach them above or below the edge of the mother plant, for example, vis cum. Especially worth attention, is the me julius destruction, a plant which feeds upon building timber, and produces in England great desolations. We might quote also the hung i, which sometimes grow on the <a name="potato33"><mark>potato</mark></a>. To avoid misunderstanding, I would observe, by way of repetition, that, according to our theory, agricultural plants do not draw all their carbon from the hum us, but only a part of the same. I no any cases the plants take up only very little carbon from the soil, but this little we hold to be essentially necessary for theirantrition, though we are not in a situation to adduct satisfactory grounds of explanation of the action of this organic nutrition. It is also admitted, that certain plants can live without hum us, but agricultural plants do not belong to this class. The reader who will not be convinced of the correctness of the theory, according to which most educated agriculturists have hitherto judged respecting hum us and maturing, and of the groundless ness of Liebigs rejection of the same by the intimations above given, I could refer to the extended treatise of Under, in the seventh number of his Her such einer age meinen physiologischenchemie, (essay towards a general physiology of chemistry) Ulster there treats of this subject with a decisive respect for agricultural experience, for which I honor him not less than for the solidity thus exhibited in the science of chemistry. But with those oppose is who will not be converted by a lessons of this kind, or who, from love to their hypothesis, take scarcely any notice of it, we would apply what once Zimmerman, famed as a physician and author in Hanover, said of love to hypothesis All kinds of prejudices may be favored through love to hypothesis; all phenomena may be bent at pleasure; we take from experience her rights we no more hear her voice; we per vert her expressions; we are silent as to her victories; we see no more than we desire to see; instead of sacrificing hypothesis to nature, we sacrifice nature to hypothesis; one makes his observations from the desk, and imputes to nature his prejudices; others are so bewildered by the laws by which they retain their own health, and cure their diseases, that they wish to govern all men according to their laws; others, it seems, think a medicine must be regarded good in all cases, because it has been good in one. Of a physician x. 213 hoes especially to see certain circumstances in a disease, he will certainly see these circumstances where he wishes, and not where they are, and we may soon mark through what glass he sees. I know a highly famous and greatly sought practitioner who has obstructions in his liver; he sees this obstruction in all his patients is the agricultural chemical system has become the fashion, so probably it will be computed how many billions of pounds of carbon, nitrogen, potash, soda, &c, may be found in the water and dust of our planet the plants be referred to these new sources of nutrition, and to the air and ash theory, be added yet a water and dust theory. A lively fancy will discover hypothesis for the motion of water and dust, by which the idea that plants can at pleasure draw from these sources of nutrition, will be set aside, asLiebig has set aside such an idea by a peculiar wind theory t may be thought by some we have devoted too much time and space to this subject; but Liebigs works have been so extensively diffused in this country, and through their charm of style and the enthusiasm with which the author enters into his discussions, the boldness displayed in his enunciation of his novel ties, and other concurrent causes, they have exerted so great an influence in various sections, that these facts seem to justify the attempt to present, in as condensed a form as we could, with any justice to the author, one of the ablest criticisms to which his principles have been subjected in myriads minded Germany. A few extracts from Vols review is all, we believe, which has been translated and published on this side in our agricultural papers. Consequently, as a part of the history of the theories and the controversy, it would appear desirable that something of this kind should be given, by which our agriculturists may have the means of comparison at hand. It is probable, but for some such method of inform nation, they might be unaware that the real agriculturists of Gerinany, and scientific men in the other branches of natural sciences do by no means assent to his doctrines; and how decisive is the rebuke which the distinguished chemist has met at their hands. I Having in former reports presented, as among trans firing facts, the history of Leibigs views, we may claim the right of giving, too, the other side of the question, and the more so, since a right discrimination of the points is contained in the foregoing synopsisof Professor Schulzes elaborate criticism. In Fritz Meyers Arch iv f fir Deutschen Landwirthschaft for November and December, 1848, we find, also, the following views respecting the true relation of agricultural chemistry, which may further aid in the object before us, of giving the state of feeling abroad on this subject. The article from which we translate is by. F. Drummer, of Began, Saxony. He says: " I, myself a disciple of Sprengel, have the following views respecting the value of agricultural chemistry 1. That plants derive their nourishment from the soil and atmosphere, no one will deny 2. That substances which plants seize upon for their nourishmein214Ex. and thus for their growth till they are ripe, must exist in the soil and atmosphere, it is believed that practical men will admit 3. That a continually cultivated field will finally be exhausted, and become un fruitful, is taught by the oldest experience, at least, of the temperate zones4That, by maturing, the soil becomes again capable of bearing is also equally well known 5. Hence, undeniably follows two things a. That plants draw a less portion of their nutriment from the atmosphere, and the greater portion from the soil b. That, by maturing, the substances are again restored to mother earth, which the culture of plants had drawn from it 6. The animal excrements, the vegetable substances which promote the growth of plants by strengthening the soil, we call manures 7. As the manure consists of a mixture of ponder able substances, but which are in a state of being de composed, so must an equal weight of like substances be used, though these do not consist of the excrements of animals and plants, when the same are capable of decomposition in the soil, and when, in the use of the same, repose is left to the soil until the decomposition has taken place 8. As animal manure (by the improvement of the science of chemistry) has been analyzed, we know its elements; we can, therefore, collect and combine these elements from the mineral and vegetable kingdoms 9. When the elements are first de composed in the soil, it needs the mixture of a fermenting substance, by means of nitrogenous parts, and the conditions in which only the ferment at ion can there take place, of the entrance of air, proportionate moisture, a certain degree of warmth, as well as (necessary) time for fermentation10. Chemistry, reaches us what are the elements of the plants, soil, manure, atmospheric deposites, the change, of substances in decomposition, of animal, vegetable, or mineral elements; and hence it follows, that it is not owing to chemistry in its present advance, but to the defect of applying it, if even where it is not empirically employed there have not been derived therefrom more manifest results 11. The failure is twofold; the chemists, with a few exceptions, are, for the most part, mere theorists in agriculture, while they attach to chemistry a higher value than now, at least, it can apparently have in practice; and their opponents are to blame that they do not understand how to avail themselves of its true value. We have over wide tracts of country fruitful and poor years. During the so different years the fields are planted in the same manner, manured alike, and yet a poor field may bear well in a fruitful year, and a rich field little in an unfavorable year. There are therefore yet other conditions for the success of plants than merely the presence of the nutritions elements in the soil. Practical men fail in the following respects a. As to liquid manure, or manure which is carried out in the norm of a dry powder, and of straw manure, either of them placing x. 215 the land in a different mode of mechanical looseness or tightness out every plant requires a particular degree of looseness or tight mess; one soil is not equally preserved with another by a similar treatment. They should, therefore, in the use of artificial manures, keep in view another cultivation; of this I have a decisive proof. A proprietor who is deficient yearly in animal manure, hears of the effect of bone powder. He buys it, stress it on his fields, but it is of no assistance. But the want of manure continuing, and constant favorable results elsewhere of this manure, cause him to make further trial, and he succeeds, as he does it with proper tillage of the field b. Agriculturists have also failed in this, that they have not allowed the manure time for decomposition, by which it is first brought into a state in which it can serve plants as nutriment. They usually avoid paying money, therefore, till there is the highest necessity; they then straw the fine powder in the furrows, and now think it may be taken up by the roots of the plants, and, as it were, swallowed and pass through them into the plants by the process of digestion. But this is a mistake! Experience has often clearly taught, that 8 cut. of bone powder put on the stubble of the previous fruit, produce as good a result in crops as 12 cut. which is put in the seed furrows. We must hence bear in mind that dung hill manure contains a large portion of water, (70 or 80 per cent which promotes its decomposition from the moment of its being plowed under. Artificial manures, on the contrary, are put on the field in a dry state. Pain or snow must impart to them that moisture which is necessary in all cases to begin ferment at ion. The decomposition will then first commence, and hence, necessarily, there should be a longer time for its full development. It is proper, therefore, first to mix all dry manures with a heap of earth, moist en it, work it over from time to time, and use this compose on the field c. The agriculturists also fails in this, that while he is acquainted with neither of the elements of the soil, nor of the fruits to be cultivated thereon, he does not know what manure is peculiarly wanting to his soil, and what he should especially procure, in order toi give to the fruits which are cultivated the requisite nutriment; as no artificial manure by itself alone actually combines the elements of the manure of the dung hill. The most perfect manure, although it cannot, in this respect, be properly called artificial; is the oil cake of the rape seed. The chemical analysis shows this, and practice in Belgium and Holland proves it. Why do not the agriculturists buy this oil cake mix it with moist earth, moist en it and heap it up in piles, according to the different periods, and straw the mixture on the kind of crop in their region for which it is most adapted? Because it seems to them too dear; because, if their dung hill fails, they choose to let their fields go poor, and will not pay as much for an artificial manure as they would pay for that of a dung hill, if they could obtain it. Next to the oil cake stands bone powder, only it is deficient in216Ex. potash and sulphuric acid, which may be added to it. Saturated preparations of flesh, blood, and earth, containing humid acid, succeed to this; but the management of the soil, and the mode of use of these manures on his soil, every agriculturists must learn for himself. This no chemical method can teach him. It hence follows, that the use of the more simple substances, as those of saltpeter, gypsy m, vitriol, alum, &c, are wholly uncertain, and must everywhere give more or less defective results. In a word, the science of chemistry arid that of Agronomie do not yet enough go on hand in hand. Chemistry cannot alone produce the benefit. This is my view of the matter, grounded on twelve years' experience. It is practical; and others may use it as they please n the same journal, we find some sensible observations contained in an essay by Leo Never, a chemist at Creutzberg, in Russia. His article is entitled, "that has Practical Agriculture to expect from Chemistrycid127" and we shall gather a few extracts, from its pages. Admitting the high character of Lie big as a chemist, he at the same time also admits that he has failed in many of his points upon agricultural chemistry, for want of more general science and in consequence of not being a practical agriculturists, botanist, zoology st, &c. Examples are cited of cases in which the agriculturists as been subjected to severe losses from a similar want of discrimination or ignorance of chemistry, when under the influence of the enthusiasm produced by Liebigs first announcements of his doctrines, application was made of the prepared manures. One was the case of a man, who, having heard that the scraping of horns would much enrich the land, thought that instead of applying these, it would be still better to take the horns and hoofs whole; and as his own farm did not supply enough for his object, bought up a large quantity and ploughed them into his field, of course, deriving no benefit from the same. His next experiment was with the scrapings, but with hardly better result, because he employed these without any reference to the foregoing crop. These instances he cites in order to show the necessity of exhibiting the true relation of chemistry to agriculture. He says, " When weturn to chemistry and examine what results the agriculturists may expect from it, since this chemical vert i go has not wholly quit the heads of men, we must first take a glance at vegetable life. Plants have a rtlatuin to the soil, the atmosphere, and atmospheric temperature. In respect to this last, the art of the chemist is at an end, for the subtle heat cannot be detected by the mo at susceptible scales of even Lie big himself; and so we can here only consider it with reference to the soil and the atmosphere. The soil is the store house from which the plant derives the greater portion of its nutriment; these means of nutriment, for the most part, consist of mineral bodies, and here it is that chemistry has furnished the proof that these bodies really belong to the plants, for it has indicated them in the ashes of the burnt plants. But the pray se is due to practical agriculture; it had by a variety of experiments shown that these bodies really serve or means of x. 
217latriment, as, long previous, it had made use of gypsy m; mary, phosphates of lime for manure; and long before chemistry had meddled with agriculture to promise it prosperity and favor, and indeed, long before chemistry was known by name. The chemist has also detected, these bodies in the soil, but the benefit which they afford to plants he has not indicated. Beside these bodies we find in the soil also others: namely, those which are considered organic, as humid acid, hum us extract, ammonia, which serve as nutriment to plants. Of these, Lie big maintains in his famous work that' plants must take them in a great measure only from the air, and, therefore, it was not necessary to furnish them to plants by manures. The author e declares that he himself had opposed this view from the first because it was not sustained by fact, notwithstanding the theory appears so finely on paper; and that, in respect to the large proportion of ammonia in the air, it had already been combatted by another chemist, Under. He then adds: "were I cannot help noticing the wavering and incorrect points of Liebigs views; for, should an agriculturists practice upon them, and manure his fields only with mineral bodies for example, gypsy m, mary, or the phosphates of lime and wholly neglect the usual manures, with their carbon and ammonia, he would very much lessen his crop The agriculturists may thus see that he cannot do otherwise than to have plants treated by the culture which is suited to their natural states. Nature has bestowed on the earth, beside mineral bodies, also organic, which may serve for nutrition; and without these the former do not exist, though it is a matter indifferent to the agriculturists whether the carbon is brought to the plants through the roots, or by carbonic acid which the bodies found in the soil containing carbon produce by their putrefaction and diffuse in the air, and by absorption through the leaves thus reach the plant. We therefore conclude that it is impossible to neglect stable manure, but that we must apply it to the fields. Met this circumstance at the same time furnishes proof how necessary it is that the agriculturists should carefully examine, when anything new is recommended to him, whether the new method is not too far removed from the operations of nature; for, if this is the case, then he may be convinced that it will be of no benefit, but rather of injury to him. Beside these elements of the soil, which serve plants for nutriment, other bodies also have an influence on their success, the operation of which is partly mechanical and partly physical. I mean by this, the peculiar condition of the tilled soil is dependent, in a great measure, as regards the quantitative proportion of elements on the different kinds of earth, or the elements that contain carbon. Nothing now appears easier than to determine the elements of the soil by a chemical analysis, in order thus to be able to form a conclusion as respects its goodness and fertility, if there were not manifold difficulties in the way of such an undertaking. The greatest of these difficulties consists in' this, that on the space of a certain' extent, the elements of the soil do not remain equal in all 218 X. places of this space, but vary as well in respect to their quantity as to their quality. I f, now, we would examine the goodness of the soil chemically, nothing else remains than to examine the soil at least on eight or ten places on a space of two morgen or some three or four acres and from the results found deduce a mean, and thus to draw the conclusion respecting its general fertility. For the examination of a single place might lead to very erroneous conclusions. The place examined, might, for example, have an excess of nutritions substances, while other portions of the tilled soil might be deficient in them and this might easily cause a person to mistake, by estimating too highly its fertility, or vice versa. But to conduct these examinations as I have suggested, would demand not only time and labor, but also be expensive. But all these difficulties the agriculturists avoids, when he values the goodness of the soil of a piece of land, according to the signs which the appearance of it offers him; or still better, when he rests on the experience of his predecessor who has tilled the same land. Chemical examination appears to be advisable only in a single case, in which a piece of land not before cultivated is to be brought under tillage, or in which a field that has for many years lain fallow is to be again sown. But even in this case the agriculturists has at command signs from which he may conclude with much certainty as to the fertility of the land to be cultivated. These consist in the knowledge of the condition of the soil which his examination of it by his eye reaches, and the state of the grass growth on the piece of land. There is likewise one other case in which the chemical knowledge of the soil must be of unquestionable advantage, when the state of the field to be cultivated anew appears not to be bad, but the scanty grass growth on it is only correspondent to a poor capacity for cultivation. In this case the chemical analysis may furnish the agriculturists the means to ascertain what elements must be added to make the land fertile. But allowing that an agriculturists has convinced himself of the fertility of a piece of land by chemical analysis, and has no regard to any other circumstances, he may by such an analysis often be led into great error, for it may chance that the same sub soil, though it is in a very good state, yet in different regions, possesses a wholly different fertility, not only if it does not contain an equal proportion of all the substances serving for nutriment, but even if, also, it consists of a quantitative proportion of clay and sand, which is very favorable to the success of plants. What influence the sub soil may have on fertility is known to every one. Hence it may happen, that a fertile soil, by means of an unfavorable imperious sub soil, may be little adapted to cultivation, and a less favorable soil maybe very much improved by a good sub soil. In the same manner a soil which ought, according to chemical analysis, to be in the highest degree fertile, yet, on account of the water rising through the bottom, may be so poor that it does not repay for tillage; and the same soil exhibits wholly different deux. agrees of facility for cultivation, according as it lies on a plain, or on the south side, or forms the slope of a hill, where it may be more heated by the rays of the sun falling directly upon it. We see, therefore, that chemistry affords almost no benefit to the agriculturists in the investigation of the goodness of the sub soil, and seems to be almost superfluous to this purpose. As the best means of nutrition for cultivated plants are found in manures which we carry on our fields, we will then inquire how far chemistry can exert any influence on these to benefit the cultivation of the land the knowledge of the best effect of manure on plants we owe, not to chemistry, but only to the practical experience of the tiller of the soil. Science, indeed, came in afterwards and showed what elements were imparted to plants by manure; but the effect of the same was known long before any one thought of chemistry; and this last knowledge is, naturally, only of special use to the .agriculturists. We may divide the manures into animal, vegetable, mineral and atmospheric; and we will now see what influence the knowledge of chemistry has on one of these kinds. The usual manures consist, in their principal elements, of animal and vegetable substances. We will, therefore, consider at the same time animal and vegetable manure very effective element in the common manure of the dung hill, is the volatile ammonia which is produced in the putrefaction of the same, which, in the usual treatment of manure, for the most part, escapes into the air, and of which, probably, the dried manure of the dung hill contains but a small per cent age. Experience now reaches us that fresh manure, in its putrefaction, developes ammonia; that it is more efficacious than old, dried up manure; but it does not teach us how a person should retain and fix this precious substance in the dung hill. This is matter for chemistry, which makes the agriculturists acquainted with the substances to be added that possess the desired properties; and this is really a merit belonging to the chemist by which he may conduce to the greater prosperity of agriculture. We frequently find the opinion prevalent that if a person carries out his manure on his fields in the winter, in order to plough it under in the following spring, this procedure will not diminish its value. But chemistry would prove to the agriculturists that this management is faulty, because by the rain and snow water a quantity of effective elements are removed from the manure which, in the spring, runs off with the water in the yet frozen ground, and thus is lost to the field. The effect of green maturing is universally known. But chemistry has taught us that this effectiveness is to be sought, not in the mineral substances which the plants plowed under give to the soil, because they in their growth derive the same from the soil, and only afterwards restore it again, but in something else; but this other substance especially is ammonia developed in their putrefaction, and which reaches the plants in a great degree through the atmosphere. It follows, therefore, that the green maturing must be so220Ex. much the more powerful if we make use of those plants which, in their putrefaction, develop e more ammonia than do others. Hence ve aches are better adapted to this than mere grasses. But at the same time chemistry clearly shows that the maturing by the stubble left on the field after the grain has been reaped, can have only a very insignificant effect, though the opinion is pretty generally diffused that its influence on the future harvest is no unimportant one; for the stubble, in its putrefaction, yields only a small quantity of ammonia, and, hence, the field does not long retain the mineral substances which were derived from it hi the growth of the plants cultivated upon it, because the greater part of them were drawn out by the grain and the straw which has been cut off. Chemistry also rectified another generally diffused pre conceived opinion. It is believed generally that by the excrements of the cattle, which they leave in feeding on the pasture or stubble field, its condition for culture is improved; but those conversant with chemistry know, at the same time that only that is given back to the soil which has been drawn from it. Further, on most farms there is a most thoughtless practice with regard to the draining of the dung hill, which is exceedingly valuable as manure; because it is not only allowed to run off unused from the stalls, but, also, what is separated from the dung hills is not collected in reservoirs. Although, now, practical experience has sufficiently proved that the efficacy of this material for manure is to be valued highly, yet it is chemistry only which reaches the agriculturists how he can increase this efficacy by the addition of other substances, and how he, in general, must manage it in the most suitable manner. Chemistry it is, further, which reaches how we may proceed with materials for manure which are not generally in use as human excrement, for example so that we may obtain all the maturing elements, and lose none of them. It also reaches the agriculturists that in manures certain substances must not be wanting, if it is to be effective, as the different plants, beside carbon and ammonia, which they all need, require also different mineral substances for their success. Therefore, an agriculturists should understand agricultural chemistry in its rudiments, not to fall into errors; as to wish to manure his fields with pure exciementsfor example, those of horses without mixing in straw; as, indeed, many do fall into this mistake, who thus think by this method to carry upon their fields a truly powerful manure; for such a person does not know, assuredly, that a most necessary element, delicate of potash, will be drawn out of the soil. Such an agriculturists must not, moreover, manure his fields with mere poudrette, bone powder, or gun no, without having first mixed it with the usual manure an error into which farmers fall, because they are of opinion that these substances, which have acquired considerable reputation as materials for manure, are in a state alone to provide their fields with the necessary elements. All this which I have here cited respecting animal and vegetable natures, may be sufficient to show that the practical agriculturists x. may, by chemical knowledge, exert an influence which must be greatly to the advantage of his fields. As to the materials of manure which furnish mineral riches, it is not to be denied that the favorable operation of gypsy m and mary was known long before the agriculturists busied himself with chemistry; yet, in the employment of these materials chemical knowledge is not without use. The principal means, indeed, of recognizing mary namely, its effervesence when an acid is poured upon it is of chemical origin. Farther, it is not a matter of indifferent e to those who are conducting agriculture, how much per cent age of lime which the mary one wishes to use contains, as the proportion of lime in the same is very different, and by his the quantity must be decided which is to be carried on a certain surface of his fields. But chemistry only can give him conclusions as to the proportion. Further, many springs of water contain a quantity of carbonate of lime in solution, so that where such water is in a state to flow over a field, we can mary the same. To, too, many springs *f water contain a quantity of gypsy m, and we can, therefore, use them to advantage for a gypsy m. That the usual tilled ground is derived from the influence of weather on stones, especially of granite, is also known; chemistry has, moreover, proved that the tilled groucid127d likewise, consists of the same elements as the stones. Hence we may assume that stones, especially if easily acted on by the weather, art no disadvantageous appearance on a field, for they may, though many of them also are very scanty in the proper material, furnish the field with elements of manure. We see, therefore, how profitable it may be, if we heap up stones on the borders of the ploughed ground, and take care of them, that the rain water flowing from them may reach the cultivated field. Chemistry also may teach the agriculturists that he can often use to great profit the minerals which he has not yet employed for maturing, especially if they are found in quantity on his estates; this may be the case, for example, with calcareous tula, which in its principal elements is carbonate of lime, and therefore may have as favorable an effect on plants as mary. As to what concerns the atmospheric materials of manure, carbonic acid and ammonia diffused in the air, the efficacy of the same cannot now be further increased by aid of chemistry, for it is universally known that its fertility is increased by the turning up of the soil by which its ammonia is absorbed, and that water containing carbonic acid operates on delicate of potash in the soil to de compose it. It was also known that when turf y soil is exposed for a long time to the operation of 'the air it becomes converted into a very fertile mass of earth. But all this is the result of experience, and chemistry has first afterwards made us acquainted with the processes by which these changes have been wrought. Of now we turn to the consideration of the plants of culture, i~ so far as agriculture can operate on their success by the help of8222Ex. chemistry, we know that chemistry has acquainted us with their elements, but especially with those which belong to the mineral kingdom, of which only we shall here speak. We have learned to know of them that some contain si vicious earth, others calcareous, and again others potash, and hence conclude that according as the soil is rich in one of these substances the plants adapted thereto especially succeed, and vice versa; that plants only advance poorly on a soil if it does not contain the substance which it mainly requires for its nutrition. Therefore good fruits are peculiarly successful on a soil which is rich in lime, because their ashes contain much lime, and they particularly need this substance for their nutriment. Hence, also, the good effect of gypsy m on c lover, &c. But by this the agriculturists may have a means at hand to improve his fields, on which especially a single species of fruit will not advance. For a field on which peas do not particularly succeed is certainly deficient in lime, and therefore lime should be furnished to it. A field on which the haul m fruits decline, is wanting in delicate of potash, because the grass haul m contains much si vicious earth, and much of this earth is needed for its full development. We must improve such a field, therefore, either by a rich quantity of straw, which is added to the dung hill manure, or by s lacked wood ashes, &c. But the knowledge of the mineral substances of the ashes of plants may be of great advantage in another respect; in the case where the agriculturists wishes to attempt the cultivation of a plant, as to the culture of which he does not possess sufficient experience for he will easily be able to judge from the ashy elements what means of nutrition the new plant particularly needs, and how to average his materials of manure accordingly. From this view, we may see that the much too great expectations which have been formed of chemistry in reference to agriculture, since the announcement of Lie big, must be called altogether excessive, and that it is the greatest injustice as well as an un pardon able arrogance on the part of the chemist, if he wishes to be regarded as the instructor of the farmer, and denied him all intelligence in the practice of his business, and maintains that agriculturists have been mere empires; for a man may be an able practical agriculturists without, on this account, understanding anything of chemistry, as this also our predecessors have sufficiently proved. But this much stands firm: that chemical knowledge i in the highest degree useful to the agriculturists, if he uses it with understanding and prudence, and thus regards all the circumstances which are connected therewith. Especially he may be convinced of this, that without gypsy m it would hardly be necessary to obtain artificial or far fetched materials of manure, as for example, gun no; because in a suitable preparation and use of the maturing powers which his estate offers him, he would not be compelled to buy any for money. Of we take into consideration this and all that I have said in favor of chemistry, then all this must force on us the conviction that this science may be, and will so continue, not without influx. a. 223 once on agriculture, but that in succeeding times it may yield much for the further development of the same. In this subject, therefore, namely, the influence of chemistry on agriculture, the truth lies in the middle; i. e, we must not form too great hopes, but we must not set it aside as wholly unnecessary. But besides this advantage just mentioned, there is yet another which certainly cannot be regarded as one of low value. Chemical knowledge places the' farmer in a situation to judge correctly of all the experiences with which he has become acquainted in his practice, and thus to investigate the cause of every appearance. It is impossible by this to conclude from one appearance to another, because similar appearances are wont to have similar grounds in a word, such knowledge will make his reflectivepowers more lively and himself more intelligent With all due allowance for any bias the above author may be supposed to feel as a chemist towards the science of his profession, we believe that in the main his remarks may be taken as a fair statement of the position chemistry holds as to agriculture, and confined within these limits in its claims and pretensions, it maybe of great benefit to the practical agriculturists of our country. This is the view it is believed, too, that the ablest scientific teachers of agriculture in this country would adopt. In a lecture by Prof. Johnston, delivered before the society at the meeting in Work, on the present state of agriculture in its relations to chemistry and geology, and which was published in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England for August last, we find much valuable information; and, as it may probably be 'seen by few of those who read these pages, we will transfer some portions of the same to our report. His remarks are in answer to the three questionsSFirst. What has been the progress, in amount and in kind, which scientific agriculture has made among ourselves during the last ten years Second. What is the actual condition of this advancing knowledge? and Third. What should now be specially done to further or make easy its advanced n answer to the first question, he mentions the state of things as they existed ten years before in reference to the want of correctly ascertained facts in experimental agriculture; the currency in theoretical writings of a crowd of hasty hypothesis; and the wide gaps and deficiencies which everywhere presented themselves in analyses of matters connected with rural economy. To meet these deficiencies the proper remedies were suggested, to have accurate experiments in the field undertaken, made by weight and under varied circumstances, and instructions were published explaining the kind of experiments desired, how they should be conducted and the ends they were expected to serve; also. to reject received views of every opinion no matter by whom propounded or propagated, in support of which there were not unmistakable facts, or in favor of which the balance of known observations did not dis 24 X. 
inctly incline; and lastly, that analytical researches of various kinds should be undertaken in the laboratory. In reply to the second question propounded, he says: That much has been done as to experiments in the field many of which were conducted and are apparently accurate in their character. From these experiments he draws the following deductions: "a. That substances rich in nitrogen increase the verdure, lengthen the straw, and generally promote and prolong the growth of plants b. That lime in its more common forms generally shortens the period of growth, strengthens the stem, and hastens the time ofripening, both of the corn and the root crops c. That certain saline substances applied alone, and even in comparatively minute quantity, produce a remarkable, what may almost be called a marvellous effect upon certain crops on certain soil sd. But change the crop or soil, or the season, or apply them in the same circumstances a second or third time, and frequently no sensible effect will followed. That where one substance applied alone refuses to produce a visible effect, a mixture of two or more may give rise to striking differences f. That phosphorus acid, lime, and certain forms of organic matter are essential constituents of such a mixture as shall everywhere and in all circumstances produce a marked and beneficial effect on old cultivated land, to which no other manure is applied These general deductions, professor Johnston says, are important bases for future practical researches, and the certainty thus attained in regard to them is worth perhaps, all th' cost of the experiments. Other conclusions likewise are mentioned, which may be regarded as probable, as for instance: "a. That the so called so ruble saline substances, the salts of potash, soda, magnetic, &c, are grateful to the root crops in which they exist largely b. That those which contain sulphuric acid have a specially beneficial action upon leg luminous plants c. That the use of common salt adds weight to the graind. That on moss y land the use of bones tend to fill the e are. That lime and salt are better than lime alone on some soils, in giving strength to the straw f. That mineral manures applied alone, act like lime, in shortening the period of growth These probable conclusions he considers to be of value as guides to the practical man, but to science they are almost invaluable, as the point the way to new experimental researches, by which the domain of truth will be enlarged. He comments on the defect of experiments which often have been undertaken without a definite purpose, and without a clear knowledge of what was to be looked for. Thus, points have been passed over important to be observed. In cases of contradictory results or discordant statements, no means are afforded for determining on which reliance is to be placed. The soil or the sub x. a, 225 stance applied to it has not been analyzed; the history of the past treatment and present condition of the land is not given; the peculiarities of the weather, or of the local climate, are not noted the physical geography of the neighborhood is left out of view the character, willing and attentive, or otherwise, of the workmen is not stated, or we know nothing of the general habits, skill, and education of the person who published and is responsible for the accuracy of the whole results." I The defects noted with respect to experiments on specific manures are, that the limits of the natural differences in the crop on different parts of the same field have not been previously or simultaneously determined. One portion of the field has been left undressed, and the produce of that one part has been taken as the standard with which the produce of the dressed or manured parts were to be compared. As evidences of the necessity of such cautions respecting experiments, he says: "the same substance applied in the same quantity to different parts of the same field and crop produces differences of an equally marked character, of which examples are given. Now, are these differences to be ascribed to the errors or carelessness of experimenteds or their servants? or do they signify that no exact numerical results are ever to be obtained from such experiments He considers that whatever be the cause, inasmuch as the tables of results at present possessed exhibit for the most part only one illustration of the effect of each substance or mixture employed, no strong reliance can be placed upon them as indications of what their mean or average effectcid127would be on the field as a whole, or upon its several parts taken singly. And in reference to the experiments made, he adds: "but the application of these and other tests has compelled me to the conclusion that a very small number indeed, out of the host of experiments made during the last five years, is really deserving of more than a general credit. They are to be trusted as showing that this or that substance adds to the verdure, bulk or weight of this or that crop, in certain circumstances; but they are not to be depended upon as to how much these several substances do so either relatively or absolutely, or as to the degree by which their action is effected by this or that circumstance, In other words, the application of weight or measure in its strictest sense to this branch of applied science has yet to be made; and the field of precise agricultural experiment, instead of being pretty well colonies, as some think, may be said to lie still open and unoccupied before us But, says Professor Johnston, have our past experimental researches, then, as a whole done no good? And he replies: I would say' they have all done good. In some cases certain and probable deductions have been made, as already stated. But even in other cases, and where no such deductions can be drawn from them, he thinks that the labor spent on them has not been lost. He advertsto results embraced in calling forth so much new thought, the definite form and meaning imparted to the idea of scientific farming, the new habits of observation created, the more precise modea8226Ex. of reasoning secured, the amount of reading of books which otherwise might not have interested the agricultural class, and their cooperation in associations whose motto is "science with practice Even in the very sense in which the experiments made are defective, that is a purely scientific one, as supplying reliable facts on which to base opinions, or to be employed as tests of opinions already entertained, he still deems them as not without their use. They have taught, he says, how to work more correctly, and have called up and trained men who are capable of performing experiments in future years. In remarking on the manufacture of mineral manures as a circumstance which distinctly marks the kind of advancement which, scientific agriculture has made of late years, and the position it now occupies, he says: The possibility of concentrating great fe utilizing efficacy in a small weight or bulk, has been satisfactorily demonstrated to every one by the remarkable effect of gun no. Chemical analysis then took it up, explained the composition ofguano, declared that it could be imitated at a reasonable rate, and, published experimental recipes for compounding artificial mixture to be tried against it. This, he states, led at once half instructed men to press forward into what appeared a sure and easy way of making money. The consequence was, that numerous worthless compounds, or at least very inferior to gun no were sold and bought by tremulous farmers, who found themselves greatly disappointed in the promised results. The farmers were indeed partly to blame, as they encouraged the sale of cheap manures. The way to check this state of things, Professor Johnston observes, is to diffuse among agricultural improves generally, that limited amount of instruction which shall enable them to manufacture the mixtures desired for themselves. That this practice is on the increase with respect to bone manure is evident from a single fact stated, that in the town of Spaulding 27,000 lbs. of sulphuric acid were sold last year for the purpose of dissolving bones. Professor Johnston says, that in addition to the experimental and directly practical part of the progress made, as the one which plainly bears on the profitable prosecution of the agricultural art, there has been considerable improvement in regard to agricultural theory within the last five years. Thus: "a. It is known that the bodies of animals contain much nitrogen. This nitrogen they obtain from their food, and this food is all of vegetable origin. Now vegetable food is believed to be more valuable for the production and support of those parts of animals which contain nitrogen, in proportion as the per cent age of nitrogen present in itself is greater. It comes nearer to the composition of the animal parts themselves. It has also been long received as a practical truth, that the proportion of nitrogen in wheat and other kinds of grain was very much under the control of the cultivatorthatby a proper adjustment of the quantity and quality of the manure he could have or double at pleasure the per cent age of nitrogen contained in his crops of corn." Numerous experiments and analyse she says, have been supposed to have proved this, and that this fact x. Toe N .59. 227 has been urged by less cautious persons as proof of the dominion which chemical research has .already given us over th operations of vegetable nature. But, as he further remarks, this opinion has not borne the test of rigid experimental and chemical criticism. He himself in his earliest writings expressed his doubts of it, and the experiments ofSchlossberger and Awes he regards as justifying the banishment of it front the books to. Another opinion in regard to the nitrogen of plants, which has also had much currency, is that plants derive all they contain from the ammonia of the atmosphere, and that they take it up only in the form of ammonia." "his opinion" he observes, "was so contrary to the oldest and most common experience of practical men of all grades of intelligence in the raising of their crops, that nothing but the announcement of it in the form of an undoubted law could have secured any degree of permanent consideration among scientific men. As it was, sanguine young persons, chiefly such as were unfamiliar with practice, took it up and warmly maintained it, both in this country and abroad- A calm consideration of facts, however, is gradually removing this notion from the public mind, and another year or two will banish it from our books c. A third opinion is next noticed, as adopted by many and extensively acted upon, that plants obtain all their organic matter directly from the air, and derive, and therefore require, only mineral matter from the soil; or, as Lie big stated it, " the crops on afield diminish or increase in exact proportion to the diminution or increase of the mineral substances conveyed to it in manure his view, contrary as it was to old experience, obtained generalacceptation; and Professor Johnston observes, that field experiments were a de and results published, which seemed to confirm it. "gutta adds, "this mineral matter opinion has received its death blow, and we are again on the highway of experience Among other theoretical opinions which have been more or less satisfactorily dis proved, he alludes to these, that the ash of the same plant always contains the same per cent age of oxygen in its bases; that gypsy m acts only by fixing ammonia from the atmosphere; that common salt enters and remains as such in plants; that analysis' of soil lead to no useful practical result; that manures should be prepared in a less so ruble form, that .the rains may not wash them out of the soil, &c. As regards the analytical researches, in connexion with agriculture, which the last five years have carried on in the various laboratories of Europe, he observes that numerous gaps have been filled up, old analyses have been repeated and corrected, and valuable data of various kinds have been accumulation g, by which our theoretical views are to be amended and widened, and our general husbandry improved. These, though in many respects defective, have prepared the way for more un exception able results, and have indicated new lines of research and new fields of inquiry. In reply to the third question, " What should now be done to further or make easy the progress of scientific agriculture? he makes 28 X. these observations The first is with reference to field experiments. The science of agriculture, he thinks, is now retarded by the want of more sure means of inter rotating nature in the field, a swell as in the laboratory; and that field experiments must henceforth be entrusted to the more instructed guidance and watchful care of the professional experimenter. The second point which he gives is, to train up and encourage a race of instructed, conscientious and honorable manufacturers of artificial manures; and thirdly, analytical researches should be carried on. In this last, topic, he offers the following suggestions, as likely, if adopted, to lead to important results. Thus: "a. The states in which their mineral and organic constituents exist in living plants, is an inquiry of much importance, which has scarcely yet been asked of a single cultivated plant, and to which it will require many years of minute and careful labor to obtain clear and definite replies. In what state of chemical combination, and of mechanical aggregation, do they exist in different parts of the plant ?a? Now much in a so ruble state in the sap ?a? Of what kind? What purpose does it serve? I s it merely disposing othercid127aatter to form fixed parts of the plants, or is it itself on the way to build up such parts? Now much of the mineral matter present in the solid insoluble parts is necessary to their existence? Now much is foreign unorganized matter? Now much actually indicative of disease ?the study of the ash of plants tells us nothing of the nature of the functions of what is burned away whether it be of an acid or alkaline nature and yet these are all of much importance. The proportion of mineral acids and alkalies in plants varies; but they contain organic acids and alkalies. Have these mineral and organic substances any relation to each other in qu an ?a? To they perform the same general functions? An they take the place of each other in whole or in part ?a? When mineral acids or bases are i scarce, can organic acids and bases be produced or taken up in their stead, so as to form a healthy plant? Of so, what influence has soil or culture upon this, and how far does this replacement of mineral by organic matter effect the nutrition qualities of the produce ?b. Again, in what states of chemical combination the food enters the roots of plants, is a question, the immediate bearing of which on practice is readily perceived. In what states can the different kinds of food enter, and in what states is it best for the plant they should enter, and what is the influence of circumstances in bringing them into these states? Of all these, he observes, we know, as yet, almost nothing but what rests on bare analogy. The results of direct experiment are almost entirely wanting c. I intimately connected with this inquiry" says Professor Johnson, "is the important one, as to the state in which it is most profitable or economical to apply this or that substance to the soil, so as in the greatest degree to benefit this or that crop. Now far also, ought the physical or mechanical condition and chemical composition of the soil to modify this state? At what period of the years x. for of the plants growth are substances best applied? Are they best laid on all at once, or at successive periods? In none of these points have we as yet any clear scientific information, and here, he states, the conjoined aid of both the field and the laboratory will be necessary, if we are ever to obtain itd. But the professor considers still more important the questions which remain unsolved in regard to the nitrogen of plants that are the natural sources of all the nitrogen which plants require? Now much do they need? What functions does it perform in their interior? Now much of what enters remains in them, and how much escapes again into the air from their leaves? These are all questions of an important practical bearing, to the solution of which recent observations, both in the field and in the laboratory, impart a higher degree of importance than we were previously prepared to attach to them." in n his explanation of this point, Professor Johnston says, that Professor Papers experiments have shown that plants are constantly giving off nitrogen from their leaves in large quantities into the air, and that it appears probable that of the nitrogen which enters their roots, only a small proportion remains at last in the full grown plant, compared with what is thus discharged into the atmosphere. And if these are facts, he adds, first, that plants must require a great deal more of this elementary body in their food than has hitherto been supposed, and secondly, that its combinations must perform in n the plant very different functions and more numerous ones than have previously been ascribed to it e. A large field of important investigation is Also laid open by another function of the leaf. From the pores of the leaves exudeodoriferous and other vapors. These are owing to the escape of volatile vaso he from the leaves that we have not yet sought to arrest or examine. The liquids ex using from the leaves are no doubt various in their odors, their differences depending mainly upon the nature and age of the plant." But' says the professor, "there is reason to believe that they rarely consist of pure water. They hold in solution appreciable quantities of organic and saline matters, which, as the water eva pirates from the leaf, remain behind upon its surface or in its pores. These the rain w ashes off and carries back to the soil; and this is one of the destined functions of the rain in refreshing the growing plant. What are the substances which the plant thus discharges from its leaves? Are they indications of health or of disease? In what form do they enter its roots? Are they necessary to the plant, and ought they, therefore, to be added to the soil? Are they unnecessary and ought they to be carefully withheld? In regard to these points, he adds, old as agriculture is, I believe a single precise experiment has never yet been made f. As another illustration, he alludes to the industrial animals of Ehrenberg, and which abound wherever water and decaying vegetable matter exist together. "these abound in many of the soils. To they not abound in all, Of not in all, in what soils are they most abundant? To they, like larger insects, prey upon living plants? Have they anything to do with the sickness and death of2EFx Toe. No. &9 lover; with the perishing of young corn; with the fingers and toe gin turnipsT Are they in any way connected with the benefits derived from draining, from naked fallow, and from the various processes by which pe at bogs are reclaimed? Were is a hitherto wholly un thought of field of inquiry, rich in promise, the cultivation of which demands the united labors of the open air experimenter, of the chemist, and of the microscopic zoologistHe alludes to the very interesting and important relations of light to vegetation, the unexplored fields of research in connexion with the feeding of stock, with dairy husbandry, with the growth of wool, &c, all of which it is desirable to enter on with the united aid of the cultivates of practical and scientific branches of knowledge which are fitted to throw light upon them, and then concluded with the following beautiful observations: "one cannot help feeling a kind of regret in thus indicating to others trains of research it would be so interesting to follow out ones self. It is like discovering, to strangers, the secret of a hidden treasure we had hoped ourselves to dig up. In this progress of knowledge, and in helping forward, and in some measure directing it, there is so great a charm and honor, that were it possible, with the means and life of one man, I should willingly myself attempt to carry forward all I have suggested; and I should scarcely condescend to point out to you what I would myself, for the sake of science, so cheerfully perform. But the life of one man is too short, his means too limited, and his knowledge too confined to allow of his hoping to see very much progress made by his own hands, under his own immediate direction, or even during his own lifetime. It is something better, therefore, and higher, while we do not cease to labor ourselves, that we should point out the way to others also, enlist the young and the ardent who are springing up around us, awaken the attention and stimulate the labors of experimental philosophers in other countries, as in our own, and urge upon all to bring a helping hand to the removal of obstacles which stand in the way of the progress of all, and which especially retard the advancement of an art on which the sustenance of all so materially depends. Was one who, meditating on the shores of an unknown sea, discovers islands afar off looming largely on the horizon, which he can never hope himself to visit or explore; or as on some bright day, pictured on the fleecy clouds by the wonderful mi rage; unsuspected fleets, or contending armies, or beautiful cities, appear to his admiring eye; which, in bodily presence, he can scarcely hope to look upon, so in his glimpses of scientific fields and subjects inviting, but unexplored, and with kindred feelings, must the rotary of progressive knowledge remain content to point out to others what he has himself more faintly described, or seen more brightly pictured in his mind of philosophic truth, leaving to them the after task of unfolding what he has himself been unable to overtake The high estimation in which Professor Johnston is held by those who are acquainted with the services he has rendered to agriculture, through his writings and untiring efforts to advance its claims230Ex. C To. 59.and improve its character, will be deemed, it is not doubted, a sufficient apology, were one needed, for so full a sycosis of his lecture before the Royal Agricultural Society of England. It maybe regarded as a birds eye view of the progress and present state of agriculture and its relations with chemistry for the last 10 years, and we know not where we could find a better summary of this subject. As such it falls within the scope of this report. There is a fine discriminating spirit exhibited, and the line is drawn with an even hand, between the false and true claims of chemistry, with unusual clearness. The fallacies which have deluded many are plainly exposed, and a better basis is presented on which to erect a more dura be structure than the airy fabrics which, like the bubble, have had their moment and exploded and vanished. The objects of future investigation are also pointed out with great precision, and, if his suggestions be followed out, unquestionably rich harvests will be reaped on these fields of inquiry. Even in the very height of Liebigs first popularity, when one might almost have deemed that many had eaten of the root which makes insane so blindly were his announcementsreceivedProfessor Johnstondidnot hesitate to call in question his views, and has all along presented his own more sober and well supported deductions as a counter active to the mischief the errors of the former might occasion. In the statements which in substance or in his own language we have borrowed from Professor Johnston, it is easy to trace the history of the new form in which chemistry has put forth its claims to the regeneration of agriculture. As in every sudden impulsive movement, so it has been -with respect to Liebigs influence over the people of Europe and this country. The doctrines broachedwere set out with such decided authoritative ness that they confounded and awed into submission, while so spacious were the arguments by which they were supported, that, if any were disposed to inquire, they might be apt to mistake the glare of his false philosophy for the resplendence of truth. It is ever the case that, in all such revolutions of opinions, much that is crude is b reached, and it is not till after the course of years that the true position of affairs can be known; but when the din of the battle is over, and the smoke and the glare are past, there can be discovered what remains and what has sunk beneath the shock. This is the period, and this the point of view, which Professor Johnston has seized upon, and by his own clear optics he enables others to see the results and what is yet to be attempted and gained. His remarks are eminently suggestive, and may be studied in their full extent with great profit .by our men of science and intelligent practical agriculturists. The cooperation he recommends of these classes is most important. Progressive improvements will mark the course he points out to be adopted, and the next ten years will witness to more solid advances in agriculture, both as a science and in practice than the previous ones. The prophecyes of the too enthusiastic disciples of the German chemist may not be realized substitutes discovered by chemistry may not be found so as to dispense with, 3 X. all the ordinary means of enriching the soil, as has been the dream of some; but, the agriculturists may be essentially aided in the management of his soils, his crops, and balancing his system of farm husbandry so as to secure the greatest crops and the highest profits at the least comparative expense of time and labor. The urgent manner in which Professor Johnston sets forth the necessity of accurate and well conducted investigations to secure reliable facts is worthy the attention of all. In no country is this needed more than in our own. Want of e one, patient research and minute, examination is characteristic of a people who are so prompt and vigorous in execution. The little steps by which are traced up remove causes to their grand effects are liable to be overlooked in the giant strides with which earnest enterprise presses on to the attainment of its favorite objects. For this reason, with exceptions here and there, we call hardly expect that the mass of even the more intelligent of our agriculturists will have much share in securing the wonderful results he seems to anticipate. From those points where are able, well qualified instructors, who shall train others in the knowledge of their own ache my, by which the proper tests may be applied, will there go forth thorough observers, whose influence may do much in developing facts, exploding errors and detecting fallacies, and they in turn will operate on 'others yet, who will swell in numbers and improve in skill and ability for the continued advances that may hereafter be made. The subject of vegetable nutrition which is embraced in the theory of agriculture and its practical bearing is most important. In the last report allusion was made to a work of Professor. H. Schuize, of Berlin, who, after a close examination, adopted a theory of the nutrition of plants which was there mentioned as quoted from Zenger ke. Since then we have obtained Professorschulzes work, entitled "the discovery of the true theory of the nutrition of plants with a view to an agricultural physiology" and will now give the theory promulgated by him somewhat more fully. In a brief sketch he first averts to the previous theories, then to the defects and contradictions of the theory of the decomposition of carbonic acid, essentially the one held by I ngenhouz, Gene bier, Assure, and more recently by Lie big. In opposition to this view he alleges various objections, ranged under sixteen particulars. We should be glad if we could adduct them but must now pass them over. But, says he, "I f the carbonic acid is not the source of the oxygen given out, then there must be other substances in plants which develop e it, and the whole process of the nutrition of plants, the whole theory of maturing must be represented differently from what has been hitherto adopted. These considerations have occupied us for a course of years before we could attain to a method leading from the existing contradictions to the truth. His induced experiments, (the mode of conducting which, and the results, are fully stated) on the operation of the vegetable acids. The effect of plants on the assimilating substances is also examined, a swell as the progress or course of the nutrition of plants, the effect of organization on the substances to be assimilated, the means by x. 233 which the digestive operation is produced, the formation of wood sap, the nutrition of the seed. germ, the repetition of the germ formation in young sprouts, parasitic plants, &c. He then takes the position that plants can be nourished without the exhaustion of oxygen, and notices the giving out of water by green leaves, after which he comes to the statement of what he considers the true vegetable nutrition. These various subjects are discussed with much ability, and embrace, of course, many most interesting particulars. But we must omit them for the' sake of presenting in full his exhibition of the subject, just alluded to, the true vegetable nutrition. This we find thus stated: "the only basis from which we must take our departure in the explanation of the formation of vegetable substances, is gum, sugar, and the vegetable acids, and probably among these is to be named, as the most common means of vegetable nutrition, the lactic acid, (milk acid) whether it exists in the tenn in liquor, in milk, or by the transformation of the elements of hum us, aided by the roots themselves. We have already herein those combinations to which originally belong, besides carbon and oxygen, hydrogen, the mode of the existence, of which in plants has been much more enigmatical in previous theories, than carbon itself. The absorption of oxygen and giving out of carbon, are the means for the general elaborate on of these vegetable substances. These two phenomena, therefore, are to be met with in the entire vegetable kingdom among all plants. The giving out of oxygen in the light, is a subsidiary means of obtaining by de oxidation of the acids, andacidulated substances, a stronger carbonization and hydrogenizationof the vegetable juices; but the basis of the formation of wood and vital sap lie in gum and acids for need and drawn out of the soil by means of the elaborate on of the hum us, from which the grape sugar and cane sugar is formed in the vessels themselves by greater absorption of oxygen and giving out of carbonic acid. Plants do not merely prepare. their carbon by decomposition of carbonic acid, but they rather always give off carbonic acid; for the nutritioussubstances sucked in from the soil are so rich in carbon, that in order to form these into the vegetable elements, still more carbon anus t be excited. The explanation of the existence of wood sap of the incorrectly so called crude nutritions juice of the plant, has been probably one of the most difficult points in the physiology of plants. The supposition that the nutritions substances from without must pass over into the plants r changed, has doubtless been the chief cause why the manifold contradictions respecting the mode of vegetable nutrition have continued unsolved. An explanation could never be given from the mere carbonic acid as to the elements of wood sap, the formation of gum sugar, of venous and ace tic acid; and in the views respecting the unchanged absorption of hum us acid and hum us extract the objection must here strike one, that these substances, as such, are not again found in the wood sap. _to far as we know, moreover, there have been made scarcely any experiments to explain the existence of the elements of the 234. X. wood sap from the hum us, because we are left in uncertainty generally respecting the meaning of wood say as well as respecting the progress of the vegetative functions in nutrition, from a defective ness in the knowledge of the minor organs. Through the knowledge of the most remarkable digestive operation of the roots on thenutritious substances in hum us, the formation of the gum is explained, as is proved to us in the changes furnished us in sugar by the operation of the roots. The continued absorption of oxygen through the roots and wood proves the ever progressive elaborationof the elements. of wood sap by the living plants. As gum and sugar contain a nearly equal proportion of about 12, 1120, 10, so the absorption of oxygen and giving out of carbonic acid may have less for its object a combination of oxygen or a decarbonizing, than the trans position of substances for the purpose of forming grape and cane sugar; but, on the contrary, the increase of the ace tic, tartar in, lactic, magic, nitric acids, always demand for a greater portion of oxygen an oxidation of the gum Such is Professor Schulzes statement of the true doctrine of vegetable nutrition, and which he attempts to sustain in the succeeding pages of his work. Were he considers the existence of the vital juice or sap, the salts and acids it contains, the origin of nitrogen in the same, and the meaning of the vital sap in plants. The last portion of his work, the view to an agricultural physiology, he divides into the culture of the germ, of the growth, of the blossom and fruit bearing, and thus concludes: " Of we now sum up the investigations here made respecting the nutrition of plants, we have the following results: 1. The opinions hitherto that carbonic acid is the essential food of plants is erroneous, and is not at all founded in nature. His acid is sucked in by the roots only, together with other nutritioussubstances, and is de composed with difficulty likewise with them, while the great quantity of oxygen gas which the roots give out has wholly another origin 2. There is no sort of proof for the opinion connected with the carbonic acid theory, that water is de composed and assimilated by plants. This opinion is entirely of hypothesis origin, by which is ought to be explained the existence of the structure of plants containing hydrogen, which could not be explained from the mere decomposition of carbonic acid. We have, indeed, discovered what was before unknown, that plants sometimes ex hale hydrogen gas; butt his happens only in the dark, exactly at a time when they form no oxygen gas, and has no origin in the decomposition of water. His explosive gas only exists when, to the oxygen gas secreted in the light, is added afterwards hydrogen formed t in the dark 3. The view which has hitherto been in existence together with the theory of carbonic acid, that plants are nourished by the un hanged hum us acid and hum us acid salts, is likewise so far incorrect, that plants never suck in unchanged hum us acid, hum us extract; and hum us acid salts. The view that this does happen is likewise merely an un proved conclusion drawn from the operation of hum us on the growth generally, but in which it has never been x. 235 how n whether or not, also, hum us really ready previously dis sov les i. :carbonic acid, and in this form promotes nutrition, as was the view void ngenhouz. That hum us acid is directly sucked in by plants is also, as yet, an un proved hypothesis, like the theory of carbonic acid; much more, this hypothesis respecting it stands in contradiction with the theory of carbonic acid, that from the absorption of hum us we never have been able to explain the origin of the oxygen given out, never could the inward course of a ti city in the assimilations be analyzed, and in fact the unchanged elements of hum us are not the true nutriment of plants. 4. The true nutriment is rather the hum us containing nitrogen converted into other substances by the digestive operation *the roots on what surrounds them. These substances are the germ of the wood sap, sugar, and in different -plants different vegetable acids, of which tile one most commonly met with is the lactic acid, But besides these are also magic, nitric, tartar in, ace tic acids, and the acid salts of these acids. From the decomposition of these substances, is produced the greatest quantity of oxygen which the plants give out in the light. All the formations in plants containing hydrogen, the vegetable tissue, oils, wax, gum, sugar, starch real, likewise have their origin from these substances 5. Plants form sulphur and phosphorus immediately by the decomposition of the phosphates and sulphate of lime sucked in from the the soil by means of the ox alice acid, the main object of which, in the economy of vegetable life, seems to be especially this decomposition. From the liberated sulphuric acid and phosphorus acid, the oxygen his then secreted in the light, while sulphur and phosphorus itself is assimilated and employed for the formation of the substances containing albumen, glum ten, and the .oils which contain sulphur t is evident from the above summary, that Professor Schulzelstheory of vegetable nutrition differs from any of the former ones, and, though probably approaching nearer to the hum us theory than its opposite, holds a sort of middle place. It is here given as part of the Progress of the science of agriculture in its comprehensive sense. Some experiments in vegetable physiology on the growth of certain plants by night or day, furnished to the Oekonomischeuneuigkeiten by F. W. Sang, present interesting facts on this science. His experiments were made with briony, pharcala, elders and flax, and resulted in the following conclusions: "the growth of these plants advanced uninterruptedly by day and night; but, (cid127ith the exception of the flax, the growth was more by day than by night. Further, the observations made on the briony the first day s ho wed that, with the increase of the heat of the sun, the growth of th outward portions of the plants felt off, and also in i disturbed and rainy weather. The former may probably be explained by the great evaporation of the leaves, b which the absorbent vessels could. only imperfectly execute their functions, while in moist, disturbed weather, at least with most plants, a cessation of evaporation takes place, and likewise the regular assimilation of carbonic acid is disturbed 236 X. a. Of Flax grows, on an average, more in the night than in the day, and more in troubled weather than in sunshine a proof that it requires for its success a moist atmosphere, and hence, also, succeeds so admirably in mountainous countries and on sea coasts. But it appears that, for a rapid success, a definite concentration of vapor, and, probably, also a certain degree of warmth for I neglected to observe this are absolutely necessary; for, in the whole summer of 1846, I found the increase by day and night of 3' to 1, and only on a single night had the flax increased about 3" 2; this particular night, therefore, it must have been acted on by particular agents. In leaved wood, the chief forester, Stephen Vein ar, likewise day and night observed a continued growth, and found a4averal increase by night one third less than by day The phenomena of vegetation is now occupying the attention of scientific men, both in this country and in Europe, to a greater extent than it has Over before done. Any inaccuracies in former views, resulting from the want of care in conducting experiments, have been corrected; while it is believed the great general principles remain, for the most part, unshaken, the experience of thousands of years are more and more strengthened in the details. Among the interesting facts relating to the growth of plants, we find some in the following extracts from the Memoir e of Mr. Quetelet on the climate of Belgium, &c: (see Bixios Journal d agriculture Asiatique et de Jardinage1. A considerable number of causes operate to produce a variation of the periodical phenomena of vegetation. The most active of all these, in our climate, is the temperature 2. It is estimated that the progress of vegetation is in proportion to the sum of the temperatures, or rather to the sum of the squares of the temperatures reckoned above the point of cong elation, taken from the instant when the plants awake from the wintry sleep' 3. The colds of winter, if they do not alter the constitution of the plant, and especially if the earth has been covered with snow, do not cause very sensible retard at ion in the ulterior development of plants. But it is necessary to have respect to the effects which they can produce, and especially to the state where the plant is found, when it begins its winter sleep a state which corresponds to a certain sum of the temperatures acquired. When we refer to the maturity of the harvests, and in general of plants which increase under the influence of the sun, we must consult the thermometer which is exposed to the same influence itself of that orb, and not the thermometer placed in the shade, as is commonly done 4. The temperatures of the night are not to be compared to those of the day as to their effect on vegetation. We must, also, necessarily have regard to the quantity of light which plants received. A more northern latitude of one degree produces nearly the same retard at ion that a height of 130 metres does, that is to say, a re, X. a. 237tardation which, in our climate, is equal to about four days. His result can be regarded only as a species of average of amounts of variations during the course of the whole year. The difference of latitude and elevation have scarcely any action except to cause differences of temperature< 6. The variations of temperature, other things being equal, are favorable to vegetation; and the same is the case of elevated plateaus where the radiation can in a greater or less degree be more active." 7. The ishnthesique lines or of simultaneous flowering do not preserve any parallel ism at different points of the year; thus the line which, over the globe, witnesses the flowering of the jasminethe same day, and that which passes ten days after by ano the series of places, tend to accomplish tie same phenomena. Now, the zone comprise between these two lines is not of the same breadth in all its extent as a zone comprised between two parallels would be, It is not even constant, that is to say, a month after, for example, the isanthesique lines will all have different forms; and places which have been retarded, in reference to others, may then be in advance. For example, the first symptoms of the waking of vegetation after winter, show themselves from twenty to thirty days earlier on the western and southern side of England than in Belgium, and nearly at the same time as in the north of I talk and south of France; but at the moment of flowering, that advance is lost, and the maturity of the fruits of those three countries are in advance of the first. The efflorescence and flowering take place in Belgium twenty days earlier than in Berlin, as Well as in all the north of Germany, or the south of Sweden, thirty days earlier than in the State of Newyork, and two months earlier than in Cap land. The efflorescence in Belgium takes place nearly at the same moment as in Parma, but the ripe king of fruits does not occur till fifty days after it has occurred in those last places 8. In fine, the fall of the leaves is a phenomenon which in our climate depends as much on the present actual temperatures a of those which have j receded. It is brought on 'generally by the first frosts f autumnBesites these, it is said: "tt the same time that these researches have been made in Belgium, a modest savants in Germany has made others very analogous, which, in our view, throw an entirely new light on the relations which belong to the principal phenomena of vegetation to the different atmospheric al conditions to which the plants are subjected. The observations of Doctor Writs ch seem to us too interesting not to be published, but we shall content ourselves, with here c iting the principal results. We borrow them from theAllgemeine Deutsche Aaturhistorische Zeitungi In the horizontal localities, says Dr. Writs ch, the number of plants which flourish at the same time is more considerable than in those lands of the same nature which incline towards any point of the horizon. In a good exposure to the sun and with the same nature of 238 E c. -doc. To, 59.soifTthe number of: plants flowering is three times more than in places poorly exposed or shaded9The number of plants blossoming, at the same period varies according to the exposure. This number diminishes from the point of exposure of the southeast, which is more favored in our climate, in the degree in which it turns more to the east and north, until it reaches the northeast, which is the point most unfavorable to flowering; but passing that point in the degree that the exposure returns to the southeast, and passes by the west and south, the number of flowering plants insensibly increases. The coloring of flowers is intimately connected with the alternations of the seasons, and the examination of these different phenomena it part not less interesting in the memoir of our observer n taking' says he, .in mass the resemble of the vegetables of our country, or in considering separately the groups of vegetables, th'e flowers of which present one and the same coloring, we see invariably the number of flowers increases from December to July. White flowers (always in central Europe) are the most numerous, in the whole period of the year when plants are seen to blossom; after these come the yellow, then the orange, the blue, the violet, the green, the orange) and lastly indigo flowers, which are at the same time the last to show themselves and the most rare. The law, according to which the increase of flowering takes place, shows itself to be closely connected with the mean temperature n the meantime, although in a general manner we cannot mistake the influence of the temperature on the flowering, and we see the latter increase or diminish in proportion as the temperature itself rises or falls, we cannot deny that from time to time are exhibited other anomalies which the change of temperature alone cannot explain; such, for example, is the rapid decrease of the number of flowering plants from the point of the last days of July to the end of the following month. From the month of January, for more precisely perhaps from the winter sol st ice, the period when all the flowers are white, even to the vernal equino x, the relative number of white flowers rapidly decreases; after that period the proportion of the same flowers gradually increases until the middle of May then diminishes anew, insensibly, even to when the frosts of winter arrest all kinds of vegetation. I five set aside (considering them as an a nomaly for the season the very small number of yellow flowers which appear in February and in March, we see that the proportion of flowers presenting that color increases continually from the first days of April to the end of June. From that period to the middle of the month of August it remains stationary; then it increases anew, and with a certain rapidity, until the arrival of frosts. The proportional number of red flowers gradually diminishes from February to the end of April, then it recovers the ascendingscSe till the end of August, then decreases till the month of October; it then recommences rising to that point, that in the x. a. 239 month of November, there exist, perhaps, no flowers but of this color* -the green or greenish flowers diminish in number, from the month of March to the end of May; from the point of the, latter period, their proportion is pretty nearly uniformly maintained till winter. The proportion of the blue flowers, on the contrary, increases to the middle of April, afterwards decreases till the summer sol st ice, then ascending anew, it returns to that which it had in the month of April, after which it sinks rapidly, and totally ceases on the arrival of the frosts. As for other colors, (the violet, the indigo, and the orange) their appearance is not made regularly enough to permit the author of these observations to fix upon the law to which they are subjected. In order to present at a single glance of the eye, as in a synopticaltable, the proportion of the flowers of each color to the different periods of the year, he has followed his memoir e with a chart, in which the colors are represented by curves, which rise or descend according as the relative number of flowers which they designate increases or diminishes. A remarkable fact, and one almost without exception, is, that each one of those lines rise at two points, and descend at two others; these are what the author calls the positive and negative poles. In the three columns, which in the table represent the months of spring, the lines approach each other much in a horizontal direction, in such a way, that the poles or maxim of elevation or depression all fall in spring and autumn. What is especially worthy of attention is the opposition (it cannot be more clearly expressed) towards the poles of the white and yellow lines; wherever the one rises, the other falls in the same proportion. The line of red flowers proceeds even to the month of June, almost parallel to that of the yellow flowers; when it has reached there, it diverges and continues to remove itself until the end of August, when it returns to cut the first, taking a direction opposite to that which it had hitherto followed; but what is curious, is that this red line, in all its course, remains constantly parallel to that of the green flowers. The curves indicating the blue and violet flowers proceed equally; those of the blue flowers and yellow flowers, on the contrary, constantly proceed inverse to each other, wherever they undergo deviations; the one descends always as the other rises, and vice versa. We might constitute, generally, the following law for the coloring of the entire German flora. In the spring and summer, the prevailing flowers are, first, the white, then the yellow, and finally the red; in autumn, on the contrary, they range, first, the yellow, then the white, and lastly the red- It is well understood, this law applies to species, not to individuals. Of t may yet happen that a group of plants having flowers of the t is well understood that here the author of the memoir speaks "only of cultivated plaits, not of wild plants, which by some accident are found to blossom out of their normal seasons; besides, there is no rule wit eut an exception 240 X. same coloring, and rich in species, blossoming all of them nearly at the same time, present on the son optical table less development than a similar group of a different color, comparatively poor in in species, but, in which, the flowering of each is effected at long intervals. The cool la of plants do not fade at the same hour of the day. M. Writs ch has also submitted observations with respect to this kind of phenomena According to him, the number of plants which open their corolladuring the night is very few, compared to that of plants which blossom during the day; he estimates it somewhat more than 12 per cent. of the entire amount of vegetables if i Germany. With flowers which open in the morning, the duration of the evening (by which the author: means the space of time during which the cool la fades) is short; for example, it is four hours for the prenanthes meal is; six hours for prenanthes vinisaca; five hours for let tube; tea for the field marie old. There is also a certain proportion, but feebly expressed, between the coloring of flowers and the moment when they fade; M. Writs ch, thus estimates them, taking 100 for the term of comparison Flowers opening Flowers opening in the morning, in the evening.

It would surprise the agriculturists of our country to see the extent to which such investigations are conducted in Germany. Volumes are written embracing the nicest calculations, and an acquaintance with the principles on which the tables are constructed is a part of a thorough agricultural education in that country. Among the exhibitions of science as applied to agriculture is the statics of agriculture. This is a branch of agriculture which is entirely unknown among us, and although there is not probably the same reason for its introduction as in those countries, some advantage might be obtained by the attention being turned to the principles on which it is established. By the statics of agriculture or land husbandry, is meant the reduction of the various valuation of soils, crops, and other things by which estimates of this kind x. a. 241 may be formed to mathematical precision, a sort of algebra in rotation by which calculations are made in reference to the particulars of agriculture. The productive ness of land is expressed, for instance, by some particular letter, p, and so on with other things. The soils being all classified, tables are formed based on the character of the soil, the product, the price, and weight of grain or other crop, so that the valuation of the land is reached. His forms the ground work on which taxation is laid, and men of the highest talents have entrusted to them the formation of these tables. The consequence is, that proceeding on these elements there must be an uniformity in the fixing of values and taxation resulting therefrom, very different from the ten thousand varying estimates of assessor and boards of taxation in our States. Something of these principles might be applied to our State governments to equalizetaxation over the State. The persons to whom are entrusted the construction of such tables, are, of course, those who are versed in the various branches of knowledge which have to be applied al. In the writings of authors on these topics, there is gathered a vast amount of practical information, for to prepare such f tables regard must be paid to all the elements which may influence the valuation of the different things specified. It cannot he imagined by any one, that agriculture can be reduced to all the precision of mathematical science, but a great number of problems may be solved by the use of a rotation which will shorten the processes of obtaining the results in a supposed case. The definite object of static may be considered to he to furnish the equation between the exhaustion of the soil by the agricultural products raised in it, and to ascertain and establish the supply by the addition of new materials of vegetable nutrition. The prominent writers on the subject are Gulf en, On Shun en, and Hlubek. Gulf en led the way by his publication, "method of estimating the Heat System2his work is a I mall volume in which the system is developed. I tubes is much larger and more perfect. Experiments were tried to test the new science, and the coincidence of some of the results was quite remarkable.

The agreement of the products is most striking, as there is only the difference of 0.16 cent. on 11 years averages. A discussion was carried on at the general meeting of agriculturists at Stettinbetween On Schlicht and Dr. Sprengel, the former defending static against the objections of the latter, but so far as the account is given, the question was left undecided. It is hardly probable, that statics can be of universal application, though they may answer for some particular crops on the same piece of land, and in average seasons. The formula of Gulf en employed by Vonschlicht as the basis of his opinions on the subject is t x r =a= c. By t is meant the activity, by r the richness, and c the crop in other words, the two factors, the activity and richness of the soil being multiplied, give the product. Everything, therefore, must depend on the manner in which the two factors are reckoned, and to reach this, all the various elements operating on the crop are brought into view. The system does not admit of explanation in its details in our limits. It was only intended to allude to it ar, evincing the investigations which have been undertaken, and the minuteness into which they enter on topics of agricultural science in Germany. Greater precision is desirable in the account of experiments undertaken in order to enable us more accurately to draw our conclusions. The importance of this is not sufficiently appreciated, and yet it is important enough to modify conclusions which are adopted as the basis of theories, sometimes involving the discarding of established principles of practice, and the adoption of others entirely new and untried. Such inconsistency and many needless disputes might no doubt be avoided, which result from causes like these, and the progress both of science and practice be very considerably aided by attention to this particular here advocated. We may illustrate our position by a brief reference to some well known examples or subjects. For instance, in the account given of the effects of different manures, in all trial experiments it is important not merely that the article mentioned be used, but that it be of the best quality of its kind, or if not so, that its variation from such standard be fully noted, and taken into the account in estimating the effect. Substances passing under the same name, and those sold in the shops, are often most diverse from each other by adult e ration or from other causes, so much so, indeed, that they can hardly be regarded as sufficiently similar to be compared or to allow of the transfer of results found to be secured from the one to the other. Suppose that mention is made of sulphate of soda, nitrate of potash, phosphates of lime, or any other in organic substance applied as a manure, it ought to be tested, and it should not only be known that it bears the name, but is in truth the very article it processes to be. When again, where this has been ascertained, and its strength and qualities duly noted, the mode of its application, whether in mass or in a dry state, or in solution, is likewise important. I to effect may be much modified by this method, far beyond what at first view might be conjectured. The state of the soicid127Ex. a. 243 likewise, when applied, whether dry or moist, recently or more distantly prepared, the time of te day, and whether in any of thee less: there existed any interval of time, and if amounting to a considerable portion of the day, at what hours of the day it was done in any case, may each receive notice. Some substances may be more efficacious at one point of time than another; just as it is known that such is the case with many re medial agents in their influence on the human organization as compared with each other. We would not advocate the precise following out of a previous mode without the slightest deviation, as in the case of the I indian who, because one man was cured by drinking at a particular fountain in a particular way, supposed it necessary for him also to approach it on a certain, side, kneel down in a particular manner, take up the water exactly as the other did, &c, or no cure would be effected. Greater precision, however, is of more importance than is supposed. In some of the appendixes will be found various tables of statistics, exhibiting the results of our agricultural products on the commercial intercourse and general national wealth of our country t is not deemed necessary to specify particulars, as the tables will speak for themselves, and in consequence of delay in obtaining some of the information, the portions of articles relating to various crops may .find a place there instead of separate appendixes, which would have been otherwise appropriated to them; several very interesting communications may be included in the appendixes now referred to. Among these may be mentioned, one on the ice trade, derived for a person who is extensively engaged in the preparation of this article for market; and which will be found to contain many facts that will be per to most of the readers of the report. A valuable table, of the prices of various agricultural products in the principal cities of the Union, will also be placed among these statistics. Unfortunately, we were not able to procure those for New Orleans for insertion in the same, as was intended But in respect to many of the tables which will be found in the appendixes, and -which have been prepared with great labor, it is believed there are some which will be acknowledged to be valuable, as well as wholly new. They exhibit only the beginning of what can be done; if the same course is pursued with more extended means, and show the vast extent of resources which a full survey of our various wealth as a nation would present. The progress which agriculture has made within ,the last ten years is great, and an equal or greater advance in the ten that are to come may be reasonably anticipated. Our last report so amply alluded to the grounds on which this expectation may be indulged, that it is not necessary to say more at present on this subject. A single point or two may be touched i upon as illustration of our, views. The vast extent of our country, its great diversity of soil and climate, open to us the position of domestic ating almost every r species of plant that is useful for food or for application to the arts 244 X. a. I increasing facilities of intercourse with foreign c limes which have been comparatively shut out from us; the spirit of enterprise which will prompt to the trial of acclimating new products: (of this, .at the present time, the experiment with respect to the tea plant is a decisive instance) the influx of emigration from Central Europe may be expected to increase, and with these, in some degree, will be introduced much practical knowledge of husbandry as conducted abroad. This must be modified in its adaptation to this country, and yet it will unquestionably exercise its influence. When no truth is more clear, that when once the way is opened to improvement, the beginning really made, the advance is rapid. Such is the case in our country as regards agricultural science. The beginning has been made; the door is open; many eager asp grants are pressing on to share in the rewards that a diligent attendance on these lessons will impart. The bare fact that our territory has been so extended, no doubt, is adapted to produce unusual enter prize. The spirit of the people is an almost restless activity Under this influence they are pouring forth to California, where the thirst for gold now impels them. For a time, this may divert the labors of the husband man. But the great spectacle of the worlds progress has just begun. Revolutions are but the work of a moment now, and mind, active mind, is at work forging out its instruments, which, like the fabled thunder bolts of Jupiter, wrought by Duncan, will yet fall with crushing force on whatever opposed the law of progress by which the world is to be renQvated. Agriculture is a more peaceful and silent cause in its operation, but the wrecks and ruins of the former world, covered with mould, under her skilful hand will be clothed with verdure, golden harvests, and plenty for man and beast. God has given us all the elements in. soil, climate, productions, and means of improvement, and we need only but be true to ourselves, and our advance in every peaceful and happy portion of national progress cannot but be rapid and glorious. Nations may feed from our stores, follow our example, and bless us as their true st benefactors. While the farmer holds the plough, the earth yields her increase, and knowledge is becoming more and more the birthright of all; every sister art will flourish and life be increasingly crowned with knowledge and comfort.

APPENDI X Of. 1. Report on the Read stuffs of the United States their relative value, and the injury which they sustain by transport, ware housing, 2ycBy Lewi S Of. Beck, M. D. Rutgers' College2njew Brunswick, Of. J., December 15, 1848. Of R: I beg leave to submit, in as concise a manner as possible, the results of my researches in regard to the bread stuffs of the United States since April last. The work has been prosecuted in accordance with the instructions which I have received from you and I hope its execution, thus far, will commend itself to your favor and to that of the public. Being impressed with its importance, I have spared no pains to prepare myself for the faithful discharge of the trust with which you have been pleased to honor me. I deem it proper to state distinctly that my constant aim has been to render this investigation useful. My object has been to show in the simplest manner, and with as few technical i ties as possible, how the value of the various bread stuffs may be determined, their injury guarded against, and their adult e rations detected. Whilst I am by no means insensible to the importance of accuracy, and yield a willing homage to those who are engaged in minute and careful ultimate analyzes, I supposed that the purpose which you had in view would be best accomplished by the employment of such processes as may be easily understood and even -repeated by all those who feel sufficient interest in the subject to read the description which I shall give of them. I concur entirely in the remarks made by a re viewer of the first report on coals suited to the British) steam navy, "that the neglect of government to aid science is due, in a great measure, to the mistaken views of scientific men. They have too often overlooked or disregarded those matters which have a practical tendency, which politicians alone consider of importance." "men engaged in maintaining the balance of power and regulating the complicated machinery of a great commercial and manufacturing commonwealth, however capacious their minds, cannot be expected to entertain the theoretical views of the philosopher, who sacrifices his knowledge of the world to his love of science thought it proper thus to announce the plan which has been adopted, in these researches, to render them n useful to the many, without attempting to make additions to the already accumulated stores of the few. As the people, through their representatives, have furnished, the means for carrying on this work, they are entitled to receive all the benefits which are to be derived from it 246 X. ice. 5 :5. I hate only to add that my attention, thus far, has been almost exclusively directed to wheat and wheat flour. I propose during the next year, should the work be continued, to extend the examination to such samples of these as may hereafter be received, and then to proceed to that of maize and maize meal, which have recently become such important articles of export. I have the honor to be your obedient servant, Slewi S. C. Beck. To the honorable Edmund Of Ukecommrissioner of Patents. Report. Agriculture, commerce, and the arts, constitute the .chief business of the industrious portions of our race, and it is to the physical peculiarities of a country that we are, chiefly to refer the predominance of one or other of these pursuits. Thus England, with her vast mineral wealth, and her dense population, must almost of necessity be a manufacturing nation; and, although she is also noted for her extended commerce, and her improved agriculture, the great attention which she has paid to the latter, may, perhaps, be fairly ascribed to those peculiar views concerning the interchange between nations which have heretofore prevailed. The rich and valuable mines of the central portions of the continent of Europe, and the numerous arts which can flourish only in their immediate vicinity, must ever give occupation to a large portion of their inhabitants. Comparatively few commercial advantages are enjoyed by them, and the produce of heir agriculture seldom rises above the amount which is necessary for the supply of their own immediate wants. In all these countries, therefore, the failure of a single crop is the cause of serious apprehension, and in some of them, as in Austria, although a large proportion of the population is engaged in agriculture, ti were is need of a yearly importation of bread stuffs. This has been ascribed to a defective mode of tillage, but I am inclined to believe that it arises in part at least, if not entirely, from n the high price of the land. It is the large returns which the farmer must export from the soil in order to meet the interest of the heavy investment which discourages hint in his efforts, and which at length has the effect of diminishing the amount of the agricultural products. All the appliances of science and art may be called into requisitions to increase, the yield of the soil, but every improvement of this kind only serves to increase the price of the land and the amount of rent which must be raised from it. When we look at the contrast which the. United Statespreset in this respect, we need not wonder, that while travellers speak 0 in raptures of the agriculture of France and Belgium, Germany and England, the famished population of some of thisecountrics has been fed by the surplus produce of a comparatively rude rode of tillage. During the year 1847, bread stuffs to the value of                          $43, 00000,Ex. a. 247 were exported from this country to Great Britain and I re land alone. The vast agricultural resources of the United States were then for the first time duly appreciated. Notwithstanding the quantity exported during the present year bears no proportion to that of the preceding one, there can be little doubt that our country is destined to be the granary of the world. We cannot boast of those mineral riches which are found elsewhere; still deposites of iron ore and coal, those most valuable products, exist here in great abundance. But our chief treasure is the soil, and the immense extent of our republic, and the liberal policy which has been pursued in regard to the disposition of its lands, places it in the power of almost every inhabitant to become the owner of a domain, which in Europe- could be possessed only by the favored few. It is a common mistake that land which is incid127the highest state of cultivation, and yields the largest crops, is necessarily the most valuable. It is stated by Boussingault, that a field in the neighborhood of Pampeluna, where the rent of land is extremely low, gave a profitable crop of wheat, although the yield was not more than from six and a half to seven And a half bushels per acre 14 An English farmer" says Washington in a letter addressed to Arthur Young, " must have a very indifferent opinion of our. soil when he hears that with us an acre produces no more than eight or ten bushels of. wheat, but he must not forget that in all countries where land is cheap and labor is dear, the people prefer cultivating much to cultivating well t is this very extent of our country, and the cheapness of the land y which now, as at the date of the letter of Washington, contribute to render our comparatively rude culture the most profitable in the world. Thus, while the average of the produce of wheat in the United States is not probably above 15 or 16 bushels to the acre, that in Germany is more than 25 bushels; in England, 25 or 26; and in France, 24. Still, as has been already stated, the amount of bread stuffs (cid127aised here, far exceeds that produced in either of the countries above named. And the same consideration, viz cheapness of land, together with the rapid and cheap rate at which, by machinery, the crop harvested and made ready for the miller, must give to the western States and Territories great advantages for the cultivation of the cereal grains there is no probability that, for many years to come, our population will be overcrowded, and the price of good cultivableland be much increased, it is easy to see what must become the leading occupation of the multitude who will here seek refuge from the poverty and oppression of other countries. The truth of this* Mr. Oreilly stated at one of the meetings of the New York State Agricultural Society, during the winter of 1844,-that the product of the wheat lands, between Seneca lake and the .niagara river, had not, for the preceding three or four years, exceeded the low average of eleven or twelve bushels per acre. The land in western New York generally bears a high price, and the problem to be solved is, whether by a more efficient system of agriculture the average yield can be so much increased as to afford a return for the investment. That, will be the result may be inferred from the well known fact that a large proportion of the wheat flour, with the " Teno see and Oswego" brands, is obtained from wheat grown i a the far western States248ex. proposition will probably be quite apparent to those whose attention has been directed to the subject. But a large number of our citizens have no just idea of the agricultural resources of the United States. One object of this report, therefore, is to spread out the facts, and to give them the widest publicity; to show, indeed, that while commerce and the arts must give employment to a great number of persons, our great business is agriculture; and that the true interests of the country will be promoted by giving to this pursuit all necessary encouragement. I have said that our mode of culture is still comparatively rude. It was quaintly remarked to a traveller by the gardener of Drummond castle, that "if science once gets into the farmers ground it penetrates into the very heart of a nation." This is perhaps true but it must be confessed that, thus far, the influence of science upon agriculture has been very trifling when compared with the vast improvements which it has effected in the arts. The difference- proceeds principally from two causes is signed by Count Chaptal: "the first is, that the greater part of the phenomena offered to us by agriculture, are the effects of the laws of vitality, which govern the functions of plants, and these laws are still in a great measure unknown to us; whilst in the arts which are exercised upon rude and in organic matter, all is regulated, all is produced, by the action either of physical laws only, or of simple affinity, which are known to us. The second cause is, that in order to apply the physical sciences to agriculture, it is necessary to study their operations profoundly, not only in the closet, but in the field." It will not, therefore, appear surprising that the researches which have been made in regard to plants have often assumed a wrong direction, and have not led to those important results which were promised upon the one side and expected upon the other. Thus most of the analyses of the proximal e principles of plants, not having been made upon such as are in a perfectly pure state, are to be considered only as approximations of the truth. The same remark will, in a great measure, apply to the numerous determinations of the quality and quantity of the ash obtained by the combustion of the grains used as bread stuffs. "The grain is an assembly age of various, distinct parts, differing from one another in composition, and varying also very much in their relative proportions. To also the dried stem of a plant, the entire straw of a cereal grass, may be burned in like manner. But this, too, is an assembly age of many parts. The exterior less vascular portion, the interior full of vessels, the fluids which circulated say "t perhaps" because in agriculture, as in all well conducted enterprises, everything depends upon a comparison of an estimate of the expenses with an estimate of the profits which accrue from them. Paradoxical as it may seem, it is nevertheless true, as stated by Chaptal, that a farmer may be ruined by a good harvest. When science, therefore suggests a lavish expenditure simply for the sake of injuring a large yield per acre, she does a positive injury. The end of those who follow at random all the innovations proposed, i invariably disastrous. X. a. 249 through them, all contain their peculiar in organic substances, and all vary almost endlessly in their relative proportion Similar objections might be urged against the analyse si of soils which have been so vigorously prosecuted by many chemists. That the facts which have thus accumulated may have some value, is not to be doubted; but they must after all be considered as onlyintroductory to researches conducted with a more just .appreciation of their true influence upon the improvement of agriculture. It is to be feared that in many cases these almost useless labors have been suggested by the crude and hasty generalizations, which, unfortunately within a. few years past, have too often usurped the place of patient inquiry. A recent writer has well observed, that of the classes which have been thus led away there has been none which has been so far his guided as the sober one of farmer. I tis to him that the vegetable 'quick appeals, offering, in the application of chemical manures, electricity, magnet ism, and other agents, harvests more golden than the world had ever seen before trust it will not be inferred from. any of the remarks which I have made, that I under value the importance of physical science in the improve rent of agriculture. In the contrary, I doubt not that with a right appreciation of its objects and a true direction of its labors, it is destined to contribute greatly to increasing the productive ness of the soil. But such results cannot be immediately realized. "years of experiment must pass by, numerous failures must be experienced, before the real advantages of scientific forming will be evident." It is sincerely to be hoped that the false expectations which have been from time to time held out by visionary men, may not have the effect of exciting in the minds of agriculturists a prejudice against all the improvements which may hereafter be proposed. The chief bread stuffs of the United States are wheat, rye, maize, and buckwheat. Of these, the first is by far the most important, and it is to its history, culture, and chemical examination, that particular attention is now to be directed. Wheatwheat is the principal bread stuff of the United States and of most European nations. This, as well as the other cereal grasses, has probably come to. us from the east; but it has been so much changed and improved by culture, that its connexion cannot be satisfactorily traced to any species of the genus now known to be growing wild. Of all the cereals, it is that which requires most heat, and its culture first begins to be of importance below- -a- -a- -gale above remarks are from Prof. J. F. W. johnstons advertisement to the English translation of Ulcers chemistry, part iii. Prof. Johnston has himself been largely engaged in the kind of researches which he now characterizes a indeed possessing some agricultural value, but which must be entirely dismissed by the exact physiology st. To set this matter in a still stronger light, he adds the following: "in amusing English chemist lately dried and burned an entire mouse; and, from the results of his combustion, drew grave results in regard to points which lie at the very confines of our existing knowledge. He might as well have put a whole man in his crucial e or his combustion tube, and reasonedajponthe nature of the ash, or the proportions of the gases he had collected 50 X. 60 north latitude in Europe, and considerably below that line on our continent. From the meteorological observations which have been made, we infer that a mean heat of at least 390 Fahrenheit is necessary for the growth of wheat, and that during three or four months. The mean summer heat must rise above 550 Fahrenheit. It does not, however, bear tropical heat well; in countries within the tropics it first occurs at attitudes which in climate correspond with the sub tropical and temperate zone sphere is a fact stated by the author just quoted which exhibits in a striking manner the advantages our country must possess for raising and transporting the produce of this important cereal. I tis, that although wheat is very productive and of excellent quality in Phil i and the republic of Rio de la Lata, and immense quantities are sent to Peru and even around Gape Worn to Rio Janeiro, yet North American flour is sold at the market of Valparaiso, and the bakers are obliged to buy it, as it is cheaper than the flour made in the country, because there are no roads in the interior, and wages are exceedingly high from want of sufficient hands. There are few parts of the United States in which wheat may not be raised. But the productive ness of the crop is influenced by various circumstances, as soil, climate, and expense of transport to the great commercial depots. These, and the more profitable cultivation of other articles, as tobacco, rice, cotton, and the sugar cane, have nearly fixed the southern limit of the wheat growing region of the United States in North Carolina t The particular districts, however, in which the culture of this cereal is most successfully prosecuted, are the western parts of New York and Pennsylvania, Ohio and the northwestern States and Territories. The rich and virgin soil of the western prairies seems to be peculiarly adapted to the growth of wheat; and the great lines of communication which are already established between these and the Atlantic cities afford every facility for the transport of the surplus produce. It has been already remarked that the profits of the culture of this cereal do not depend upon the yield per acre, but upon the cheapness of the land, And the economy practised in its management. The want of precise information upon these cardinal points renders the statements which have been made in regard to the productive ness of wheat in various parts of the world of little practical value. Thus when we are told by Been that in Russia the average produce of wheat is not more than five or six fold of the seed; that in Hungary and Croatia it is from eight to ten fold; and that in some parts of Mexico the produce in favorable years is from twenty-four to thirty-five fold, the information is of no use to the farmer, because the relative expenses of the culture and the value of the crop are not stated* Eyes Outlines of the Geography of Plants t Mr. J. B. Oneall, in an address before the Agricultural Society of South Carolina, estimates the value of the flour imported into that State at                                                  $260,000, of corn                                                                                                                                                                                   $150,000, of oats, peas, and hay,                             $585,000. E x. notwithstanding what has been said concerning the profitable culture of .wheat in large portions of the United States, and the, probability that the great west will hereafter furnish the principal supply for export, we should by no oceans overlook those causes which exert an influence upon the productive ness and quality of this grain. It has been ascertained without doubt that the real value of wheat and of the other cereals and bread stuffs, depends mainly upon the proportion of glum ten and albumen which theyuontaip, their starch, glucose and doctrine, or gum, not being considered nutrition. It appears also that wheat exceeds all the other cereals in the quantity of nutrition matter which it yields. Another advantage which it possesses is, that it furnishes also a greater quantity of flour; for fourteen pounds of wheat yield thirteen pounds of flour, while fourteen pounds of oats yield only eight pounds, and an equal quantity of barley but twelve pounds, That wheat is peculiarly sensible to the effects of soil and climate appears to be a well established fact. It is stated that even in different parts of England the crops and their produce are very various. The Civilian and southern wheat generally contains a larger proportion of glum ten than that from more northern countries. This, no doubt, arises from its more rapid growth, its harder and tougher grain, and its less proportion of moisture. Hence, also, it keeps better, and commands a higher price in market, especially when required for exportation. I have reason to believe, however, that the superiority of southern wheat has usually been overestimated, and that the proof almost always a deduced of its containing more glum ten than that from the north, viz: its employment in the manufacture of macaroni and vermicelli, is by no means conclusive tone of the most important points connected with the subject of wheat and wheat flour, is the proportion of water or moisture which they contain. We have the high authority of Boussingault for the statement that, in France, " it is undoubtedly in consequence of the large quantity of water which the northern wheats contain, that we meet with such indifferent success when we attempt to keep them for any length of time in our granaries. The wheat of Alsace, for example, frequently contains 16 to 20 per cent. of moisture, and I have ascertained by various experiments that it is almost impossible to keep it without change in vessels hermeticallysealed. To secure its keeping, the proportion of water must be re* Burnetts Outlines of Botany. I Accrdiing to th? analysis of Professor Johnston, the fine flour of the celebrated Amalfi, or macaroni wheat, rough at from I talk by Colonel Hamilton, contains, in 100 parts, 13.30 of water and 11.62 of protein compounds, (chiefly glum ten) This is not above the average of the proportion of glum ten contained even in our New York and western flours. Mr. Alter, in his " Letters from the Continent" describes the process for fabric ating macaroni, which is very simple, and adds: " It is my firm belief that if any spirited individual would commence its manufacture (in England) on an extensive scale, the I italian macaroni would soon cease to be an article of importation- (london Quarterly Journal of . Agriculture, vol. I I .p. 462.) I have no doubt that this manufacture might be successfully carried on in various parts of the United States, especially if some care was used in the selection of those kinds of il our which are known to be rich in gluten252Ex. induced to from 8 to 10 per cent, and this is nearly the quantity of, moisture contained in the hard and horny wheat of warm countries n five analyses of London flours by Mr. J. Mitchell j the proportion of water varies from 14.10 to 317.40 per centtjThe proportions of water in the above samples range much higher than those given in the analyses of various flour 4 performed byVauquelin, which are from 8 to 12 per cent. They are also higher than those in the United States flours, the range of moisture being in the samples which I have analysed from 12 to 14 per cent. This difference in the proportion of water, which seems to be an matter of so much consequence, is undoubtedly, in part, due to the difference in the climate of the region in which the wheat is grown. This, indeed, is so well understood to be true, that the amount of bread obtained from different kinds of wheat flour is referred to the same cause. Thus "it has been shown by a comparative experiment tried some years ago upon Scotch and English wheat of apparently equal quality, that a quarter of the latter, though yielding rather less flour, yet when made into bread gave 13 lbs. more than the former. This is accounted for by the greater strength of sunshine, under the climate of England, having an effect upon the grain when ripe king, which occasions the flour to absorb more water in the formation of dough From experiments which seem to be trustworthy, it appears that the Alabama and the southern wheat flours, generally, yield more bread than th'e northern or western. The gain in favor of the Alabama, as compared with the Cincinnati, is said to be 20 percent. It is also stated by one of the most extensive London bakers, that American flour will absorb 8 or 10 per cent. more of its own weight of water in manufacturing it into bread or biscuit than i the English wheat. The English wheat of the same variety with the American is invariably a larger and plumper merry. This is attributed to the longer time required for ripe king in that comparatively cooler and damper climate. The American, on the contrary, in ripe king under a hot sun, eva pirates a larger proportion of water, and leaves the marina in a more condensed state, and when exposed again to moisture in cooling, it absorbs the additional quantity above stated. This is and important fact of which the dealer and consumer should be fully aware. To apology is necessary for the details which will be presented concerning the effect of water or moisture upon this cereal, as it isa subject worthy of the most serious consideration. Although, as has been observed, the proportion of water in the wheat and wheat flour of the United States is generally less than in those of England, France, and the north of Europe, it is often in sufficient quantity to cause great losses, especially when shipped to tropical* Rural Economy t Treatise on the Calcification of Good, &et Penny Magazine, vol. 75. From an article in the For onto (canada) Herald. X. a. 253 countries. To early as the year 1814, attention was directed to this in a valuable series of papers published by Mr. On as Number t, of New Jerk' a large dealer in flour, and at one time a deputy inspector of that article. He states that since the revolution, the price of the New York wheat flour in the markets of Europe and the West I n dies had been gradually falling below that of Pennsylvania and Virginia. He asserts as the result of his own experiments, that the New York flour is equal to that obtained from wheat raised in any other State or country; and he attributes the deter i oration in the price of the former to carelessness on the part of those who are engaged in its preparation and shipment. Among the points which he enumerates are, a want of attention to the ventilation and proper drying of the grain before it is ground, the rapid and improper mode of grinding, re grinding the middlings, and mixing therewith the portion first ground- and also the still more objectionable practice, perhaps still followed, of mixing old and spoiled flour with newly ground wheat. It is stated that in Poland, where the ventilation and drying are continued for some time, wheat has been preserved sound and good for half a century; its age never does it injury, and such wheat is said to yield handsomer and better flour than that obtained from the grain, more recently harvested f In Dantzic, the preparation for keeping wheat continues for a year and sometimes longer; after this period it is often kept for seven years perfectly sound in the large granaries of that place, although surrounded by the sea. In regard to American wheat and wheat flour, it may be remarked that the proportion of water naturally existing in them is often increased by carelessness in harvesting the grain, and in its transport and storage. In one sample of I n diana wheat flour recently analyzed, which was sour and had but little more than one half the usual quantity of glum ten, the injury was probably caused by the hurried mode of packing, for the changes above noticed occurred before the opening of summer. Sometimes, however, our flour is spoiled by being stored in damp, warm, and ill ventilated warehouses. The books of one inspector of the city of New Work, shows, that in 1847 he inspected 218,679 barrels of sour and musty flour. He certified that in this amount he is of opinion that there* Transactions of the Society for the Promotion of Useful Arts in the State of New Work, vols. I Of. and I Of Mr. Number t objects to the mixing of the produce of the first and second grinding, and putting up the whole for superior flour. "to the eye" he says, " this mass appears very fine; but when mixed with water it is very deficient in elasticity, and on being worked with the hand, is similar to clay mixed with water." The mode of management here spoken of is no doubt resorted to from improper motives; but whatever may be the difficulties in working such a mixture, it so happens that it contains more nutrition matter than the fine flour alone. But of this, more hereafter$ It will be seen, however, that the flour from the samples of Poland wheat which I have analyzed, yielded comparatively small proportions of glum ten. All the samples were in excellent condition, and seemed to have sustained no injury by shipment. But from some experiments which I have made, I am induced to believe that wheat which has been long kept may suffer a diminution in the amount of glum ten without presenting any external evidence of the change which has taken place. Heat flour, when carefully managed in the mode hereafter to be described, retains its nutrition matter in a more stable form. Of this view is correct, it should have some influence in determining the best made of keeping bread stuffs for future use or for shipmentS254Ex. Dec. No. 59.was a loss sustained of                                                        $250,000.* . But as no flour that is known to be sour or bad is inspected, this statement gives a very imperfect idea of the loss incurred, even in that city. ,the total amount of loss for the whole United States arising from chemical changes in bread stuffs by internal moisture, has been estimated at from                          $3,000,000 to                            $5,000,000. Some remarks upon this subject, recently published t by Mr. Brondgnest, of Hamilton, Canada west, deserve to be here introduced. This gentleman has paid much attention to the preservation of food, both as a merchant and as president of the board of trade of Montreal and of Hamilton. He notices an article on the 'preservation of Good) in the January number of the Westminster, the author of which proposes the exclusion of air, by an air pump or otherwise, as a remedy for the injuries sustained by bread stuffs, and very justly observes that these extreme measures are wholly unnecessary, as arrangements perfectly feasible will answer the purpose. He admits the necessity of something being done, as the present system is wasteful, and contrary in many respects to common sense; the ware housing of grain is defective in every point of view. The common mode of shipping wheat or other gain in bulk, is the cause of injury with American grain, and I doubt not also with the European. The emptying of grain loose into barges not over dry t spray and moisture on the voyage to true shipping port; exposure to weather while being shipped, damp lining boards, damp vessels, damp during the voyage, and then again being exposed in a lighter and put away in a damp warehouse, or in a low situation on the bank of a river; all tend to the destruction even of the finest particles of grains remedies for all these injurious influences, Mr. Brondgeestproposes the shipment of grain in barrels like flour and the properkilndrying of such varieties as are known not to keep well. Thesouring of flour, either on the river or sea voyage, or after \ware housing, he adds, "can be perfectly prevented by the use of the kin, either to the flour, or the wheat prior to grinding; one third to one fifth of the wheat being highly dried makes the whole keep perfectly for years, and that third or fifth may be of the cheap spring grain, making much stronger and better flour; but which if not kill dried would sour the whole n the report of the Commissioner of Patents, dated March, 1844, there are some statements of interest in regard to kilndriedflour and meal. From these it appears that Ohio flour, after had* Observations on the Production, Manufacture, and Preservation of the Cereal Trains by J. R. Staffordf Westminster Review, for October, 1848.t A gentleman residing in the city of Albany, N. Y., informed me that during the past season he witnessed an operation which, if generally performed, will sufficiently account for all the losses sustained in the shipment of the cereal grains. Several persons were engaged in transferring wheat from a canal boat to a river barge; and, while this was going on, it was the business of one of them to sprinkle the grain quite freely with water, containing in solution a portion of common salt. As soon as one pail full was exhausted, another was prepared; and the effusion was continued until the work was completed. The addition of the salt to the water was a mere cover for a really fraudulent and most reprehensible operation. X. a. :55ing been subjected to the drying process, was kept in the southern and South American ports in good merchant able order, and in weather in which other flour not thus prepared invariably spoiled. The process of drying, here noticed, was conducted by the employment of hot air; and Mr. Will, who claims the invention states that 18 pounds of water are thus expelled from a barrel of flour. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the removal of a portion of the water which wheat flour and maize meal naturally contain his the easiest and best means of preserving them. But the drying process, simple as it may seem, requires to be carried on with great care. The passage of the grain or flour, however rapidly, over highly heated surfaces is apt to scotch, and thus give the man unpleasant flavor. From the rapid evolution of the moisture in the form of steam by the heat thus applied, unless proper ventilation be also* secured, further injury will probably j result. The steam again condensing into water upon the cooling of the flour, may accumulate in particular parts of the mass operated on, and thus, perhaps, render it at least equally as liable to injury as it would have been without tie employment of this process. Another fact which I have observed in those samples of wheat flour that have been exposed to a degree of heat high enough to expel all the water is, that the glum ten is less tough and, elastic a proof that its quality has been impaired. It is probable that the proportions of doctrine and glucose may thus also be increased at the expense of the starch. -under these circumstances, a subsequent exposure to moisture and a slight elevation of temperature, establishes the lactic acid ferment at ion, which, I suppose, is the chief cause of the pouring of flour. The advantages to be derived from artificial drying, are more fully attained by the invention patented by Mr. J. R. It afford in 1847,than by any other plan with which I am acquainted. It is based upon the process for drying organic bodies usually adopted in the laboratory. The grain or flour is brought into contact with a surface of metal heated by steam, and a due degree of ventilation, so important to the completion of the drying, is secured. As the heat is not raised above that of boiling water, there is no danger of injuring the quality, color, or flavor of the substances subjected to its action. The heat is, moreover, uniform, and the expense is said to be less than that of the mode of drying heretofore generally adopted. By Mr. It affords apparatus 16 or 17 pounds of water are expelled from each barrel of flour; this reduces the proportion of water to four or five per cent, an amount too small to be productive of injury. Absolute dryness cannot be easily attained except by a long exposure of the flour to the heat, and it is not required for its preservation; a reduction of the amount of water to the small per cent age just stated, has been found to be amply sufficient to secure this object. I cannot, in my opinion, render a more important service to dealers in bread stuffs, than to recommend strongly the employment of this or a similar- process of drying 256 X. a. After the power ventilation and drying of the grain has been effected, there is still another point deserving of some consideration. This is the absorptivepower of the different kinds of flour, which I have foul he by experiment to be subject to considerable variation. -the amount of moisture absorbed by the various samples which have been tried, after having been brought to a state of absolute dryness, ranges from 8 to 11.65 per cent. by an exposure to the air of a room, for from 18 to 24 hours. This difference in the hygroma tic character of flours, must, I think, have an influence upon their preservation, and will perhaps account for the fact, that with the same degree of carelessness and the same exposure, Ape kinds are more liable to spoil than others. The remedies for all the difficulties to be apprehended from this source, are the employment of tight barrels, and the avoidance of all unnecessary exposure of their contents to the air. Some remarks may be added more definitely ,to explain the various modes in which wheat flours especially, is injured by the presence of an undue proportion of water under the influence of a warm climate. The general result is a diminution in the quantity of glum ten, or such a change in its quality as renders it unfit to produce good pacification. It sometimes also favors the formation of s po rules of different kinds of mushrooms which are afterwards developed in the bread. Sum as states that the wheat of 1841, exhibited in 1842, during a very warm summer, this defect in a very great degree. When these mushrooms were developed, the temperature was much elevated, and the bread soon disappeared, leaving only a reddish and disgusting mass The number of s po rules was much diminished by the thorough washing of the infected grain, followed by prompt designation. By reducing the proportion of water, increasing the dose of salt, and finally by raising the temperature of the oven, the development was in a measure prevented few years since, I observed reddish spicules similar to those above noticed in a sample of New Jersey flour. The change took place in twenty-four hours after it had been made into a paste with water. In repeating the experiment, the same result followed. According to Sum as, moisture and heat which often cause such changes in the most important constituent of wheat flour, produce very little effect upon the starch which it contains. Although it is with some hesitation that I dissent from such high authority, the following facts appear to me to show that this idea is an incorrectoneStarch is known to be composed of particles which are insoluble in cold water, but when exposed to a heat of 180 F., the pellicle of the grain bursts, and the contents are liberated. In a state of solution, it is quickly converted into doctrine and glucose, or grape sugar, by the addition of a small quantity of diastaset I f* Sum as, Chime Appliqu6e aux Arts. ,t This is a peculiar nitrogenous principle which exists in the grain of the cereals after germination commences. X. 257 this mixture be kept in a warm place for a few days, it acquires anew property, viz: that of converting the glucose into lactic acid. This is de nominated the tactic acidfermentation; and, as I have before suggested, it is probably one of the causes of the pouring of flour when exposed to high summer heats in its ordinary moist condition. Hence it will be found that, while in sour flour the quantity of glum ten is usually diminished, or its quality injured, the proportions of glucose and doctrine are also, in many cases, increased at the expense of the starch a change which precedes the development of the lactic fluid. One of the best modes of determining the real value of wheat and other flours, is to examine the bread made from them. The process of pacification brings out all their defects, and as the researches upon bread stuffs are conducted chiefly with the view of ascertaining their suitable ness for the manufacture of bread, it affords a good standard of comparison for the various samples subjected to experiment. It should be remembered, however, that bread is sometimes adult era ted for the very purpose of enabling those who are engaged in its fabrication to use the poorer kinds of flour. Thus, Sum as states that in Belgium and the north of France, sulphate of copper (blue vitriol) has long been introduced into the manufacture of bread. By the employment of this salt, the bakers can use flour of middling and mixed quality; less labor is required in its preparation, the pacification is more speedy, and by its addition a larger quantity of water is taken up The use of alum in the fabrication of bread seems to have been practiced from a remote period. This, it is said, also secures to the baker the advantage of employing inferior kinds of wheat flour, and even of mixing with the marina of beans and peas, without apparently injuring the quality of the bread. The alkaline carbonates, the carbonate of magnetic, chalk, pipe clay, and plaster of Paris, have all been used, either to correct the aridity of damaged flour, to preserve the moisture, or to increase the weight and whiteness of the bread. But it need scarcely to be observed that all these substances, with perhaps the exception of small additions of the alkaline carbonates, must render 'he bread un wholesome. Fortunately, however, the presence of most of them can be quite easily detected. Other frauds which have been resorted to are more difficult of detection; but these are, happily, less pre judicial to health, although not always perfectly harmless. Among these may be mentioned the adult e ration of wheat flour with <a name="potato34"><mark>potato</mark></a> starch, the flour of leg luminous plants, buckwheat, rice, linseed, &c. Cares ka, in a recent paper, states that he has had occasion to examine several samples in which these frauds had been practiced, and he describes several processes by which their occurrence may be ascertainedtAccording to a statement made by a quartermaster in the United* Trait 6 de Chime Appliqude aux Arts, vol. Of   .a, p. 429.f Journal de Pharmaciequoted in the London Pharmaceutical Journal, for February, 1848, p. 394,-I -258 x. a. States army, one barrel of flour, or 196 pounds, when in dough, contains about 11 gallons, or 90 pounds of water, 2 gallons of least, and 3 pounds of salt; making a mass of 305 pounds, whichevaporates in kneading and baking about 40 pounds, leaving in bread about 265 pounds; the bread thus exceeding in weight the flour employed by about 33.50 per cent. Sum as informs us that 130 pounds of the common white bread of Paris are obtained from 100 pounds of flour. To this he adds, that the flour contains 17 per cent. of water, the produce being then equivalent to 150 pounds of bread from 100 pounds of flourcid127As the American wheat flour seldom contains more than 14 percent. of water, the statement of the quartermaster corresponds very nearly with that of the French chemists. The increase of weight in the bread over that of the flour, viz: 33.56 per cent ought to afford an ample regeneration for its manufacture. But it is not un frequently the case that larger demands are made by those who are engaged in this important branch of art. The deficiency in the weight of bread, and the extent of their position practiced in the sale of leaves at a certain price, can, in general, be very easily ascertained. For example, the proper weight of the shilling loaf (new York currency) may be determined by reducing the price of flour to shillings, and then dividing 196 by this amount. Thus, the price of flour being             $7 a barrel, (which is a sufficiently high average for even the best brands during the year past) the shilling loaf should weigh three and a half pounds. For, F '785 6; 196 563 .50 his will leave twenty leaves of the same weight, or                                               $2.50 as the profit on the manufacture. Although the whiteness of bread is considered as a mark of its goodness, it has been ascertained by Professor Johnston that fine flour contains a less proportion of nutrition matter than the whole meal. The correctness of this view has been confirmed during the present investigation; for, in two or three samples of wheat which   have analyzed, it was found that the amount of glum ten in the fine flour was less than in the flour passed through a coarser siege and containing a larger proportion of br an. These results, according to Professor Johnston, are to be accounted for on the supposition that the part of the grain which is most abundant in starch c rushes better and more easily under the mills tones than that which, being richest in glum ten, is probably also tougher, and less brittle. They are also consistent with the greater nourishment generally supposed to reside in household bread, made from the flour of the whole grain- But such is the controlling influence of custom, that it is perhaps in vain to attempt a change, even though its benefits may be clearly proved by the researches of science, and by an extensive experience* Boussingault gives the same proportions for the white bread of Paris. But he says, in the country, where the bread is less baked, 100 parts of flour give 140, 145 and 146 of breadiRural Economy p. 173.t High land Society Transactions, 1847; and Dinners Farmers' Library, vol I I I. pp 142 aid 143,Ex. 
259ANALYSES Of Wheat Flourbefore presenting the details of my analyses, it may not be amiss to offer a few explanations in regard to some researches of a similar kind, which have heretofore been made. The discrepancyes in the published results of various analyses arise principally, I apprehend, from the different processes which have been employed. The table published in Navys Agricultural Chemistry gives the proportions of glum ten or albumen in English Middlesex wheat at 1900 per cent; in Civilian wheat, 23.90 per cent; in Poland wheat, 20.00 per cent; and in North American wheat, 22.50. The mode pursued by this celebrated chemist has not, so far as 1 know, been published, but the amount of the nutrition principle is larger than that usually obtained, a circumstance which may perhaps be ascribed to its being imperfectly dried. Of n the table containing the results of Vauquelins analyses of wheat flours, the proportions of glum ten are generally much lower than those obtained by Navy. Thus, in common French flour, :thegluten is 10.96 per cent; flour of hard Odessa wheat, 14 53 percent; flour from the bakers of Paris, 10.20 per centBoussingault, adopting the plan of determining the amount ofazotized principles by immediate ultimate analysis, has obtained a larger per cent age of the nutrition principle than either of the above named chemists. Thus he states that the hard African wheat contains of glum ten and albumen, 26,50 per cent; Civilian wheat 2 430 per cent; Dantzic wheat, 22.70 per cent. He gives reasons which, to a certain extent, account for the larger quantity of agonized principles which he found in the samples of flour, and adds, "that the varieties of wheat, the flour of which was analyzed, were all grown in the rich soil of the garden, a circumstance which, asHermbstadt has shown, exerts the most powerful influence in increasing the quantity of glum ten in wheat tar. Robert D. Thomson has also published the results of several analysis of wheat flour. The proportion of the nutrition principle was deduced from the quantity of ammonia formed from theazote contained in the sample. According to this chemist, Canada flour contains 13.81 per cent. of the nutrition principle, (glutenand albumen) Lothman flour, 12.30 per cent; 'united States flour 1 137 per cent, and another sample of the same, 10.99 per cent to t is not easy to understand why Canadian flour should rank so much higher than that from the United States. The sample named Canadian flour in the -table may have been, in fact, brought from this side of the line, for it is stated that our wheat is carried to Canada, there ground into flour, and taken to England under Canadian duty.

Catharines, on the Well and canal, and sent to London under contract. Mr. Mitchell, in his analyses of various London flours, obtained the following proportions of glum ten, viz: in fine flour, No. 1, 9.50per cent; in No. 2, 11.40 per cent; in second flour, No. 1 8.50per cent; in No. 2, 7.70 per cent After mature consideration, I determined to adopt the mode of analysis which shortly consists in separating the glum ten by washing with cold water, and then subjecting the remaining constituents of the flour to other operations. I preferred this process, as being more easily executed, requiring less apparatus, and less skill and nice ty of manipulation, than are demanded in the ultimate analysis. "*I have little doubt, moreover, that, for the practical purposes of this investigation, it is equally, if not more, accurate for, with all the improvements which have been made in the method of determining the amount of nitrogen in organic substances, it is not yet free from difficulties. I may also add that the ultimate analysis fails to give us any information concerning the peculiar nature of the gluteal point which is, perhaps, of as much consequence in settling the real value of flour as the amount of that principle. The different steps of the analyses have, in all cases, been conducted with as much uniformity as possible; one important object being to furnish a table of results which should at least show the relative value of the different samples subjected to trial. All the samples from abroad were received in tin boxes or glass bottles carefully closed, so as to prevent the access of external air. Thus, whether damaged or not, they were probably in nearly the same condition when they came into my hands as they were when put up. In proceeding with the analysis, 100 grains of the flour were put into a small Berlin ware capsule, which had been previously counterpoised in a delicate balance. The capsule, with its contents, was then placed in a water bath drying oven, and subjected to a heat of about 2 120 Fahrenheit, for from three to six or seven hours, or until after rapid weighing there was found to be no further diminution of weight The proportion of water in the sample was thus determined by the weight required again to balance the capsule and its contents to weighed portion of the flour, usually 100 grains, was next carefully kneaded into a stiff paste or dough by the cautious addition of pure water, and the dough thus formed allowed to remain in the cup for a few minutes. A fine linen cloth was stretched over the top of a bolt org cloth si eve, and this again placed in a large Berlin ware dish. The dough was now washed on the hand over the si eve and cloth with a small stream of water, and gently Treatise on the Falsifications of Good, &c, pp. 46 and 47.t I have lately employed a small paper tray instead of the capsule. It is equally convenient, and the drying is more rapidly effected. X. 
 261 kneaded, from time to time, until all the starch y particles and thesoluble matters were removed. The tough glum ten was washed until the water ceased to become milky, and after being carefully pressed out by the fingers was subjected to the heat of a water bath until perfectly dry, an operation which sometimes occupied 10 or 12 hours. It was then weighed while warm and the amount noted. A sufficient quantity of water was now poured upon the linen cloth to carry down the starch, while any small particles of glum ten, washed off during the operation, were added to the mass. In those cases where the flour contained any considerable proportion of ran, the latter substance was found upon the linen cloth. The turbid washings were allowed to remain in the vessel until the whole of the starch was deposited. The supernatant liquor was then removed by a pipe the, the starch again washed, and the wash water removed as before. The starch was now dried, subjected to the heat of the water bath to expel all the water, and then quickly weighed. The clear liquor, removed from the starch, was elaborated at a boiling heat to near dryness, the completedessication being effected at a temperature of about 2 200 or 230 Fahrenheit. In some cases, a few flocks, probably albumen, were observed floating in the liquid during the evaporation, but the quantity was usually so small that I did not attempt to separate it. The residue m thus, obtained was principally a mixture of sweet and gumma matter, with small proportions of wood y fibre and saline substances. As I ascertained that the sugar was the variety calledglucose, or grape sugar, and the gum my constituent was supposed to be doctrine, I have placed all the results of the evaporation of the clear liquor under these two heads. I may remark, that the glum ten obtained by this process contains a small quantity of an oily matter, which I supposed to be about equal to that of the albumen in the clear solution separated from the starch. The proportions of glum ten given in the following analysis will, therefore, very nearly represent the amount of nutritivematters contained in the various samples. In most cases I carried out the analysis to the end, obtaining and weighing the several substances; but as the principal object was to determine the quantity and quality of glum ten, the process was occasionally stopped at this point. In a few other instances the proportions of glum ten, glucose and doctrine, were determined directly, while the quantity of starch was estimated by difference. For convenience of reference, the analysis are arranged under the head of the several States from whence the specimens were obtained: I regret that the number received from the south is so small, as I was very anxious to exhibit in one view the relative quantities of nutrition matter in the northern and southern flours. Should the investigation be continued, this point will claim my earliest attention.

Of R: Agreeably to your suggestion that I should collect during my stay in Louisiana, all such information as would be of interest to the sugar planters of the United States, I set out for that State in the middle of October, and arrived in New Orleans, at the beginning of the rolling season. I lost no time in accomplishing my object and visited several plantations, with a view of becoming acquainted with the mode of cultivating the cane, and the improvements for boiling sugar. But, as my investigations progressed, I found that there existed a great many conflicting views, in regard to cane culture, arising from the different kinds of soil, higher or lower locations, and the influence of climate. It was necessary, therefore, in order to arrive at correct statements, that I should visit other portions of the State, as for *instance, A you Lafourche, Red River, and all those parishes where the sugar is now and has been heretofore grown, and also those where the planters intend to raise the cane instead of cotton. To accomplish all this, the time allowed me was too short, and I came to the conclusion to transmit to you only a part of the collected facts and drawings and to continue my investigations, if so authorized, during another rolling season. It is a subject of too great importance to be slightly treated especially at this moment, when so many cotton planters within the region suitable for the culture of sugar cane, intend to quit the growing of cotton and plant the cane. The cane has been successfully cultivated for several years in the higher latitudes of Louisiana, and as the profits, arising therefrom, are greater than those from the cultivation of cotton, the production of sugar will necessarily increase in a few. years to such ar a extent, as not only to supply our home consumption, but leave a surplus for exportation. In that portion of the States of Louisiana and Mississippi, where the cane can be raised with advantage, nearly all the cotton plantations will be diverted to the cultivation of sugar. And as the cotton crop in that region amounts to 300,000bales, we can assume that the same force employed: for raising that quantity of cotton, will produce nearly 250 000 hogs heads of sugar. Thus doubling the present crop, without bringing into 0 the calculation the sugar which Texas, Alabama, Georgia, )1 ida, an rid the other sugar growing States of the No. will produce. It will the  s be seen that it will take only a few years to increase -e stir drop of the United States at least to three times the amount of what it x. a. 275 now is. All the facts emanating from a source like 'that of the United States Patent office, at a moment like the present, will be of incalculable importance. With regard to the collection of facts, having relation to the apparatus used in the boiling of sugar, I had less difficulty to contend with; although it is a subject of great moment to the planter, to enable him to produce a sugar which will bear a comparison with the best Savannah, in grain, purity, and whiteness, obtained cheap, with the least amount of fuel and labor. There is no exaggeration in saying, that there is no sugar growing country, where all the modern improvements have been more fairly tested and adopted than in Louisiana, and where such perfect boiling apparatus is used, fulfilling all the conditions that science and experience have pointed out as necessary for obtaining a pure and perfect crystal in sugar, combined with the utmost economy of fuel. The success of these improved modes is due to the enterprise and high intelligence of the Louisiana planters, who spare no expense to carry this important branch of agriculture and manufacture to its highest perfection. They have succeeded in making, strictly from the cane juice, sugar of absolute chemical purity, combining perfection of crystal and color. "his is, indeed, a proud triumph" says Professor Mcculloch, in his valuable report to Congress. "of n the whole range of the chemical arts, I am not aware of another instance where so perfect a result is in like manner immediately attained that was supposed impossible, has been accomplished by the Louisiana planter, notwithstanding the obstacles of the late maturity of the cane, early frosts, and other incidents occurring there, which casualties are unknown to the sugar planter of the tropical regions. But not only in the raising of cane and the manufacture of sugar does the Louisiana planter expel. He deserves also commendation for the manner in which he has embellish ed his country. His leisure hours are devoted to the beautifying of his estates, thus rendering the margin of the Missississippi a continuation of beautiful villages, surrounded by tropical plants and trees. I cannot describe the delight I felt when: I first entered the State of Louisiana. I to river, the creator of this! rich alluvial territory, after having tossed and rolled its mighty waters against the wild shores of the upper country, carrying away and building up, in un dating vast tracks and leaving everywhere traces of its destructive sway, begins at once to slacken its current and keep its turbid stream within the bounds of fertile banks, gliding majestically through highly cultivated plains covered with the graceful sugar cane, the uniformity of which is continually diversified by beautiful dwellings, gardens, and the towering chimneys of the sugar houses, she handsome fronts of which stand forth in the picturesque back ground of the forest, forming an ever changing scene, The traveller who floats in one of the gigantic palaces of the southwest, can from the high deck behold with delight the eaehenting scenery the whole day long, and look with regret om the sitting sun, which' gradually withdrawing behind the dark out lie 27 6 x. of the cy press forest, leaves this lovely country rep o sing under the dark mantle of night. Not less beautiful and well cultivated are the shores of the great ba you and tributaries crossing the State in all directions. I invariably met with that far famed hospitable welcome peculiarly characteristic of the southern gentleman and planter. I consider it my duty to mention, especially as such, Mr. Theodore Back wood, Mr. Benjamin, Mr. Mcmaster, and Colonelmaunsel White, senator from Plaquemine. At the plantation of this last gentleman I was seized with a violent fever. Owing to the kind attentions I received I was in a few days sufficiently restored to enable me to examine his beautiful estate, on which utility and taste are everywhere blended. His large and, in fact, splendid sugar house, placed in the midst of extensive cane fields, vies in neatness with any in the State. His superior draining machine, large canals, and innumerable ditches, deserve the highest praise as also his garden, adorned with a great variety of roses, all then in bloom, with sweet my rule, orange, plant ain, ole ander, aloe, and many other tropical shrubs and plants, as well as with live oak and other native forest trees, the inter mingling of which is novel and curious for those born in the north. This valuable plantation extends a considerable distance up and down the coast, enclosed by a neat fence, lined with the hardy sour orange, its golden fruit adding to its picturesque appearance. To these gentlemen and their families I shall always feel most highly indebted; and, indeed, to every gentleman I called on, since they all gave me, with most condescending kindness, every information I desired, favoring me with the perusal of their memorandum books, and extracts therefrom. The sources from which I drew my information were various, but I stand principally indebted to Mr. Theodore Back wood, ofScarsdale, to Mr. Benjamin, of Bellechasse, to Colonel White, Beer Range, Messrs. Organ, and Dickinson, and Urquhart. I found also a great deal of valuable matter in Professor Debows Commercial Review, a work of sterling merit, containing a rich source of information for those interested in the statistics of our extensive country. Mr. He Now most obligingly tendered me the free use of his office and library, and I have availed myself of his kind, disinterested, and occasional assistance. I have made copious quotations from the notices on sugar, furnished to him by the ablest planters. I feel myself excusable for having done so, as Mr. He Rows work is new and scarcely known among those who live at a distance from the Mississippi. I would strongly recommend every one interested in sugar growing, to per use the Commercial Review, in order to keep pace with the progress of the Louisiana planter, who seeks information not only in his own country, but also in the West I n dies and in Europe, the summer months being spent by him in journeying through these countries, and on his return in the fall he makes use of what he his acquired in his travels, attending to his business with a care x. a. 277 and interest that surprises even our active business men of the north. Such is the Louisiana planter, so far as I have had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with him. There remains still much to be done. But the desire of improvement is aroused, the proofs of successful endeavors attained by some, must have convinced the less energetic, and there is no doubt, in a short time, the progress in the culture and the manufacture of sugar, will be rapid and general throughout the State of Louisiana. A book which ought to be in the hands of every one engaged in the manufacture of sugar, is Professor Mccullohs able report in relation to the chemical nature of sac charing substances, and the art of manufacturing sugar, published by Congress in 1847. I t contains all the valuable improvements up to that period, that had been made in this branch of industry. I must grave some indulgence, as I had only a few weeks to visit the principal plantations, collect notes, and make drawings, but I hope that during another grinding season, I shall be able to complete a fuller report. Through the disinterested kindness of Professor Word a, from Prague, in Bohemia, well known through his works upon vegetable physiology, and his numerous microscopic analyses, whom I met in New Orleans, in his scientific tour through the Unitedstates, I am enabled to lay before you beautiful and almost invaluable drawings representing the cane as seen, highly magnified; with a description of its structure, both of which will be found in their proper places. Baron On Humboldt most earnestly recommends Professorcorda to the American nation in a general letter of introduction, a copy of which I here annex, to show the interest this eminent savants yet takes, in his advanced age, in the progress of science. I have also, with your permission, compiled from the records of the Patent Office, improvements patented in the manufacture of sugar, with illustrations. It is highly important that the planter should be acquainted with the various improvements made in this branch of industry, in order to avail himself of them when found useful. The publications of extracts from the scientific journals of England, France, and Germany, on this subject, in the official report of the Patent Office, would also be of great importance to the sugar growing interest, a branch of agriculture and industry which every year becomes more extensive, and in which many millions of dollars are invested.

A Dans Souciprts de Potsdam, Alexander Of Humboldt. A 10 October, 1848.[Translation.]NEW Orleans, December 21, 1848. My short stay in New Orleans, and :the entire want of bibliographic assistance, prevent me from fully meeting your flattering confidence in me, and furnishing you with a more perfect microscopic analysis of, the sugar cane. Accept, therefore, the following small sketch on the structure of this so highly important plant, which interests me exceedingly, having been myself occupied for many years with the investigation of the best mode of cultivating the be et root, and the manufacture of sugar therefrom. (see the transactions of the Bohemian Trade Society) I am really sorry that am not able to give that full satisfaction which you and I would have desired, I am respectfully yours, Corda. Charles L. Flei Schmann, Esqjv we Orleans. Analysis of the Sugar Lane. The s talks of graminaceae, or grass tribes, have only to distinct forms in their structure, .i: (a) such as have hollow s talks, in which the fibrous structure or wood y portion forms a more or less regular or irregular circle; (b) those in which the whole inside of the stalk is filled up with the fibrous structure, forming a compact mass or marrow. To this class belongs the sugar cane. The following phyotomic analysis is rather superficial, yet sufficiently explicit for this object. The stem, in all the various speech of the sugar cane, form six. a. 279 a more or less regular shaped cylinder, which is divided by nodes and internodes; forming, from the middle of the stem downwards to the root, and upwards to the terminal bud, several joints of various lengths; which are, however, in their anatomical structure, all alike even in the lowest part that reaches down in the ground, where the joints are shorter and provided with roots, which .branch out horizontally therefrom. (see figure 29 ache stem consists of three distinct parts. The nodes (figure 6, d to e) are formed by a terminal and side bud, having a projecting rim, with a slight spiral turn, forming a ring around the stem upon which the leaves expand. When the cane ri pens, the leaves drop off and exhibit a sharp edge projecting beyond the outside of the cane. Below this edge or ring the cane is covered from a quarter to one inch in length with a greyish waxy substance, called ce rose. Above the edge or ring are three or four rows of delicate points, placed between slightly curved ribs; these are the germinal points, and of great importance in the culture of the sugar cane, as on their perfection depends the reproduction of the cane. In the side of the last named points are situated the leaf buds or eyes, from which the young plant sprouts. These eyes are covered and protected during the period of the vegetation of the cane by the sheathing of the leaves. Each joint has a furrow, at the lower and deeper part of which the eye is placed. The internodes or joints form a more or less even cylinder, through the transparent surface of which can be seen the parallel layer of fibres. When such an internode is cut horizontally in two, and the surface of it examined with a magnifying glass, three distinct structures can be seen, viz: (figure 1) the bark, cortex, a d; the fibrous vascular tissue, f g h; and the marrow or cellular tissue, c c. When we examine the bark through a still higher power, we find that its structure is composed of four different formations, viz: first, of a transparent, exceedingly thin, external layer, of no particular organic structure see figure 5. Next to this is a row of thick sided (pachytychous) cells, b; next to this layer are three or four rows of larger thick sided cells, (bast z ellen) highly transparent, having in their sides a great number of pores. I immediately beneath that layer is a row of more or less oval shaped thin sided cells, (d) which contain a green or other colored matter, of a globular shape, which the natural ist calls chromula, and which constitute the color of the cane.  When we examine the exterior layer of the bark in a longitudinal section of cane, (figure 45) we observe that the pachytychouscells (figures 5 and 6) are of the shape of parallelograms. Figure 4. t, the thick sides, 8 s of which are provided with numerous pores. Between th'ese, we .find somewhat irregular of long hollow spaces or pores, r r, called s tomato, which form the organs by which theresa ration system of the outer surface is per for rise. Thiisis one of the most important acts in the functions of the vegetable i fr, because the plant, by means of thecid127cid127m, partly  absorbs from the door atmosphere the nee misery elements to the formatimmr f new. matter. The fourth i layer, constituting the bart as above -mcehtionedJ280Ex. figure 1, r 6 b, c, d) forms a perfect circle, and covers the whole entire surface of the cane, having only three different kinds of openings, the largest of them leading from the fibrous part or marrow to the sides of the germinal bud. The second and smaller openings give egress to the wood y fibres into the leaves, where they form the veins of the leaves. The third are the small openings on the interior surface of the sheathing of the leaf, through which the fibrous vascular bundles extend to the roots or germinal points. The whole interior of the cane, which is encircled by the bark, is filled up with two different kinds of structure, consisting of large cells of a delicate white tissue, (figures 1,.2 and 3, e, e, e which is called marrow. When examined in the horizontal section, we find another structure, consisting of small round bundles of tough vessels, extending over and through the whole marrow y substance. These vessels or wood y tissue are next to the bark not compact, as in the middle of the stem and distinguish themselves in their structure from all other vessels in the sugar cane. Each bundle consists of three different organs: 1st. Respiration vessels; 2d. Cap vessels; 3d. Fibrous or bast z ellen. The first two organs are perfectly surrounded and protected by the latter. They originate under the surface of the inside of the leaf sheathing, on the root part of the stem, from one of the little root buds, and run upwards through a number of internodes, and tend gradually toward the centre of the stem, until they have reached the centre, where they run in slightly curved arcs upwards and outwards again to the sheathing, and then in a spiral line to the surface of the leaves, forming the leaf nerves, and by several series of such structure constituting the leaf. When we examine the fibrous tissue of a longitudinal section of a well macerated or rotten cane, from which the bark has been carefully removed, it will be seen that it forms a completely interwoven network, which covers the whole stem in more or less parallel layers he proceed now to the anatomical examination. When we examine a bundle of these wood y fibres in its fullest development, (figure, section 2,) we find them, when looked at in a horizontal section, f a somewhat oval shape, the exterior layer of which is formed of wood y or fibrous cells. Within are the organs of respiration, "with large openings, g, A, and immediately over them are the sap vessels, i. But when we look at a bundle from the middle of the stem, (figure 2,) we find the same organs, in the same position, but with fibrous cells of less development. The fibrous cells (figure 2,m, n) surround the whole bundle, and have several layers of a thick cellular tissue, which appear in the longitudinal section figure 3, m, n) as elongated cells, the sides of which are provided with very delicate pores; in the centre of these fibrous cells are two large tubes, (figures 2, and 3, h, h) of cylindrical shape, the sides of which contain several of the spiral shaped pores, (figure 3, n Between both of these large vessels are three or four smaller ones, (figure 2, i, i, i, i) the sides of which are either porous, or consist of a single spiral thread, (figure 3, i, k) Those which x. 281 have porous sides have, in their openings, (lumen) very often, rings (figure 3, p, p) which serve to support the flabby sides, that bend between the rings a little inward, (see figure 3, q) which shows that the vessels or fibrous bundles of the cane are built exactly as in the whole group of mo no cotyledons. The marrow, (figures 1, 2, 3, e, e, e) which fills up all the space between the bark and fibrous bundle, consists of large transparent tissue, the single cells of which are of a dodecahedral shape, and consequently always appear in the transverse section hexagonal. Each cell consists of two different bodies, viz: (a) the cy to blast, or cell nut, from which each separate cell obtains its origin. His is a spherical global e, (figure 3, o, o) which appears, generally, attached to one of the sides of a cell, and is perfectly transparent. It contains in its middle a still smaller transparent global e, which is the proper cell nut, and dissolves more or less when the plant reaches its proper development, or maturity, (b) The cells (figures 3, 4, c, e) are formed of very transparent layers, which are perforated by a great number of very minute pores. Each more of one cell corresponds with that of an adjacent cell. Through these pores the exostoses* and endo moses of the cell juice from one cell to another, takes place, and fills the whole cane. It is this juice which contains the sugar in solution, with a mixture of salts, albumen, glum ten, &c. A perfect analysis of the sugar cane by the hands of an able chemist, made under the direction of naturalists would lead to important results. Culti  Vati  Of, &c, Of Sugar Cane. Varieties of cane cultivated in Louisianathe planters of Louisiana cultivate five different kinds of cane; the Bourbon, the green ribbon, the red ribbon, the Otaheite, and the Are ole cane. The Bourbon cane, as represented in fig. 6, is very extensively cultivated. I found it almost the only kind of cane raised on some plantations; it has a good coating of s iliac, which forms a strong protection against the cold; the dark purple color of its cortex increases the absorption of light, and accelerates its maturity. It is thought a hardy cane, rat towns well, and yields good sugar; it has large eyes, (see figs. 7 and 8,) which resemble those of the red ribbon, and somewhat the eye of the Are ole, (see figs. 13 and 19,)and with stands the influence of a slight frost. I was told by a planter that, when red ribbon cane is planted in new rich land, it loses its stripes and becomes altogether purple; but that, when the same cane is planted in old dry land, the ribbon appears again. Others think that, when the eyes of the red ribbon cane are situated upon the purple st ripe, the cane produced from such eyes is an entirely purple cane. The leaves, and the whole appearance of the plant, resembles that of the red ribbon represented in fig. 22.*ExosMosE.-That force which causes a viscid fluid lying on the outside of an organic membrane to attract watery fluid through it Elements of Botany, 4 c, John Lindleyt Endomosethat force which causes a viscid fluid lying within a cavity to attract to itself a watery fluid through an organic membrane bid282Ex. a. The green ribbon (fig. 9) is undoubtedly a different species of cane, not only from its light yellow color and delicate green stripes whence its name is derived but also from the difference of shape and formation of the eye, (see figs. 10 and 11,) which is small, elongated, and delicate in its structure, resembling that oftheOtaheite, (see figs. 16 and 17.) Lee cortex is less strong than that of the Bourbon, it yields well, but is much more easily affected by frost than the former. Next to the Bourbon, the red ribbon (fig. 12) is the most extensively cultivated in Louisiana. It is a beautiful cane, and its purple stripes vary from one inch to a line in width. Like the Bourbon, it has a strong coating of s iliac, which makes it more hardy and capable of resisting slight frost. I to eyes (see figs 13 and 14) are in shape and size like those of the Bourbon2and are less affected by the in clemency of the weather than the green ribbon, Otaheite, or Are ole cane. It rat towns well, yields well, and the juice from the ripe cane is rich sugar. The Otaheite cane (see fig. 15) has large joints, but grows less high, and its cortex is less thick, than in the former species; its eyes (figs. 16 and 17) are of a very delicate structure; this cane does not rat to on well, which must be ascribed to its delicate eyes. It is easily affected by the frost, in consequence of which very little of this kind of cane is cultivated, although its juice is rich and yields very abundantly. Thecreole cane (fig. 18) has, in former years, been very extensively cultivated in Louisiana; but the Bourbon and red ribbon, from their hardy nature, have nearly every where superseded it. It is only planted in small patches for eating; and in the neighborhood of the city of New Orleans, it is raised for the markets. I to cortex is e itly crushed, and yields a very rich and delicious juice, from which a superior kind of sugar is produced. I to eyes (figs. 19 and 20) are rather small, but still of a larger size than those of the green ribbon or Otaheite, and resemble somewhat those of the Bourbon and red ribbon. I have been informed that, in the parish of Plaquemines, the planters begin to cultivate it again more extensively. I have seen there, on Mr. Organs plantation, who always cultivated it, considerably large fields planted in that cane. This cane grows short, its leaves are straight, (see fig. 23,) and do not droop like those of the Bourbon or red ribbon. The joints of this cane, like that of the Otaheite, are often covered with a black matter, which comes off when rubbed, and appears to be a kind of fungus. Among the Bourbon and red ribbon cane, there grows sometimes a large cane of whitish color, with very large joints, containing a great deal of juice, but of a disagreeable taste. This is a diseased cane, caused by long wet spells; its whole appearance is coarse and unnatural, something like the diseased limb of a man. Colonel White planted that cane in his garden, and remarks, in his memorandum, kindly extended to me, " I also took the white, sickly looking ease, frequently found among the purple and red x. 283 ribbon, the bark of which is softer, and the cane itself more juice. It grew well and large, and, from having air and sun p produced a yellowish, slightly purple, looking cane, which I continued to plant until I got about five acres. I then abandoned it as worthless have been told of different varieties of cane produced, by planting ribbon and Otaheite cane in the same field; but, as the cane never flowers how could it be possible to produce a differentvarietyThe length of the ripe joints vary; those of the Bourbon and red ribbon have joints varying from four to nine inches in length. The cane cut for grinding measures from three to five feet in length. I saw some over eight feet high, and with from twenty-four to twenty-eight good joints; but they are a rare instance. The eyes are situated above the joints, and alternate in a straight line on each side of the cane. The knots, or ring, of the joints are of a light yellow color, and have two or three rows of minute points, from which the roots project; below the joint the cane is surrounded with a ring of greyish substance, which Mr. Avequinanalysed, and found it to be a substance similar to wax, and called it, from this resemblance, ce rose. This film of wax like substance covers the whole length of the joint. I observed it to be abundant on the Bourbon and ribbon cane. Mr. Avequin states, that cane which is much covered with this kind of wax yields little sugar, while those species of cane which have little of that waxy coating are richer in sugar. Mr. Avequin presented me with two specimens of the ce rose. It is a substance, in appearance and touch, very much like wax of a dirty greenish color, exceedingly brittle, requires a higher degree of temperature to melt it than s term, tallow, or bees wax, and 'hen melted together with them, it separates from them in cooling. Mr. Avequin showed me some cane arrows which he had brought with him from the West I n dies; they were cut from the last joint of the cane and measured from five to seven feet in length, the cane itself being about six to eight feet high. The spike is about one and a half foot long, bearing very small delicate grains; the plumes are provided with a fine silk like plume, to facilitate the winds to carry the <a name="seeds16"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of this useful plant great distances, showing that nature has intended it should prop agate from the seed still there exist a great diversity of opinion with regard to the power of reproduction through the <a name="seeds17"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of cane.

Gray remarks in his work, The Practical Sugar Planter" page 30. "is I have often been applied to on the subject, and have instituted many inquiries and experiments, in order to satisfy myself and others, I take this opportunity of stating what I have ascertained on the point First. That no variety of sugar cane is known to perfect its seed or indeed, to produce anything like seed) either in I india, China, the Straits of Malacia, Egypt, or even in the South Tea I s lands ; as in all those countries the cane is entirely propagated by cuttings." Second. I have, myself, tried numerous methods, which I imagined might, by some possibility, cause the plant to perfect seed. That many of these were fanciful, and perhaps, far fetched, I have no hesitation in owning: under these circumstances, there is no need to make them public, or weary the reader with a long detail Time of planting The planting time of the cane in Louisiana, is in the fall, and immediately after the grinding is over. New planters commence planting as early as October, but few have time to begin planting before or during the grinding season. They are fully occupied at that period, laying up their seed cane, and in making all the necessary preparations for grinding and boiling. Lane planted in the fall, gives generally a fine crop, but it requires well drained fields, for if the ground be wet and the weather mild, the cane will rot; furthermore, it must be well covered with earth, at least to the height of four to six inches, to protect it from the frost, in case of a severe winter. Lane well planted in dry land, comes up early in the commencement of the warm season, and out grows cane planted early in the spring; for this has to contend against wet or dry weather. Distance of planting cane There exists a great difference of opinion among the Louisiana planters, with regard to the distance that cane should be planted apart. Any still adhere to the old mode of planting, that is, in rows from three to five feet, while others plant it, with great advantage, eight feet apart, or at such distance, that the carts and cattle s twaddle the rows in carting cane from the field, without injury to the rat to on. As in Louisiana, the cane must reach its full growth in nine months, the planter carefully endeavors to expose it as much as possible to the influence of the sun and free circulation of the heated air. I have seen cane planted at eight feet, which was so luxuriant in its growth, that the rays of the sun could scarcely penetrate, although it was a field planted with cane for twenty successive years, and had only the year previous a crop of I indian corn and peas on it; that one years rest, wide planting, and proper culture, gave it such a vigorous growth, as I never saw in any agricultural produce. I made a sketch of it, as seen in fig. 29, to give those who never Saw a cane field, an idea of the luxuriant growth of this beautiful and graceful plant, X. 285 think some of the Louisiana planters look too much to the number of acres planted in cane, and not enough to a more perfect culture, whereby they would increase the size of the cane, and improve the quality and add to the quantity of the sugar. Need cane The Louisiana planters use generally for cane seed, the river part of the stalk. Some cut the cane in the middle to use the tops for planting, and bring the lower joints to the mill, some again, use the green tops alone for planting. It is with cane as with all other plants, imperfect seed produces a poor plant and bad fruit. The planter cannot expect that seed cane, with delicate imperfect eyes, short thin joints, will produce a cane like-one of vigorous growth, with perfectly well developed eyes and a great deal of juice which supports the young shoot, until its roots are strong enough to obtain nourishment from the soil. The young sprout from poor cane is less able to support the in clemency of the climate and is more liable to disease. In the West I n dies, we are told, the few upper joints of the plant nearest the leaves, commonly designated as the "cane tops are used for cane seed. In the West I n dies, where the cane arrives to perfect maturity, where every joint is ripe, and every eye well developed, the top joints may answer, but in Louisiana, where the cane is never entirely matured, where it must be cut before the upper joints are formed, the tops are not fit for seed, and the result must necessarily be a bad one. All the planting of cane that I have seen, was done with cane from five to twelve joints or more in length. Some planters select for seed the oldest or poorest rat to on cane this cane is of small growth, has a few short joints, and bad eyes, and appears almost to be a different species of cane from the plant cane which has been raised upon well prepared and thorough drained soil, or after I indian corn or peas. These planters save all their fine cane for the mill, and forget that by this kind of economy they reduce their crop for the following year, and that it will affect the sugar, both in quantity and quality cannot believe, g" says the writer of that able article on sugar, in He Rows Review, "that this practice of always selecting the poorest plant cane for seed, was one of the main reasons which caused that fine variety of cane called are ole, to degenerate to such an extent, that in late years it has been almost entirely banished from our fields rode of planting Previous to planting, the land is ploughed, well harrowed, and the rows marked with a two horse plough, after which the double moulded plough follows, which opens a clear furrow ready for planting. In this furrow three canes are laid straight, in rows four inches apart, (see fig. 26.) Of we examine the drawing of the various species of cane, we shall observe that near every joint is an eye which is always opposite to the eye of the next joint above or* See He Rows Review, Vol. I I .a, p. 324.286Ex Doc. 0 59.below, so that in every cane there are two rows of- yes in regular order and in a straight line. It is, therefore, very important in planting to lay the cane in such manner in the furrow as represented in figure 27, that both rows of eyes be free to grow their young shoots at the same time. This mode of planting cane requires attention and much labor, because the cane must be re fixed sometimes with earth to keep it in its proper position, to prevent its turning when the earth is thrown upon it, and few planters have hands enough to spare them for extra labor, just at that time. In case the cane is thrown promiscuously in the furrow, and some of the cuttings have to lay with one row of eyes facing the ground, as represented in figure 28,the young shoots will have to twist and force their way up to the light, and their growth is necessarily retarded and unequal. The cane, when thus laid in straight lines, three thick, two joints of the top, and two of the butt always brought together and overlapping, must be carefully covered with the he; the depth of the earth thrown over it varies according to the season; in the fall, as mentioned above, it requires from four to six inches, according to a more southern or northern latitude of the sugar region. -For cane planted in the spring, two inches of well pulverized soil is sufficient, in order to hasten the development of the shoots, and accelerate the growth of the cane, that it may reach its maturity before the cold season sets in. In the tropical region the planter has nothing to fear from frost, and he gives his cane as much time a sit naturally requires to come to maturity. The Louisiana planter labors under great disadvantage in this respect, and his principal aim must be to obtain fine large canes in as short a period as possible; and this depends not only on early planting, but also on a careful preparation of the soil, good seed cane, and proper cultivation during its vegetation. In Of anureThe Mississippi valley, and especially the lower portion, which embraces the State of Louisiana, has been the depositors of enormous beds of fertile soil since time immemorial, composed of the minutest particles of organic and in organic matter, brought together down from the source of that father of rivers, rolling its muddy waters over various rocky beds, washing the extensive limestone, coal and chalk formations in its current southward, mixing with it in its course vegetable as well as animal matter, and adding thereto the- deposites of its numerous tributaries, which have their sources among the primitive masses. The rapid current rolls on for thousands of miles, and deposites gradually its more bulky and heavy particles as it winds its way down to the lower portion of that valley, where its bed becomes deep and its current more gentle, forming on either side of its channel the inexhaustible treasures it holds in suspension. Although the formation be the same, yet the soil differs in its nature, even on the same plantation. Generally speaking, we find the soil near the banks of the river of a more sandy character; it is there more elevated, and slopes gradually as it recedes from the x. 287 river to wet flats covered with cy press, magnolia, palmer to, and the slender cane or grass, for mine vast prairies. Between these marshy flats and the river the land is in general cultivated and planted in sugar cane. Formerly, and previous to the shores of the Mississippi being cultivated, the river overflowed every year at several times its banks, the water spreading over those immense flats, and depositing nearer the bank the heavier sandy particles, and gradually as ri reached the more level portion strewed on it inexhaustible layers of fertile soil. When, where the water could not entirely drain off after the river had subsided again, the rank prairie grass, the moss clad cy press, and many fingered palmer to, vegetated, delayed, and thus for centuries accumulated their vegetable remains, on which a most vigorous vegetation continues yet, yearly, to add a fresh supply of vegetable matter. The planters protect their land against this foundation by an embankment, which varies in height and width according as the river is wont to rise at certain places; these levees, as they are called, are thrown up on both sides of the river, and answer well the purpose of keeping the water within its channel. Sometimes the river carries away a portion of land on one side and takes it to some other place; when this happens the levee must be renewed. However, some plantations are entirely free from that danger, and a little attention to the repairs of the levees is all that is required to keep this majestic stream within its bed. The soil along the Mississippi is sandy; after that comes a stiff, tenacious, dark soil, highly fertile, but difficult to work, on account of its rete native powers; then begins the vegetable mould, bedded upon turf or quick sand the deposites vary, and few plantations are alike in that respect. The elevated portion of those bottoms along. the banks of the river has been under cultivation for a series of years, and gradually, as the culture of the sugar cane is extended, the forests recede from the shores to make room for the cane; more especially since large canals, ditches, and efficacious draining machines have freed the lower ground of the stagnant water, leading them to la goods orbayous, which empty their surplus into the gulf of Mexico. It would surprise many a northern farmer to see the quantity of ditches, the lengths and widths of canals, which the planters are obliged to dig and keep in repair. They would be astonished to see the well built scoop wheels worked by powerful steam engines. Were these canals joined together, they would well deserve the name of a great national work of internal improvement. And the planters of Louisiana have undertaken that work without any assistance from the State. When we examine the banks of the Mississippi river, and see one and the same kind of alluvial deposites to an enormous depth, or when we look at the black, rich soil thrown out from the ditches and canals which cross the plantations in all directions, and which is of the same nature as the soil upon which a luxuriant crop of cane th rives, we must acknowledge that the Louisiana planter is right 88 Ex
in saying: "our lands are inexhaustible; they require no manure we have only to plough deeper to bring up a new supply of virgin soil, and we can raise for years to come heavy crops of cane met, nevertheless, the planters find it a very great improvement to plough in the tops and other trash gathered from the cane; they find it even necessary to put their cane land now and then in I indian corn and peas, to be turned under with the plough, as they have discovered that cane planted without intermission in the same fields yields badly, and that after this kind of vegetable manure, the cane succeeds better, yields more, and gives sugar of a superior quality. The writer of the already quoted article, in He Rows Review, Mr. Benjamin, says: "when the cane is cut in the fall, a large portion of the produce of the soil remains on the field, as is well known, in the tops and leaves of the cane, the ripe portion alone of the stalk being conveyed to the mill. This is called the trash, and is placed on the stubble to assist in protecting from the frost that part of the cane which remains under ground, and from which the rattoonsshoot up the ensuing season. As soon in the spring as danger of frost is no longer apprehended, the trash is raked off the rows of stubble to allow access to the sun and air; and on nearly all plantations this trash, which is a useful and fe utilizing manure, is burnt up, instead of being returned to the earth. One cause of the difficulty of making use of this trash as manure, was the narrow ness of the space between the rows under the old system of planting, which left so little room as to make the operation of sloughing in the trash difficult and laborious; but where the rows are eight feet apart, the task is easy. I independently of the considerations to which I shall presently avert, and which derive their force from the chemical constitution of the cane, it is difficult for a person who has not witnessed the results to form an adequate idea of the improvement to a soil that is naturally at all stiff or clay by, from the mere mechanical subdivision of its particles attendant on the decay of the large quantity of this trash left annually in the fields. This system was first put into operation last year on the plantation of which I am part owner. The trash on the first sloughing of the rat towns was covered with the earth turned over from the furrow, which is run alongside of the stubble. At the second sloughing, when it became necessary to turn up the entire space between the rows, the difference in the soil was so perceptible as to create strife amongst the negroes for the preference of sloughing these rows, the subdivision of the soil caused by the decay of the trash rendering the work much lighter and easier than in others, where, from causes not worth detailing, we had been compelled to burn this trash. The advantages of this system are such, that in lands which have been thus treated for a term often years without repose, I have been assured that the soil, far from deteriorateing, is perceptibly improved in each successive year. The space between the rows not only reposes for three years, but is enriched by an annual in cement of the best manure, X. 289 and when it becomes necessary to re plant, the cane is planted in the spaces thus fertilizes, and the former rows then become intervening spaces to receive in their turn the benefits of this rich nutriment for the soil. I referred in support of the advantages derived from the plan of sloughing in the trash, to the chemical constitution of the cane, as established by organic analysis. Although I am satisfied, from reasons which I will !give when I come to treat of the manufacture of sugar, that no accurate or satisfactory analysis of the sugar cane has yet been made, or at least: published, still the errors are not such as to affect the results in relation to cultivation. Sugar cane is composed of water, wood y fibre, and so ruble matter or sugar. In round numbers, it may be stated that the proportions are 72 per cent. of water, 10 per cent. of wood y fibre, and 13 percent. of sugar. But sugar itself is shown by organic analysis to consist entirely, of carbon and water, and wood y fibre consists principally of the same elements combined with in organic bases, so that the oxygen and hydrogen found in the sugar cane in the state of water, or as constituent elements of the sugar, and wood y, fibre, form about nine tenths of its weight, and are entirely derived from the atmosphere and from water, thus abstracting nothing from the soil. Butt his is not all; vegetable physiologists agree that a very large proportion of the carbon of plants is derived from the air through the action of the leaves, which decomposes the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, and appropriates to the formation of the tissues of the plant, the carbon contained in the acid. For the purposes of the present illustration, it may, therefore, be assumed that not more than about six per cent. of the growth of the cane is derived from the soil, and hence the fact, that this crop can be cultivated on the same soil without exhausting it, for a long series of years; but it is certain that a system which is constantly abstracting something from the earth, and never making to it any return, must by degrees, impair, and eventually. destroy the fertility of even the alluvial soil of power Louisiana. Now, by sloughing into the land each year the tops and leaves stripped from the s talks, not only is the soil improved by the mechanical subdivision of its particles above referred to, but it is kept in good tilt h by having restored to it not only, at least, as much carbon as was abstracted from it, (because the tops and leaves contain fully as much of the carbon derived from the air, as the s talks contained of the carbon derived from the soil) but a large portion of the in organic bases. And if ,to this, the bag as se were added as a manure, we should never hear of a soil being worn out on a sugar plantation in Louisiana. I am aware that it was formerly doubted whether any of the carbon of plants was derived from the soil, but later researches have put this point at rest, and have shown that a large portion of this element is derived by; plants from the carbonic acid evolved from vegetable substances during their decay in the soil, either by its inhalation into the roots in an peri form state, or by its first entering into solution into the water found in the soil, and being afterwards absorbed10290E x. in this form by the roots. The experiments of Air Humphrey Navy on this point appear conclusive; that eminent chemist having shown that "different plants and grasses grow much more luxuriantly when watered with solutions of sugar, than with common water; the two liquid differing in nothing but the presence of carbon in the former, and its absence in the latter his shows that even the "inexhaustible" alluvial beds of the Mississippi become fatigued from continual dropping of one and the same kind of plants, and a years change of crop, with a supply of vegetable manure, gives it new strength to produce afterwards a fine cane crop. It is, then, the change of crop and manure which is indispensable, even in Louisiana, to till the soil with advantage. I must say that I was surprised to see the banks lined with bag as se to prevent them from having in; still more was I surprised to see it carried to a field not far from the sugar house and set on fire, where it is partly burned, and the ashes being washed away by the heavy rains. Met that same bag as se would make an excellent com post, if properly prepared, and mixed with earth thrown out from the ditches, stable manure, ashes from the steam engine and kettles, the sum from the defecators and kettles, and animal charcoal from filters. Bagasse, when piled up without the admixture of other materials and water, remains under composed for years; as I have seen an the banks of the river whole piles, in almost a preserved state, which have been there for years. But when prepared in the following manner, it will make an excellent manure. For instance would place the com post heap near to one of the main ditches, to obtain the necessary water to moist en it; the first layer of the com post heap should be made of bag as se, say 25 to 30 feet wide, and 100 feet long; upon this a layer of earth should be carted, or thrown, in cash it has already been carted, before the grinding season; then another layer of bag as se, and another layer of earth. The layer of bag as se over the last layer of earth is to be covered with stable manure, and upon this alternate layers of bag as se, earth, bag as se, manure, and so on, until the heap is about 12 feet high; then cover it over with earth, and begin a new one. Thesejheaps must, soon after they are made, be thoroughly soaked with water, which can be taken from the ditch by means of a pump. The watering must be repeated several times during a dry spell, until the heaps show, upon examination, that the bag as se is de composed, which should probably be about the middle of the following summer or fall, when it may then be carted into the fields to be ploughed in, preparatory to planting. The objection which will be raised that it would require several tears of males to cart manure and earth upon the bag as se, and hands to load and spread it, at a period when every hand must be employed to cut cane, cart and grind it, I admit as weighty. But why could not the bag as se be carted to a proper place where the com post heaps might be advantageously located, and there left until the grinding season being over, the com post heaps might then le attended to x. 291, Shells, lime, and coal dust would be good addition to the com post. The carting in the field could be done at the most convenient times before the grinding season; and the advantages derived from it would sur pass green soiling with peas, and the effect of the manure would show itself for at least three years. This kind of manure would act chemically as well as mechanically; it would loose n the tenacious soil and give access to the atmospheric air, and the roots of the cane could extend themselves in the ground with more ease. I would rather see the bag as se used as fuel than to see it wasted in the manner it is now, for then the ashes might be collected and applied to the soil. Gray, in his valuable work on sugar, mentions the application of green trash from the mill as powerful manure, page 75."The green trash, direct from the mill, is returned to the trenches of the field from which the canes are just cut, by very light carts, and thrown carefully over the dry leaves and long tops lying in the trenches between the banks The levelling machine, drawn by six cattle, is introduced between the banks, which powerfully presses down the mass of trash c, and at the same time slices off, from either bank, some four, six or more inches of earth, and arranges it cleverly over the trash. This repeated once or twice, a may be determined on, quite covers over the trash, and leaves the smallest possible amount of work for the laborers, which consists in their cutting, with very sharp hoes the cane roots down to the bottom, and levelling the small portion of the bank remaining, so as to have the whole field once again quite level. In a few days after being so cut down, the stools begin to throw up numerous vigorous shoots or sprouts, which soon require a light mouldingAnd p. 279, he describes the levelling machine as follows: "I will now proceed to give a rough description of the construction and peculiar action of the levelling machine alluded to: "his machine consists of an iron cylinder, somewhat similar to a garden roller, to the frame work of which are affixed two arms preceding the roller; these gather the cane trash and place it in a position to be pressed down by the roller, whilst immediately behind the roller are two cutters or ploughs, which slice off from either bank portions of earth, and by means of the mould board e arrange them cleverly over the canetroughThus, in planting in lines six feet apart, the canes would receive, in banking, successive portions of earth, until the banks had become about three feet broad at the base, one and a quarter feet at .th top, and two and a half feet high; the space then left between the base of the banks would therefore be only three feet, which accordingly is the breadth of the roller. Now, when a field of cane his cut, and the leaves and trash of all kinds are laid in the trenches, this machine being introduced between the banks and its cutters or ploughs properly adjusted, (by means of an expanding contrivance the roller passes over the mass of cane trash, which it compresses, and the cutters or ploughs cut off from each bank the desired4292Ex. quantity of earth which is made to fall over the trash so as to cover it up. In each succeeding trip the cutters are expanded in order to take off a further quantity from each bank, until they are so much reduced that but little is left to cut down by hoeThus the machine proceeds up one trench and down the next alternately until the field is finished, altering the expanding apparatus each time to suit the case. It is necessary for me to say, that I have never seen such a machine at work, but it is of my own contrivance, which I intended expressly for the work specified and I have a very firm belief that it will be found to answer the ends proposed very well indeed; and if so, there can be no doubt as to the saving of time and expense it would effect in the work of an estate There must be a great deal of inert hum us in the soil of Louisiana, from the very nature of its formation and wet condition, which the application of alkalies would render so ruble, and thereby act beneficially towards the growth of the cane. A proper analysis of the soil is much wanted, to show how much organic matter it contains, and consequently how much ashes or lime would be required to render it more productive. A judicious application of lime would undoubtedly increase the productive ness of this soil. In the lower part of the State, where shells are plenty and wood in abundance, experiments, on a limited scale, upon different portions of a plantation, would soon show what effect calcareous matter produces. Shells carted upon tenacious land and ploughed under would facilitate its cultivation, and render its drainage easier. The atmospheric manuringploughingis one of the most effective fertilizes of the soil. But when I speak of sloughing, I do not mean a mere scratching of the ground, half turned up in thin slices, a work de noting more the passage of a herd of swine than that of a proper implement drawn by four mules. For what can be the effect when the soil i is worked and turned about for years at the same depth? It is natural to suppose that the rain will wash gradually all so ruble particles down into the sub soil, and carry it off in the ditches. The continual cultivation of the same kind of crop must' deprive it gradually of those elements which are requisite for the perfect development of the plant, and by degrees it will cease to yield profitable crops. I had once the stiff fertile clay land, which forms the granary of the upper portion of the Danube valley, ploughed in the fall with heavy four horse ploughs as deep as the plough could be set, to bring up some of the sub soil, and expose it to the influence of the weather. The following crop looked as if the field had been manured with the best kind of stable dung, so luxuriant and beautiful it grew. The sub soil plough has been introduced in Louisiana. I saw it on several plantations; but I suppose it has not as yet been very extensively used. There is not the slightest doubt that a good sub soil sloughing, after a deep furrow has been thrown up with a heavy plough, would increase the productive ness of the alluvial x. a, 293 lands; for not only the sub soil plough would loose n the sub soil, but facilitate a deeper penetration of the roots* but the air would rush immediately into the smallest openings and are vices, and there begin its chemical action. Besides, it has still another advantage, which would be that of furthering the drainage of the rain water, if care is taken that the water in the ditches be kept low. Although the cane is a tropical plant, still, even in its native country, it requires rich land or manure and proper cultivation to be brought to perfection. Not being a native of Louisiana, which latitude is rather too high for it, it is only by a careful cultivation which will accelerate its maturity in a short space of time, that it may be perfect before the frost sets in, and by a regular supply offer utilizing elements hasten its growth that the cane may be raised successfully in the State. The planters of the less fertile regions of Louisiana will be obliged to adopt regular rotations of crops, and to manure their fields at certain intervals, to keep their land in .heart and produce a vigorous cane, which: will pay the labor of cultivation by a rich yield of sugar. Of Lls. The mills used for grinding the cane are generally placed ten to twelve feet from the ground, in order to give sufficient fall for the juice to flow into the juice boxes, and from them into the kettles. The mills consist mostly of three iron rollers, from 25 to 28 inches in diameter, and from 4 to 51 feet long. The thickness of the shell of the rollers, in those mills constructed by Needs & To, New Orleans, represented in figures 30 and 31, varies from 21 inches to 3 inches, according to size the depth of the eye of the roller is 12 inches in all these mills. The shafts are of wrought iron. The journals vary in size from 71 to 89 inches in diameter. The boxes in; which the journals revolve are of brass, lined with "rabbits antiattriition metal." The return plats, about which there is a great difference of opinion i respecting their proper position, are placed from one to two inches below the top roller. The cane carrier is from fifty to ninety feet in length, according to the height at which the mill is placed* "I n digging post holes for a cow pen on a thrown up cane piece, I have found abundance of strong cane roots, running in all directions, in a stiff cold clay, two feet perpendicular below the surface. In transplanting some young cane, about six or eight weeks old, I pulled up some with roots fully three feet long; they must have been much longer, but the fine ends were broken off by being roughly pulled out of the ground. In mentioning the above circumstance to a friend of mine, he told me that, in confirmation of the circumstances, on one occasion when travelling he passed a part of a steep bank that had lately fallen, from wet weather, and that he could distinctly trace the cane roots ten feet deep. Of this, I do not entertain the smallest doubt, as it is quite in accordance with vegetable physiology See Right Practical Treatises on the Cultivation of the Sugar Lane, Jamaica, 1843, p. 99.)"But who would suppose, but he who knows the fact, that roots of cane, small and delicate in appearance, would penetrate three or four feet in the hardest soil we have. This I discovered many years ago, from a deep gully being worked through a cane field on the side of a hill on Selle isle." (see He Rows Commercial Reviewthe roots of the Canada whistle have been followed down to the depth of seven feet those of oats eighteen inches; those of onions in mellow black soil two feet; <a name="potatoes32"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, fifteen, and twenty inches 294 X. a.

The cost of erection will be about two hundred dollars of additional expense. There are few cane mills with five rollers in Louisiana. Colonel. White, of Beer Range, had one of them in use, and he says in his memorandum book: "after having fairly tested its usefulness, we rolled with all imagine able care for three hours and six minutes, and, while we got from the first three rollers 1,600 gallons of good juice, we only obtained about three gallons of a matter, more like soap than anything else I can compare it tour. Cap ice, who uses a similar five roller mill, I understand, moistened the cane coming from the first set of rollers before it passes between the other set, and obtained good results from it. Mr. Alfred Tillman, of New Work, obtained letters patent, dated 8th of August, 1846, for a sugar mill, as represented in the sectional view, figure 32.

E, the cane carrier; a, curved metallic plate; c, inclined plane; d, endless apron; and e rollers; f, inclined shut e; F and G, second set of rollers; g, thebagasse apron. Figure 33 represents a five roller mill, built byNellius, in France, for the French colonies. Gray, in his Practical Sugar Planter, page 297, describes a similar five roller mill, as represented in figure 32, and says: "the arrangement of the mill with its extra set of rollers, or crushing cylinders, is that which is commonly used in Province, Wellesley, Mauritius, and Bourbon, with the exception, perhaps, of the band which travels between the first and second set of rollers. A few explanatory remarks may, however, be necessary to show its principle The first set comprises the usual number of (three) rollers, one of which has a spur wheel that works into another wheel of similar size on the shaft of the second set of rollers, and communicates the motion which itself receives from the engine. Thus, the first set is acted on by the engine, and transmits that power to the second set by means of these spur wheels, so that both sets move on together at the same pace The second set comprises only two rollers, which are situated from six to eight feet from the first set, and the expressed cane s talks, as they issue from the first set, are carried on the second by means of an endless band which travels between the two sets. It this point an attendant is posted, to direct the passage of the cane s talks, so that they may be presented to the rollers of the second x. 295 set in the most desirable manner. Perhaps the best material for the traveller band is brass, 4 inches; gauze not too fine During the passage of the expressed s talks between the two sets, a jet of steam or moderately hot water may be applied to them, if considered desirable; ,of the two, I should prefer water as hot as the fee der could bear his hands in* *a* *a* "the intended benefit of this application, of hot water is twofold, viz: first, in sat u rating the already expressed cane s talks, in order to obtain from them, during their passage through the second set of rollers, whatever sac charing matter may be still remaining in them; and, secondly, in cleansing and keeping perfectly sweet the traveller band. *a* *a* *in engine and mill such as represented and described* will grind canes sufficient to yield upwards of 12,000 gallons of juice during the day of from twelve to fourteen hours, besides allowing of the engine performing such work as may be required by the vacuum pan, or Wetzalls concentratorsThe mills, such as I have represented, obtain, commonly, 70 per cent. of juice, and have been known, when they were carefully adjusted, to yield 75 per cent n the late publication entitled "in sugar cultivation in Louisiana, Cuba, &c, London, 1848," the author, speaking of mills, says, page 25: "I n 1844, passing through the Havana on my way to the neighborhood of Matanzas, I called on my friend, On Wanceslao, to inquire after his apparatus of the double pressure system, working since the beginning of the crop; he told me that by an experience of four working months, he has arrived at this conclusive result: "1st. That the second mill crushed the bag as se so much as to render it unfit to be used as fuel 2d. That owing to the ruptured squeezed cane, minute parts of the cane mix with the cane juice, rendering its clarification very difficult, and producing a very inferior sugar n reaching la Well a, I was convinced On Wanceslao was right this time. Two of the four twenty-five horse steam boilers were fed with wood, a fuel very expensive in this part of Cuba, and the sugar was far from good. The year before, these four boilers were heated by the bag as se alone. That, then, is to be thought of the sugar mills with four, five, and six rollers, patentee in France and England t is not mentioned that On Wanceslao used either steam or warm water for m listening the cane before it passed between the second set of rollers. The mixture of particles of the cane with the juice, can be no serious consequence where the juice passes through properly constructed straineds and animal charcoal filters before boiling. The greater consumption of fuel, which is caused through the increase of power for grinding and evaporation of the* The rollers are described as having four feet in length, and two feet diameter 296 X. additional 28 per cent. of juice, must be amply repaid by the greater amount of sugar produced. Fig. 33 represents a five roller sugar mill, built by Bellies, in France, for the French colonies. Messrs. J. P. Morris & To, of Philadelphia, constructed a four roller mill for the Battle ground sugar refine by near New Orleans, owned by L. An in, esq; its cost was                            $5,600. Fig. 34 is a representation of that mill. There are several other foundries in the United States where mills for grinding the sugar cane are constructed. Planters who pay attention to the setting of the rollers and the feeding of the cane carrier, obtain 66 per cent. of juice; yet the usual amount obtained, probably, does not exceed 52 per cent. Gray recommends "the first under roller to be adjusted exactlyfivesixteenths of an inch from the main or upper roller, and the second under roller just one tenth of an inch from the upper rollers found the bag as se coming from mills with a slow speed, always more perfectly expressed than from such with more rapid, motion. The velocity of the mills I had an opportunity to observe varied from 21 to 4 revolutions per minute. Lane carrier The cane carrier consists of an endless belt formed of chains with seats inserted into it, placed in an inclined position of about 300 to 35 to the ground. The best constructed carrier I saw was at Mr. Oh. Organs plantation; it extends considerably beyond the mill house, and is about two feet from the ground, at its lower end, a height which enables even children to throw and spread the cane properly upon it, without much exertion. The carriers I have seen elsewhere, I think, are too high, and render necessary the use of a feeding table, attended by two hands, to shift the cane from it to the carrier, an extra labor which might be spared. It is very important that the carrier should always be well and evenly supplied with cane, for if thrown carelessly on it, they reach the rollers promiscuously, and enter between them, sometimes several at one place, overlapping each other, and often the carrier runs for some time empty, causing by this irregularity, checks, jerks, and strains, in the motion of the power to force them through, the journals below get heated, and what is worse, the cane being indifferently pressed, causes great loss of juice. The carrier ought to be established under a shed large enough to shelter and keep the laborers from being exposed to the rain or hot sun. I must say, I have in many instances seen cane going to the mill very imperfectly stripped, so that cane and dry leaves went together through the rollers; on examining the bag as se of such cane, I round the leaves drenched with cane juice, which went in that state with the bag as se to the banks of the river. Either of the rollers can beset close enough to press a leaf which is almost as thin as a sheet of stout paper; the consequence is, that the leaves which have absorbed a quantity of juice in passing through the first roller, pasrsEx. a untouched through the bag as se rollers, and carry away a considerable quantity of the best juice. Trying bagasseTo dry the bag as se immediately after it leaves the mill, has been a subject of much speculation and experiment. Of it could be effected so as to dry the bag as se thoroughly that it can be used as fuel under the steam boilers and kettles, it would bean improvement of great importance to the planters, especially on such plantations where fuel is scarce. George Berwick has obtained letters patent for a mode of dryingbagasse, dated April 10, 1845; from the specification of said patent give here the following extract, with a ground plan of the apparatus. The bag as se, as it leaves the rollers, by which the juice has been pressed out, is received on to an inclined slide or shut e, down which it passes on to an endless apron formed of seats of iron, which are connected together by suitable links. This apron is kept in motion by power derived from the steam engine employed in the works, or by any other adequate means The endless apron passes around feels or drums, at each end of a range of horizontal flies, through which the apron, with the bag as se deposited upon it, is to be conducted. The blue, also, which is intended to convey the heated air and smoke into the chimney from the steam boiler furnace, or from that under the boilers used in the manufacture of sugar, is made' to extend along and through same range, through which the endless apron is to pass, said range of horizontal flies being thereby divided into three blue spaces or compartments; along the uppermost of these compartments the endless apron, with the bag as se upon it, is to pass, and said apron is to return along the lower compartment after having deposited the dried material upon a receiving plate, or platform, in front of the furnace, or otherwise conveniently situated for that purpose." The fire blue, for the purpose of conducting the heated air from the furnace to the chimney, is situated between those along which the endless apron passes. The top of this fire blue is to be formed of sheets of cast iron or other suitable material, which will allow of the passing of heat through it into the upper or bag as se drying blue; upon these plates, there should be projecting ribs or ways, upon which the seats of the endless apron may slide, which will not only enable them to do so un obstructedly, but will allow the heated air to pass freely around the material to be dried. The length of the horizontal blue must be varied according to the circumstances of the particular case, as in some works the escape heat will be much greater than in others; for this, therefore, no particular rule can be given, but the point must be decided by the judgment and experience of the construct or." When the heat is great, the blue may be of less length than when it is moderate; and the effect may be regulated by increasing or diminishing the motion of the endless apron; it is desirable, however, that the motion of this should be the same with that of the carrier that supplies the mill with cane. The escape steam maybe used to increase the draught, should it be found necessary, or this298Ex. may be effected by means of a fan or other apparatus used for that purpose. In the accompanying drawing, figure 35, represents a plan or top view of the apparatus with the range of horizontal flies, and the receiving plate or hearth for the dried bag as se. The endless apron is not represented. L, L, L, are the rollers made use of to express the juice from the cane. M is a shut e or slide inclined downwards to cause the bag as se, when it leaves the rollers, to pass on to the endless apron orbagasse carrier. The feels or drums, around which the endless apron passes, are shown at B, 2; one of them being placed at each end of the range of horizontal flies. D, D, represents the boilers of a steam engine, or the place of a range of sugar kettles, from the furnace of which the heat for drying the bag as se is to be derived; the escape heat from such furnace is to enter the fire blue H, which constitutes the middle blue of the range of flies. Last iron plates constitute the top of this blue. The blue immediately above the fire blue, H, is for the passage of the endless apron with its load of bag as se, and the blue below the fire blue is for the return of said apron after it has deposited its load on the receiving plate, E, or into any convenient receptacle. H' isa blue leading from the blue, H, to the chimney, K, into which it conducts the heated air and smoke after they have traversed the length of the blue, H. I n to the bag as se or drying blue, atmospheric air is to be admitted, to carry off the vapor given out in the process; and at each end of said blue I place a sliding scuttle or register of iron, for the purpose of regulating the quantity that shall be allowed to enter; the lower edge of these registers may be brought as low down, particularly at the end where the bag as se enters, as the endless apron and its load will admit. There is also a blue leading from the bagasseflue into the chimney, K, to carry off the vapor extricated in the drying process. The bag as se carrier or endless apron may be made to revolve in various ways. A pulley is attached to the shaft of the engine; or, if preferred, to the shaft of the rollers. Another pulley is attached to the shaft, N, N, upon the end of which is affixed the level wheel, X, that gear s into the level wheel, Y, upon the end of the shaft 2; which, it will be seen, will produce the desired effect, The bag as se should be delivered on to the endless apron at a short distance before it enters the blue, to admit of the falling through between the seats and on to the ground of any pulp y matter, and of such shreds as may be too small to be sustained on them. Ani Mal Charcoal. Animal charcoal is not very extensively used by the Louisiana planters. To far as could ascertain, it is only employed by those who use vacuum pans, Derosnes or Rillieuxs apparatus. I to peculiar property of de coloring and purifying sir ups has been sufficiently established by its extensive use in the refineries and be et sugar man factories, Those who wish to become acquainted x. 299 with the de coloring power of bone black have only to visit the plantations where the improved plans of boiling sugar are used; there they can see how clear and slightly colored the juice and sir up comes from the bone black filters, and how beautiful the sugar looks made from sir up filtered in that way. Those planters who boil in open kettles would improve there sugar much by the use of bone black, and might always calculate upon the highest prices of brown sugar. Large wine or rum luncheons would answer for filters. One of the juice boxes, when provided with a series of copper pipes, could be used for a defeat or, and a revivification furnace would make up the whole expense of apparatus. The greatest out lay would be in the first purchase of the necessary bone black. For a plantation making 500,000 pounds of sugar, about 100,000 pounds of bone black would be sufficient. One black costs from 21 to 3 cents per pound. There is always a loss of bone black occasioned by the various charging and discharging the filter, fermenting, washing and revivifying the bone black, which amounts to about 12 to 15 per cent. a year After the bone black has been used for de coloring a certain quantity of sir up, it must be revivified again. The bone black is taken from the filter, suffered to ferment, in order to free itself from the coloring matter and glum ten, &c, which it has abstracted from the sir up or juice. When the organic matter is de composed by ferment at ion, the bone black is washed, dried, and calcined, whereby it acquires again its full de coloring powers, and it can be used over and over again. The Louisiana planters reviving the bone black by calcis nation, viz: the bone black after having been left for several days to ferment, is washed, dried, and then calcined in retorts, or by means of Derosnes apparatus, hereafter described. Various methods have been contrived to effect a perfect revivification; but they are either too complicated, expensive, and require too much manual labor. It is a subject of great importance to reviving the bone black perfectly, and with little waste, expense of fuel, and labor. The various methods employed to reviving bone black by calcis nation are 1st. To calcined it in closed iron pots 2d. To calcined it in vertical or horizontal retorts 3d. By means of highly heated steam 4th. In open revolving cylinders. The calcis nation in the iron pots is unquestionably the best method, since the bone black comes the least in contact with atmospheric air, the pots are closed with iron covers, and lured with clay. This method, however, has been generally abandoned, because the expense of labor and the loss of pots from burning were too great, and over balanced all its advantages The author "in sugar cultivation in Louisiana and Cuba, London, 1848," says: "The renewal of animal charcoal gives a waste of 6 per cent. on each reburning300Ex. a. The calcis nation in vertical cylinders was very extensively used in France and Germany until within in a few years. The apparatus used for it consists in upright cylinders, closed with iron covers at top and bottom, and set in a proper furnace. With this kind of furnace the animal charcoal can be well revivified, and very little of it is burnt; but it requires a very strong fire, in consequence of which the cylinder (having about six feet length and 10 inch diameter) are frequently burnt, occasioning great expense and delay. The great diameter of the cylinder prevents the heating of the bone black in the centre, and the inconvenience in discharging the cylinder from below, renders their use still more impracticable. The mode of revivifying bone black in gas retorts is used by some planters in Louisiana; it has the same objections as the above, and differs only therein that the above mentioned retorts are placed vertically and these horizontally. The former have yet the advantage of being emptied with less difficulty. The most ingenious method of revivifying bone black was invented in France, and introduced into other countries. But, in consequence of being very complicated and costly, its use was not very extensive. The apparatus consists in a steam boiler for gene rating steam of about 60 and 80 pounds pressure. The steam passes through a serpentine of wrought iron welded together, about 3 inches in diameter and f inch thick, which is heated to red heat, in order to impart to the steam a temperature of 700 and 750 degrees. This highly heated steam passes into a tight conical reservoir in which the bone black is placed, allowing the steam and condensed water to escape at the bottom of it, carrying with it all the impure ties contained in the bone black, which, after an operation of from 7 to 8 hours, is perfectly revivified. But the serpentine is exceedingly costly, difficult to construct, and burns by the least inattention of the firemen. The vapors arising from the operation are very pernicious, on account of their bad odor. The whole apparatus costs about six times as much as the furnaces with vertical retorts. It revivifies, perhaps, in a given time, more than those with vertical retorts, but it consumes a much greater quantity of fuel, and requires great attention. Mr. Benjamin, of Bellechasse, who lately turned his attention to sugar growing, speaks of this apparatus, which he saw in operation in Paris* " Such talent and labor have been expended in devising the best means of economical and effective revivification, but I have heard of none so satisfactory as that by heated steam, which I saw employed on a very large scale at two refineries near Paris. The black is thrown into a heap, after being used and allowed to ferment; it is then thrown into a cylinder, and steam heated to 750 Fahrenheit is driven through it. The steam is heated by being -conveyed th:rough pipes placed in a furnace, so arranged as to heat them red hot without the actual contact of the* He He Rows Corcid127mercial Review, vol. 5, p. 52 x. 301 fire, which would otherwise soon destroy them. For is this process at all attended with the danger which might be supposed to result from the great degree of heat imparted to the steam. The action on the bone black is at once to destroy, by combination, all the organic matter absorbed into the pores of the charcoal during its use, and the purgation of all impure ties. The bone black when taken from the cylinder, is simply sifted, and is found then to be fully equal to new bone black; and one of the refine is stated that he considered it as constantly improving by this process. This mode of revivification is cheap, simple, and superior to any with which I am acquainted. The proper degree of heat in the tubes is very simply indicated by dropping in them an allow, which melts at 750 Fahrenheit. When the allow begins to melt, the bone black is discharged, and a fresh charge introduced into the cylinder. D6rosne was the first who employed animal charcoal in refining sugar, and in the manufacture of be et sugar, which, since then, has been brought to great perfection. Dbrosne invented, also, a revivifying apparatus which he describes in his patent for a boiling apparatus. The following is the description of the apparatus taken from the specification: "the apparatus for restoring animal charcoal is composed of a cylinder, F, represented in fig. 36, (a section) placed in a position a little inclined from the horizontal, and on the upper part of its shaft (K) there is a screw (m) that is placed in the lower part of a hop per into which the coal from the filters is put; by the revolution of the cylinder, the screw that turns with it conveys the coal from the hop per, and then gradually passes down the cylinder and out at the lower end. The cylinder is surrounded by brick work D, leaving a sufficient space between them for the circulation of heat all around the cylinder; below the point or lower end of the cylinder, there is a furnace, S', built in the brick work, and one third of the distance between that and the hop per, there is another furnace constructed in a similar manner; the smoke is conveyed off near the hop per by means of a pipe (E) passing through the top of the furnace. The animal charcoal going into the cylinder, is gradually heated up and dried as it passes over the furnace) and so down, approaching still nearer to the fire at the furnace, (S',) where it is heated up to a red heat, and in the most perfect and equal manner; thus subjecting each particle, by a gradual increase, to the highest temperature required, without over heating and spoiling any, as it is absolutely necessary that the coal should be only heated up to a dull red that requires a dark place to be distinguished in. The black is then fit to be used again in the filters. The cylinder may be turned by any mechanical means, and the fires should be regulated with accuracy instead of the animal charcoal above mentioned, and which is constantly growing dearer and more difficult to obtain, I have inserted a substitute, which I de nominate vegetomineral black; considering it a principle, that the molecular division of carbon, combined with a certain pomposity in the texture of animal charcoal302Ex. was the cause of its whitening properties, I have produced a compound which seems to unite these two properties, that may be produced in all sugar works in any position The principal ingredients used to supply the carbon is saccharinematter combined with a clay be to give it more consistence. The sac charing I use for this purpose is taken in the form of molasses or the residue m of syrupy, which is rarely of much value in sugar works; this is mixed with a white or grey clay, as they contain little or no iron. Take any quantity of this clay, and about one third as much molasses by weight, to which is added about the same quantity of water, pour the liquid into a reservoir, and mix the clay with it gradually and uniformly, so as to form a homogeneous mass, the paste thus produced will have the consistency of stiff mortar; iron cylinders are then filled with this mortar, care being taken to dispose of it in layers of three or four inches in thickness. When the cylinders are full to within an inch of the top, three or four holes are made through the centre of the mass with a stick that will reach the bottom, and one or two pieces of wood may be introduced in the middle of the mass to accelerate carbonizationwhich is effected in the same manner as the process of carbonizingines. The pulverizing and sifting is also similar to the process sed in forming the animal charcoal The vegetomineral carbon thus produced, has the appearance of the finest animal carbon, and its whitening properties are equal thereto with a still higher power of absorption. It is quite as solid, is not disturbed by the water, and may be used either coarsely in finely powdered like the animal carbon his black may also be revived in precisely the same way as, was before described for animal carbonD6rosne intended to bring the heated bone black in contact with the air, to prevent the fusing of organic matter which has been absorbed by the bone black during the felt ration of the sir ups, which happens when calcined in close vessels, producing a bone black with a brilliant lustre, but of less dissolving power. But this apparatus has the inconvenience that, in case the bone black is not highly heated, the revivification is imperfect; and when the coal is heated up to a high degree, the contact of air produces combustion, and causes a great loss of coal. I consider, therefore, this kind of furnace the least economical for the planters, and do not see how it could be improved to avoid the inconveniences pointed out; besides, it requires mechanical arrangement to keep it inunction. War th(cid:127)e year 1846, a new apparatus was invented, and from its simplicity and practical construction, perfect. revivification of the coal, and easy management, several hundreds of them were introduced at once in France and Germany by the be et sugar manufacturers and refine is, and replaced nearly all other furnaces of that description. For the description and drawing, I am indebted to Mr. B. Andreae, civil engineer, who visited the United States with the view of becoming acquainted with our improvements in steam navigation x. 
30Oand sugar works. He was extensively engaged in the construction of various apparatus for the manufacture of be et sugar inMagdeburg, (germany) where about 200 very large factories are in operation, conducted in the most perfect manner. Mr. Andreae enumerates the advantages of this furnace 1. An easy and uniform revivification without producing burnt coal. The tubes are not liable to be burst, because the furnace is heated with a small fire, spreading over a large grate 3. In 24 hours this furnace is capable of revivifying 10,000 pounds of animal charcoal with a very small quantity of fuel, whereby great economy of fuel is obtained 4. The management is exceedingly simple, requiring less labor than any other mode of revivifying, because this furnace requires nothing else than the opening or closing of the slides whereby the tubes are emptied and filled. This furnace, which is represented in figure 37, is a section through the dotted line x, x, of figure 38; and figure 38 is a section of figure 37, through the dotted line o, o; it consists of 28 inclined tubes A A, (see figure 37, and figure 38,) 14 on each side, resting upon bottom plates, B, B, with openings corresponding to the size of the tubes A A; the tops of the tubes fit in a hop per C, the openings of which are covered with bone black, ~D and when the tubes are to be emptied, the slides, E, are to be closed, to prevent the bone black which covers the opening of the tubes, and which is not yet revivified, from falling into the tubes. The heap of bone black which rests upon the tubes prevents the access of air into the tubes, and causes a more perfect revivification. Below the bottom- plates, B, are channels, a, a, in which always two tubes, A, A, empty, built of masonry work; a cast iron pipe, b, fits into a sheet iron box, c, which holds the quantity of two tubes, A, A. When this sheet iron box, or cylinder, is filled with revivified bone black, it is immediately closed with an air tight cover, removed, and an empty one put in its place. A wide grate, H, reaches the whole extent under the tubes, and as the fire is below, the heat en circles them, and is carried, by means of flies, I, which are connected with the upper flies, K, 1 leading the heat under cast iron plates, L, L, L, forming a platform, and used to dry the bone black before it is put in the tubes. When the tubes become heated to a certain degree, which is ascertained by observation and experience, they are to be emptied which can be done every half hour in properly constructed furnaces. To ascertain that proper degree of heat required for revivifyingthe bone black, the following method can be practiced. A piece of bone, say the size of a finger, is introduced from above in one of the tubes, and when that piece of bone is properly calcined, the revivification is complete. The operator should then observe with care the color which the 304 X. tubes have assumed, and for the future discharge of them every time they have reached that same degree of red heat. The evaporation of cane juice is accomplished in Louisiana 1. By the common open kettles 2. By open kettles in which the juice is concentrated to the density of 29 to 300 Beaume, and afterwards boiled to the striking point in high pressure open steam pans 3. By open kettles which concentrate the juice to 299 to 300Beaume6 and finish it in vacuum pans 4. By boiling all together in open high pressure steam pans 5. By concentrating the juice in open high pressure steam pans to 250 Beaume, and boil it to the striking point in vacuum pans 6. In va cut altogether a. By two vacuum pans, one for reducing the juice to sir up, and the other to boil it for striking b. By Degrandls (called Derosnes) apparatus c. By Riellieuxs apparatus 1. Open kettles When cane juice is elaborated in open kettles, consequently under the atmospheric pressure, heated by fire or high pressure steam, the sugar is always more or less burned orcarmelized, especially when the evaporation is carried on slowly, and the juice kept a long time in contact with the heated surfaces. Experience has shown that, when the evaporation of saccharineliquid is carried on rapidly by means of a high temperature, the color of the sugar and its crystal ligation are less impaired. This has been: partly effected by enlarging the chimney of the kettle furnace, which was formerly not wide t than about 12 by 14 inches. This improvement came into use about the year 1833, and the planters have since been enabled with the same set of kettles to e vapor ate three times the amount of juice, producing sugar of a better quality, lighter color, and considerably diminishing the amount of molasses. The next important improvement in the open kettle system was made the year after, and consisted in placing two grandes at the end of the furnace instead of one, and having two different flies, provided with dampers, constructed in such a manner that the draft can be directed at pleasure under the one or the other, whereby the defeating and boiling of both is under the control of the sugar boiler, permitting him to stop the heat under the one or the other kettle at the precise moment required for swimming. Since that time several improvements have been made in the mode of setting and constructing kettles for boiling sugar, and patented in the United States. The following descriptions are extracts from the specifications of said improvements, with drawings to illustrate them Francis Board obtained a patent, dated 30th May, 1838, for a circulating sugar boiler: "the apparatus is filled with cane or other juice to within about 18 inches of the top; as the juice boils, more must be received into compartment No. 4 see fig. 39 and from thence charged forward into compartments 3 and 2 progressively, by means of the x. 305 cock B B No. 1 is the striking teach or finishing compartment, and must be charged by dipping or lad long the liquor from No. 2. The large cock C being opened, the sugar will pass directly intothe cookers, which must be placed a little below the level of the cock. In taking off a strike of sugar, care must be had in shutting the cock as soon as the surface of the sugar comes down to the level of the top of the blue; after which the teach must be changed immediately, in order to prevent the sugar remaining in the teachfrdomrunning too high, or burning The process of swimming is exceedingly simple. The compartments 1, 2, and 3, in a great measure skin themselves; most of the, swimmings deposit e themselves in the back end of the compartment 4, from whence they can be removed with very little labor; and will be quite often enough to boil off, as it produces waste of fuel and manual labor, and the apparatus will not require cleaning oftener n boiling off, the liquor will be charged forward by means of the cock B B, until it comes down nearly to the level of the blue, when the cock B connecting the compartments 3 and 4 must be closed, and the remaining liquor in compartment 4 drawn off by means of the cock underneath into a box or cistern, wherein should be placed a pump for charging it up into compartment No. 3. The same cistern and pump will answer for charging the liquor from any one compartment to another is soon as any one or more compartments are emptied of liquor, they must be filled above the blue with water. Before taking off the last strike of sugar, the fire must be extinguished, when all the sugar may be discharged and the teach charged with water in instrument similar to the one used for cleaning the inside of gun barrels will be found serviceable in cleaning the tubes, and one upon the same principle will answer for cleaning the- sides of the flueReference to the drawings.

When opened, there will be a rapid rush of cold air, consequent upon the previous heating of the chimneys, so as, if desired, to cool the vessels almost instantaneously. There may be such numbers of these air flies as may be preferred, and they may be varied in their arrangement without altering the principle upon which they, operate. To A. Hagersletters patent were granted, dated March 9th, 1844,for a new mode of setting kettles; fig. 43 of which represents a top view of the s tack with. the kettles in their proper places; fig 44, is a vertical longitudinal section. The s tack A, furnace B, ash pipe C, flies D, kettles E, chimney, are made in the usual or most improved manner. The main improvement consists, 1st, in constructing spiral flies G, beneath the grandes and clarifying kettles E' 2, increasing gradually in size as they wind around the kettles and approach the blue F, with a partition H, and an enlargement of the blue at 2, by which a spiral draft is produced around and under the bottoms of said kettles, and a more active and intense heat and quicker draft, causing the x. 307 kettles to be heated with a much smaller quantity of fuel and in less time than in the old plan; the said flies, after encircling the bottoms of the kettles, and driving down obliquely under them at And then passing off through flies G' (shown by dotted lines) towards the chimney F, and uniting in a single blue at G', where a valve, I, is placed for opening or closing either of said flies G', at pleasure; 2d, in making said valve I, and its stem or axle J, hollow, arid filling the same with water to take off the intense heat acting on said valve, thereby preventing m it from being warped or consumed; 3d, in constructing the bottom of the granulating kettle Concave on the bottom surface next the fire at 2, for producing ain ore direct action of the heat applied to it in a circular corresponding blue, L, constructed under said kettle, which is formed with a partition, M, therein, for the purpose 'of preventing the heat passing to the chimney before it has circulated around and under the concave bottom of the said granulating kettle, whose lower edges rest upon the brick seat or bed, except at a place L near the partition, where a space is left open for the draft to pass under the edge of the kettle to the blue L', formed around the outside of the kettle K; 4th, in the construction of a blue, N, in the s tack, extending nearly its whole length, leading from the granular or to the chimney, in which a slide valve is placed for opening or i losing said blue when required; 5th, in the arrangement of a hanged valve, Q, in the blue R, leading from the furnace to the blue or space under the granular or for regulating the heat applied to the same; 6th, in the construction of man holes, S, under the kettles for removing accumulated dirt or ashes from under them. The hollow valve I, filled with water, to prevent being consumed by the intensity of the heat, is made in the shape of a hollow wedge, through which, at the back, is passed a vertical hollow spindle, J, having a funnel shaped mouth or top, by which it is filled with water kept always at the requisite height, by stop cock, or flow, or other convenient apparatus. The hollow spindle has a pilot at the lower end, and its upper end passes through the brick work and turns therein, leaving the funnel top above the s tack. His valve is turned to the right or left by a handle, h, for opening or closing the flies 4 at pleasure, more or less for regulating the heat' under the grandes and all the kettles of the s tack. The granulating kettle K is made with a concave bottom as represented at fig. 44, having a circular ring around its largest diameter for strengthening it while ho i sting it from its bed, and a circular rim, r 2, above said ring, being a continuation of the side of the kettle vertically above the brick work, to prevent boiling over, havingtrunnions at the sides, to which a common bale handle is attached for suspending it by a crane or other apparatus for lifting and tilting it in discharging its contents, being provided with a handle for panting or reversing its position. The granulating kettle rests upon a suitable seat or bed formed in the s tack near the furnace. The circular blue L, under said granulating kettle, is formed in the brick work, by carrying it up at 2 in the centre of the cavity made to receive the kettle) above the horizontal bed upon which308Ex. the kettle rests, into the con cavity or bottom of the kettle, to a sufficient height to leave a space for a blue for the proper circulation of the heat therein. Another blue, L, is then formed around the outside or convex surface of the kettle, commencing with the aforesaid blue formed in the con cavity of the kettle, by means of the continuation of the blue under the lower edge of the kettle at L,. near a partition, M, constructed in the outside blue for causing the draught to pass around the kettle before it passes to the blue N, leading to the chimney F. A blue is constructed in the brick work leading from the furnace B to the blue L, under the granular or K. A hinged valve, Q, is placed in this blue for letting or shutting off the Seat to or from the granular or. Before ho i sting the granulating kettle from its seat or bed, this valve must be closed. Likewise the side valve in blue N. The blue N leading from the circular blue under the granular or to the chimney, commences near the partition M, and dives obliquely downward, then turns horizontally and continues in a straight line till below the grandes; it there takes a turn towards the middle of the s tack; from thence it leads to the chimney F. A slide valve is placed in the blue for regulating its draught and for preventing any interference with the draught of the chimney, where the granulating kettle is raised from its seat by the entrance of cold air at the said blue. The man holes S, for receiving the dirt and ashes collected in the flies under the kettles, are constructed in the brick work near the bottom thereof, and are cleared in the usual manner. The draughts being caused to pass around and under the kettles in the manner described, increases their length, and consequently their strength, which is likewise augmented by gradually improving the size of the flies as they recede from the furnace, and their spiral or circular course tends also to promote an increased draught under the kettles, and causing the flies to descend under the grandes, as set forth, enables the construct or to do away with the necessity of occupying the space around or behind the kettles in the boiling room required for the tender of the kettles, by a mass of brick work required to admit the flies, where they are arranged above the level of the floor of the boiling room. A hinged scut or trough, T, is placed on the top of the s tack, for conveying the boiling cane juice to the granulating kettle from the kettle over the furnace. I do not claim, the invention of spiral flies; but what I do claim as my invention, and which I desire to secure by letters patent, is the use of spiral descending flies under the grandes, as above set forth. I also claim the arrangement of the flies L, 2, L', in combination with the concave bottom of the granulating kettle K, as set forth. I likewise claim the hollow valve, I, filled with water, to prevent burning out, arranged and operated in the manner and for the purpose set forth. James . Alone y obtained letters patent for an improvement in setting kettles, dated September 10, 1838. X. 
309lgAs boilers are usually set in brick work alone, the bricks at their rims are placed on end, standing at an angle of 45 degrees, making a fragile structure, which soon breaks down. In my improved mode of setting, the rims of the kettles: rest upon hoops, or circles, of cast iron i which I make about six inches wide, and two inches thick. In the accompanying drawing (figure 45) is a top view of four boilers, A, B, C, and D, as ordinarily arranged a, b, c, and d, are four cast iron rims resting on the brick work, and adapted in size to the respective boilers which pass within, and have their rims resting upon them Figure 46 is a vertical section through the centres of the boilers, the furnace, and the blue, E, being the furnace, and F the termination of the blue leading to the chimney, The sections of the iron rims are shown at a, b, and c, and d, and these are so formed on their upper sides as to receive and embrace the brick work, which constitutes the ordinary divisions between the kettles Colonel Counsel White, of Beer Range, Plaquemin, Louisiana, invented a new mode of setting kettles, for which he obtained letters patent, dated September 17, 1839. The following is an extract from the specification on record, of the U. S. Patent Office: "I n this arrangement the kettles are so placed as to surround the s tack or chimney for the escape of smoke, and they have a circular arch underneath them, along which the draft from the fire passes. I sometimes, however, place the kettles in a circular arch, and erect the chimney on the outside of said circle, but in either case, the plan of setting the kettles is the same Fig. 47. A, in the accompanying drawing, is a plan of the top of the arch and kettles when completely set and finished, and also of the frames or margin of wood or other material which form the compartments by which the kettles are surrounded and separated from each other. No. 8 shows the chimney blue arising from the centre of the structure; the kettles are numbered respectively from to. 1 to No. 5, on each side, No. 1 being the battery or first kettle standing out of the circle, and immediately over the furnace Fig. 48 is a horizontal section or plane immediately below the kettle. d is the place of the grate bars of the furnace under the battery. From the furnace the flies run under the other kettles in both directions until they meet on the opposite side of the arch, a sat 6, whence the flies 6' lead into the chimney at 7. G G shows the places of the canal into which the ashes are to fall There is also described a variation of the plan of setting the kettles in a circle, the battery, with its furnace, and also the flies and arches, being constructed in the manner already explained; but, in this plan, the chimney is placed without the circle, and so also are two additional kettles. The blue, in this arrangement, instead of passing inwards from under the series of kettles' n each, passes outward and into the chimney, the two channels being regulated by dampers, as in a former instance. By this arrangement, a single fire is made to operate on two series of kettles, whilst, as heretofore constructed, it could act upon one only, and a double quantity310Ex. of juice could, therefore, be operated upon at the same time; and even a larger quantity with the aid of two additional kettles. The economy resulting from this mode of setting kettles is not, however, limited to this circumstance, but it has been proved, experimentally, that, owing to the circular form, the heat is concentrated in a much smaller space, whilst the surface of the flies, being spherical, and from this cause approaching more nearly the surfaces of the kettles, the current of heated air which passes around them is more directly applied to them than in the straight arches heretofore constructed, and a more rapid evaporation is consequently effected. The following description of boiling sugar in open kettles is the old Are ole style, which, I witnessed at a plantation in the parish of It. Bernardthe juice, as it came from the mill, was collected in large juice boxes, holding many hundred gallons, where it remained until drawn off for boiling. A s trainer was used to separate the s cum, cane pieces, and trash, from the juice. The juice was s dimmed in these boxes preparatory to boil iris. The old Are ole mode is to boil in four open kettles with he mi spherical bottoms, comprising what is called an equipage. The first and largest kettle is called the grande; the second, farm beau, so called because the point of the flame reaches that kettle; the third is the sir op, or sir up kettle here the juice is boiled down to the density of sir up; and lastly, the batteries, or sticking pan. Some have an additional kettle between the sir op and grande, called proper clear, because, in that kettle, the juice begins to be clear and transparent. The kettles used to be mostly of cast iron. Some use kettles made of sheet iron, which are more dura be, but rather expensive. The kettles of an equip page, or set, are of different capacities, holding from one hundred to four hundred gallons. After the kettles have been all filled, the fire being started in the furnace, the heat passes on its way: first, under the batteries, then under the sir op, f lamb eau, and grande, beyond which it enters the chimney. As soon as the juice begins to approach the boiling point, the lime is added. The s cum rising to the surface is carefully lad led off, and thrown into a proper receiver. In proportion as the juice is elaborated, the kettles are supplied from the grande until this is nearly empty, when it is filled from the juice boxes. Time is again here 'added, the s cum taken off, and, when the juice is sufficiently clean and clear, it is gradually added to the more concentrated juice of theflambQau, &y c. As soon as the sir up in the batteries has reached the striking point, it is almost all turned out into the cooler, and immediately re charged with a fresh supply from the sir op, in order to prevent the burning of the kettle and its contents. The sir op then is replenished from the f am beau, and this from the grande; this last one being, as soon as it is emptied, again supplied from the juice boxes. And thus the rotation is continued to the last drop of juice. The operation requires, for every kettle, a hand to attend x. 311 to the necessary shipping out, and what is called to the brushing off" which consists in taking off the s cum, or other impure ties, which will rise to the surface during the process of boiling of the juice or the sir up. The kettles are kept full up to their brim, around which is a kind of rim of masonry, rising about six inches above the brim of each kettle, and enlarging towards its top; this space is filled with the f roth caused by the boiling, and on its surface floats the impure ties. The men appointed to watch over the kettle use a thin bat, with a convenient handle, to sweep, or rather brush off, from the sir op into the f lamb eau, all the floating stuff a sit comes up. The man at theflambeau brushes it into the grande the man attached to the grande, or last kettle, ladies the s cum out into a bucket. During the transfer of the juice, sir up, and strike, from one kettle into the other, and ultimately into the cooler, a great portion of the surface of the kettle being exposed, during this process, to the flame, necessarily becomes highly heated and burns the part of the liquid which is in immediate contact with the almost red hot sides of the kettle. This unavoidable injury has made Dr. Are call the set of open kettles, not without truth, "sugar trying pans" for in fact at the moment of transporting the liquor front one kettle to another, the burning of the sugar is so great i that a strong' odor of carmelizedsugar is emitted, which is perceptible even at a great distance from a sugar house where sugar is boiled in this manner. The kettles are often burnt in consequence of the incur station which forms in them, especially the grande, which is always in crusted with a thick coating of scales that require a chisel to be taken off. There is less in the other kettles in proportion as their contents become purified. The quantity of lime or temper used in defection is generally made the matter of a secret by the sugar boiler. He varies the necessary quantity according to the state of the cane. When he boils juice from good ripe cane, he puts from five to eight ounces when from rank cane, grown on new ground, or when high topped or frozen cane, the doses vary from fifteen to thirty ounces, regulating the quantity according to the appearance of the s cum r which rises in the grande, ft am beau, and sir op, and also by the color andlimpidness of the strike in the batteries. When the s cum, floating on the surface of the juice or sir up, is in small detached lumps, and frees itself easily from the liquid, when the eyes of the boiling juice are small and clear, and when it is nearly transparent and of a pale color, like Madeira wine, then the quantity of lime is considered as sufficient. But if the, s cum rises in large agglomerated lumps of a fat appearance, and the eyes look large and greasy, like soap bubbles, there is a deficiency of lime. When the sugar, after having had sufficient time to make a thin crust in the cooler, forms instead of -it a kind off roth, which can be drawn together with the finger, this is another sign that the juice had not enough lime. When there is an alkaline smell, or the sugar boiler hears a312Ex. whizzing noise in the kettle, he knows that he has given too much lime or temper. When the sir up in the striking pan runs off the bowl of the lad le thick, like blue, it is another sign that there is not enough lime given; but when the sir up breaks off short and lively, the quantity of lime is sufficient. The lime, before it is added to the juice in the grande, is first soaked in about two or three gallons of juice. The quantities of lime used for defection are generally measured; the doses vary from five to thirty ounces, and even more, for one charge of the grande. The quantity; must be increased and decreased during the day, according to the state of the cane, being either more or less rich in juice, or in consequence of having grown upon moist land, or such as has been touched from the frost. The fire man has the most laborious task to perform during the boiling season, he has to keep up continually a strong fire under the kettle; when the fire is in the least allowed to go down, the sugar boilers call out to him to fire up, and a new supply of wood is forced into the red hot furnace. The amount of fuel consumed is ,enormous, varying from two and a fourth to five cords per hogs head, according to the state of the cane. The economy of fuel depends a great deal on the proper construction of the furnace and, chimney. I have seen the flame rising several feet above the top of the chimney; and it is easily inferred that the consumption of fuel, in such furnaces, must be very great. The vapor arising from the boiling juice is carried off into the air by a large chimney. Those who know the amount of heat contained in that mass ofvrapors cannot but deplored the enormous waste of, fuel and calorie. The sugar obtained by that obsolete method must invariably contain a large proportion of burnt or carmelized sugar, the crystal living power of which being impaired, drains off from the crystallized sugar into the cisterns as molasses. Even if the operation of boiling is carried on with the greatest care, the burning is unavoidable, and the color of the sugar must invariably be affected by it, making it more or less brown. The crystals are small, and the loss by drainage during transportation excessive. It can be fairly set down, that, for every hogs head of sugar of about 1,000 pounds, the drainage of molasses in the sugar house amounts to 55 gallons of 12 pounds, or say 660 pounds; which quantity, at the actual price of 20 cents per gallon, or 1 cents per pound, would, if turned into sugar, bring double that price. I have seen molasses sugar, made by the improved methods with vacuum pans, which was better than fair, selling at five cents, or nearly double the price of the common kettle sugar. By the old method of boiling sugar we have therefore 1st. A laborious operation 2d. A notable loss of fuel 3d. A deep colored sugar. X. 313 4th. A large quantity of crystal liable sugar turned into molasses, and hence a reduction of income 2. Open kettles and open steam pan n this mode of boiling the juice is concentrated in open kettles to a certain degree, and brought to the striking point in steam pans. The first steam pan was introduced in Louisiana in the year 1829;it consisted of a serpentine tube coiled up at the bottom of a circular pan. Whether from the defective construction of the worm, or from want of knowledge in the management of this pan, they were set aside for nearly twelve years, when they came again into use. Pequeurs pan has been since introduced With some improvements. This combination of open kettles and open steam pans offers not the slightest advantage in regard to the economy of fuel, because the evaporation by steam consumes as muchcombustible matter as by the direct action of the fire. The only advantages which steam paris possess are: first, that the boiling can be stopped or discontinued instantaneously; second, the temperature can be kept up at an uniform degree, whereby the sir up is less over heated; nevertheless, the sugar produced with this kind of combination of open kettles and open steam pans, is not much better than such made in open kettles altogether; besides these pans are liable to get out of order, and cause often great delay at a time when every moment is of great importance to the sugar planters. The steam pans either heated with the worm or the improvedPequeurls plan, are very useful for defection of the juice. I saw them at Mr. Wilkinsons plantation advantageously employed for that purpose. Mr. Alfred Tillman of New York invented an apparatus for boiling sugar in open kettles and open steam pans, of which I annexed an abstract of the specification, illustrated with a sectional view of the apparatus. A. Tillman obtained letters patent for an improvement in evaporating sac charing juices, dated 17th August, 1843. The invention consists in placing between the usual train: of coppers" or 'kettles the chimney steam boiler, which shall, a employ the surplus or waste heat from the "train: in .gene rating steam for grinding cane, jumping, or any other purpose for which it may be required. :to supply the deficiency of evaporating power occasioned by diminishing the train of kettles, he substitutes in their place' any number of steam evaporators or clarifiers, into which is introduced the "exhaust" or waste steam from the steam engine This waste steam to be made effective must be introduced into the clarifiers or evaporators under a pressure greater than that of the atmosphere, and the effect will be in proportion to the pressure. The objects of this arrangement are, a saving of: fuel and improvement in the i quality of the product, and the improvement in the latter respect will be proportionate to that amount of the process of clarifying and evaporating which is transferred from the ordinary kettles in contact with the fire, to those making use of the waste steam314Ex. a. Fig. 49 is a section of the sugar works, in which are shown the application of the improvement, and respecting only a general arrangement, A A are the steam boilers so placed as to receive under them the waste heat from the train. B, the steam engine. E, pump for bringing the liquor from the reservoir to the clarifiersthrough the pipe F. This pump is not an essential fixture, as the mill is more frequently elevated to a height sufficiently for the liquor to run directly to the clarifiers. G G, the clarifiers; H, the evaporator, which is of the same form and construction as theclarifiers. I, K, L, a train of "coppers" or evaporators, such as are in common use. M, fire place for the train. N, the f lie, through which the flame passes from the "' train 1 under the steam boilers to the chimney. 0, P, is also a blue to the chimney, so that the flame from the " train " may be turned off from the steam boilers at will. R, exhaust steam pipe from the engine; this pipe communicates with the pipe sein the clarifiers or evaporators. S, the escape valve, by which a pressure is maintained in the exhaustpipeThe clarifiers are rectangular boxes of sheet iron, (boiler plate the bottoms of which are double, so as to form a steam chamber, a around the top they have a channel way (m) which forms the swimming spot" the swimmings, which it receives, are carried off by a pipe. In addition to the heating surface obtained by the double bottom, there is above it, one or more tiers of copper pipes. The method of introducing them is as follows: on two opposite sides of the clarifiers, is a cast iron box riveted, which forms the side chamber (b b) and extends the whole length of the clarifierthis chamber is closed by a move able plate which is fastened by bolts; these two opposite chambers are connected by the cross pipes c) the pipes are received into the chambers through " packingjointscid127" so as to prevent any communication between the steam in the chamber and the liquor within the clarifyer. To the top of one of the side chambers, there is a cylindrical valve chamber attached, which receives the steam from the exhaust pipe on either side from, the lower side of this valve chamber is a steam passage communicating with the chamber (b) this steam passage is opened or closed by means of a sliding valve (d When the engine is in operation, the waste steam passing through the exhaust pipe (R) is admitted through into the side chamber (band from thence into the pipes c c, and also through apertures intothe bottom chamber, a. The liquor in the clarifyer is then exposed to the heating surfaces of the pipes c e, and also of the "false for "double bottom Steam pipes passing through the liquor have been before employed, but not in combination with the double bottom. The advantage of this combination is this: by using the pipes alone, that portion of the liquor beneath them would be in a great measure unaffected, whilst the double bottom above would not give the necessary heating surface; so that the combination is necessary to a perfect operation h and i are two valves; one for discharging the clarifyed or cone x. 
315centrated liquor, and the other for discharging the sediment formed in clarifying. Their construction is as follows: the valve is the ordinary "puppet valve" with a hinge on the upper side for attaching the rods; the seat is fitted between the two bottoms of theclarifier and riveted to both; the pipes for carrying the liquor and sediment are attached by blanches and bolts to the bottom of the seats. The valves will close by their own weight, and the weight of the liquor above them will keep them tight; the valves are raised by cords connecting them to levers on the shaft R, which shaft is worked by a handle on the outside of the clarifyer. The valves are so placed that the levers stand in opposite directions, upon the same shaft, so that both valves can never be opened at the same time. S, the escape valve, made like an ordinary safety valve, (such as used on all steam boilers) and attached to the exhaust pipe of the engine. I to particular construction, however, is not essential, its purpose being to obtain all the useful effect of the waste steam, by confining it in the exhaust pipe and clarifiers at any required pressure. Suppose, for instance, that the engine is in operation, and the exhaust pipe terminating in the clarifiers, but in some part of the exhaust pipe there is an opening into the air, of a size equal to that of the pipe, the steam, of course, would escape through the opening against the pressure of the atmosphere only its effect in the clarifiers would then be very slight; but when that opening is closed by means of a loaded valve) (like an ordinary safety valve) we obtain some effect from the steam, and, by increasing the weight on the valve, we may so confine the waste steam as to effect the entire absorption of its heat in the clarifiersor evaporators, and without materially affecting the power of the engine. The operation of this apparatus is as follows: The flies N and being closed by dampers, (at the beginning of a days' work a fire is made under the steam boilers at i, (fig. 1,) in the ,usual manner. As soon as a sufficiency of steam is generated the engine and cane mill are put in operation. The pump E is then put in operation, and the liquor carried to the clarifiers G, G, through the pipe F; the steam is then admitted from the exhaust pipe intothe clarifiers; and the liquor having gone through the usual process of clarifying, is discharged by means of the valves (h, h) intothe evaporators I H, and through that into the train of coppers ; K, L, where the evaporation is to be completed. These coppers or kettles being filled with the clarifyed liquor, the furnace is closed, and the fire started under the Trains of coppers on the furnace M, by which fire, besides effecting the concentration of the liquor in the kettles, the steam is generated in the boilers, and the operation continued. The steam clarifiers may be used indiscriminately in clarifying or evaporating, as the case may require. Of the train of coppers be very much diminished, more of the evaporation, of course, must be carried on in the steam evaporator 316 x. alfred Tillman also invented a steam sugar pan, for which he obtained letters patent dated May 16, 1846. The following description is taken from the specification recorded in the United Statespatent Office: "I n the evaporating, pans, as heretofore made, the main and branch pipes are divided by horizontal partitions, the steam passing into the main pipe below the partition, thence through each of the branch pipes (which are single) below the partitions and around the end thereof, and back over the partitions to the upper division of the main pipe, and thence out the branch pipes being permanently secured to the main pipes The objections to this mode are various, but the most important are, the great cost of original construction, and the difficulties of repair both of which are in a great measure obviated by my improvements, which consist, first, in dividing the main pipe by a vertical partition in the middle of its length, in combination with bent crank pipes that connect each with the main pipe on each side of the partition, so that the steam that enters one division of the main pipe, passes into and through the last branch pipes to the other divisions before it passes out Secondly. In connecting the branch pipes with the main pipes by a shoulder and socket joint, which admits of fitting by turning the end of the branch, and brings the face of the main pipes in combination with the mode of securing them air tight by means of screws which pass through the main pipe, and are tapped into tubes, connected with the end of the branch pipes by blanches to admit of the passage of the steam which mode of adjustment and connection admits of easy adjustment in the original construction, of the easy removal of any of the branch pipes for repairs, cleaning, and of tightening the joints in the event of a leak, by simply turning the screw belonging to the pipe that leaksThirdly. In connecting the main pipe with the induction and eruption pipes, by means of double packed joints to admit of turning, up the branch pipes to clean the pipes and the pan when necessary Figure 50.,a, represents a sugar or evaporating pan with a double bottom to form a chamber below for the circulation of steam, in the usual manner. The main circulating steam pipe (c) is connected with the pan and the induction (d) and eduction pipes in such manner as to admit of turning. , The ends of the main pipe e) are turned, and fit in sockets (ff) attached to the sides of the pan, and to the ends of the pipe are fitted short tubes, (g g) and the joints made steam tight by means, of stuffing boxes, (h h) and the short pipes (g g) are then connected with the induction and eduction pipes by means of the stuffing boxes, (i i) the induction pipe being provided with a stop cock (k) in the usual manner, and the eduction pipe, connected with the bottom of the pan in any desired manner The face of the main pipe, to which the branch pipes (i) are secured, is made flat, and provided with an equal number of holes on each side of the central position, [see dotted line m] unto x. 317 which the ends of the bent branch pipes (1) are fitted, so that each branch pipe communicates with both divisions of the main pipe. The ends of the branch pipes are turned to fit accurately the holes in the main pipe, and they are also provided with blanches that fit the face of the main pipe accurately, and they are then secured by screws (o) that pass through the main pipe and are tapped into tubular nuts in the ends of the branch pipes, and connected with them by rings, (r) Of desired, the blanches (n) and the heads of the screws (o) may be packed to insure air tight joint shapes 'y Box patented a pan for evaporating sac charing liquors 11, dated 7th January, 1846, which consists of .a series of short straight pipes of copper, A, (see section, figure 51,) or other metal, communicating with each end with a metallic box, or tube, B, B', running the whole length of the series: an arrangement which offers the least possible obstruction to the circulation of steam, and permits the pipes, A, to be laid at such an inclination as will insure the immediate running of the condensed water as it forms. Steam is admitted from the boiler, or vessel in which it is generated, into the box, B, with which the raised ends of the pipes communicate, from whence it passes into and fills the pipes and there yields up its heat, which, being transmitted through the copper or material of the pipes, heats or eva pirates the fluid surrounding them. The water formed by condensation of the steam flows into the box, B', at the lower ends of the pipes, from whence it is conducted away, either to waste, or into a cistern for re supplying the steam boiler. The pipes are inclined not less than an inch, or three-fourths of an inch in a foot; the inclination being greater as the length of the pipes is greater, as it is important that the water should not be suffered to accumulate in them, owing to the injurious effect it has upon their evaporating power. I n order that the condensed water may be got rid of without letting steam escape, there may be connected with the box, B, some one of the many contrivances for this purpose now in use; for example, a vessel in which is a ball cock so arranged as to let off the water only The pan, D, contains two series of copper pipes, (A, A,) a little less than five feet in length. The bottom of the pan has an inclination from the ends towards the middle of about one inch to the foot; and, as pipes rest upon the bottom, they have a like inclination. Across the middle of the pan is a gutter (d) which receives the sir up as it runs down the bottom, and conducts it to the centre, where the discharge valve (E) is placed. The discharge valve is controlled by a lever which permits of its being raised from the outside. The steam boxes (B, B) of both series, connected to one steam pipe (G) in which is a stop valve (H) for shutting off the steam, and connected with this stop valve is a pipe leading from the steam boiler. The box (B) is rectangular; one side has openings in it into which the pipes are screwed; the other side is closed by a cap (see' figure 52.) The cap is also rectangular, and resembles a box having only the top, bottom, and one side, and when in place, looks like a box of smaller dimensions fitted into318Ex. the side of one of larger dimensions. The inside of the top and bottom of the box, and the outside of the top and bottom of the cap, are planned to make a better joint: and in planning the box, a rabbit, or shoulder (b) is left upon the top and bottom, against which the cap comes. Red lead, or some suitable substance, is put in the joint, and the surfaces are brought together by screw bolts j) passing through the cap and box. The water box, (B') the form of which is not essential, but for convenience is made semi elliptical, is cast entirely closed, except the openings into which the pipes screw, and an opening in the under side, and near one end, through which the condensed water is led away The pipes (A) are formed in the usual way, by rounding a piece of copper of the proper width and length, and grazing the edgestogetherThe ends of the pipes are drawn in a little, and have brass collars (a, a) b razed upon them, upon which the screw thread is cut. The end which screws into the water box is so much smaller than the other end, as to permit it to pass through the hole in the steam box, into which the other end fits, and the pipe is screwed into both boxes at the same timefThe form of the cap, above described, for closing the steam box, is preferable to any other which we have used, for two reasons: it forms a joint imperious to water and steam, and it permits the apparatus to lay close to the bottom of the pan, by which means a small charge of sir up can be boiled. It is an established fact in sugar making, that the less the quantity of juice, or sir up, operated upon, and the shorter the time it is under treatment, the better will be the result both as to quantity and quality 3. Open kettles and vacuum pans By this mode of boiling sugar, the cane juice is concentrated in the common kettle, to the density of 29 or 30 degrees Beaume, and finished in the vacuum pan. Mr. Thomas A. Organ was the first who introduced a modification of Towards vacuum pan, to bring the sir up which has been concentrated in open kettles therein to the striking point. Mr. Organ' kindly offered to furnish me with notes from his careful and extensively kept memorandum books, not only in regard to the boiling of sugar in va cut, but of all the various operations concerning a plantation. Time, however, would not permit me to avail myself of his kind offer, but I hope another year to obtain some valuable data from this experienced and disinterested planter, who has spent many thousands of dollars in experiments to improve the manufacture of sugar direct from the cane juice. The vacuum pans used in Louisiana are made of boiler iron, resembling in form and construction locomotive boilers. These vacuum pans are heated with low pressure steam, the sir up is not liable to be burnt, and the sugar is far superior to any made in the modes already described. With the use of animal charcoal filters, sugar of superior quality can be produced. This mode of boiling sugar, however, affords no economy in fuel; and, I believe, requires even more than in the common mode in open kettles; because it needs two furnaces to be heated-one for the open kettles, the other for x. the generation of steam to work the air pump and heat the vacuum pan. The vacuum pan which I saw in operation at Mr. T. Organs was constructed by Messrs. Morris & To, of Philadelphia, a beautiful specimen of workmanship; the price I was informed was                                               $2,800. The arrangement of the pipes in these pans is shown in a longitudinal section through the dotted line x x, figure 53. Figure 54 represents a vertical section of the pan 4. Open high pressure steam pans his apparatus consists of a number of pans, wherein the juice and sir up are heated either, by means of a worm, by Pecqueurs or Tillman S plan. The steam is generated in boilers, and conducted to the set of steam pans by a mean steam pipe, from which the steam is carried to every separate pan by a branch pipe. Fr. Duplessis obtained letters patent for an apparatus where the sac charing liquid is partly elaborated by pans exposed directly to the steam generated in the steam boiler, and partly by steam pans with double bottoms or jackets, which is more fully described in an extract from the specification, and illustrated by a drawing. This kind of apparatus has never been used with any success, and whenever they have been employed with some advantage the sugar has seldom turned out to be of a better, but oftener of an inferior, quality to that made in open kettles, and the consumption of fuel is from 25 to 30 per cent. greater than in the usual mode of boiling, owing to the great amount of pipes leading the steam through all the various steam pans, causing a great waste of calorie by radiation. In the mode of boiling in open kettles, the great amount of heat is lost through the chimney; very little is wasted through radiation, as the furnaces are built under ground or surrounded with earth. Duplessiss mode of boiling sugar, for which he obtained letters patent, dated 16th December, 1846 Figure 55 is a longitudinal vertical section* The methods heretofore practised for evaporating saccharinejuice in the manufacture of sugar are setting the series of kettles in a furnace, the flies therefrom passing under them, or making the kettles with double bottoms, into and through which steam is caused to pass by means of pipes from a steam genera to r. The former of these is very objectionable, on account of the practical difficulty of regulating the temperature to avoid burning the sir up, which of course spoils the sugar; and the latter on account of the waste of heat, and the original cost of construction, the steam being conducted from the genera to r to the double bottoms of the pans through long pipes, which, together- with the outer causing of the kettles, are exposed to the condensing influence of the surrounding atmosphere. To remedy these evils is the great object of my invention, which consists in arranging the whole series of kettles, for evaporating the sac charing juice and sir up, on the top of a steam boiler, with their bottoms, or all that portion of their surface which is to be heated, within the boiler, to be exposed to the direct action of the steam within the boiler; instead of taking320Ex. the steam from the genera to r and conducting it through pipes exposed to the atmosphere; whereby I effect a saving of fuel and room, and avoid the whole expense in the original structure of making the double bottoms of the kettles and the pipes, &c. But simply putting the bottoms of the kettles in the boiler will not suffice, as this arrangement will not enable the attendant to moderate the temperature of any of the kettles, as is frequently required, without affecting the whole series at the same time; and therefore to meet this end I have devised my second invention, which consists simply in providing the boiler with one or more partitions, with a valve in each, so that by the closing of the valve or valves steam may be blown off from that section which heats the kettle or kettles, to be reduced in temperature, thus putting the apparatus wholly under the control of the attendant. In the accompanying drawings, fig. 55 (A) is the furnace, constructed in accordance with the most approved plans, and (B) the blue leading therefrom to the chimney. The boiler (D) is made with the bottom semi cylindrical, the sides vertical, and the top nearly flat, and deeper at the front end (D') than at the rear (D) to make the top incline from front to rear. It is provided with a man hole and a safety valve a teach end of the usual construction; and to these must be added supply pumps in the usual manner. The evaporating kettles (E, E', E", E'") constructed in the usual manner, are let into the top of the boiler, which is pierced with large holes for this purpose, the blanches of the kettles being bolted steam tight to the top plate of the boiler, which, being inclined from front to rear, gives to the tops of the range or series of kettles the same inclination to facilitate the transfer of the s cum from them to a delivery depot (d) at the lower end. The kettles are further surrounded by woodwork (e, e) representing tiling, to form a sloped rim around the kettles to prevent the sum in the boiler from running over. The kettles in the series are of different sizes; the larger at the lower or back end, (D,) and the smaller in the upper or front end, (D',) the size being gradually reduced from what is called the "grande" to the "batteries" to correspond with the reduced bulk of the sir up as it evaporatesfrom the sac charing juice to the concentrated sir up prepared for granulating. The sac charing juice is ,heated preparatory to its introduction into the first of the series of kettles, (E,) by means of pans, F, F) arranged back of the boiler and above the level of the kettles, so as to conduct the juice after it is heated by a pipe (which communicates with the bottoms of the pans, (F,) by small vertical pipes (g, g, g) provided with valves, (h, h, h) the stems of which extend up above the top of the pans. Other valves (i, i i, )are adapted to their bottoms for the purpose of cleaning them. These pans are heated by steam conducted from the boiler (through the space (k, k, k) between these double bottoms, by means of a steam pipe provided with branch pipes leading to each pan, and each having a cock to shut off or let on the steam. The boiler D is divided in its length into two compartments, by ax. a, 321 vertical partition (H) provided with a valve (n) which may be operated by a stem passing through a stuffing box in the side of the boiler, so that by closing this valve, steam can be blown off from either, and to reduce the temperature under the kettles, when deemed essential by the attendant, and, when sufficiently reduced, the valve may be opened to restore an equilibrium of temperature. In this way the boiling may be regulated with great facility and accuracy. I instead of one partition and valve for four kettles, the number may be increased so as to have one for each kettle; but I deem one for four kettles sufficient for all practical purposes. William Graham obtained, letters patent, 10th March, 1843,fora steam boiling apparatus, of which fig. 56 is a vertical section. The evaporating kettles A, in which the juice is elaborated, and made of copper, or other suitable material, are of different sizes, and are arranged on different levels the largest in this arrangement being the highest the kettles gradually diminishing in size from the kettle termed the grand A' to that which is termed the battery 4, the upper edge of each kettle being placed nearly on a level with the bottom of the preceding one, and communicating the one with the other by suitable tubes, B, provided with cocks, C, for opening or closing communication from one boiler to the other. The evaporators A are placed in semi spherical cast iron, or other metallic shells or jackets, D, of larger size than the evaporators, so made and arranged as to leave a space, E, between the two, to admit steam from a common boiler by which the evaporator s are to be heated, the steam being heated through branch tubes, F, of a main tube, G, leading from the steam boiler; all said tubes being furnished with stop cocks for regulating the admission of the steam, and consequently the degree of heat required. Theevaporators are provided with pipes and cocks for letting off the liquid from one to the other. The condensed steam is made to flow back into the boiler constantly by arranging the main steam pipe immediately beneath the kettles in a position inclining upwards from the boiler, with vertical branch tubes leading intothe same from the lower part of the jackets, through which steam is admitted to the spaces between the jackets and kettles, and by which the condensed steam is suffered to flow back into the boiler by its gravity, thereby preventing the evaporation of the steam by keeping it constantly enclosed from the atmosphere. Open Of Of Pressure Steam And Vacuum Pans5. The relative advantage and disadvantage of the open high pressure steam pans, as well as those of the vacuum pans, has been pointed out already. The combination of one of those systems with another produces, in regard to the economy of fuel, no advantage whatever. When the proper care is taken in evaporating the juice in the pans, so as not to over heat and burn it, and when the operation of evaporation in the vacuum pan is carried on with low pressure steam, sugar of good quality can be produced, especially when bone black is used. The sugar, when properly managed, is equal to any made by the improved modes hereafter described, 11 322 X. a. The vacuum pan, used in combination with open kettles or high pressure steam pans, have always the advantage, that the planter is enabled to re boil his molasses. Two Vacuum Pans6. a his mode of boiling sugar requires a careful defection and felt ration of the juice and sir up through animal charcoal. The cane juice, after having been defeated, is passed through bone black filters, collected in a vat from which the first vacuum pan is supplied; when the cane juice is concentrated therein to 280 or 290 of Beaume, or whereabouts, it is drawn off into a vat from whence the concentrated juice is passed again through bone black filters, collected into a proper vat from which the second vacuum pan is supplied, where it is then brought to the striking point. The vacuum pans used in this mode of boiling are like those described under the mode of boiling in open kettles and vacuum pans; they are heated with low pressure steam, and, consequently, the burning of the concentrated sac charing liquid is thereby obviated. When the operations of defection, filtering, and boiling, are well managed, the sugar is equal in every respect to any made in any apparatus of the most improved method. I saw at Mr. William sons plantation, where two vacuum pans for boiling are used, sugar of an exceedingly light color and beautiful large crystals. By this mode of boiling sugar, the consumption of fuel is as great as with common kettles. These kinds of vacuum pans require a great quantity of fresh water for condensing, which is not difficult to obtain along the banks, of the Mississippi and ba you; but, in places where water is scarce, vacuum pans of this description cannot be employedbDegrands apparatusDegrands system consists of a condenser. The vapors arising from the juice or sir up boiled in a vacuum pan and condensed by means of a serpentine tube, over which a film of cold juice is continually kept flowing, which absorbs the latent heat of the vapor within the tube, and a portion of the water from the juice passes off as vapor in the air. He grands condenser serves the double purpose of a condenser and evaporator. There are only two of He grands apparatus* in Louisiana. One is owned by Mr. Balfour Time, the other by Mr. Cap ice. They are more commonly known as Derosnes apparatus; but justice to the inventor compels me to give the apparatus its proper appellation. In 1846, when at Paris, I had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with Mr. He grand, the real inventor and patentee of this apparatus, from whom I learnt that Messrs. Heroine & Nail were only the contractors and as signers of his apparatus for the north of France and all the colonies. I was informed that the He grand apparatus, in operation in Louisiana, have vacuum pans with a very large heating surface, and heated with low pressure steam; the air pumps are larger than those used in the I s land of Cuba. The artificial draught of air is not Constructed by Messrs, Allen; Tillman, & To, at the Novelty Works, New Work, X. a. 323 made use of here, but the same result is obtained by the injection of water between the condenser and air pump; this increases somewhat the consumption of fuel, but the vacuum obtained in that way is as perfect as by means of the draught of air; and the sugar made with this apparatus is as good as any made in Louisiana. I have seen this apparatus at work in the be et sugar man factories in Germany in my last tour through that country; but the manufacturers were beginning to abandon its use, in consequence of the practical difficulties in distributing the be et juice regularly over the serpentine; and in case one of the many tubes which form the serpentine has the slightest deviation from the straight line, the juice will concentrate more at such depressions, and disturb the regular distribution of juice over the tubes. When a leak happens, the juice or sir up is rapidly absorbed into the interior of the tube on account of the vacuum, and causes a considerable loss. I tis likewise found that the economy of water for condensing is not so great as was anticipated, and finally it was concluded to return to the former plan of boiling in common vacuum pans. The consumption of fuel by a He grands apparatus is 1 to 2 cords of wood for every 1,000 pounds of sugar produced. I have been told that in the I s land of Cuba this apparatus takes off the whole crop with the bag as se alone; however, some require great quantities of wood besides the bag as se. Mr. Heroine obtained a patent in this country, dated in Europe, 1836, and in America, July 10, 1845. The following description of the mode of working his apparatus, is taken from his patent, on record in the United States Patentoffice. The method of manufacturing is described therein as follows The juice is expressed from cane, or other material, in a mill of usual construction. The juice which is taken from the mills is defeated in pans, or boilers, a row of which is shown at f f f, figure 58. In figure 57,the elevation of one of these boilers, f, is represented. The juice from the mill passes into a reservoir, d, that is connected by a pipe (d) with an air tight cylinder, c, in which pipe there is a, stop cock that is turned by a long handle, (d) by turning which, the cylinder, e, can be filled, and the communication can be afterward cut off by admitting steam from the genera torn, or boilers shown in figure 58, G, in dotted lines, that supplies steam to the engines and heating apparatus of the whole manufactory) into the top of the cylinder, e. The juice is forced through a pipe, e, in the bottom of said cylinder, up into the clarifying boilers, f, which is constructed with a double bottom, between which steam is admitted by the tube (a) from the genera to r; the condensed water being returned to the boilers by a force pump through the pipe b) The construction is common, and a more particular description is not deemed necessary; but the employment of the series of these pans, for this purpose, has never before been done, or the juice clarifyed, as about to be described. When the cane juice has reached the point proper for receiving324Ex. the clarifying mixture, which point is from 60 to 630 of Beaum6it is added. This composition is made by a compound of the sulphate of alum in of the cheapest character, either with or without the presence of iron, which is formed by mixing sulphuric acid with a luminous earth, and adding thereto lime, potash, or other similar salt, and a quantity of liquefied blood, "either fresh or dried, being incorporated into the precipitate. This is united with the juice by carefully stirring it while pouring in the mixture, andclarifies it; or, instead of this, lime alone can be used, as in my former processes, the quantity being much greater than that used in the old colonial mode of proceeding, as, in this system, there is nothing to fear from an excess of lime, which a subsequent part of the process perfectly corrects to any extent that it may have been found necessary to use it, in order to obtain a good clarification. The steam is kept on until the juice begins to boil, and when this point is reached, the steam is cut off. The result of this is, where the mixture is used, that at the top of the boiler, f, f, a thick and solid coat of s cum is formed, and only a very small quantity of matter is precipitated to the bottom of the boiler. In a few minutes the liquor will have become clear, and can be drawn off through a tube, (m) by turning a cock in the bottom by means of a key my) when it can be ascertained if the liquor is limp id. A small quantity of thick matter usually issues from the tube first, but it soon runs clear. By this mode of proceeding, we avoid all the troublesome labor of swimming, &c, which is rendered necessary. The juice, after leaving the tube, (m) passes into a gutter (which communicates by a pipe (c) with another reservoir, (j) by which the filters, hereafter described, are charged with the juice. When all the clear juice is drawn off, the s cum and the remainder is drawn into a reservoir underneath, after which bags are filled with it, and the sir up is drained and pressed out of it. The clarifyed cane juice in the reservoir F, is next to be filtered through animal charcoal in grain; and this felt ration constitutes one of the most important operations of the manufacture it purified the juice to a degree hitherto unknown, and furnishes the means for readily obtaining sugar of the first quality. In Fig. 57, eight of these filters are represented, (h, h, h) all of the same construction; the same are shown in Fig. 58. They are constructed to contain about one and one-seventh tons of animal charcoal. They are made of sheet iron or wood lined with copper, of a square form, narrowing slightly toward the bottom. At the lower part there isa grating, leaving a small space between that and the bottom, through which the filtered liquid flows. In this grating is placed a thick blanket, for the purpose of supporting the charcoal, which should be sufficiently large to allow the edges to be pressed against the sides; a thick layer of charcoal is then spread over this blanket firmly and evenly, after which another layer of charcoal is put on, care being taken to equal i ze it with a trowel as it is thrown in, and the filter is filled thus to about four and a half feet in depth; the upper surface is then carefully smoothed, and it is ready for use. X. 325 plate is laid on the place where the cock discharges the juice or sir up into the filter, in order that it may spread horizontally over the surface without forming hollows therein. The sir up penetrates the animal charcoal, and drives the air down before it, which is discharged from a pipe that leads up from the space below the grating to the top of the filter. The sir up, after passing through the grating and having deposited all its impure ties in the filter above, is drawn off through the cock in the bottom, from whence it is conducted to a reservoir, shown in Fig. 58 by the letter k, from which it is elevated by a cylinder (1) into a reservoir, (a) This cylinder or montejus is made and operate s precisely the same as that above described and shown in fig. 57. From the reservoir 1 of figure 58, the juice is conveyed to the evaporator, which is one of the most important parts of my invention, and is constructed as follows: Figure 58, (C' C" C"') being a top plan, and figure 57 a side elevation thereof; it consists of a double or triple series of horizontal tubes of 8- inches in diameter, and about 300 feet in length, each series being placed one over the other, forming two or three parallel lines; the tubes of each series are connected together at each end, so as to form one long conductor for the steam, by which they are heated, as hereafter described. The tubes of each series are supported by two upright posts, one at each end, which are connected at the top by a crossbeam or cup brace just under this beam; there is a bracket on the inside of each post, which supports a triangular shaped trough or distributor, (P,) that extends from one to the other, the lower edge of said trough being serrated, without being cut through, and standing directly over the centre of the upper tube of the series, (one side of this trough has a row of small vertical of long holes in it, through which the juice received from the reservoir (1) perforates, and guided by the lower serrated edge, drops upon the top of the upper tube, spreads itself around it, and then falls on the next, and so on to the bottom, passing over the entire surface of the tubes, which, by the heat of the steam within them, serve to e vapor ate some of the aqueous portions of the juice that is then received at the bottom in a receiver, (t) and ultimately into the reservoir u) and the juice being heated by the tubes, and being exposed to the action of the air in a state of extreme division, is elaborated, and conducted in a proportion determined by the rate at which it escapes from the distributor above, as it falls into the receiver (to is a pan of a common construction for boiling by steam in vacuum, with the usual fixtures attached here to, a particular description of which, therefore, is not deemed necessary; a vacuum is formed by an apparatus hereafter named, in the boiler A, and by opening a communication between the boiler and the reservoir (u through the connecting pipe (d) which extends from the bottom of said reservoir to the pan the juice contained in the reservoir rushes into the pan. As soon as the pan is filled, which is ascertained by means of the glasses in the lid of the pan, the pipe (dis stopped, and the steam is introduced into the respective theaters of the boilers from the steam generators326Ex. a. The steam which rises from the juice in the pan into the cup h) passes through a tube (a) into a large upright cylinder, B, which I de nominate a safety vase, and in which any saccharinematter is separated from the steam which has been forced up with it. From the vase B, the steam passes by the pipes (e) into each series of tubes above described, (lettered C', C', C"',) entering the upper tubes of the series and passing out of the lower ones on the opposite sides; the steam, in passing through the tube, (C,) is condensed by the juice which runs down over the outside, the apparatus thus performing the twofold operation of evaporating the juice and forming a condenser for the steam rising from the vacuum pan. The steam, when condensed into water, runs out of the lower tubes, as above named, into an injecting cylinder, D, where, if the condensation is not perfect, water can be injected to complete it; from the cylinder D, the water of condensation, &c, is drawn off by the action of the air pump attached to a steam engine, all of which are of usual construction, and their location is indicated in the drawing by E. The pump and cylinder D, above named, may be omitted, and a ventilator placed in their stead, as will be obvious to any competent mechanics; but the vacuum will not in that case be so complete, although the expense of the apparatus is somewhat reduced. I instead of attaching the condenser with the vacuum pan, as above described, it may be connected with the exhaust pipe of the steam engine. As the depth of juice in vacuum pan A is reduced by evaporation down to the h eaters inside, a further supply is to be admitted from u, through the pipe, (d) as in the first instance; and when the juice under evaporation acquires a density of 24 or 250 of Beaume, it must be drawn out of the pan, the passage of the steam to the h eaters being first cut off, and the vacuum therein destroyed. The sir up at 250 then passes through a move able spot, L, which is directed into another spot, N, and thence into the reservoir I, after which the boiler is charged with juice from u, and the process again proceeds as before. During the operation of emptying and refilling the pan, the time is so short as not to require the stopping of the flow of the cane juice over the outside of the tubes C', C", U". From the reservoir I, the sir up is raised, by means of a hand pump, J, into a spot which is represented at i, figure 58, for feeding the filters before described. The sir up runs from the spot i into either of the filters (h) through stop cocks attached& thereto for that purpose, and passing down through the filters, as above described, it is soon after drawn off through the cock and received into the gutter, (i) whence it is conducted into the reservoir k figure 58, and when there is a sufficient quantity therein to fill the pan A, the other processes are stopped, and the pan A is filled with the sir up from the reservoir k, by means of a pipe, u, which connect them by a proceeding similar to that for filling the pan from the reservoir u. The evaporation of this sir up of 25 is then proceeded with until it is sufficiently boiled, which is ascertained x. a. 327 by the testing rod of common form. When the sir up is in a proper state of condensation, the pan is to be emptied, by means of the move able spot L, through the spot N, into one or the other of the heating pans shown by letter F. The pans F have double bottoms, and are supplied with steam a from the genera torn between the two bottoms, by which they are heated, until the temperature of the sir up contained therein reaches 700 Beaume, at which point crystal ligation almost immediately commences; and when it is quite determined, the mixture of crystals and sir up must be stirred with a wooden s pa tula, care being taken to distribute the crystal formed on the bottom and sides equally; the matter is then, while in a liquid state, ready to pour into the moulds. In the process of felt ration, hereinbefore named, as soon as it is found that from the use of the filter the sir up of 25" comes from it less pure than at first, it is stopped and turned into another filter the clarifyed juice is then admitted into the filter from spot (j this drives the sir up still contained in the filter down, and takes its place. When the degree of the flowing sir up is found to be reduced to 15, the juice flowing from the cock is directed into the gutter j, which conducts it into the reservoir k, from whence it takes its course as before indicated. When the animal charcoal is sufficiently exhausted by the felt ration of the clarifyed juice, water is let on to the filter, and assumes the place of the clarifyed juice in the same way as the juice did the sir up; by this means the greater part of the juice is recovered, the flow being stopped when the degree of the liquid is too weak to be of value. The coal is then taken out of the filter and conveyed to the revivifier, described in the remarks on animal charcoal, and the filter is again re filled with fresh black. D6rosne claims as his invention, first, the method of renewing or restoring the animal charcoal, as set forth in the specification and found in the remarks on animal charcoal, by means of the revolving cylinder placed over two fires in the manner specified, by which it is heated gradually to the proper temperature. Second, he claims the employment of a series of horizontal tubes, placed one above another, in the manner described, having a current of steam passing through them, and the cane juice flowing over the exterior surface, by which the steam is condensed and the juice is somewhat concentrated; thus serving the double purpose of condenser and evaporator as before described, said condenser being attached either to the vacuum pan or the exhaust pipe of the steam engine. In regard to the novelty of this mode of evaporation and condensing, I shall speak in my next report. The price of a two metre vacuum pan, two condensing evaporators of 23 pipes each, two air pumps of 10 inches diameter, worked by a five horse high pressure engine, without steam boiler, 30,000 francs, (about                            $5,700:) the complete apparatus delivered in Paris, cost                                                            $20,370. It is called the 500 hectolitre appara328 X. it us, or apparatus of the first magnitude, working 11, 00 44 imperial g allons of cane juice in twenty-four hours time, with steam from 60 to 75 pounds on the square in cher. D. W. Villa Urrutia, of Cuba, ordered in 1843 an apparatus of He grand, at Heroine & Nails, to boil 13,205 imperial gallons16000 pounds sugar) in twenty-four hours, which has cost, including steam clarifiers, filters, charcoal reburners, &c, &c, so as to form a complete modern apparatus, delivered at Paris,                           $32,000.tc.-Rillieux's apparatusNorbert Rillieux, a native of Neworleans, invented an apparatus for boiling sugar in va cut, in which he uses the latent heat arising from one pan to boil the juice or sir up in succession in another vacuum pan of similar construction. To heat the first pan he uses the escape steam of the steam engine which works the grinding mill; the second, third, or fourth pan, is heated from the vapors arising from the second and third pans. An air pump produces the necessary vacuum. Mr. Rillieux obtained letters patent for his invention, dated August 26, 1843, and for improvement in the same, dated 10th December, 1846. The following description and drawings will give a correct idea of the apparatus, and its mode of working itRillieuxs boiling apparatus is composed of three or four pans. The four pan apparatus The cane juice after having passed the clarifiers and filters flows into a vat, from which it is pumped in the first pan, A, through a pipe, a, figure 61, which leads to the back part of that pan, on which pipe there is a stop cock which is opened or closed by means of a handle (b) placed in front of the apparatus, where the man who manages the apparatus is placed and, in turning that handle more or less, he can regulate the feeding of that pan, in front of which is a pipe, c, figures 59 and 61,leading the cane juice to the back part of the second pan, B; on that pipe and under the first pan is a stop cock, worked by the hand d, by which the feeding of the second pan B is regulated; and in the front, on this second pan and below, is another stop cock, worked by the hand e; from that stop- cock a pipe (e) leads to the back of pan C, to convey the cane juice, now at the density of 15 degrees Beaume, into said pan; and from this pan a pipe leads to a pump which draws the sir up, now arrived at 28 degrees, from the pan c, and forces it up to the clarifiers E, E. In those clarifiers the sir up is heated up to the boiling point and scummed from thence it passes through the bone black filters G, G, whence it goes to a vat, H, figure 60, below, to supply the fourth or strike pan, D. Now let us follow the steam The exhaust steam from the boilers goes through the pipe I, figures 59 and 60, to the first pan, A. Below that is another, K, which brings the direct steam I from the boiler and feeds the clear* In Sugar Cultivation in Louisiana and Cuba page 41, first part.

At M, figure 60, is a valve which connects the two steam pipes together, and through which any quantity of direct steam wanted, besides the exhaust steam, can be let into the exhaust steam pipe I, for boiling the juice. The vapors arising from the cane juice of the pan A, are carried down through a pipe, h, (see figures 62 and 63,) and column i, in a cast iron box, of, steam chest k. A part of this steam passes up through the column 1 to feed the second pan, B, and passes through the horizontal pipe, m, (see figure 61,) and up the column q, to feed the strike pan D. The vapor arising from the second pan, B, passes through column n and steam chest k, and up through the column o, to boil the pan C. The vapor from C D passes through the columns p, 2,through the horizontal pipe s, and brings the vapor to the condensers, where it is condensed by means of a jet of water; the vacuum being maintained through the means of an ordinary air pump, T. S is a pipe which connects the jumping engine with the condenser, the third and fourth pan. The waste water of the first pan, A, comes down through pipe, t, (see figure 63,) into an air tight chest in the bottom plate of the jumping engine, from which the force pump, u, takes it and sends it back to the steam boilers. The waste water of the second and third pans, which is the condensed water of the vapor arising from the cane juice in the first and second pans, passes through similar stop cocks and pipes, which carry it to the small air pump, U, which forces it up to a vat, where it serves for all the cleansings of the establishment. Three pan apparatus When the three pan apparatus is used, the cane juice is pumped into the first pan, A; from thence to the third, C; the second, marked B, is omitted; whence it is drawn off by the pump to the clarifiers, and the juice follows the same course as in the four pan apparatus, above described. The exhaust steam, and the direct steam are let in the first pan by means of the valve M, above mentioned, and the vapor arising from this pan feeds the pan, C, and the third pan, D, and the vapor of the second, C, and third, D, goes as in the other apparatus, already described, to the condenser. The waste water of the second, C, and third, D, follows the same course as already described in the four pan apparatus, to the small air pump. As the main part of the boiling in the apparatus is effected by the exhaust steam of the mill engine, the mill must be kept grinding at a uniform speed, and with a continually regular supply of cane; and as the power of the engine is regulated by the difference of pressure between the steam in the boilers aid the steam in the exhaust pipe, and, as that difference is regulated by the weight on the valve, M, it follows that, in loading that valve, M, more or less, the different pressure of steam, or what is called the effective pressure of the steam, is adjusted in such a way that the mill will furnish as much cane juice as the apparatus boils in such a way that the clarifiers, filters, and filtered juice vat are always kept full. Due liquid flows from the mill up to the clarify. fires and down to the filters, with the same speed as it comes from the mill, the cane juice passing out of the aforesaid vat as fast a sit comes in, to supply the first pan, and from thence to the second pan, (or third, as the case may be) when it is brought to the density of 290 Beaume. A small pump is attached to the engine to take it out of that pan fast enough to keep the sir up at a certain height in it. The sir up is pumped into one of the clarifiers, E, as high as the jacket reaches; when that clarifyer is filled to that point, the rest of the sir up is turned into the other, which is heated by letting in the steam before it is full; when the first clarifyer has reached the boiling point, the steam is shut off, the s cum removed, and the liquid emptied by the cock W into a trough, and thence down to the filters. The only operation which the attendants of the pans have to observe is to keep the juice or sir up at the proper level in the first and second pans, and to feed them as well as the third pan in such away that the sir up be maintained at 290 Beaume in the second pan or third, as the case may be) by opening or closing the feedingCcid127cks when the sir up runs too thick or too thin, or when the juice is too high or too low, and also to regulate the pressure of the steam by the valve M. It will be observed that there are two sets of clarifiers, E One set to boil the sir up, and the other set todefecate the juice as it comes from the mill. When the stop cocks are regulated, they require a constant watching by the person employed at the pans; but they remain, sometimes, hours without being moved, or the handles require to be moved more than one-eighth of an inch to one or the other side to keep the cane juice at the proper height, and the sir up at its proper density. The cane juice, when it leaves the mill, passes in a constant stream to the clarifyer E, from thence to the filters and pans, and returns again to the clarifyer F, at sir up of 290 density, and from there it goes through the bone black filters G G to the rat H, which again supplies the strike pan, and then, at last, the boiling is done by strikes, as the sugar boiler called it. The juice goes from the first into the second in the three pan apparatus, and from the first to the second, and from the second to the third, in the four pan apparatus; because, in the latter apparatus, there is more vacuum in the second than in the first, and More in the third than in the second; and it is that excess of vacuum which draws the cane juice from one pan into the other. The waste water of the juice clarifyer F F comes through i pe x in the steam chamber of the first pan; on which pipe there is a three way cock, which, when properly turned, sends it directly back to the waste water pipe t of the first pan. The waste water of the two other clarifiers, E E, comes directly to the waste water pipe t of said pan. When the second pan is boiling, the three way cock is turned to bring said waste water from the cane juice clarifyer to the steam chamber of the first pan; and all the steam arising from said waste water upwards miles itself with theshauitst steam, and helps the boiling of said pan; the water flows to x. 331 the lower row of pipes through the other end of the pan, and miles itself with the waste water of said pan, and goes down through the waste water pipe t, mixed with the waste water of the clarifyer E To the closed chest in the bed plate of the jumping engine, from whence the whole is pumped back to the boilers in such a way that all the steam condensed in the jacket of the cane juice and sir up clarifyer, and that which has been condensed in the pipe of the first pan, is returned to the boilers. Now, as all the exhaust steam of the mill and jumping engine is used for the boiling of the first pan, it follows that all the steam raised in the boilers, except the small portions which escape from the leak of snuffing boxes or safety valves, is entirely condensed and rendered available for heating the cane juice and sir up in the clarifyer, and the whole of the waste water heated to the boiling point, is sent back to the boiler. In Rillieuxs apparatus the use of the latent heat is carried out more perfectly and fully than in any other system known. The first pan of his apparatus is heated by steam not exceeding a pressure of four to eight lbs. per square inch, and the latent heat of the vapor from this pan is used to e vapor ate the sir up in the next of the series of pans, and so on. We have seen from the description of this apparatus that he uses an air pump to form the vacuum, which is worked in connexion with the various other pumps by a separate steam engine, which is placed under the apparatus. The apparatus is now in use on the plantations of Messrs. White and Gruff an, Mr. Lesseps, Messrs. Murphy and Hard anne, Messrs. Chauvin and Devoid, Mr. A mile Zeringue, Mr. Theodore J. Back wood, Messrs. Benjamin & Back wood, Messrs. Arm ant & Brothers, Mr. See, Mr. Marrow, Mr. Am beth, and I was informed that several planters have ordered similar apparatus to be built and set up this year to take off the coming crop The Louisiana planters are indebted for the introduction of this apparatus to Theodore Back wood, esq, ofScarsdale; he was the first who adopted this system, and through his untiring zeal the difficulties which occur in the adoption of all new inventions, and in consequence of which many a valuable improvement has been abandoned, have been overcome, and the calculations of the inventor and the expectations of the enlightened planter realized. Equally deserving for the success of this apparatus are Messrs. Berwick & Down, of Philadelphia, as signers of N. Rillieuxs patent these gentlemen carried the plans of the highly intelligent inventor into execution, and developed in its results its admirable adaptation to the purpose for which it was intended. The principle of the successive use of latent heat, has been long known and applied for dis tilling and evaporating, but it has never been applied in connection with vacuum, by which connection only the rapid boiling required for the evaporation of sac charing can be obtained. This is, therefore, an American invention, which will form a newer a in the sugar growing interest of the United States332ex, a. I visited several plantations where this apparatus is in operation spent many hours in the sugar house of Mr. Oh. Back wood, (which is a model of neatness) in studying its various operations, all of which went on uninterruptedly with great regularity and precision. Mr. Oh. Back wood uses three steam boilers of ordinary size, the fire grate extends only under two of them, the third boiler is heated by a return blue, and this is the only fire employed about the whole sugar house, gene rating enough steam to work the grinding mill, to heat the defecators, supply the necessary quantity of steam to the boiling apparatus, to work the engine for the air, juice, sir up, and water pumps; making 12,000 lbs. of sugar in 24 hours. The apparatus is solid and requires very small space, and has a pleasant appearance. The sugar made with this apparatus is of a beautiful light straw color, of fine large crystal, and free from unpleasant odor, and commanding a good price and ready sale. At Messrs. White & Ruffians, Turtle Drove, and Messrs. Benjamin & Back wood, Bellechasse, I saw the four pan apparatus at work. Mr. Benjamin, who is indefatigable in perfecting the manufacture of the sugar, and who employs with great success rheumatic cookers, called tigers, makes fine, white, stamped, loaf and lump sugar direct from the juice. Professor R. S. Mcculloh, in his official report to Congress of the United States, dated March 1st, 1847, gives therein several letters, and the report of the Agricultural and Mechanical Association of Louisiana, which bear high testimony as to the usefulness and perfect success of this improvement in boiling sugar. He Bowscommercial Review also gives several favorable accounts of Rillieuxs apparatus. I shall endeavor to collect correct and valuable data in regard to the quantity of sugar and molasses made, and the amount of fuel consumed in a given time, also tie expenses of keeping this apparatus in repair, the number of persons employed to work it, the prices obtained for sugar made with such apparatus, and ascertain its nature in regard to transportation and keeping; which, when compared with similar data from other systems of boiling practised, will show the advantage and disadvantage of either system. The price of a Rillieux apparatus varies according to the size; a three pan apparatus sufficiently large to take off a crop of 440 hogs heads of first sugar, cost, including clarifiers, bone black filters, vat for filtered cane juice and sir up, three boiling pans, jumping engine, cast iron and copper pipes, and all expenses of setting up, comes to                                                                                                                                                                 $11,000.*John Tens on and Days obtained letters patent for a double effect apparatus to boil sugar in va cut, dated August 1, 1848, of which the following is an extract of the specification, illustrated by figure 64* See He Bowl Commercial Review, p. 292, vol. 5. X. a. 333 The nature of our improvements consist, first, in constructing and combining a series of sugar pans with each other in such a manner that any one of them can be used at pleasure, either as evaporating or concentrating vacuum pan. Second. In the surrounding and enclosing the sugar pans with a metallic causing, leaving an interstitial space between the two communicating with an aperture in the top. of the sugar pan, the object of which will be herein after set forth. Third. Our improvements consist in the arrangement of the steam pipes in the sugar pans in independent series of two or more, for the purpose of regulating and g radiating the amount and position of the heating surface, as the condition and quality of the concentrating syrupy may require. And fourth, in the exhausting the aqueous vapor from the vacuum pan through a pipe passing from the space between the pan and causing into the evaporating pan, where, after coiling a number of times around near the top of the same, it passes out through the sides of the pan and causing to the air pump. The object of carrying the aqueous vapor from the vacuum pan through the evaporating pan is, that it may subserve the purpose of an evaporating pipe a portion of heat being extracted from the same by jumping a quantity of sir up from the bottom of the evaporating pan to the top into a perforated trough) through which it drips on to the spiral exhaust pipe. The object of enclosing the sugar pans within an external causing is, to form a space between them to receive the aqueous vapor from the pans, and protect the pans from the cooling influence of the atmosphere; thereby preventing the condensation of the vapor on the upper surface of the pans, and facilitating its condensation after its passage into the space between the pan and causing, by the large surface exposed to the action of the atmosphere. In the old style of vacuum pan, it has been found that from thirty to forty per cent. of the aqueous vapor is condensed upon the sides and top of the pan, and is thrown back into a liquid form to be revaporized, causing a proportionate loss of time, fuel and labor. In the accompanying drawings, figure 64, is a vertical section of an evaporating and a vacuum pan, as they are fitted up for plantation use; any number may be combined that may be required. A is the evaporator; B is the concentrate or, or vacuum pan; K, K, are the ca sings enclosing the pans A and B; C, steam pig e for heating and evaporating sir up to a point prior to the concentrating point; Pipe to complete the evaporation and bring the sir up to concentrating point; E, E, changes to connect the evaporating pipes with the main steam pipe; F, F, changes to connect evaporating pipes with waste pipe; G, exhaust pipe for vacuum pan, (B;) H, f large to connect G with the air pump; I, pipe, with stop cock, connecting the spaces M, M, between the pans A and B and their ca sings; by opening this connection between the two, the evaporating pan A can at any time be converted into a vacuum (or concentrating) pan; J, small pump for jumping the sir up from the bottom of the evaporating pan A into the distributing trough or cylinder L, at the top of the same, through the pipe 334 X. a. The aqueous vapor rising from the sir up and filling the space between the pans and ca sings, preserves a uniform temperature of the surface of the pans, and is rapidly condensed by coming in contact with the ca sings, and is drawn off from the bottom of the space By the air pump. The evaporating pipes in the vacuum pans, and in those pans intended to be used either for evaporating or vacuum pans, should be divided into series of two, three or more, arranged one above another, each having an independent connection with the main steam pipe, for the purpose of g radiating and regulating the amount and position of the heating surface to suit the condition of the concentrating sir up at the bottom, middle and upper portions thereof; when the sir up at the bottom of the pan is brought nearly to the concentrating point, the steam is shut off the lower series of evaporating pipes, and so also of the remaining series of evaporating pipes to the top of the sir up, until it is all brought to the concentrating point. By this arrangement of independent series of evaporating pipes in sugar pans, it will be perceived that we avoid all agitation of the sir up that has been brought to the concentrating point. The original cost of our improved sugar pans will be fifty percent. less than the pans in ordinary use, and but a trifle more than the common iron pan. Nothing sugar Joseph Ourd obtained a patent for machinery effecting the separation of molasses from sugar, dated October, 1844; the following description is collected from the specification on record in the United States Patent Office. The process of putting sugar, or freeing it from sir up or treaclemolasses) as practised in the West I n dies and other countries, consists in allowing it to stand for a considerable period of time in hogs heads, cases, or cisterns, having holes bored through their bottoms. The force of gravity causes the sir up or treat le gradually to descend through the sugar, and escape through the holes in the bottom of the hogs heads. In order, by the above operation, to expel the sir up or liquid sufficiently to render the sugar fit for market, much time is necessarily consumed. Besides, large curing houses, as they are termed, adapted for the purpose must be erected and maintained. My improvement consists in effecting the separation of molasses, by a machine of a peculiar construction, which accomplished the same through the agency of centrifugal force. It consists of a cylindrical or other proper shaped cistern, surrounding and having within it another cylindrical or other suitably shaped vessel, B, as shown in figure 65, which is attached to or has a vertical shaft, c, passing through its axis or central part, and so arranged in bearings and in other respects, as to be capable of being revolved on its axis, and thereby impart a corresponding motion to the vessel B. As a convenient and simple mode of making it, I construct it of a circular and solid bottom, (of wood or other proper material) and having raised upon it a cylindrical wire framework, b, formed of strong wire or strips of metal wound in a felix, and secured in such a form by any suitable number of vertical wires, or rods, or s tips, it c, &c, inserted and confined in the plate x. 335 or bottom a, and a metallic ring or rim d, the latter of which is connected to the central shaft c, by arms. The frame work b surrounds and is intended to give support to a hollow cylinder, f, of wound wire, whose inner surface is lined with flannel or other suitable material, the object of the whole being to suffer the escape of the sir up, molasses, or liquid matters through the sides of the vessel B, and at the same to retain the sugar within it, whenever the vessel is put in rapid revolution. The said vessel may be revolved within the cistern by means of a pulley, h, fixed on the top of the shaft, around which (pulley) ab and from the driving power may extend and give motion to it. The sugar containing the molasses is to be thrown into the interior of the vessel B, and when the said vessel is put in rapid revolution, the centrifugal force generated in the molasses, or sir up, or liquid matter, will expel it from the mass of sugar, and drive it through the sides of the chamber B, into the cistern surrounding the said chamber, from which it may be removed through an opening or fauces. Such a machine is so effectual in discharging molasses, sir up, or other liquid matters from sugar or other powdered or pulverizedsubstance, that but a short time is required to effect by it what requires a very long period by the old process herein above detailed. Although I have described such a machine as my own practical experience has proved to be of the simplest and most convenient kind, for the purpose for which I have used it, yet others, varied in form and construction, may be made to operate in a similar manner, so as to expel the sir up, molasses, or other liquid, from the sugar or other matter containing the same. I also use the said machine for washing sugar or other matter, and this I effect by gradually pouring or discharging water or other cleansing liquid upon or near the centre or other suitable parts of the mass of sugar, or other material contained in the cylinder vessel B, while the said vessel is in rapid revolution. The water or cleansing liquid will thus be driven through the mass and sides of the vessel by the action of centrifugal force. John He Fret ton obtained letters patent, dated 24th May, 1845,for an improved method of clarifying, draining and grainingssugar. The following description is an extract of his specification relating to draining, &c. When the sugar is fit to be posted, five copper pipes or tubes, a, a, a, a, a, figure 66, perforated with small holes an inch apart, are placed perpendicularly in holes in the bottom of the hogs heads. The tubes are made in a conical form, hollow inside; the diameter on top is to be two inches, tapering down to three quarters of an inch diameter at the end. (see figure 67.) The hogs head is then filled about one third full of sugar, or if ten hogs heads are to be posted, you will fill them all, as said above, one third full, and then commence throwing on each with a watering pot one half gallon of strong rum, which is called a wash, and is for the purpose of dissolving and carrying off the molasses; then put on another layer of sugar on the first hogs head, and so on i a rotation 336 X. Do. No. 59.as mentioned in the first instance, and again wash with a half gallon more of rum; after which the last third of the sugar is posted in each and every one of the hogs heads, and the same quantity of rum is applied, so that each hogs head receives one and a half gallons of rum when entirely filled The pipes placed in the hogs head are to be turned frequently round after they have been in twelve hours. In the said pipes, an iron or wooden rod, small enough to go through them, is used for the purpose of clearing away any obstruction that may be caused by the rapid flowing of the molasses, which ought to be done three or four times in the first twenty-four hours. Afterfortyeight hours have elapsed, the pipes are removed to be used in other hogs heads, and are replaced by wooden sticks large enough to fill the space made by the pipes that are introduced into the vacant holes in the sugar; these are kept there until the sugar in the hogs head is found to be sufficiently drained; they are then taken away; but care must be taken to have these curing holes kept open, to admit of the molasses draining as much as possible, until the sugar is fit for market saw these pipes in use on several plantations, and they consider them a great improvement in draining the sugar in hogs heads. The following is inserted to guard against the use of poisonous substances in the manufacture of sugarsPATENT Offi Of, February 19, 1849. Of R: Your application for letters patent for a process for the manufacture of sugars has been examined and rejected for want of novelty. You. claim the combination of sulphur out acid with lead in the manufacture and refining of sugar. Combining sulphurousacid with oxide of leads forms the well known salt called sulphate of lead, which is known to be insoluble in water and in solutions of sugar in water. Hence, it was known beforehand that sulphur out acid presented to a solution of a so ruble salt of lead would precipitate the sulphate of lead See Doses Analysis, vol. 1, page 211. The office takes the ground that the spirit of the invention consists in the use of the sulphur out acid to precipitate all of the lead from the solution; as such fact was known, it cannot now be claimed as new. There is another ground or reason why the office should not grant letters patent in this case. It is in the fact of the want of security to the public against accidents from the use of poisonous materials in the manufacture of sugars. Hours, respectfully, Edmund Burke. Mr. To. Scoffern, Are of P. H. Watson, Present. X. 
337Charles He A noel and E. Graf in, both of the island of Martinique, in the territory of the kingdom of France, have invented new improvements in the manufacture of sugar from cane, which was patented in the United States, dated 22d February, 1848. The nature of the invention consists in drying and pulverizingsugar cane, and then washing the sac charing matter therefrom, to be manufactured into sugar, by evaporation in the ordinary way. The cane is first cut by a cane c utter in pieces of small size, after which it is dried in a proper stove or kill; and then it is pulverized in a mill, which fits it for the process about to be described. A series of any number of tubs or vats are placed in line together above these tubs a reservoir of water is placed, from which a pipe descends to a level with the bottom of the tubs, and then runs along horizontally below them all; this pipe is connected with each of the tubs by a short branch pipe, in each of which there isa stop cock, which, when open, connects the tub with the pipe this pipe is also furnished with a stop cock for closing all communication with the tubs. The top of the first tub has a small metal box on the top that opens into it, from which a pipe descends to the bottom of the second tub, where it connects with it, after passing the water through a perforated plate. The second tub connects with the third in a similar way, as do all the others with those next succeeding; thus connecting the whole. To each of the pipes there is a stop cock, so as to cut off either of the tubs from the series. From the last tub a pipe is attached to its top in the same relative position as those before named, and runs back to the bottom of the first tub, with which it is connected, and to it is attached a stop cock. Another pipe runs along the top of the tubs, which connect by short lateral pipes, furnished with stop cocks, by which either of the tubs can be connected or disconnected with it; this pipe leads to the filtereds, when they are used; and otherwise, to the reservoir direct. Besides the above described pipes, each of the tubs is furnished with a trap door or man hole at the top, and a similar one on the side near the bottom, through which the pulverized cane is received and discharged. A railway is situated over the tubs, and on it a small car traverses over the tubs; below which car there is a funnel or spot that serves to direct the pulverized cane from the car into the tubs. Another car runs along on a railway just below the bottom of the tubs, and in a position to receive the contents of the tubs when they are to be emptied. The operation of this apparatus is as follows: The car on the railway above the tubs is filled with the dry pulverized sugar cane, and then brought over the tub in which the cane is to be deposited the bottom of the car is then opened and its contents fall down through the hop per into the tub below, which, when filled with the cane is closed by the door, and after the whole series is thus filled in like manner, the water in the reservoir is let intothe first tub through the pipe, by opening the stop cocks; the11338Ex. Bloc. No. 59.water which is first let into the bottom of this tub rises until the tub is filled, it then escapes through the box into the pipe which conveys it to the bottom of the second tub, partially saturated with the sac charing matter contained in the cane through which it has passed; it then runs through the second tube in the same way, and then through the others till it has received a sufficient degree of sat duration, (say about 20 or 25 of the areometerof Au me) and which generally reaches 20 at the fifth tub; the stop cock is then opened and permits the water thus saturated with sugar to pass through the pipe into one of the two filtereds, or into the reservoir direct; it is then taken to the kettles or battery direct, and boiled. [his kettle is not shown in the drawing tube of glass is inserted into the box of each tub, into which the areometer can be placed; by opening the stop cock the saturated water is admitted into this tube, the cock is then stopped and the degree of sat duration ascertained, after which it is drawn off through a small fauces. When the sac charing matter is all drawn from the cane in the first tub, the areometer will descend to zero, and it is no longer necessary to let the water pass through it; the cocks are, therefore, closed above and below, so as to cut off this tub from the series, and the corresponding stop cocks of the second tub a reopened, a new tub being also added at the opposite end of the series; and after the second tub is exhausted, that is cut off, and soon through them all, retaining the same number at all times in the series, and when one tub is exhausted and cut off, another is added through which the water has to pass. After the first tub is exhausted, without suspending the operation of sat u rating the water that continues to pass through the apparatus, it is cut off as before stated, and the exhausted cane contained therein, is removed by opening the door and drawing it out in the car which is on the railway below; the tub is then again filled from the car above. When the last tub of the series is reached, the stop cock is opened and a communication established through the pipe, between it and the first one, which has been filled with the fresh cane, and the operation is thus continued. The tubs and pipes are made of any suitable material, and of any proportions found most convenient; their number, also, is in material, if there are enough to give the requisite saturization to the water.

Foxcnoft, Of Scataqui S County) Mai Of, November 20, 1848. It is with pleasure that I proceed to make a partial report of matters relating to the agricultural interests of this vicinity. Having had the object of your circular in view through the summer and autumn, and my duties calling me to various parts of the county at periods during the season, I have availed myself of every opportunity, by extensive personal observation, as well as by numerous estimates of intelligent individuals on single subjects, to be prepared to answer on as many points as practicable. I have encountered so many difficulties at every step of my inquiries as to really preclude the hope of succeeding, with even an approximation to correctness on a single point, to render a return of -any particular value in the vast statistics of the nation. These difficulties arise from our position and its attendant effects. Located on and north of the 45th parallel of latitude, at great elevation above tide water, our county did not present to the early Atlantic colonies that attraction which they saw in the more genial crimes of the west. Our settlements date entirely with the present century. Extending, as we do, into the cold timber regions of the upper It. Johns, the Penobscot and the Kennebec, the agricultural portion of our county is at present found in a narrow border on our southern boundary. But we are pleased to see our borders extending goodly increase of population, great extension of cultivated lands, with rapid improvement in their general appearance, excellent roads, and universal education. To proceed in detail with our inquiries, we will consider them briefly, in the order of the circular. Wheattwenty years since, our lands produced a fine crop of spring wheat with as much certainty as we looked for a crop of hay. But this has sadly changed. Numerous enemies have sprung up, amongst which, mildew, and rust, and the weevil are the greatest, till the raising of a field of wheat is viewed as an experiment. A majority of our farmers have abandoned the trial entirely. Others have sowed the past season from one to four or six acres, and we can hardly say with varied success, it is so near a total failure. The kind most sown, heretofore, is a bald white chaff variety, known here as the tea wheat. -of this kind, I feel sure that not so many bushels will be threshed as were sown. Another variety a bearded red chaff succeeded a little better. I sowed two bushels of each kind, one bushel to an acre, and on each acre one or two necks of flax seed. Of the bearded variety I have a fair mixed crop the wheat as good as I have seen for the season. The bald wheat produced but little, but the flax seed is abundant. But little of either is yet threshed. I think the flax had a favorable influence on the wheat. Farmers generally delayed sowing till the last week of May and the first days of June, to avoid the weevil. X. 
343Harvesting the last of August. The per cent age I send you in the circular. Barleybut little has ever been sown here, I have tried it with flax, as practised in New York with good success. Not enough raised worthy of naming. Oatslarge quantities are raised since the failure of the <a name="potato35"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. Most of our largest farmers give much of their tillage land to a mixed crop of peas and oats-one half peas. They are raised with less labor than corn, and the surplus finds a ready market with thelumbermens' teams, it being preferred to corn meal. Buckwheat would succeed well, but the only piece I have seen during the season was a small one on my own farm. I indian Cornthis crop is much larger than usual. The fine crop of 1847 induced every one to prepare an extra acre or two, which more than doubled the land usually cultivated. The crop, however, is not so sound as in '47. The weather was wet and cold in May; the same in June, and wet continually after through the season. The warm weather in July and a part of August did not suffice to mature the general crop, and the cold nights of September took it un prepared. Well tilled fields gave a good yield. Potatoesthe crop is extremely light; less rot, perhaps, than in '47; but the rust cut them early, and we found them small <a name="potatoes35"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and few in the hill. Maybe have had three fine crops in succession/ The yield about one ton per acre. Our land in good condition, two tons per acre. A large quantity is required for the lumber business, but prices have declined, and the last year ranged from                            $5 to                      $8 person loose. Hemp and flax Less attention seems to be paid to these crops now than formerly. A piece is now rarely seen. Silkvery little attention is given to this culture; but two or three individuals have given it a trial. It doubtless would succeed well with suitable attention. Sugarthis county a bounds in the sugar map le; but, for the last four years, the returns have not met the expenses of its manufacture. I keep my buckets and fixtures in working order; but find it cheaper to buy than to make our sugar. One made worth estimating. Our oldest and best towns are probably one third cleared of wood. Our farmers are hardly settled on a system of rotation of crops. We are yet too new to have our attention, from necessity, directed to the matters of exhaustion and renovation of lands. Foot crop Since the failure of <a name="potatoes36"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, there is an increased attention given to the culture of bees and carrots. Turnips yield abundantly, but seem to be not much valued. The root culture is fairly on the increase. Seas are not much raised, except as a mixed crop with oats. They yield well; average crop, perhaps, thirty bushels per acre, half peas. Means are raised mostly with 344 X. corn. Worn is rarely planted without them. In former years large fields have been planted alone. An over supply has deprecated the price, and this year few have been s won. A very great crop has been produced, and the price cannot be expected to exceed one dollar per bushel. The Orchardgreatly increasing attention is being given to apple trees; pears, plums, and cher rise, also come in for a share of attention. The State Domo logical Society has given an impetus to this business that is doing great good. We find by trial that most of the valued varieties of apples, known in the northern and eastern States, mature in this county in common seasons. The trees bear early, retain their vigor to the extent of age that we have yet proved them; and the lateness of our opening spring, and the certainty with which warm weather follows, insures a crop when warmer climates suffer by spring frosts. Our trees have not yet suffered by many maladies that affect older places. My experience reaches that a thousand trees here demand less care and labor in tending, than is indispensable to twenty-five in some parts of the older States. In the raising of stock, sheep, swine, &c, this county stands nearly equal in the quality of these products with other counties of the State; I would gladly pursue this subject further but other engagements forbid. We had an agricultural society in this county for several years, and last spring it decided to have no fair this year, and I fear it must be classed with things that were. Wages of labor arm help, from                                                                                                                                                                                             $10 to                                                                                                                                                                              $15 per month, average                                                                                                                                                                                   $12; mechanics from                                                                                                                                                             $1 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.50 per day; female domestics from                                                                                                                                                             $1 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.50 per week.

This embraces, in accordance with our present tax act, "all over six months old. S. Fatten, esq, of Over, has kindly furnished me from the inventor of that town, matters more in detail than I have had time to furnish from other towns, and I here enclose his slip as I received it. X. a. 345 The assessors of the several towns proceed substantially in the same manner to make up their inventories; go from house to house, appraise animals and other property from actual inspection, and at a fair cash value, not too high. In the numbers here returned, we may add for your purpose, the natural increase for the year. The number of swine wintered the last year was unusually small, and the stock mostly breeding animals. I think the number has since increased four fold. A very large increase of stock of all kinds is also visible. We have a larger proportion of village and manufacturing population in Over and Foxcroft than in the county, making our basis, I think, a safe one. May, 1848.

The winter of 1847 48 was unusually mild and broken, and spring came on early and pleasantly, with abundant rains. But a sit advanced into summer, the warmth did not increase in fair proportion until the length of the days; and the rains were frequent and heavy till the end of July. May, June, and July, were, on the whole, unusually cool and moist, though with many pleasant and some warm days. In August, the weather became extremely and steadily hot, and rather dry. This weather lasted till into Sep346ex. member, at the end of the first week of which it again became cool and rainy, and has so continued till the first day of October. But as the spring did not grow warm with the approach of summer, so neither has the autumn grown cold with the approach of winter and October, though cool and cloudy and rainy, has been very free from frost, and its average heat has probably been as great as usual. In the early part of the season, especially in May and June, there was much high wind. In the latter part 'of it, the winds were generally light or moderate, except now and then in a storm. The crop of grass was usually large, and generally got in good condition, though some little portion of it suffered from rain falling on it after being made. Oats yielded a fair, full crop. Eye gave a good crop. I indian corn yielded a very good crop, both in quantity and quality. The earl i ness of the spring permitted it to be planted in good season, and the great and steady heat in August brought it to perfect maturity. Heat is but little cultivated whereabouts, as it is a very uncertain crop. It is believed, from what can be gathered on the subject, that the crop this year was about an average. Buckwheat did well, and gave a fair crop. Means did moderately well; but the crop is not above an average one. Tompkins failed almost entirely; partly from* the coolness and moisture of the early part of summer, but mostly from the destructive ravages of the large black pump kin bug, which was this year unusually abundant and voracious. This was also the case with s qu ashes, from the same cause. Tops, in this vicinity, have given but a small yield this year, though the cultivation of them has been considerably extended within a few years past. <a name="potatoes37"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> have done very poorly. The crop will hardly be half an average one. This does not arise so much from their destruction by rot, though some quantity perished that way, as from a generally un propitious season, as many pieces, almost entirely free from disease, did not yield 40 bushels to the acre. The rot began to show itself in the first part of August, at the time of the change of the weather from foolish and wet to hot and dry. In the first two or three days of hot weather, the air was very much loaded with warm vapor from the excessive evaporation from the saturated earth; and the black spots began to show themselves upon the leaves; but as no fresh rain fell, and the sky was generally clear, this excessive evaporation soon ceased, and the diseased tops delayed very slowly, so that the stems did not become dry till the end of the month. In one patch, about two rods square, I took off the top of every stem as the blossoms were forming, and but half a dozen blossoms formed afterwards upon this patch. Met, this was more quickly and intensely affected by the disease than the rest of my <a name="potatoes38"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The tubes were, except in a few cases, but x. 347 little affected, even where the tops had entirely perished; and the decay among them was much the greatest where the soil was naturally moist. Garden vegetables generally did well, with the exception ofsquashes and cucumbers. Unions were remarkably good. Small garden fruits, as currents and goose ferries, yielded very abundantly. Plums, with the exception of the native Canada, plum, were an entire failure. New trees had any blossoms in the spring, and none of them more than half a dozen. Either the fruit buds did not form in consequence of the coolness and dampness of last September and October, or they were destroyed by the extreme changes of temperature in the winter. From an examination of my trees, I am most inclined to believe in the former state of the case. Years also yielded but scantily, and the show of blossoms was less than common. Apples blossomed fairly; but much fruit dropped off during the cool, wet weather in June, and much was k curly and imperfect, or delayed prematurely, so that the crop was rather small, though not remarkably so. S. Webber. Commonwealth Of Massachusetts, Methuen, county of Essex, November 20, 1848. Dear Of R: I have partially answered the queried in your circular, and will further make such remarks as now occur to my mind, having particular reference to this county. As I said in the circular, wheat is but little cultivated, as it is not considered a profitable crop. Barley is not extensively cultivated. It is used mostly for fattening swine. This year there is about a medium crop. Oats are more extensively cultivated. The crop this year better than usual; 50 bushels to the acre is a good crop on land well manured, although we often hear of a much greater crop being raised. Eye is considerably cultivated, and usually on light, easy land consequently, light crops are usually the result. About 10 bushels to the acre is considered a medium crop. From 20 to 25 bushels is considered a good crop where the land is well in manured, although there has been, this year, a premium awarded by the Essex Agricultural Society for the unusual crop, 44 bushels to the acre. His year there is about a medium crop. I indian corn is considered a profitable crop, especially on easy land, although the cultivation of it requires considerable labor. Good crop of corn affords a large amount of good fodder for cattle, besides the grain. Worn can be raised the cheapest on light, easy land, although the crop may not be quite as large as may be raised on hard land, but it requires much less labor; 30 bushels to the acre is a fair crop without manure. Good land, well manured, will produce 60 or 70348Ex. bushels to the acre, and sometimes 80 or 90, although that is more than a usual crop. This year, a medium crop. I think corn cannot be raised in the county of Essex, on an average, under seventy-five cents per bushel, although some have set it at much less. <a name="potatoes39"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> are, this year, unusually light think about half a usual crop. They have rotted but little. The blight struck them about the first of August, and almost a total failure was anticipated; but the crop was better than was expected. In regard to the cause of the disease I can give no information, although I think those planted early, on dry land, without much manure, have been the most successful. The crop of hay this season is unusually good think about a quarter more than a usual crop. Our best grass lands are cultivated meadow lands, where there is some depth of mud, as they produce greater crops and require less manure. Grass requires a rich, deep soil, that is not excessively dry. Perhaps one ton per acre may be considered an average crop. Good land, well manured, will produce two or three, and sometimes four tons to the acre. The common practice has been to sow grass seed in the spring with grain; but the young plants are often killed by the summer drought. I think, however, that August is the best time for sowing grass seed, and is now more practised than formerly. Grass seed should be sowed thick, especially on rich land, as the hay will be finer and of a better quality. From twelve to fifteen qu arts of herds grass and three pecks of red top to the acre is not too much for rich land; but less will answer on poorer lands. I think a portion of c lover on light land is desirable. I think there is no crop more profitable than hay on lands well adapted to its growth;                                                                                                                                                                                   $12 per ton is now a fair price for hay in market, which is less than it has been for some years. There is an increased attention to the cultivation of fruit, especially of apples. In suitable land, perhaps, there is nothing more profitable, as they require less labor than most other crops. His year there is rather short of a medium crop. Good apples are worth from                                               $2 to                                               $2.40 per barrel. There are but few horses and little stock raised in Essex county they are mostly purchased from the interior of Paine, New Hampshire and Vermont. Stock is now unusually high; common cows are worth from                                                            $20 to                                                       $25 each extra ones are worth more. Good oxen                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100 a pair, or more. Fairies, to supply the numerous cities and villages with milk and butter, are considered more profitable than raising stock. Some farmers make it profitable buying cows, not with calf, and other cheap stock in the spring, putting them into good pastures, and selling them to the butcher in the latter part of the summer or early in autumn, before the droves come in from the country, as they get more for them. Fattening beef in the winter is not so profitable as fattening them in the summer, especially to those who have a market near hand for their hay. There is an increased attention to making manure. The success of the farmer depends much on the quantity he makes. The mere x. a. 349,chant may as well continue business without capital, or the engine be proper led without steam, as the farmer have good success without manure. At the present day almost every farmer that builds a new barn digs a cellar under it, and many are digging cellars under their old ones. Thus the value of the manure is greatly increased, as it saves the light as well as the solid; also, prevents its being washed by the rains and dried by the winds. I believe it is a fact that the liquid is worth as much as the solid; and by hauling in, mud or some other material, to absorb the liquid and mix the solid, large quantities of manure can be made. Seat mud is one of the finest ingredients for making com post manure; and large quantities are made by mixing it with stable manure, reached ashes, &c. The cow yard should be lowest in the middle to retain the water and juices of the manure. There should be have troughs to the barn to carry off the water from the yard. To water should run into the yard; consequently, little will run out. Pua no has been used in some cases with good success; in other cases but little benefit has been derived from it; and I doubt, on the whole, whether it will usually pay the expense. Rushed bone has also been used on some land with good success. Ashes and salt have both been used on some land with equal success; on other land they do no good. I think, however, the best way is to mix them with mud or other materials for com post. Gypsum does exceedingly well on some of the lands in the north part of Essex county. Pastures that were nearly worthless have been completely re nova ted, and produce white c lover like land highly cultivated and manured; and I think it, on some lands, is exceedingly profitable. I think, however, for renovation g our, cultivated land, we must depend mostly on stable manure, or compose made of mud or other materials. The Essex Agricultural Society was formed in 1819.

Since that time we have had seasonable rains, but not excessively wet. Respectfully yours, Joseph How. Honorable Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents350ex. a. Of Chmond) Mass, December 1, 1848. Dear Of R: The last year has been one, in our climate, 42 , of some striking peculiarities. The productions of the earth have been seriously affected by the unusual course which nature has pursued in fulfilling her annual routine. October, 1847, was a beautiful autumnal month, highly favorable to the in gathering of the fruits of the earth, and in making such preparations as the season would warrant for causing the earth again to produce in abundance. There were a few light frosts during the month, and a slight fall of snow towards its close, merely enough to whiten the roofs of buildings, and give the hills for a little time a wintry appearance. The morning sun soon dispelled it. The next month throughout was not a "gloomy, sad November" it was a fine month for business, and many things were done to advance the labors of the field and garden the coming spring. January, 1848, continued mild until the 9th; and, in some instances, the earth became so dry that sloughing was performed. In the 9th, there was a slight fall of snow with a change to colder 11th mercury fell 190 below 0.13 shade; 14th, fog, and so on, with frequent changes to the end of the month, whose snows in the aggregate would not have furnished tolerable sleighing. In February, on the first, snow fell eight inches deep; and this storm was succeeded by another on the fifth, making the aggregate depth twenty-one inches, which was considerably whirled about by the playful winds. Twentieth, rain, attended with fog, from which it changed to cool, and remained so to the end of the month; 28th, snow fell five inches deep, and driven about furiously by winds roads badly drifted. March possessed a variable character, changing from cold to moderate, and from warm to cold, until the 20th, after which much of its peevishness appeared to be lost in the prospect of spring. In the 18th, blue birds were first seen; 19th, robins; 2 1st, phoebe birds 2 9th, frogs first heard. April opened cool, but not frosty, in consequence of the earth s being but slightly frozen, and the small quantity of snow in comparison with previous years; the ground was early in condition for sloughing, at which all were busy in their several localities by the 10th. It continued dry, and, for the most part, cool, until the 19th, when snow fell to the depth of six inches, and delayed the labor of the farm for two or three days. Owing spring crops commenced as early as the fifteenth, and continued through the month. Stock of all kinds came out in the spring in an unusually fine condition; and, though the crop of hay was less the previous summer, the supply of forage was more than equal to the demand; and it brought no higher price in March and April than it did in November, a circumstance attribute able somewhat to the fact that sheep required but little fodder until December, and, in some instances, received none until the middle of the month. When the quality of the small crop hay was excellent. It was gathered with care and x. a. 351 fed with economy. Coarse fodders were also used with unusual prudence, and were eaten readily by animals. May was a cool, moist month so wet as in some instances to delay the work of corn planting until near its close, and so cool as to occasion some misgivings as to whether it was best to plant a tall. The season was highly favorable to the setting of grass and small grain. The was too dry for a desirable growth of vegetation, and was subject to many high, cold northwest winds, which operated un favorably upon all spring grains, especially corn. I to effects upon the <a name="potato36"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop were never recovered. July came in cool; so much so that frosts were apprehended. He, however, escaped. This and the following month were favorable for sowing the grass and grain crops. The earliest frost of the season was discovered on the morning of September 13, and slight frosts were noticed for two or three successive mornings. There were not sufficient, however, to injure any but the most delicate plants. In the morning of the 17th, the earth in the val lies was as white as though a sheet of snow had fallen. It appeared that a dense fog arose the previous night, and, ascending into a cold atmosphere, congealed and fell upon the earth in glittering whiteness, most dense in the lowest lands, and diminishing in quantity as the elevation increased. It was remarkable that a frost of so much show should have so little effect. Except in the lowest lands and their immediate vicinity, it was not of sufficient effect to kill the leaves of corn or <a name="potatoes40"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, or even the tender leaves of the grape. In the night of the 22d, fell the first snow of the season. Had the surface of the earth been dry and cold enough for its preservation, there would probably have been a depth of four inches; but much melted as it fell, though some of it remained on the high lands until the night of the 2 3d. For the mean temperature of the year, together with the amount of rain that fell, I refer you to a following note, kindly furnished by Professor Hopkins, of Williams College. This institution is located in the valley of the Too sic, in latitude 420 42' 49, longitude 73 13. It probably is a fair average of western Massachusetts. With regard to crops, the best we can do is to make an estimate approximating as near to facts as possible. Perfect accuracy is out of the question in this matter. We have investigated compared opinions, drawn from observing and practical men, and from these draw our inferences. From the best estimate we can make, the quantity of grain raised in Berkshire, in 1848, will be as follows worn. .a. .a. .a. .a. 185,000 bushels.

There was probably less sown in 1848 than in 1847, from the fact that, in many instances, the cultivate or did not realize a harvest to the extent of his wishes the previous year. The number of fields of spring wheat entered on the county agricultural societys books for a premium this year was thirty-one a greater number than for any previous years; which shows that, on the whole, the crop is receiving more attention. In 1843, its cultivation was considered so unprofitable that the society thought any encouragement in its behalf would be useless, and they struck it from their premium list. The viewing committee on crops were, however, invited to view one field of wheat, which showed so well in favor of its cultivation that they awarded its grower a premium on their own responsibility, and recommended the crop to the attention of the farmer, and the care of this society. Since then, premiums have been regularly awarded on it; and from that beginning, which would hardly be considered a single entry, an increase of thirty fold in number of fields, and a much greater in bushels, has been realized. We think the increase of wheat harvested this season over 1847 must give an increase of seven per cent. in quantity; and the probable amount harvested in Berkshire would not vary much from ten thousand bushels. The expense of raising an acre of spring wheat, as estimated by a farmer who has always raised more than enough for his family bread stuff, is as follows went of land worth                                      $50 per acre. .a. .a.                           $31 day sloughing* .a. .a. 21 " narrowing .a. .a. .a. . .a* *a* .a. *a* 24 days seeing .a. *a. .a. . 2 Harvesting .a. .a. *a* .a. .a. .a. 4                                                                                                                                                                $13 He applies no manure in the season of raising his wheat, which follows the corn crop, which is well manured, and allows the straw to pay for threshing.

Time of sowing, from April 10th to 25th. Harvest from 25th of July to 10th of August. Needs own, from 11 to 2 bushels per acre. Barley was sown in about the same quantities as last year. The crop has been good, and is considered profitable. Oatswe should estimate an increase from the land sown of from ten to fifteen per cent. The crop is thought to have averaged forty bushels per acre, sometimes going as high as sixty or seventy; they are worth from 371 to 40 cents per bushel. They were sown at all times, from April 12th to 10th of May; harvested from 20th of July to 20th of August. The usual quantity of seed sown is 21 and 3,bushels per acre. Ryeprobably not more than three-fourths the number of acres sown that there was in 1846, but a large harvest gathered. The crop was very fine. Any of the fields entered for premiums were estimated at thirty bushels per acre. The time of sowing depends on locality. In our clay by loams it should b sown by the middleofAugust; on warm light lands, from the 1st to the 10th, and some sown as late as the 20th of September. The expense of raising an acre of rye depends on the soil. Of the soil is light and friable it can be raised for nine dollars per acre. Of a stiff soil, more labor must be bestowed and the expense increased. The quantity of seed necessary where exposed to frost killing, is 1~ bushels; on light lands, from 1 to 1 bushels; time of harvest from 15th to 25th of July. The crop in Berkshire this year may be set at 375,000 bushels, worth 75 cents per bushel. The corn crops his we consider an important crop in our Newengland husbandry, and our farmers are growing firm in the same opinion. It is a fattening crop in every position it can be placed. The very process necessary to insure its success is fattening to the soil, so that is better when the crop is taken off than when planted. The ground must be enriched for its benefit, if it is not already in good condition; it must be thoroughly pulverized to a good and sufficient depth, to enable it to throw its wandering roots abroad and on these two operations hang the laws of good husbandry.

But the great proportion of land is not so valuable, and on most of the crops the expense in cultivation is enhanced; nor will the crop as a whole come up to the estimate. The last season, forty-five bushels per acre may be considered a fair average. We have seen no poor corn. It all ripened thoroughly, and many crops exceeded sixty bushels per acre, while some few if reports are true) rose as high as one hundred. The kind cultivated are Button, a twelve rowed variety, and the Sioux, &c. I need, we have many varieties; but they are mostly of the golden ear. Very little white corn is cultivated. The time of planting is as soon as the season and the getting in of smaller grains will permit, Last spring, many farmers planted in April, and from that to the 20th of May, the labor being retarded in the latter month by storms. Worn was ripe universally by 15th of September. It is desirable in our New England climate to plant as early as possible; for, though cold weather may retard its early growth, early planted will ripe n earliest. Buckwheat is among the crops of which our farmers sow, from year to year, since they have got in the habit of raising it, about a usual quantity of land. The crop filled well the last season, and averaged about twenty bushels per acre, worth 50 cents per bushel. Down from June 20 to July it harvested early in September. <a name="potatoes41"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> t seems as though farmers had resolved to " keep trying" this crop, notwithstanding the sickening failures of past years, Any planted very early, thinking thereby to escape the disease of former years, and others planted, in point of time, as though no disease was apprehended. The crop suffered from dry weather in June; but the loss from rot in Berkshire has not, bethink been over two per cent. on the whole crop. The cause of the disappearance of this plague, we cannot give; our season, however, has differed from those of three or four preceding years. Thunder showers have been much more frequent and powerful; the general temperature has been cooler; but we formerly raised <a name="potatoes42"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in warm summers. The earth has been of a more uniform x. a. 355 moisture, and fogs from malignant molasses less common. Whether any or all of these have produced the good effect, we know not; but we think that the purifying influence of electricity has given this disease a shock. An any one bring reasons to prove our conjecture incorrect n consequence of the dryness of June, there was not that number of <a name="potatoes43"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the hilt which is usual; consequently the crop was not heavy. They grew to a fine size, however, and were of a superior quality. Their yield may be put at from 100 to 150 bushels per acre and they were worth at home from 371 to 50 cents per bushel. The kinds known as Verser and the Garters bear the highest prices, give the smallest yields, and are most subject to the rot. The "flesh colored" and orange are more hardy, and on all accounts most worthy of cultivation. The quantity of seed planted varies from 20 to 30 bushels per acre. The increase of crop over last year, 6 or 7 per cent. May n 1847, the hay crop was a short one compared with the average crop. In 1848, it was an improvement over that of the previous year, of from 25 to 33 per cent, owing in part to new stocked meadows and the favorable weather in May, which 'was cold and wet. Present price of hay,                      $8 per ton. Average produce per acre probably about l 1 tons. Sugarthe towns in which the map le flourished have formerly received a handsome revenue from its rich r tss. In the single tfbvnof Wanders field, 143,000 :lbs. of map le sugar have been manufactured in a year; and in the county, a probable aggregate of 500,000pounds, worth from 8 to 12 cents per pound, in small cakes manufactured expressly for the retail market. In many instances, it isclarified, grain ied, and made equal to the richest product of the cane. Last spring was unfavorable to its manufacture, in consequence of the ground being so slightly frozen, and the run of sap so short. Probably 200,000 pounds would give the full amount. Flax receives but little attention. Horns talk and straw fodderCornstalks, well secured and cut fine, furnish an agreeable and healthy food for horses and neat cattle; for the latter, if, when cut, they are scalded by pouring on warm water, are almost equal to what they are when green, especially for cows, causing them to produce milk of almost the richness of June. They are worth, when well cured,                  $6 per ton, when hay is worth                                                                                                                                                                                             $10. Straw is worth from                         $4.50 to                            $5 per ton. Large quantities of straw are annually manufactured into paper, and the demand of it for this purpose probably increases its price some 15 or 20 per cent. Foot crops are not raised to a great extent. Some farmenirsraisethem in small quantities, say from a quarter to half an acre. Parrot sand sugar bees will probably yield from: 400 to 600 bushels per acre, and are worth twenty-five cents per bushel. Turnips are raised to a greater extent, less labor being required, and the yield being as great, and prices in the market the same. The orchards increasing attention is paid to fruit growing, as all kinds of good fruit are in high demand. Apples of known va356Ex. varieties brought at harvesting fifty cents a bushel, which was an advance from last year, owing probably to the shortness of c rep. Years have yielded a tolerable supply. Plums, peaches and cher rise were entirely cut off by the warm weather in December, during which the blossom buds were killed. The growth of wood was fine the past summer, and we hope for a rich supply the next. Strawberries and grapes are cultivated only in few gardens, and for family use. They should have places assigned them in every garden, and be cultivated for the healthfulluxury they afford. But it is to be feared that ferries will not receive the attention they fully warrant, so long as they will grow in old, exhausted fields, along fences, and in open places in woodlands, where they become the prey to every lawless marauder that can lay clutches upon them. Hairy increasing attention is paid to raising stock and to the dairy. Farmers are improving their herds by introducing the beautiful Peons and Ayrshires more generally. The former arc celebrated for their nobility, ease of keeping, and for their working qualities as oxen. For milk they may be behind the Ayrshiresbut, taking all qualities into consideration, it is doubtful whether there is a better breed of animals for the north. The quantity of butter manufactured in Berkshire the past year will probably not fall short of 1,200,000 pounds, selling here at 14 to 25 cents per pound. The average price has probably been 183 cents per pound The quantity of cheese made in the same period cannot fall s fort of 2,500,000 pounds, worth from 6 to 8 cents per pound. The surplus butter is sent to Boston and Newyork markets, usually once a week, from May to September. Such of the cheese is sent to the southern cities for market. The present prices for cows are from                                                            $20 to                                   $30, and some as high as                              $35. Beef is worth                            $5 per hundred; hides six cents per pound; tallow nine cents per pound. Sheepfat sheep are worth from one dollar and seventy five cents to two dollars and fifty cents per head; mutton does not vary much in price from beef. Skins, worth from 17 to 50 cents each. There are very few, if any, sales of wool; manufacturers make no offers, but guess it is worth from 25 to 30 cents a pound. Farmers reckon they will keep it awhile longer, as storage costs nothing, and they are generally not much pressed for cash. There is a general disposition to get rid of flocks, and embark in other branches of agriculture. The average yield per head is probably three pounds. Hogsno essential variation from last year. Poultry t would be very difficult for us to make an estimate of the average number of fowls to a family, and quite as much so to estimate the number of families. May fifteen are wintered to each family, and how much wiser are we? It is a subject, however, worthy of consideration, and I wish that something like accuracy could be approached in the matter. Any at the present time are making the business profitable, and most of the farmers are deriving small incomes from it. Eggs have been worth from 121 to 16 cents per dozen through the year, and poultry is now worth eight cents per pound. X. a. 357 Prices of labor, the same as last year.

Dear Of R: You request some statistics relative to the meteorologyof our county. I do not know the precise object you have in view, and therefore will confine myself mainly to facts 1st. Clean temperature his is the temperature as deduced from three daily observations during the year, (sundays excepted 358 X. Docno. 59. The quantity of rain in May is greater than during any, month since I had made observations. The amount during the year is a little above the average. The above conveys, I believe, all the information to which you letter refers. Of the facts can be of use to you or your correspondents, they are at your service. Very truly yours, Albert Hopki Of. Mr. Of Lli Of Bacon. P. S. I might add the extremes of heat and cold during the year. The greatest cold was February 11, 230; the greatest heat June 17,9S0, nearlyPEMBROKE, Mass, December 13, 1848. The state of cultivation in the county of Plymouth does notre acid large portion of the subjects of inquiry embraced in the circular sent from your office. Ordering on the sea, great numbers of our citizens are engaged in navigation, another numerous class in mechanical business, so that few are left to nurse mother earth; and she appears, in many instances, not only void of all artificial ornament but even of a useful dress. There agriculture commands only a divided and subordinate attention, it is very difficult, if practicable, to present anything like just views of the state of it. We may be able to ascertain pretty correctly the two extremes of best and worst cultivation; but the medium will not be the true index of general practice. A numerous class will be found falling below the best cultivates, yet rising far above the worst. In comparing the crops of two consecutive years, we must avail ourselves, to great extent, of conjecture. Reports to an agricultural society may give some aid; but variant seasons would make our inferences from them of somewhat doubtful ,CorrectnessThe winter of 1847 and 1848 was of about the usual severity in this latitude. Now continued some longer than is common so near the sea; all of it, however, disappeared in the month of March. April was a dry and warm month, remarkably favorable for the sowing of the small grains; and even I indian corn to some extent was planted in that month. May brought us, in this particular locality, much of that rough east wind, before which young plants and tender human constitutions shrink. Early in June, the summer temperature seemed established rains and sunshines were well i apportioned to promote the health and vigor of vegetation. The weather of summer was unusually uniform, with a moderate degree of heat, till about the 20th of August, when the weather became remarkably cold for that season, and continued so a week. The growth of all tender plants was checked, and, in many instances, not again renewed. But this great change, without much actual frost, at length gave place to warmer breezes. X. a. 3 The last days of August and the first in September were very fine; but before the middle of the month, the chilling northwestern again visited us and soon caused the fields and forests to assume the autumnal hue. The season of vegetation was something shorter than has been common here, but rather unusually productive. Autumn months have been cold. Winter commences with mild weather, approaching the temperature of those October days often designate as I indian summer. Eye is cultivated in this county more, probably, than any other of the small grains. The greater portion of it is sown in August and September-one bushel of seed used on the acre. Some is sown in spring, when one third more seed is applied. Autumnal sowing is considered as giving the best promise of a full crop; in some years, however, that sowed in spring does quite as welLThis was the case the past season. The rye crop of 1848, according to the best information obtained, exceeded that of 1847, neaqrl20 per cent. Domestic price,                                                                                                                                                             $1 per bushel. Oats are raised to some extent the crops this year rather unusually large. Statements give from 30 to 62 bushels on the acre. From 21 to 3 bushels of seed on the acre. Time of sowing, from 1st of April to 1st of June. Price 50 cents per bushel. Barley was, found in comparatively few fields, and, so far as observation extended, was less productive than usual. In several instances less than 20 bushels to the acre were reported. In 1849 from 25 to 35. Heat was sown in fewer instances than barley. The opinion generally prevails that this grain cannot be raised here to any profit. A few enterprising men continue experiments. in the hope of ultimately discovering the cause of so frequent failures. He had one cry, p of the past season reported twenty-six bushels to the acre more than thirty per cent. beyond what is ordinarily obtained. I di an corn is raised in the county in larger quantities than any other grain. There have manifestly been great imnprovemientswithin a few years in the culture of this article. It is now produced with less expense than formerly, and in greater quantity on the acre. The improvements consist chiefly in the. more judicious application of manure and more effective tillage. The surface soil only is now moved among the plants, deep sloughing avoided as injurious. The year 1847 was partially favorable to the growth of corn, and the crop of that year was uncommonly abundant. A similar result would have been realized in 1848, had not the plants been suddenly checked by the cold week in August, after which no corn was formed, and much that had partly grown was shrivelled and lost. In fields planted late, the crop was less than that of the preceding year by 15 or 20 per cent; but where the planting was early, and the fields carefully prepared, the corn had so far matured before the cold week, that the yield was great. Applicants for psr360Ex. 
miums obtained more bushels to the acre than in many former years. The reports range from from 77 to 132 bushels on the acre. Notwithstanding these results, we should not place the average through the county beyond 30 bushels. The most coman on season of planting here is from the 10th to the 20th May. Domestic price of the article, 90 cents per bushel. The crop of hay in this year was probably about 15 per cent larger than that of the preceding year, which was considered fruitful in this article. May and I indian corn are leading objects of attention with our farmers, and some very handsome improvements have been made in the cultivation. The average yield of hay is about one ton per acre. The price from                                                                                                                                                                                             $10 to                                                                                                                                                                              $15 per ton. Foot culture is practised here very little, scarcely enough to form any foundation of comparison between different years. Few plats of carrots and turnipshave been examined the last two years, and there was no great variation in the products. Carrotsyield from 300 to 50 bushels to the acre, and turn is from 400 to 700. <a name="potatoes44"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> were cultivated pretty extensively till the appearance of the malady; since, fewer have been annually planted. The crop in 1847 was large; but the loss in decay, before and after harvest, great. The crop of the last season was considerably less; but the loss in decay, as yet, has been very trifling, and the prospect of good spring supplies is better than last year. Early planting on dry porous soils, and with those <a name="potatoes45"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which ripe n early, have proved the most effective, prevention of disease. The quantity of seed used on the acre ranges from 15 to 25 bushels. The usual price at harvest 33 cents per bushel. Most of the products of the soil are consumed in the county. A few articles <a name="potatoes46"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, apples, milk, and hay are occasionally carried to other markets, from which we draw a far greater amount in flour, grain, and meat. The above enumerated articles comprise nearly all that are cultivated in fields. Various other plants are found in gardens, but in too small quantities for even probable estimates of the productive ness. Orchards, which have been greatly neglected in former years, are now commanding something more of attention. The railroads furnish an easy and safe conveyance of the fruit to market. Our stock is chiefly brought from other States. Very little is raised here. Hence, the number of animals kept is too small for any thing like systematic dairying or fattening of cattle. Forty per cent. of our land is supposed to be in forest, and of the residue, a considerable portion is a near approach to barren waste. The wages of labor which mechanical business commands discourages, to some extent, agricultural improvements. Mechanics receive from                                                                                                                                                             $1.25 to                                               $2.50 cents per day for their services, and laborers on farms think the disparity too great when they receive only from 75 cents to                                                                                                                                                             $1 per day, which the farmers think as much as can be justified by the value of produce. X. a. 361 The monthly wages of farm laborers by the year range from                                                                                                                                                                                    $12 to                                                                                                                                                               $17; in the summer months from                                                                                                                                                                              $15 to                                                            $20. In an early settled place like this, success in cultivation must depend very much in skill and industry in composing manure. To this subject attention has been invited in annual offers of premiums for the largest and richest com post heaps. All may not have been effected in those offers which was desired, but sufficient improvements have been made to give many of our fields new and more attractive aspects. The resources of manure on our farms are not yet fully explored unfortunately the attention of some farmers has been diverted from the certain path of interest, by puffed accounts of the wonderful effects of gun no and certain concentrated manures, which renders have strong interest in largely recommending. An economical use of the various materials found on every farm; the early reduction of vegetable matters to the component substances, and the judicious application of those substances to fields, are the most certain means of general prosperity among farmers. Respectfully, Morri Of Allenl, On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Watertown, Massachusetts, . Sov. 20, 1848. Dear Of R: Your favor of Patent Office reports, by Mr. Grown, was duly received, and I feel greatly obliged to you for the same will comply with your request in regard to my farm as far as I am able. I shall not be able to give you a detailed account of products grown, or receipts for each, but I propose to give you the gross amount of receipts for 'the years 1845, 6), and '7, as taken from my cash book. I employ one man to carry my produce to market daily, and he frequently takes an assistant with two or more loads, and he settles with me at night for all that is carried, and it is entered as cash received for marketing, except hay and pork, which are entered as such, as the case may be. And so ofdisbursements: I charge the farm with all labor performed, both in the house and out, (and it is all done by hired labor, as I have no family of my own residing with me, except a daughter) all provisions and stores for family, all grain and feed for hogs, and all expenses incurred in prose cuting the business of the farm, and in keeping the buildings and farm in repair, and improvements on the ground. My whole grounds contain 120 acres, fifteen of which are wood and pasture, a large share of which is broken and hilly, and not susceptible of cultivation, and twenty-five acres more that I have reclaimed from bog or brush swamp, and are too wet for cultivation, on fruit trees. The balance, eighty acres, is employed ingrowing the usual crops that are produced in this section of country, and are more or less occupied by orchards of apples, pears, peaches, plums, cher rise, and small fruits. Some twenty-five acres 32 X. are yearly under cultivation, and planted with about the following drops, varying as circumstances require. By 5 acres of corn for market and stock. 3 " <a name="potatoes47"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, early and late." 4 " vines melon, s qu ash, and cucumbers u of ~a~ roots bees, carrots, and par ships." 1 " cabbage." 3 (a( miscellaneouspeas, beans, turn is, sal lads, &c." 3 "C rye or barley; and some six or eight acres not dropped at all, but kept constantly cultivated for the benefit of the t fees, the latter in grass, which produces heavy crops, as none of it goes more than five years without sloughing. I should judge the average crop to be two tons of hay to the acre, of corn, 60 bushels, <a name="potatoes48"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, 200, (but the last two years badly rotted and of littlearNhlue; carrots, 800; bees, 700; parson is, 600; and, as I manureibrerally, my other crops are luxuriant and produce well. Twothifds of my cultivated ground are a stiff, deep, moist soil, on a clay sub soil. The balance a lighter and driver, but deep, warm Soil, on a gravely sub :s il, nearly the whole rolling, but not silly. My stock consists of four horses, four oxen, four cows, and from forty to sixty hogs, and from four to six heiress, that I raise or purchase. The horses are stab led through the year, and fed with hay and grain, each receiving three pecks of chopped hay, well wet, and one peck of meal well mixed, and :fed at night, in the cool weather, and half the same, night and morning in warm weather, and a peck of carrots in the morning through the winter; oxen stabbed nine months in the year, and fed as horses with half the allowance of grain, full allowance of roots through the winter, and pastured on mowing grounds in the fall months; calves pastured through the summer, and fed on corn, fodder, and hay, and roots in winter. The young cattle are sent into the country to pasture through theummner, and fed as cows in the winter. They come in at two years old and are sold with the calves. Dogs are purchased at Right on, spring and fall, weighing from 120 to 140 lbs; and kept six months and slaughtered. They will average 280 lbs. dressed for market, are fed on the refuse vegetables and fruit produced on the farm, which are boiled together with some 300 lbs. of beef scraps, or six Bushels of meal, or an equivalent, in a kettle holding 600 gallon s after which is added, as fed, the same amount of s lines, a wash which I purchase at the starch factory, being the best -part of washing in the process of making starch from flour; and for the last six or eight weeks, I increase the allowance of meal sufficient to" keep them in the highest state of th rift. I have three barns for storing hay-one 40 feet by 50, 13 feet posts, one 30 by 50, 22 feet posts, and one 30 by 40, 16 feet posts; and a s tack barn, 56 by 60, with a mill house, 22 by 40, on the east end, with cellar under the barn. They stand facing south entrance at the west end. The ground falls 8 feet :in 60 'to the east; east of that nearly level, and level with the bottom of the cellar. The east end of the barn stands on a brick wall 8 feet x. Doc. j. 59. 362 high, and the cellar is divided in the centre length wise, by a brick wall 12 inches thick, dividing the manure cellar from the fruit cellar. The manure cellar is entered on a level from the yard at the east end by a door, 16 feet wide, at the south end of the mill house, for the purpose of drawing in loam and bringing out manure; and the fruit cellar is entered through the mill house and scuttle in the barn floor, and both lighted with glass windows that open to admit the air; but neither are to be allowed to freeze in winter. The yard is protected on the west by a shed running south 100 feet, including a gateway to the feed house for hogs, which is situated on the south side of yard, 16 by 50 feet, and on the south side of that the boiling house, 16 by 25 feet. Later is brought to the shed in the yard through a lead pipe, from a rising ground 40 rods distant. 'horses and cattle stand over the manure cellar which is constantly supplied with loam, swamp much, weeds, or any substance that will absorb the urine of cattle and hogs; and the manure spread frequently, as it is necessary for the th rift of the hogs that the cellar should be kept supplied with fresh loam or litter of some kind, as often as it becomes wet or muddy; and the amount of manure that can be made by attending strictly to the above, is surprising. I should say not less than 600 loads, of 25 bushels each, of the best and strongest kind of manure, a retaken annually from my yard and cellar, and this, for the most part, is spread and ploughed in at the rate of 30 loads per acre more or less, as the different crops require. In addition to the above, I purchase, say 25 loads of horse manure, to mix with portions of the above for planting early vegetables, and such things as require forcing or artificial heat, I consider winter apples my best crop. Their average yield is 1,000 barrels of Baldwins andros sets. They are picked by hand and packed in barrels stowe din my fruit cellar daily as picked. And I have a good supply andassortment of summer and fall apples, pears, peaches, plums, andcherries. The crop of peaches has been small, and quality poor for several years past. The whole amount of receipts for the years 1845, 1846, an 187, are                                                                                                                                                                 $18,834, of which                         $4,257 were received for hay, and                         $4',552 for pork the balance for fruit, vegetables, stock, &c. Tthewhole expenses for the same time are                                                                                                                                                                                             $10,148, of which for labor w as .a. .a. . .a. .a. .a. .a.                          $3,52Grain and feed for hogs. .a. .a. .a. . .a. 2,065HObgs.. . .a. .a. .a. . .a. .a. .a. .a. 1 57 Manure. .a. .a. .a. .a. . .a. . .a. 373 Provisions. .a* *a* .a* *a. . . . . .a. 260 Goods. .a o. . . . o. .a. . . 0 .a. .a. .a. . 707Taxes. .a. .a. . .a. . .a. . .a. .a. 310 Stock .la .a. .a. .a. .a. .a. 309Miscellaneous. . .a. .a. .a. .a. . a1025And the receipts for the years 1844 and 1848 will equal the average of the above. In cultivating my land, my practice is to plough as deep as the364Ex. ground will admit, gradually increasing the depth until my largest grass plough will seldom reach the sub soil. Except when rocks prevent it, I consider deep sloughing of the utmost importance and almost any lands that are under cultivation, except rocky and clay, may be deepened by gradually turning small portions of the sub soil to the surface to be converted by the sun, air, and frost, to productive loam. 'I have been at heavy outlays in clearing of frocks and draining wet lands. My practice has been, where there was fall sufficient, to make covered drains; that is, dig a trench some three feet deep, 2 to 4, feet wide at bottom, and such width at top as will be most convenient for working. May a drain 6 inches wide and 10 high with cobb le stone, and cover with the largest size of the same, and fill with small stones to within 12 inches, and then cover with shavings and fill with earth; level with surrounding ground. Any of those drains have been down for seven to twelve years, and none of them have as yet failed to perform all that was expected of them. I have pitt down some 400 rods of the above, and have some 400 rods of open ditch and drains where there was not sufficient fall to admit of covering; portions of the mare subject to be washed by heavy fresh its in spring, which would wash away the banks, and the ditches would fall in a few years, so as to become inoperative. I tried many experiments to protect the bank, and my last one was successful, which was adopted in 1841, and was as follows: I commenced at the outlet or lower end of the ditch in June, as early as the water had fallen away so that I could work, by making temporary drains ahead in the ditch. I had the ditch cleared out and banks cut down or filled up, as the case might be, to make them straight and of the proper shape. I then commenced laying the banks with sons cut from the swamp 6 inches wide, 18 inches long, and 4 inches thick- These were laid grass side down, and joints broken in the same manner that you would in laying brick, each course falling back and resting on the bank a trench cleaned out some 4 inches before the natural level of the ditch to commence with, to prevent it from being undermined and washed away. The wall was carried up nearly, to the top, when the sons were removed and laid grass side up level with the surrounding grounds. The face of the bank was then trimmed smooth with a spade, and the grass started immediately from the edges of the sons; and before winter the whole surface was covered with a rank growth of swamp grass, which has stood to this day against frost and snow, as not a rod has given way since it was finished. My manner of reclining swamp lands, varies according to circumstances. When the grounds are too soft to admit of sloughing, they are cleared and leveled as far as possible; and when the ground is frozen, I cart on and spread, as fast as delivered, clay, loam, or gravel, whichever are available, one and a half inch thick. In the top of that a good coat of strong com posts manure, and sow with one peck of herds grass and two pecks of red top seed to the acre. But when the lands are hard enough to plough, I prefer to plant with <a name="potatoes49"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> until the ground is well subdued, so that it can be laid in slight ridges by the plough, a six. a. 365 is desirable to drain. My subsequent practice is to top dress the soft part of the swamp, and turn over the *hard with the plough, and manure liberally, and s tack on the sod in September as often as the grass wants renewing. Should you prefer a more detailed account, you will please inform me in what manner you would like to have it drawn up; and you are at liberty to make use of the whole, or any part of the above, that suits your convenience. Most respectfully yours ,LEONARD Stone. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. West Cambri Dge, Mass, January 15 1849. Of Dear Of R: By request, I here with send you a brief account of my farm, without entering into a detail of the crops grown upon it, or the manner of cultivating those crops. My farm consists of about twenty-six acres, most of which has heretofore been considered poor and worn out land. About seven acres are now pretty well covered with fruit trees, mostly apple and p each trees; about half of it was in full bearing the last year the remainder will be in a bearing state this year. The whole surface of the ground is so covered with the trees as to produce a small and inferior crop' of any vegetables I plant or sow among them. The remainder of my farm, being about nineteen acres, I cultivate wholly in the raising of vegetables for f the Boston market. My object is profit, not ornament or show; I therefore cultivate such kinds of vegetables as in my judgment will give me the greatest net profit, keeping in view the variety which the successive crops and seasons require. I have found it necessary and profitable to use glass for the hothouse, in for warding plants in winter and early spring. I have 250 sashes on about 1,400 surface feet of glass, under which I growlettuce and ra dishes. I also forward tomato, ce very, cabbage and other plants. The two past seasons I have grown the dandelionunder glass, with what I considered a fair profit. I have received three dollars a sash of eighteen square feet, or one shilling a foot, for the simple and homely article, the dan de lion, grown under glass. It may not be quite so profitable again; still, I shall try it. As I before remarked, I raise a general assortment of vegetables, such as peas, beans, early and murray me s qu ashes, bees, carrots, onions, early <a name="potatoes50"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, corn, and melons of all the varieties. I have raised the cauliflower and brow coli four or five years last past at a fair profit; they sell in the market at wholesale at from                                                                                                                                                                                   $12 to                                                                                                                                                                             $15 per hundred. There are but few farmers in this county who succeed in raising them. The manure I used in the cultivation of my farm the past year I find to be no small item of expense. One hundred and eighty-five 366 X. loads of stable manure, ten loads of night soil, composed with stable manure, meadow mud and loam, has cost me the sum of                                                                                                                                                             $1,347.34, including the tearing, by an account kept of the cost. I almost always use the stable manure upon my grounds in a crude state, just as it is taken from the stable, when the ground is in a proper state to use it. I have employed upon my farm the past season six hired men-four for eight months, two the year round at about                                                                                                                                                                $16 per month per man. I have paid                        $80 for day laborers besides; hoard for my men, say                                                                                                                                                                                             $10 per month; making the expense of labor and board about                                                                                                                                                             $1,600. My team consists of three horses to do the work on my farm and to carry the produce to the market. I purchase all' the hay and grain to keep my horses at an expense of about                               $350 per year. My other unavoidable expenses the t wear and tear" of farming tools, wagons, harnesses, blacksmiths' and wheels rights' bills amount to no inconsiderable sum; but when I turn to my account of the proceeds of the sales of the produce actually s bid in the market, as accurately kept by daily entries, I find the, same to amount to                            $5,726.23, with considerable produce un sold; the balance still remaining, after de ducting the above enumerated expenditures, is to me quite satisfactory being a fair interest for the capital invested, and a reasonable compensation for my services in the management of the farm. I have omitted to add anything by way of the, increased value of my farm by the growth of my fruit trees, from a large part of which I have not yet received any crop. They are now just coming into' a bearing state; I have, therefore, a right to expect, with the same cultivation, a much larger income the present and future years than that of the last year. With much respect, yours, George Pei Rce. On. Edmund Burke. Of. Albans, Frankli N County, Vermont, December 9, 1848. Of R: In the estimates which I have made, in reply to your circular of 1848, I have availed myself of the aid of gentlemen engaged in producing, or who are dealers in the articles, and in whose judgment I have the fullest confidence. I have not attempted an estimate of the amount of produce consumed within the county, and some other estimates I have omitted, not having sufficient data to arrive at conclusions satisfactory to myself. When I have given quantities, I have given the surplus only, or what is sent to maiketThe season has been favorable for all kinds of crops at the time of planting and harvesting, and through the season, except a small portion of the county h bordering on the like, where some of the crops were injuriously affected by drought in July. X. a. 367 The crops have been unusually free from injury by blight or insects, especially the wheat worm, which has heretofore been very destructive; very little damage has been sustained from it this season. There was some more wheat :sown this year than last, and the crop may be estimated dat 10 per cent. more. The crop is not equal to the consumption of the county, and probably there will be required some 4,000 barrels flour to make up the deficiency Of coarse grains, the production is about equal to the consumption. <a name="potatoes51"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, before the rot prevailed, were extensively cultivated in this county for the manufacture of starch; the crop has diminished fully one half. There was not s many planted this as the last year, but less damage has been sustained by disease, and the crop may be estimated at 15 per cent. increase. To remedy is known here for the <a name="potato37"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot. They are said to be less liable to disease when planted on land moderately rich, not too moist, and without manure; 'green s ward is preferred. The dairy produce is fast increasing, and is estimated this year at 15 to 20 per cent. more than the last. Preparations are making for at least an equal increase the coming year. The quantity sent to market this year is estimated at 350 tons of cheese and 250 tons of butter, amounting to over                         $800,000. The surplus wool of the county may be estimated at about 200 000 pounds, and to have decreased about 10 per cent; since s hearing, the sheep have diminished from 15 to 20 per cent. Battle is one of the principal productions of the county. The increase is estimated :by competent judges at 10 per cent, and the sales equal in amount to last year.

Dear Of R: I received last summer a circular of queried, desiring information on various topics connected with agricultural productions, &c, a is 'compared with 1847. The circular has been unfortunately his laid, and now, being without a guide, only from memory by a hasty perusal of the circular' at the time, I shall be un a 368 ix. able to answer all the inquiries therein requested. But so far as my recollection will serve me I will, with pleasure, give to the Patentoffice the desired information. Windsor County Agricultural Society was formed March, 1846. Present number of i members, about 640. Funds from the State;                                                $276; do. from members,                   $640; total,       $916.

The state of the weather at seed time this year was very favorable for this climate more so than in 1847. April was a very dry month; no want of rain throughout the season. September a cold month, but no frost so early and severe as to injure the crop of indian corn, which is very good, particularly in the towns adjacent to the Connecticut river; though compared with the crop of 1847, there may be a trifling per cent age off. Of wheat, there is comparatively but little produced in this section. In newly cleared lands, and on high, elevated lands, of a deep, strong soil, a good crop may, be obtained; but generally it has proved a failure on our old lands, and has been mostly abandoned. Great quantities of western flour are annually consumed by the farmers themselves in Windsor county. Eye is a good crop with us on dry and light soils. Oats are a sure and profitable crop on deep and good soils. <a name="potatoes52"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, once so sure and profitable as food both for man and beast, have become the most uncertain of all our productions. The rot, however, is not so general as last year, though considerable in some localities. Experience has taught us that early planting is the safest remedy against this destructive malady; yet this is not sure. This crop may be considered' 10 per cent. better than last year, though not over half the yield of former years. I should have said, when speaking of the o at crop, that the average yield is 25 per cent. over last year. But very little barley is grown in this region. The low price of cotton goods has for years entirely supplanted the use of domestic linens, and driven the cultivation of flax away from our country. The grass crop, so necessary a cultivation in high northern latitudes, is this year very good, though a slight falling off from last year in this region. Our pasturage and grazing lands have been more than an average throughout the season, on account of the seasonable and abundant rains. Considerable map le sugar of a superior quality is produced in Windsor county, and sells readily 331 per cent. above the common brown sugar of New Orleans or the West I india islands. Our root crops, except the <a name="potato38"><mark>potato</mark></a>, have been good this season. Garden and field vines, pump king and s qu ashes in particular, have in most cases proved a total failure, in consequence of the early ravages of the vine bug, a destructive insect, for which we know of no remedy. Apples, almost the only fruit of importance here, have come out about an average of last year. The productions of the dairy are increasing in the same ratio that that of wool is dear easing, in cone x, Doc.

Price of dairy, same as last year; price of wool, 25 per cent. less. Average cut of flee ces, 3 pounds per head. Beef has brought a good price, and is about the same as last years n the raising and. fattening of hogs we cannot compete with the fertile and virgin soil of the west, the cheapness of their lands c. We produce no more pork than is wanted for our own consumption. 'horses are raised to some extent, are profitable, and will compete in any market ,in ,the United States for durability, form and beauty. Vermont horses stand at the head in our northern markets. In the whole, our agricultural interests are improving. Our county societies are awakening a spirit of improvement, and doing much good. Our railroads now in progress, and some in operation, are giving an impetus to business of all kinds; and Vermont is destined to stand at the head of the Union in agricultural productions, in proportion to area and population, for the next half century. The also has the resources of greatness in manufacturing operations; but whether these sources of national wealth are to be developed within her valleys and upon her water falls, remains yet to be seen. Considerable improvements are making in the grafting of winter fruit, setting out young orchards of entire grafted fruit, mostly for winter use; and with the facilities of railroad communication, a new source of wealth is opened to Vermont farmers in this one item. The subject of saving and making manure is getting a prominent hold upon the ideas of our farmers; much attention and labor are now bestowed upon this subject, and a manifest improvement in the renovation of farms and the yield of crops is the result. Most of our farmers are no longer content to follow the beaten track of their fathers. Though they are not wanting in veneration for their ancestry, yet to practise upon the exhausting system of the soil, as their fathers did, is contradictory to their own good sense, intelligence and judgment, and they are fast breaking away from those old wedded customs, and, keeping their -best interests in view, they are becoming modern practical men. I think one of your inquiries had reference to wages of labor, transportation to market, &c; also, average cost of production, and amount per acre. I indian corn, per acre 40 bushels; cost of labor, exclusive of worth of fodder, (which will pay the harvesting) 28 cents per bushel. Present market price per bushel, 67 cents, 20 per cent less than last year. Eye, 16 bushels per acre. Present worth per bushel, 75 cents 20 per cent. less than last year. Most of labor in producing, 30 cents per bushel. Oats, 45 bushels per acre. Present worth, 34 cents per bushel 30 per cent. less than last year. Most of producing, exclusive of straw, which will pay the threshing, 17 cents per bushel 12 370 X. a. May, 11 tons per acre.

Of <a name="potatoes53"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, no correct estimate can be given, so variable has the crop been in different places. The above statements include the expense of seed, with the labor, but no charge for manure.

Of there are any facts herein contained that will be of any benefit to the Patent Office for the next report, I shall be amply repaid for communicating them. Very truly, &c. W. Colburn. On. Edmund Burke. New York State Agri Cultural Soci Etys Rooms, Albany, January 2pl849. In compliance with your request, relative to the agricultural products, &c, of this State for the year 1848, I give you s u ch information as has been received at our rooms, and obtained from personal observation throughout the State, during the se a son pasts we have no statistical returns of our crops, I can only give you the general average, and a general view of the agriculture of the State. It is gratifying to be enabled to assure you that there is an advance among our farmers in their methods of conducting their operations; and the instances are neither few nor rare where farms are managed with all that skill and care with are to be found upon the best cultivated farms abroad. The results of these improved systems of husbandry are not only beneficial to the individuals who have adopted them, but their influence is happily extending to others. The prejudice, which it is probable has more or less affected the minds of most of our farmers, in relation to improvements, is fast giving way before the evidences which 'experience reaches them cannot well be resisted. It is important in this connexion to observe the beneficial influence exerted upon the' agricultural interest of our State by our State and county societies. The change which has been wrought during the past eight years is not apparent, and much of it is traceable, I think, to the influences arising from the labors and efforts of these associations. While it is true that they have not accomplished all that they might have done, it is 'nevertheless apparent that in various ways they have contributed to a better state ofagriciilture than we have hitherto enjoyed, so much as to encourage us to make renewed efforts to render them still more useful. X. a. 371 t seems to me that the importance of this branch of national industry, the foundation of all our prosperity as a nation, and upon the success of which depends the perpetuate of our free institutions, demands more attention from our general government than has been given to it. While it is not expected that legislation can make good farmers, it is nevertheless true that, in innumerable ways, the patronage of the government might develop e our resources, open new channels of trade, and encourage and elevate the farmer, and combine with other agencies to render this most important class of our citizens among the most intelligent, as they are now among the most virtuous. Upon them does the country rely for aid in time of trial, and to them and their advancement should the energies, of the government be directed in proportion to their importance to the public welfare and prosperity. The annexed general statement will give such information as I possess of our agricultural productsWheatThis crop has proved generally very good; in many of our wheat growing districts it has been all that could be desired in the language of a farmer in one of the western counties, .excellent in quantity and quality of grain." From all I can ascertain, I should think the crop will equal the average yield of former years. In some sections of the State the "wheat ridge' (or weevil, l as it is called sometimes erroneously) has done some damage. To avoid the injury resulting from this insect, the Mediterranean wheat has been introduced to a considerable extent in some counties, and the result has been very favorable. This variety of wheat, as well as the white blue stem, generally escape the ravages of this destructive insect. The yield of the Mediterranean has been large; in some i stances, thirty bushels and upwards per acre for large fields. This is a red wheat, and (cid127oes not produce quite as white flour as some other varieties; but it is said that it will produce more flour to the bushel. It ri pens from ten to twelve days earlier than the usual varieties. This wheat is less liable to the rust than most others. The white blue stem wheat is a very handsome serried wheat, and is also said to escape the fly and rust. We received a sample of this wheat from the On. H. L. Ellsworth in 1843; and from the trial of this, as well as the Mediterranean, we are satisfied that they are much less liable than any varieties we have seen cultivated in this State to damage from insects or rust. In the same field, in One ida county, our then residence, we sowed Mediterranean, white flint, and You les wheat, The former produced an excellent crop, while the two other varieties were almost entirely destroyed by the fly. At our late States how, at Buffalo, the first premium was awarded for a sam pie of white blue stem, wheat, raised in Chautauque county from seed originally received from the Patent Office. I to weight, I think was about 64 pounds to the bushel. It had for competitors our best varieties cultivated; but this was considered superior to al. others. The grower sold it readily for two dollars per bushel. While on the subject of wheat, I would refer to the improvement of Mr. Men tz, of Boonesboro, Maryland, of un branding the wheat372Ex. previous to grinding, to which the attention of the public was first called by our society, as will be seen by reference to their transactions, 1847, page 190. A diploma was awarded to Mr. Men tz, and efforts were subsequently made for its introduction into our flouring mills. At our late fair, By man A. Spaulding, esq, ofLockport, in this State, presented half a barrel of wheat, prepared by Mr. Cents process, for grinding. This, Mr. Spaulding says, "is the first wheat ever done by machinery, so arranged as to make it an object for a miller. It is perfectly simple and dura be, being made of cast iron, and will un ran one hundred bushels per hour. The machine can be furnished ready to attach to any running power for one hundred dollars." 'the advantages claimed for it are, "that all varieties of wheat are improved from five to fifteen cents per bushel, and good varieties of red and yellow wheats will make as good and fair meal as the white varieties now do, which ordinarily sell from ten to fifteen cents higher per bushel than the red." Themediterranean wheat, after going through this process, has as white, clear merry as the white wheats, so that the objection on account of the color of the flour will not exist against wheat un branded by this process. In the manufacture by this process, from forty to fifty-two pounds of wheat upon an average is saved in a barrel of flour. There are also several other advantages claimed for this process, which are fully set forth in the article referred to. In a letter from Mr. It is said that the miller using this machine can afford to give 12.cents per bushel more than can be afforded by mills without this improvement. Another season will doubtless more fully test its qualities; and should it succeed, as I see no reason why it should not, it will prove of immense advantage to our country. I distributed last season several samples of wheat for trial received from your office. Some of it, I understand, has done well and promises to be useful. I will give the particulars as soon as received. Barleythis crop is raised extensively in some parts of the State; The crop is, perhaps, hardly equal to that of last year, which was a small crop for this State. In some sections the crop was remarkably good, while in others the crop has been a diminished one; the quality of the grain is good. A new kind of barley, called the "Cheltenham black skinned barley' has been received at our rooms, which is highly spoken of in England. Sample of this barley I forwarded to your office, The following description of it is taken from an English paper: "his extraordinary and productive species of barley is at present to be seen in full ear and blossom near Pal mouth, and, from present appearances, will be ready to cut by midsummer. It was planted in the latter part of October, and has withstood the frost, cold winds, and wet, during the winter. This barley is six rowed, and w as propagated from three corns, by a tobacconist at Cheltenham, who planted it in January, 1843, during a severe frost of six weeks, and produced 5,610 grains. It is supposed to be a native of Abyssinia, where six rowed black and white barley grows very luxuriantly. The average produce of barley grown in 1847 was about x. 373 23 Furnish bushels to the acre weight 69 pounds. :-I t appears suited to any description of land, and proves itself good either in frost or drought. I I t i males well and makes good light colored ale; its flour produces excellent bread, and the straw is well adapted for planting or thatching. This barley i has been distributed in different parts of the State, and some of it from which   have heard, is presenting a fine appearance. Should it succeed here, it will prove a very valuable grain, and will, doubtless, come into general use. I shall take great pleasure in giving due account of the results as they will be communicated by the gentlemen who have the grain in cultivation. Ryethis Drop, which is not largely cultivated, is a very good crop, and probably larger than usual. The samples in market, which I have seen, have been excellent. A new variety, themulticole has been cultivated to some extent, which has been recommended as a very prolific variety; but, so far as my observation extends, the results have not been as favorable as in some other sections of the State, where it has succeeded well; another years trial may produce equal returns here. It requires less seed than the common rye, as it tillers remarkably. I have in the agricultural rooms the proceeds from one berne l, 120 s talks, raised opposite this city. Oasthe crop of oats this year has been an excellent one. This is a very important crop in this State, and the price during ,the year has been such as to render it a very profitable one. Yuri farmers are beginning to learn that a crop of sixty bushels, at least, may be raised without difficulty, and many crops largely exceed this. In a farm within a few miles of this city, on the sand plains between here and Schenectady, the yield of oats for the last four years has been equal to 60 bushels per acre; this has been secured by raising turn is, feeding sheep off the land, and turning in a green crop c lover. In Jefferson county, a yield of 110 bushels per acre has been reported, weighing 41 pounds to the bushel. Buckwheatthe crop has been very good, and the samples of grain in market remarkably fine. A new variety is cultivated in Sullivan and Its ego counties, called the blue buckwheat, which is highly spoken of. It can be sowed as early as the first of June, and is said seldom to be affected by the hot sun, and ,yields well, and where cultivated has almost entirely super ceded the ordinary buckwheat. The seed was obtained from a German, in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, who said it was called "canada buckwheat' and probably came from i Canada. The flour commands twenty-five cents per 100 pounds over the ordinary buckwheat flour in the New York market. I indian corn The past season has proved, upon the whole, a very favorable one for this all important crop. The corn filled remarkably well, never better; and the quantity raised is probably larger than in any former year. Our farmers in some of the wheat growing districts are best owing more attention upon this crop. I t doubtless pays as well as any crop raised, and is devoted to more 374 X. useful purposes than any other grain. Great care is taken to preserve the s talks in good condition, and the practice is becoming general to cut them up and mix them with shorts or meal for the use of cattle; and their value is equal, I should think, per ton weight to good hay. Such, at all events, is the opinion of some of our best farmers who have made the trial. Potatoesthe yield has been light, but the crop less affected with disease, taking the whole State, than any year since it has been prevalent. As yet no sufficient cause has been a signed for the disease, satisfactory to the public at large. Early planting, on moderately good soils of strong varieties and well cultivated has succeeded best, in the opinion of a gentleman who has given much attention to the subject; and, as a general rule, I think it may be said that early planting has succeeded best; but, as if to defy all calculations, many of the earlier planted crops entirely failed this year, while those later planted in the same vicinity escaped entirely. An article on the <a name="potato39"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, by Rev. C. E. Good rich, Tic a, in vol. Trans. 1847, page 425, displays much research and a careful examination of the effect of the seasons and alternate changes of weather; and Mr. G. says that the experience of the season of 1848 fully confirms his views, as contained in that article. The crop of hay has been excellent, exceeding, I think, the usual yield considerably. The season was favorable for its early growth, and the result has been a very abundant crop. Flaxmore attention, I think, is given to this crop than formerly. From my observation the past season, I should think a considerable greater breadth of land has been in cultivation with flax than for several years, and the return has been very fair. Tobaccovery little raised. There it has been attempted, it has succeeded very well; but it will never be a crop that will receive much attention in this State. Silkthere are comparatively few who attend to the preparation and manufacture of silk. Line samples of sewing silk, as well as manufactured goods, are exhibited at many of our shows, and those who have steadily pursued the business have made it profitable. It deserves much more attention than it receives; and, if encouraged by the general and State governments, as I think it should be, the quantity would be increased, and a supply eventually for our own consumption be secured. Sugarthe manufacture of map le sugar is very extensive in this State, and much of it of a character equal to the very best sugar in market. As an evidence of the perfection which has been secured, I give you an extract from the report of the judges on sugar at our last show. The judges say: ' The first premium is awarded ,benjamin A us, jr, of Last Gloom field, for a sample which is unequal led, it being in the style, and fully equal in appearance and grain, to Stuarts or: Volleys best crushed sugar Of another sample y, they say : It is very white, coarsegrainedsugar, fully equal ,to Stuarts best coffee sugar." Another, f sample of fine yellow coarse grained sugar, resembling l a good are x. 
375ticle of It. Croix sugar." The judges were merchants of Buffalo, fully competent to judge, and their decision shows to what a state of perfection the manufacture has attained. It is hoped that the census of 1850 will give a full account of the amount manufactured in this State, as it was omitted in our State census of 1845. Foot crops There are but comparatively few sections of the State where much -attention is given to the cultivation of roots still there are many who have pursued their cultivation with success. Of their value, there can be little doubt; and when the raising of them is understood, and the land is favorable, they prove not only. profitable for feeding cattle, but, when fed to sheep, they also secure the enriching of the soil, and leave the land in fine condition for succeeding crops. The following statement of an excellent farmer in this State, who raised last year 1, 3 179 bushels of rutabagas per acre, estimating 50 lbs. to the bushel, will, I doubt not, be found useful: "having the last eight years cultivated the rut a bag a crop extensively (from four to six acres yearly) for feeding, I annex my method of culture. Generally, I have taken fields that have laid from three to five years in grass in good condition, without using any manure, turning over the sod the fall previous. In the spring, between the first of May and the 15th or 20th of June, (which latter time is the time of putting in my seed) I generally plough and harrow, at intervals in succession, the ground from two to three times, (depending on the stiffness of the sod) the last time narrowing immediately before drilling in the seed, using a fine light garden harrow, tearing the surface as smooth as possible. As soon as the plant obtains three or four leaves, I commence with a weed, ing 'knife to thin and weed, having help sufficient to finish as soon as possible; I then follow with a cultivate or. As soon as necessary, I go through with a he, rather taking the soil from the plants instead of adding theretocid127) and then completing the thinning process, leaving a distance of from six to ten inches between the plants the drill rows being was near thirty-three inches as possible then follows the cultivatoralways using the cultivate or last. By using good land, I ,get a cleaner crop with less labor, with about the same yield as using land under culture with manure From the success which has attended this method of cultivation, I deem it one of the best methods of raising roots with which I am acquainted. Seas and beans The average yield of these crops is between 20 a nd 40 bushels. Seas are generally cultivated. I have seen, the past season, large fields of beans growing, and I should judge that increased attention is now being given to this crop. Rotation of crops believe the number of farmers is rapidly increasing in this State, who are giving attention to a rotation of crops, that will secure the thorough culture of the land, with increased fertility. It was been the' practice especially in some of the wheat growing districts to crop with wheat as long as the land would yield even; a small return; but the experience of late years has shown that the 376 X. land would not bear this, and return any sufficient regeneration. A change is apparent, and I doubt not the time will soon come when the adaptation of the crops to the nature of the soil and climate will be generally attended to, so as to secure a continued succession of crops, that will regenerate the farmer and still preserve his land in an improving condition. That this can be done by judicious draining and maturing, and by a proper rotation of crops, has been demonstrated by many of our farmers; and when it shall generally prevail, will add immensely to the wealth and prosperity of the State. Fruitthe culture of fruit for our own markets, and for exportation, is receiving much attention throughout the State. The soil and climate of New Work, taken as a whole, I believe is the best fruit growing region in the world. There is no fruit which is sent to the English market that keeps as well and arrives in so good condition as ours. :the extent of this traffic is very large. Single individual from one of our extreme counties, (Niagara shipped, the past fall, to Liverpool, 2,000 barrels of apples of 25 different varieties. I noticed in a Chicago paper that there had been received there, th;e past season, from New York and Ohio, from 8 to 10,000 barrels, and that the New York fruit was esteemed the best. Whether this arose from more care and attention in selecting and packing) or from the superior flavor of the fruit, I do not know. The appearance of the Ohio fruit which I saw at thePomological Convention at Buffalo, was certainly equal to any I have ever seen; and I should suppose the fruit of northern Ohio would be as good as any of our western fruit. The growing importance of the fruit business induced the State Agricultural Society, in connexion with the Horticultural Society at Buffalo, to call a convention of fruit growers from all the States in the Union and the Canadas. The convention was held, and a large number of delegates, and others of the most distinguished pomologists and fruit growers from 14 different States and counties were present Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, New Work, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, I n diana, I illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Canada, east and west. This was, I believe, the first general convention ever held in this country, and the results of its deliberations were of the most satisfactory character. The deliberations of the convention, the open examination of all fruits exhibited, and the discussions of the members, were calculated to do great good, and the mass of information received was of the most valuable character. The convention resolved to continue their sessions annually, and organized under the name of "' The Jorthadmerican Domo logical Convention" and appointed the next annual meeting to be held at the place of holding the next annual fair of the New York State Agricultural Society. It cannot, I think, be questioned, that the results of the labors of this convention, as they shall continue from year to year, will be productive of great good, and finally secure a list of fruits suited to every portion of our country of the most valuable character, and rid us of the almost countless varieties that are unworthy of cultivation, which x. 377 are annually palmed off upon those who are unacquainted with their worthless character. Believing that the proceedings of the convention in an abridged form will be useful to the country at large, I have selected some portions of the proceedings, as furnished by one of the secretaries, German *wendell, M. D., of Albany, which will, I presume, be useful, as well as interesting. The convention was organized by the appointment of the following officers. Presidentdavid Thomas, N. Y. Vice Presidentswilliam R. Top pock, N. Y.; J. W. Hayes, N. J.; A. T. Rout y, Rich; S. P. Beecher, His; Dr. C. Head le, C. W.; Henry H. Voit, Ohio; J. D. G. Elson, I nd; J. A. Kennicott, I ll; Thomas .ll en, To. W. J. Hayes, C. E. Secretariesdr. German Wendell, Albany, N. Y.; William R. Prince, N. Y. The following rules were adopted for the government of the business of the convention 1. During the hours of the day, the examination of varieties of fruit shall engage the attention of the convention. The most perish able shall be brought forward first by a committee of five, appointed for that purpose. One specific variety only shall be examined at a time, by calling on all delegates present for specimens of that variety for comparison and decision; and so on till all a reexamined. Only brief statements of facts in each case are to be allowed, that as little time may be occupied as possible 2. In cases where the convention cannot agree upon disputed questions relative to the merits or correct names of varieties, the whole subject shall be referred to a special committee of five, to examine and report thereon 3. During evenings and intervals, general discussion on various subjects of domo logical interest may engage the attention of the convention. During any discussion no member of the convention shall occupy more than ten minutes at a time, nor shall speak more than twice on any one subject. Adopted. Messrs. Benjamin Lodge, F. R.

The character of our butter and cheese is steadily improving, and it is not, I think, saying more than the truth will authorize me to say, that many of the fairies are equal to any in the world. Already the butter and cheese of our State are known and sought after wherever the stars and stripes are known, and the demand is annually increasing. From personal observation in England in 1846, 1 became satisfied that our cheese made for that market, similar in character to the English dairy cheese, would soon drive every foreign article out of the market and I understand it has nearly accomplished this already, and the best .of our cheese sent there nearly equals in price the very best English. I had occasion, last year, (1847) to make an examination as to the character of the butter made in this State to stand the test of tropical climates. From the accounts then received, as well as information obtained since, I became satisfied that, from a very large portion of the counties in this State, butter is made, in greater or less quantities, that will st nd the test of climate the world over. It has been supposed by gentlemen having charge of the supply of butter for the navy and army, connected with the Navydepartment, that the district of country from which butter could be made to answer the purpose .was confined to the county of Range, in this State. The accompanying statements, which are entitled to the most undoubted confidence, will dispel this illusion" : 'a- 'a~ 'a; " Y "a" *a' ' :il 386 X. and will satisfy every one who reads, that the field in this State is vastly more extensive than a single county, from which can be produced butter that will stand a voyage to China, and' some of which, after a voyage of four years in a whalingship has been found in "as sweet and good condition as when made" I deem these facts of great importance to the country, and- they deserve to be generally and widely disseminated. From the means of information I have of the manufacture of butter in this State, I can with safety say, that butter of this character, as to its keeping qualities, is increasing every year. ;the state society have for .several years directed their attention to the improvement of the fairies of the State, and I am satisfied with the most auspicious results. To show what is the character and quality of butter made in some of the southern and western counties of New Work, and its adaptation to tropical climates, the annexed extracts are given from letters from extensive dealers in butter in the city of New Work, which deservees they the "city of N 6 was they doubtless will receive, consideration of those who are interested in the purchase of butter for use in warm climates. Bethink it cannot be questioned that it is here clearly established, that a very large portion of the butter marked *to she" in the New York market, is actually made out of Range county; and it is but justice to the counties where it is made that credit should be given to those to whom it in justice belongs. Extracts From Lettersthe, butter made in the county of Cheamung is equal to that made in Change county, and will stand the southern climate a swell: Also that made in Tompkins county is well suited for shipment south, and stands the salt air as well as any butter we receive, ere, I find that western fairies sell as well as the best 0Goshenputtercid127' when sent south, and in many cases better, as it has more color. Merchants sending butter south mark it 'os hen, without any regard to the place or locality of its manufacture; it is unavoidable doing so, as the southern merchant requires it From another letter: "I have never had -a- 's dairy, but have had many others in that place, (Chemung) and one of my friends has had -sand -s, nd many others which I could mention' and a number of them have been sent south, to my certain knowledge, and they stand the climate equal to any of the Range county varies, and they fetch is high a price as any of the Range county The writer of the above has an: establishment at Now Orleans, where for a long time he has been in the practice of sending butter from Western New Work, and is competent to speak with certainty, as he does, of its keeping quality, From another letter Speaking of the manufacture of butter, it is saidcid127The defects arise from th'e manner of making& almost entirely x. a: 387 and but a small deduction is to be made from advantages of locality. I should think a Minisink (range county) dairy woman that Know, could go on a farm of natural grass and good water, and could make a dairy of 40 or 50 fir king, (for a large dairy is better than a small one, other things being equal) in some western spot, that would be a facsimile in eating and keeping with that she now makes in that place. In Mr. T-- s neighborhood (in Kaluga county) there are some fairies that keep very well, and more in Room e county, at a settlement of Range county people. There are some good fairies in <a name="chenango0"><mark>Chenango</mark></a>, but a great many more that are very poor his gentleman says he considers the butter made in Minisinkthe best; but, in his opinion, a dairy woman from that place could make a face smile of the, Minisink butter in some western spot, thus substantialing the position, that, as a general rule, it is the manufacture, not the location, that gives the preference so far as this State is concerned. From another letter: ."I n answer to your first inquiry, Whether butter made out of the county of Range, and in the southern and western counties of our State, is so made as to keep in our southern and warm climate s we answer that generally it is not; but this is not necessarily the case. In the contrary, we have a large quantity of fairies made in the following counties that have proved nearly if not quite equal, both as to quality and style of packages, to the Range county, viz: Chemung, Room e, and <a name="chenango1"><mark>Chenango</mark></a>, produce a large number of strictly prime and choice fairies; especially is this the case with a large portion of the fairies made in Chemung county. There are a goodly number of fairies made in this county, varying in size, from 15 to 80 fir king each, that are not only equal, but there are those among them that in our judgment are superior, Room e county also produces some strictly fine, but not in so large a proportion of the quantity made; and so also is this remark true of <a name="chenango2"><mark>Chenango</mark></a>, and those three counties produce the largest quantity e quality and style described. Tompkins county and Tiogaproduce some few strictly prime fairies; and in fact there is hardly a county where there are not some strictly choice fairies, made. The Each produce some choice fairies, but their style is tubs instead of fir king, which is an insuperable objection for shipping The C- dairy, of which you write, is made in Chemung, and has passed through our Mr. Is hands for the last fifteen years and has always proved superior, and never, we believe with but one exception, has this dairy been sold for less than 18 cents, and for the most part it has brought 20 cents, and as high as 28 cents, the entire dairy; and in this county there are several fairies that have and do bear the same high character in the best sense of the term, and will compare, to say the least, with the best that range does or ever has produced The annexed is from a letter received last July from an extensive dealer in Room e county, New Work 38 X. a. I I have not for old time .in til now to look a ver the circular .of the New York State Agricultural Society, relative to the manual, true of navy butter for foreign stations. What 'I wish rose better is, I do not know; but 'that the milk must be thoroughly worked out, and the butter cleanse de of all extraneous substances and be put up in good seasoned oak fir king, ,containing about 80 pounds, each, well and sir on gly hooped, so d as to be perfectly ,air, andpickletight' (these are the requirements for navy butter) Hate ch of these requirecid127eents is essential t t the manufacture and preservation of first rate butter, every one who is conversant with the subject well knows; and in the most perfect cleanliness in the manufacture, the use of lock salt, and the churning of the milk had been, required, I think the whole ground would have bien, covered. The idea. that no butter made ou. of Range county, will w resist the action of tropical climates and preserve its qualities for years is an utter absurdity. I think that nototonethiird of the butter sold in market as 'range county' is made in that locality. That county has, during ten years past, sent out -hundreds of emigrants to the counties of Sullivan, Delaware, Room e, <a name="chenango3"><mark>Chenango</mark></a>; Iowa, Tompkins, and Chemung, and perhaps others in this State, who have continued the manufacture of butter, for market, and who at the end, of each season have been; in the habit of transporting their butter in wagons across the country to .the different points of shipment in. Range county, and there shipping it, as 'range county any of these persons had, for years before em i grating, regular purchasers in New .work for their butter, who it was understood, were to take their po duct each year when made, and pay the- highest market price for it. These relations were, in many instances, continued for many: years before em i grating from r Range county, and many now continue :them, without the Least objection being made to the quality of the better; The :term, Range county butter, seems to be misunderstood- It does not mean (as I; understand, it) the locality where made, b ut a peculiar method o, f manufacture. The perfect neatness and cleanliness of everything about the fairies, the churning of the milkcinsteai of the cream, and the attention to the quality and quantity of salt, are the; principal peculiarities. The churning the milk, I deem essential to butter intended for long voyages. It gives it a peculiar firmness and finer new of text ire, and wax like appearance when it is fractured, which butter made by i churning the cream seldom e or never; has. These peculiarities can generally be detected by the eye. (cid127There -is a. cream like flavor to milk churned butter, which have never found in butter manufactured in a different manner. I believe i the highest price for fairies paid in New York for several years past has been paid for several fairies from, Chemung ;county. Being at the table of a well known gourmand in New Work, in the spring of 1847, I remarked the very fine quality of the butter. He replied, 'that such butter could not be made out of Range county. The conversation continued, till finally the original fir kin was brought up wh end  found it was branded, John Robert, (premium) (I Fr. Robert resides inChemung county, hundreds of miles west of Range county) Thisex. Dec. To: 59: 389 gentleman told ti e he had his supply of butter of this 9 dairy for several years, at an extra price of 33 cents per lb, of a particular grocer, who alone sold it' The opinion of 'the gentleman who has charge of the butter department of the United States navy that no butter made out of Range county will resist the action of tropical climates, I know to be erroneous. A dairy made in this county (room e) has been sent abroad much of the time for ten years past. In 1839, it was sold in It. Croix, to the governor, for 75 cents per pound. In 1840, it was sold in New Bedford, and went' on a whating voyage. I saw some of it after the expiration of nearly four years from its manufacture, as sweet and in as good condition as when made. The same dairy has since been sold in New Orleans, in Watched, and Mobile, and there never has been any complaint made as to its quality. I shipped some 'better 'that was the product of this county to Wanton, in 1846, which, under very disadvantageous circumstances, opened as fresh as when made, and proved so good that the shippers have each year since applied to me for butter for cabin stores for their ships. I broke up the original fir king, and procured a quantity of small white oak kegs, which would contain from 15 to 25 lbs. each, and repacked the butter, selecting the best from a large quantity. These kegs when' filled ere put in ere put in very large hogs heads, and filled in the interstices with rock salt, and placed in the hold of the vessel. This butter when sold (about eighteen months after its manufacture) was in as good condition as when made. The small kegs were not used in reference to the preservation of the butter, but merely for convenience of retailing at Cantonthe exportation of butter for the supply of the different cities along the coast of Asia, is probably destined to be a very considerable business. The entire supply for the immense cities in the possession of the British Last I india Company, being derived ifromEurope, (mostly from I re land, but some little from Holland) and it is usually purchased at home at a price which would fully pay an American shipper at its destination The relative proportion of our counties that is adapted to the production of the finer qualities of butter, is probably as small as any other article of general necessity; but much of the southern tier of counties, and also of the central and northern portions of the State of New Work, will, when well cultivated, produce the variety of grasses necessary to give butter the peculiar flavor and aroma of Range county, when properly manufactured, . The emigrants from Range county, before alluded to, all agree in opinion that as good butter can be made in their new locations as in Range county. Minisink is cited as being the locality producing the best butter in Range county. A Minisink dairy woman in this vicinity, who had for many years the reputation of being one of the best in that town, made her first dairy of about 60 fir king here last season, and says it was the best she ever made. All the Range county emigrants agree in opinioncid127, (and many of them n are farmers ofanuch experience and close observation in their business) that, in 390 X. favorable situations they can produce as much butter and of asgoodqua city as in Range county. Of. J. Of .can Nghamton, Room e To, July 24, 1848."With these facts, and others of a similar character which could be produced were it necessary, we trust it is not too much to say, that "the district of country from which butter is made that will stand the test of climate and preserve its qualities for years" is not that limited one which has been supposed, confined to a single county, but embraces a very large portion of the State of Newyork. In the language of one of the gentlemen from whose letters extracts are given, ~there is hardly a county where there is not some strictly choice fairies made." Of the skill of the Range county dairy women is applied in other counties of the State, an equally prime article will be the result. Mr. John Robert, of Chemung county, whose butter had been purchased by the New York gentleman at 33 cents per pound, and used with so much gusto as Range county butter, has often received the highest premium at our State and county shows. The present year it received the first premium at Buffalo, and also at the! American I institute, New Work. I annex a statement of his dairy; and also his method of manufacturing his butter, which will, I presume, be found of interest as well as of value to the dairy interests of our country. Statement of the farm and dairy of John Robert, of Chemungtown and county. This farm is elevated about 800 feet above tide water, in 42 north latitude. Contains 209 acres. The past year 40 cows have been kept, and the land managed as fallow s 24 acres of wheat 8 " buckwheat 10 " oats 20 " corn and <a name="potatoes55"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 2 " summer fallow 40 " meadow 74 " pastures 22 " wood and waste land 200, acres. Soil, a gravely loath, with a slight mixture of black sand; sub soil the same. To plants or slops for cows. All that is fed is hay, grass, and corn s talks. Pastures are c lover and timothy; hay the same. Meadows produce from one to two and a half tons per acre. Plaster is used on the pastures and meadows every year. Several experiments in making butter have been tried the present season. Commenced making butter about the first of April, and, up to the 4th of May, made 512 pounds. May 5th, commenced packing for fall market, and closed 15th December. June 15th, drew the milk from 37 cows. Mornings mess 525 pounds; even x. 
391ings, 632 pounds; in all, 1,157 pounds, taking 3 pounds 11 ounces of butter to 100 pounds of milk. June 20th, had three more cows come in, which made dairy full. Rows commence dropping their calves in March, and do not all come in until the middle of June. To not rear all the calves, but usually keep the finest. Wine are kept to consume the buttermilk. Rows are generally the common breed; have a few that have a slight mixture of the Durham blood. Their ages range from three to twelve. Prefer a cow not less than five years old for the dairy, and as much older as she winters will. Change pastures often, and think it advisable to change twice a week. Too much care cannot be taken to haveCowvs well watered and salted. Deep a large watering trough ipcoaw yard, where the cows are observed frequently drinking large quantities of water immediately after coming from the brook. Salt is kept lying in the yard the year round. The cellar is thoroughly cleaned every spring. Silk is kept in one cellar; the butter in another. Too much care cannot be taken as to the time of churning. Usually c turn from one hour to one and a half. But from one to two pails of cold water in each c turn before commencing to c turn, and one pail more in each when nearly done, to thin the milk and make it produce all the butter it contains. When done, take the butter out, wash it through one water; then set it in the cellar and salt it; then work it from three to five times before packing; do not finish' salting until the last working; then add a little salt, which makes bring that keeps the butter sweet. One ounce of salt to one pound of butter, is about the quantity that suits most people, or, at least the butter buyers in the city of Newyork. The butter is then packed, if the weather is cool, the first day; if warm, the second day. Of the milk is too warm when churned, the quantity of butter will be less, and the quality and flavor not as good as when it is cool at a proper temperature. Utter is worked by hand used a butter worker last fall, but recommend the hand lad le as decidedly preferablePdckingFill the fir king to within two inches of the top; then lay a clean cloth on the top of the butter, and put salt on the cloth and keep it covered with salt and bring all the season. Great care should be taken not to let the milk stand too long before churning, as, in that case, in hot weather, it becomes too sour, and the butter will be sour also; and in cool weather it will become bitter, all of which can be prevented in cool weather by putting' about one quart of buttermilk in each pan or tub before straining the milk, and in hot weather by churning as soon as the milk becomes thick and moist in the top of the cream. Use salt of the Ash ton brand. From 5 cows in 30 successive days commenced 28th of May made 248 pounds of butter. In ll th of June, drew from five cows 181 pounds of milk, which, made 8 pounds of butter. Turn all the milk by, horse power, and usually c turn 4 1 l barrel c burns at once. In 8th of August, drew the milk from 40 cows in the morning 508 pounds; in the evening, 519 pounds- in all, 1,027 pounds, which made 39 pounds of butter 392 X. Dqc. No. 59.

 393 The above table shows the difference between cows and milk. In churning the milk separately, on h of the best cows makes as much butter as three of, the poorest giving the same quantity of bill. June isa better month for making butter than July or August. Made 107 pounds more butter from 37 cows in June than from 40 cows in July. One hundred pounds of milk drawn from best cows, giving richest milk, will make or re pound more butter thin 100 pounds of milk from the whole herd. There is still more difference in quality than quantity; one cow well kept is worth two poorly kept, for dairying. S. Wounds.

Last year, same dairy sold in New Work for 24 cents; went south and stood climate well: John Holbert. December 25, 1848. , Stockevery year gives additional evidence of the gradual improvement which is making in this State, in our cattle, 'help, horses, and swine. The exhibition at our last show was unusually large, and the splendid display of cattle, horses, and sheep, was the admiration of all. The short horns and He vous are the most numerous of the improved breeds. In travelling through several portions of the State the past season, I was surprised to find such an extensive variety of improved cattle already introduce I in: the different coin ties. The Hereford and Ayreshires are introduced to some extent, and their numbers are increasing. The southern tier of counties, and the central and northern parts of this State, are well adapted to grazing, and large numbers of cattle are raised for market. It is believed, for those portions of the State, the Galloway and Westhighland cattle of Scotland, which stand at the head of the great Smith field market for beef, are peculiarly well adapted. f t is hoped that some of our spirited bleeders will turn their attention to them, and introduce them into our State. I have no doubt myself, having seen them in their purity in England, and made myself familiar with their hardy and early fattening qualities, as well as the peculiar fine ness of their beef, that they would for mt for those sections of our State the most valuable cattle that could be raised, and that it would not be long after their introduction before their beef would have the same pre eminence here that it so justly obtains abroad394Ex. Dec. No. 59. Fattening cattle Some of our large farmers 'are beginning to make a business of stall feeding cattle for the winter and, spring markets. Short horn grade steers, from 3 to 4 years led, generally are purchased from Ohio or the western counties of our State in the fall in good condition, and feed well until February or March, and then sent by railroad to the New York or Boston markets. It is believed that, with our I indian corn and root crop, this business will be made profitable. A very superior article of beef will be the result; and where this is fully understood, I think the price will yield a remuineration. As far as I learn of the experiments already made, the returns have been satisfactory; so much so that more extensive preparations have been made for continuing and increasing the business. This will prove eventually a very important business in our State. Of the fee der can sell his cattle so as to return to him his capital invested in the purchase with interest, and obtain the market prices for his fodder and grain, the manure which he will obtain, will, on right application to his land, secure to him such increased crops as will make the business a profitable and desirable one. The change of things consequent upon the opening of the fertile and cheap land of the far west to our markets, in competition with our farmers, will compel them to adopt new methods of farming to obtain satisfactory returns, and among others I think the fattening of cattle will probably prove one of the most important. Sheepwe have some of the best flocks of fine wool sheep in the country; and more care is being paid to the preservation of these f locks in purity. The low prices of wool have damp end the flock growers some; but those who hold on steadily will doubtless in the end succeed as well as in most branches of farming operations, The South down and long wooled sheep are receiving more at tent ention. The demand for South down sheep has been remarkably large the past fall, and I think this valuable breed for mutton will ere long be as popular in this country as it has long been in England. Fool depot she utility of these establishments has been proved think, and they will, I should hope, be sustained, and- prove beneficial to the wool grower, as well as the manufacturer. The grower will be enabled to receive the full value of his wool, a part of which has heretofore gone to the agent who buys up the wool; and the manufacturer will be benefit ted, as he can buy the quality he needs already prepared at the depot, and can afford to pay its full value. Horsesthe attention which has been given for the last few years to the selection of thoroughbred stallions for service, is bringing forward a fine stock of young horses. In many of our counties the show of colts and young stock has ex celled any exhibitions heretofore made. The market for first rate horses in this State, is always a ready and profitable one, and the raising of first rate horses will continue to be a very profitable business. It was supposed by many, that on the completion of our railroads the demand for horses would be much lessened. To far as my informal x. 
395tion extends, the demand for first rate horses has never been better than for the past two years. The premium matched horses for the last three years have sold, I believe, at from                         $600 to                                                                                                                                                             $1,000. Drainingthe importance of draining, in all good farming, cannot be questioned. Although without manure a farm may raise scanty crops, yet, where draining is needed, no crops will succeed unless it is performed. The instances where draining would prove beneficial, are far more numerous than is generally supposed. I n this State much more attention is being given to it than formerly and the results in the increase of crops most abundantly reward the farmers. Some spirited gentleman in Seneca county in this State, has ordered an improved drain tile machine from England, and they anticipate from its use the cheap manufacture of tiles, so as to bring them into very general use. I have no doubt our country men, on witnessing one of these machines, will be enabled to improve it, (if it should prove too expensive) so as to bring the manufacture of times to such cheapness as to meet the wants of our farmers. I submit brief extracts from reports from county societies, which will afford some indications of the feeling that is abroad in this State on the subject of agricultural improvemientCayuga county The president of this society writes, that the show of 1848 exceeded all others ever held in the county. From six to seven hundred head of neat cattle, and three hundred horses, were exhibited; the horses of superior excellence. From eight to ten thousand people in attendance. The president of the society came on to the grounds selected for the show with his wagon drawn by sixty-eight yoke of oxen from his own town; and thirty-six additional yoke from the same town were exhibited making one hundred and four yoke of cattle from a single town. The improvements in this county are most cheering, and afford undoubted evidence that the right spirit is abroad.

The attendance of the farmers large the society no longer an experiment, and few can be found who would be willing to give up the annual meeting. Jeffersonof the agriculture of this county it is said the crop of spring wheat was remarkably good. The Black Tea wheat usually cultivated. This variety is less liable to rust and to the wheat worm than any other variety, and has a very good merry, and makes very fine flour. Winter wheat is less cultivated than formerly, owing to the ravages of the fly, (wheat midges indian corner op much larger than usual, and yield very good. Oatssome very fine crops grown in this county. One crop reported of 110 bushels per acre, by measure, weighing 41 pounds to the bushel a very extraordinary yield. Fruitmuch attention is being given to the culture of fruit; a very large number of orchards planted the past fall and spring. Any of the fall planting failed, while those set in the spring are healthy and flourishing. The committee on farms examined twenty-four different dairy farms; on which were kept seven hundred and thirty-one cows, and which exhibited much care and attention. Female influence and efortThe president of the society in his annual address says: "I n the successful prosecution of this highly honorable and peaceful pursuit, female influence and effort are indispensable to success. We may then appropriately appeal to mothers to teach their daughters to assist in early life in all the important and appropriate duties of the kitchen, so that they may thoroughly understand the practice thereof, as well as the parlor or drawing room. Strive to give them an education, solid, useful and practical, that shall fully prepare them to fill any appropriate and honored station to which they may be called. I am aware that some persons of near sighted and contracted views have expressed the opinion that the female mind ought to be occupied altogether in the contemplation of unreal things, of ideas that float in a feverish or excited imagination, and of outward accomplishments, and be content to dwell upon the surface of subjects, without an attempt to dig deep in the mine of knowledge. To one honored with the title of mother can, for a moment, listen to any such suggestion; but will, I am sure, put forth their utmost exertion for the fullest expansion and enlargement of the intellectual and moral capabilities of their daughters as well as their sons.

In He Hunter, in this county, an agricultural department has been connected with one of their academies. From a letter from Professor Evans, who has charge of this department, I am informed that the most flattering expectations as to its usefulness is being realized. I to primary object is to give thorough instruction to' young men who desire to become truly scientific, as well as practical. The farmers) course will continue fourteen weeks, during which a regular course of study will be pursued, accompanied with daily recitations in "Johnsons Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry andGeologybTwo hours will be spent each day in the chemical laboratory, where students will be instructed in the constitution of soils and ashes of plants, with a minute examination of the properties of their ingredients, and the mode of testing for the presence of all the components of soils, ashes &c. A course of about thirty lectures will be given, during the term, upon the relation of geology to agriculture the soil the plant the animal, and their various relations rotation of cropsfeedinganimalsmanures, draining wet lands, &c, &e. Ontariothe returns from this county show, some excellent crops, as well as increasing attention to the farming interest generally. Jmilch cows George Bier, of Last Gloom field, received the first premium on a cow, which produced nineteen pounds of butter in one week; and sixteen pounds per week for two weeks. In the first case, she was fed on corn s talks and middling , with sour milk the last two weeks, the same feed, with the exception of the sour milk. Field crops worn, 88 bushels per acreeightrowed variety Winter wheat, 48 bushels 19 pounds per acre, of You les wheat barley, 55 bushels per acre; oats, 70 bushels. Oswegothe leading crops of the county are hay, oats, barley corn, <a name="potatoes59"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and the dairy business is becoming an important interest.

This county, from its location, (having Take Ontario on one side, from whose waters a very salutary influence is given to the climate) is admirably adapted to the growth of fruit.

This, he thinks, refutes some of the theories about the disease. The house was kept at as even temperature as practicable without the use of artificial heat, and the ground continually moist neither sudden alternation of heat, nor sudden changes from dry to wet, can be the cause of the disease. The soil is made three and a half feet deep, very rich, from an admixture of well rotted manure much and shell mary, and limed very heavily. Such are the facts, and they may aid in arriving at some just conclusion as to the disease. At the annual show in this county, the fruit displayed exceeds any former year.

Seneca t is gratifying to notice the increasing attention to farming in this county. Even farms were entered for competition at the county show. (having attended the show of the society of this county, and having viewed the farm that received the first premium, as well as several others, I can say that it will be difficult to find farms superior to many in this county. And they are far med profit ably, yielding, I think, from 7 to 10 per cent. on all the investments) Lectures have been delivered to the farmers of the different towns by the president of the society, John Cela field, esq, accompanied -with illustrations and experiments, which havelieea productive of the most happy results. Mr. Cela field was formerly a distinguished merchant and banker in New Work, and for years exercised an influence as extensive, both at home and abroad, as that of any man in this country; but I venture the assertion the tim the field he is now occupying, and which he has been in fo rome six or eight years, that of a practical farmer, he is exerting, and is destined, (if his life is spared, which I pray it long may be to exert a wider influence, and upon a more important class, (the agricultural) than even he ever exerted in the times when his open nations were \most extensive, and reached to every commercial mary on the globe. His intelligence, his familiarity with science in its bearing upon agriculture, combined with his practical know edge, will enable him to exert a most salutary influence upon the cause, not only in his own county and State, but throughout the ni on. Mr. Cela fields farm received the first State premium last year, 1847, and an account of his operations will be found in our Transactions for 1847,As a detailed statement will be furnished you from this county, Xoniit any further notice of its products.

Dear In: I send yyoldi ni answer to your circular, th foblwihgstatecid127entiof the' products of the county of Madison, New Work 1. For some years past we have ben troubled with ar 'insect, called the weevil, which has n such injured o du wheat crop; and the consequence has been i that our farmers have hot so don as much as usual; the probability is that' the amount raised this year will fall short of that raised in 1845, when the crop was 1903 64 bushels. The northern and central parts of the county have. 'suffered th:emost; in the west and southwest the usual l quantity has been sown, And the yield has been (cid127erfy good. 'were has been more spring wheat sown that winter. The time of sowing winter wheat, from the 1st to the 20 th of September; and, of spring wheat this depends on the season; a tall events it should be sown as soon as the, ground can be i properly prepared in the spring. The amount of seed, per acre, is from 1 to 2 bushel; time of harvesting? the last of Julyiand the first of Augustcid127) this that t 18 bushels would be a fair average, per acre, of tie winter wheat. The white flint i 'considered to stand the winter the best, t though 'marcid127y other kinds are sewn. Of spring wheat, the Black Tea is generally preferred. Our day soils are considered rather preferable. Most of the wheat ra is f land of e in this county is consumed by the inhabitants 2. 'barley has been a good crop the, s seasonisya230000 bushels though, not so much sown as last, but the yield has been much better. Time of sowing, from the 20th of April to the I th ,of May; quantity of seed, per acre, from 2 to 3 bushels; ti nee of harvesting, about 90 days from the time of sowing. About 25 bushels per acre would be a fair average. Two and four rowe dare the principal varieties sown; the two id wed is considered the surest crop. -a." Almost any soil that is not wet will raise barley. :even i eigths13402 X. of the crop raised in this county is sent east; price from 50 to 75 cents per bushel at the canal, which passes through this county 3. The o at crop in this county, the present season, has been unusually large say 750,000 bushels. Oats may be sown any time from the 1st of April to the 1st of June. Early sown oats a reconsidered the best; quantity of seed per acre, from 2 to 3 bushels. Various kinds are sown, but the white o at is the most common. Any soil, if properly tilled, will raise good oats. Most of the crop raised is consumed in this section, as our canal and stage horses require a large amount. Price generally 25 cents per bushel. Average yield, per acre, 40 bushels 4. Previous to the coming of the weevil among us, rye was not much sown; but, since that time, the cultivation of this kind of grain has largely increased. The crop this year, I should think, would reach 12,000 bushels. Time of sowing, from the 5th to the 25th of September; quantity of seed per acre, from 1 to 2 bushels time of harvesting, the last of July. About 15 bushels per acre would be a fair average. Bandy and slate, and almost any soils among us will bear rye. This crop is usually consumed at home. Price :about 75 cents per bushel 5. Buckwheatthe crop of buckwheat this year has been larger than usual; the quantity- raised has, no doubt, exceeded 10,000:bushels; time of sowing about the 20th of June; quantity of Need per acre from n one half to three-fourths of a bushel; time of harvesting in September; twenty-five bushels would be a fair average per acre. Right sandy soils are considered the best, though it will grow almost anywhere; usually consumed at home; price per, bushel 50 cents 6. Cornthe most important crop raised among us is that of indian corn; from 300,000 to 400,000 bushels, I presume, has been raised in this county the present season; time of planting from the 5th to the 25th of May; from six to twelve quarts or seed per acre, according to the fancy of the farmer. We generally commence harvesting the latter part of September, and continue as circumstances shall allow till finished. About 30 bushels would be a fair average per acre. We have many varieties of corn and the farmers are somewhat partial to their own kinds. The small eight rowed yellow is thought by many to be the earliest, but I do not think that it will produce as well as the twelve rowe d yellow. Some prefer the eight rowed white flint, which is a very good kind of corn. It is very difficult to determine which is the most profitable kind to raise. A gravely loam, with a portion of sand, is considered the best soil for corn. It is very difficult to say what part is consumed at home. Price from 50 to 75 cents per bushel 7. ~PotatoesWe have been troubled for the last five years with what has been called the rot among our <a name="potatoes70"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and this year I think the worst of any. My opinion is that the crop in the county this year will fall short of 130,000 bushels. The cause of, the disease among the <a name="potatoes71"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, no satisfactory reason l has as yet been given. Time of planting from the last of April to the 1st of June, I know of no fixed quantity of seed to put on an acres x. a. 403 every farmer <a name="seeds21"><mark>seeds</mark></a> according to his own judgment. It ne of harvesting, the last of August and the first of September. I doubt whether the average in this county this year will exceed 50 bushels per acre, although it may. Opinions differ as to what kind of <a name="potato41"><mark>potato</mark></a> is the most successful; yet some kinds rot, worse than others. I think that a dry sandy soil, not very rich, at. this time aid in this section, produces the best <a name="potatoes72"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, Price, this fall from 30 to 50 cents per bushel 8. May. Our hay has been rather a short crop for the last two years, owing to some cause not exactly understood. The grass will start early and look fine and promising for a ,short, time, but when it shoucid127ld head out, not one in tea i make their, appearance. This last season has not been so bad as that of 1847. The crop has been all of 25 per cent. better. I think the crop of 1848 may beset down at 1 l ton per acre, on an average. We generally commence our having about the 1st of July. Price from five to ten dollars per tone. lax Since cotton cloths have become so cheap, the raising of flank has not been much attended 'to. I am not able to say what quantity is being raised at this time 10. Silkat our county fair on the 13th and 14th days of September last, we had several samples of silk and cochons exhibited of a very fine quality; but the amount raised in the county is n6tlarge11. Sugar large amount of map le ,sugar is annually made in this county, of a very excellent quality; but I am unable to estimate the number of pounds annually i manufactured; price, generally, from 6 to 8 cents per pound 12. Foddersince the failure of our crops of hay farmers have made more use of their straw and corn fodder, and have become satisfied that this kind of fodder is a most valuable substitute for hay, and the quantity now used is immense; it is considered equal in vale for stock to one half of the quantity of hay, :13, Rotation ii crops he usually plant corn on s ward ground il next year barley or oats; and before the weevil; we moved wheat in the fall, and in the spring sowed c lover with herds grass 14. Peasthere may be 30,000 bushels of peas raised in the county this year but the raising of peas is diminishing rather than increasing; time of sowing, as soon as the ground will admit; about 4 bushels per acre is the usual quantity sown; harvest, the last of July; 20 bushels would be a fair average per acre; price about a scorn 15. Fruitof fruit we have a large amount, particularly apples, and some very choice varieties. The interest of late is very much increasing; from . 200 to 3,00 barrels were probably set to the eastern cities in 1847. In small fruits there is considerable attention paid to the culture of, in many parts of the county, and to very good success 16. Dairybutter and cheese are both largely on the increase, and the quality of the articles; much improved; many of our farmers who have heretofore been much in the wool business havi404Ex. disposed of their flocks, and gone into the dairy. Probable average per cow of cheese is 350 pounds, and of butter 125 pounds 17. Raising of stock n that section of our county where they have gone the most heavily into the dairy business, they generally kill their calves at from n 4,to 6 days old; consequently not much stock is raised, though in some sections considerable attention is paid to the raising of cattle; in 1846, the number in the county was 45,216, which is probably more than at the present time; yet in some sections of the county they raise as fine cattle as in any part of the State. I should think that of horses there are a g many now raised as in 1845, when the number was 11,774.'18. Sheepthere are some excellent flocks of sheep in thiscoitnty, but since the growing of wool in the far west has been so extensively gone into, many of our wool growers have quit that business, and turned their attention to the dairy. I should think that the number would fall short of that of 1845, when it was 263 132; but an improvement has no doubt been made in the weight of the flee ce; the probable average per sheep would be about 3 pounds; price from 24 to 35 cents per pound, according to quality and condition 19. Hogsof hogs we have many and of excellent breeds; there may be 30,000; average weight, when fattened, probably 275 pounds for hogs that weigh 300 and over,                         $4.50 per hundred; under 300,less price 20. Beesthe interest taken for the last few years in the raising of bees is very considerable; but it is impossible for me at present to say to what extent it has gone. I know that some of my neighbors raise the most beautiful honey that I ever saw; it is done by anew process lately gone into, viz, by putting small caps or boxes on the tops of their hives, so that when the bees have filled them with honey, they can be removed without destroying the bees; price of honey per pound, usually 124 cents 21. 1.lanure.-Manure from our barn yards, stables, and how pens, is the principal, though much gypsy m is used, and to good advantage; i and many of our farmers are making use of lime, ashes, and salt, to some extent 22. Laborthe prices of labor on our farms per month, for the season, is from ten to fifteen dollars; day labor from fifty cents to, one dollar per day. Men at these prices are boarded. Mechanilabor, from one dollar to one dollar and fifty cents per day; female labor 'from one dollar to one dollar and fifty cents per week 23. Marketour market is on the canal, and as both the Erie and the Chenrja go canals pass through this county, no definite price could be fixed for transportation to market. 24. Agricultural societies- Madison Coninty Agricultural Society was formed September 21, 1841. Present officers are, President, Benjamin Nos, He Hunter post office; Corresponding Secretary~ Element Least, Eaten post office; Recording Secretary, Jamessims, Cazenovia post office 25. Nuinber of members probably one hundred and fifty, Akmoumapaid for premiums, say two hundred and city dollars x. 405 26. There was formed in the town of He Hunter, in December, 1847, a society called the Farmer as and Mechanics' Association of he Hunter; this association is divided into three departments, agriculture, manufacture, and the arts and sciences. We number between forty and fifty members, and the probability is, that before another year expires we shall exceed one hundred. We have a constitution and by laws; fees for membership fifty cents, nAfquarterly dues twenty five cents per member. We have a very excellent library, made up of the best books we could procure in the city of Albany, on the subjects of agriculture, manufactures, and the arts and sciences. We have a very good room fitted up in the building of the Deruyter I institute, in which we hold our regular meetings on the first Thursday in each and every month, and during the winter season we meet every week, and discuss such subjects as shall have been proposed at a previous meeting. Prince the formation of our society, we, with the faculty of the institute, have succeeded in fitting up in the institution a departilenitof agricultural chemistry, and a class is now being formed to pursue that study the coming winter. Officers of the association President, Benjamin Nos, He Hunter post office; Corresponding Secretary, David Paine, He Ruyteirpost office; Recording Secretary, In. J. Yer, He Hunter post office. :27. Feathers to the weather, I can furnish only from my own book kept to enter the daily occurrences of my farm, kept in rather an imperfect manner, to give to you separate from the other portion of my entries; but I shall give it as concise as possible, and as it occurs in my day farm book, omitting as much as possible all that does not allude to the weather 10th May. Commenced planting; half past 3, p. m. was stopped by the rain. 12th. Half past 2, commenced planting again, and the 13th, at half past 2, p. m, stopped again by the rain; it raised all the time till the morning of the 14th, when the hills were white with snow; .finished planting on the 15th.18th. Commenced planting another field; and, on the 19th, e it commenced raining about 4 o clock, p. m, and raised moderately through the night. In the 20th, finished, although about 1 o clock, p. m, we had quite a shower, and from that time till half past 10,a. m. In the 2 3d, it raised a great part of the time. I think that the large amount of rain that fell from the 19th to the 2 3d, prevented much of my corn from sprouting. I have no means of knowing the quantity of rain that fell. June 6. Prevented from hoping about 11 .o clock, a. m, by rain, which continued most of the afternoon. June 7. Old rain stopped us again from hoping, and continued. June 8. Old and wet. June 27. Stopped about 1 o clock, p. m, from hoping beans by rain, and it continued till 8 o clock, a. m, of the 28th-onecontinued shower, flooding our cornfields and meadows in many places, and doing much damage. July 21. Stopped from carting hay by a show r, . I find again 406 X. that, on the 22d, mention is made of the rain s 6 lodging my oats, that fears are entertained that they will not fill well. July 24. Finished mowing a certain meadow; but, on account of the rain, did not finish carting it in till the 29th. September 5, Finished cutting a large field of oats, but, in consequence of the continued rains, did not finish carting them in till the 28th; in fact, through the month of October, there was seldom a day without rain. November 4. It commenced raining; and, on the next day, i trained and snowed all day, and continued storming, with snow on the ground, till Thursday, the 16th, when we could resume our outdoor labor. Thus I have endeavored to give you the short and imperfect account of the weather as noted down in my day book. It makes rather an odd appearance, disconnected from the whole entries as made at the time. I have made to entry of rain, unless it affected some particular business in which I was engaged 28: I have mentioned in the account of <a name="potato42"><mark>potato</mark></a> e and wheat crops, and also in that of grass, the effects of blight and insects. The probable per cent. of loss, I am unable to say with any degree of c certainty .29.

407PORTLAND, December 20, 1848. Air: Enclosed I send you a part of the information you; desired me to furnish you with. I should have sent sooner, but it has been almost impossible to collect such information as I wished, from the fact that there has, for a long time, been a conflict of opinion as to the true manner ofgraduating the price of land in the northern and southern portions, of the county to a more perfect equality, in raising our county and. State tax. I had this influence to meet; many supposing it to collect statistics for that purpose. I shall soon send the statistics of the exports and imports of this county. Hours, respectfully, E. S. Bartholomew. On. E. Burke. No. 1.*SI R: Your circular requesting agricultural information was duly received. The difficulty of obtaining the desired information is such that I cannot give you as full detailed statistics as I could wish, or as the county of Chautauque might merit. But I hope, that enough may be presented to give you a birds eye glance at the elements of wealth within this county. Comprised within its limits are two geological formations; those known in the survey of the State of New York as the Sort age, group of rocks, which have their out cross bordering on Take. Lie, giving their dip southerly, the abrasion of which composes the soil of that part known as the lake level. This group is comprise within the limits of the tertiary formation, in which there are very few fossil remains, and an imperceivable quantity of lime in any of its combinations. Hence you see why our wheat crops do not compare with some other districts in this State, without the application of highly stimulating manures, and lime, in some of its combinations, artificially. The hilly, or southern portion, is mostly upon the Chemung group, in which there is more lime found, consequent upon the greater quantity of organic remains, &c. Annexed is a meteorological table, as kept by David Baton, esq, of this town, in which will be given the monthly mean 'temperature also the state of the weather, and the amount of rain and snow. The snow was taken from snow gauge, and melted and turned into rain gage, and counted as rain. You will see by that what the general range of the year, ending on the 1st day of November, 1848, is. Wheaton the level the wheat crop, as a whole, is better than for several previous years; there being but very little complaint from the effects of the fly or rust. The crop for this year is 10 per cent better than in 1847, on the408EM lake level, the re winter .wheat is almost wholly sown. In the south part no winter wheat is sown, as the soil is somewhat moist the frost destroying it; consequently, spring grain is sown. His season has been bad for that section, the rust destroying the most of the crop; so that this county may be said not to raise enough for home consumption this year. The time for sowing the winter varieties is from the 10th of Kept $ member to t the middle of October. Spring, as -early as the sea so will admit of; generally as early as the 1st or middle of April. The kind universally used for winter is the white flint, producing the best and most beautiful flour. The I italian, for spring sowing, seems best adapted, as it with stands our drought y seasons best. Our season for harvest is from the middle of July to the last of August. For- average yield and price, you will refer to table of cost and profit per cent. Barleythe crop is less, as there is not so great a demand for it now as there has heretofore been, from the fact that a number of distilleries have closed, making the market dull. Heretofore, barley has been fed to hogs for fattening; but most of farmers have found that corn is much better and cheaper. Oatsnot far from 10 per cent. plus. They have demanded a good price; consequently the crop ,has been increased. Riethe crop will average ten per cent. plus from last season, from theft that te heat crop has been much injured for two, or three years past. 'BuckwheatVery little raised. The crop is probably 25 percent. less than last. year. Siitdian corn The crop this season has been a good one full 1006ercid127) en t. over last years crop. The foreign market, which has bien, opened by loss of the <a name="potato43"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, and an anticipation of continuance of that demand, in connexion with the high price of beef, has been a mighty impetus to the raising of this excellent, grain. Potatoesthere are a few persons who have succeeded in raising sweet potatoes. They have to start them in a hot bed, where they remain until the season has advanced to an even, warm temperature, when the sets are transferred to the plat prepared for Common <a name="potatoes73"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are again diseased to a great extent. The cause, to a great extent, seems to settle down on the single principle that I described to you last season; to wit, the worm. I n my ex ami nations the past season, I 'ave found that the egg from which the 'worm patches, is deposited at the root of the leaf stalk, and enters and eats downward. Of the worm commences early enough to eat down into the root before the <a name="potato44"><mark>potato</mark></a> ri pens, disease is sure; but the contrary, if the <a name="potato45"><mark>potato</mark></a> ri pens before his arrival there. I am also satisfied, from further observation, that on very rich soil, and a luxuriant growth of stalk, the insect will invariably deposit e a greater amount of eggs than here the grothamore spirited. X. a. 409HayThere is, probably, thirty-five per cent. more than last season: The season has been r 'well adapted to the growth of grass. It will probably yield, on an average the and a half torn per acre. The amount of cultivated land in this county is two hundred and seventy thousand seven hundred and eighty-four acres. The ribs approved rotation of crops is quadrennial, commencing With (cid127lcterfollowing with corn, oats, wheat, and seed with c lover. Manuringon the c lover, lay for cord and turning it under. Foot crops Such as carrots, bet, turn is, &c, are only raised in small quantities' by some farmers. Messrs. Isle y are extensively engaged in the seed business, and by them the greater part in the county are raised. The average number of bushels per acre of bees is 600, worth 121 cents per bushel; carrots, 900 bushels per acre 12' cents per bushelturnips are an increase over last year 83 per cent. Nothing definite as to average number of bushels per acre; value, 25 cents per bushel. In orcharding, there is an increased attention in all the various kinds grown in this climate, to wit: apples, pears, peaches, plums, quincey, 'cher rise, nectarines, apricots, &c. All the kids: above named are grown here in perfection. Small fruit is now takitngthieattention of amateurs and others who have leisure to give them proper attention. Long the shore of Take Erie, the I s abel la and Catawba grapes can be found in almost every persons garden. There is one gentleman who is now growing the I s abel la for wine, from which he makes a very good article, selling from n 1 5 to                                               $2 per gallon. Dairyingthere is an advance of 25 per cent. Perhaps there is no county in the State possessing greater natural advantages than this for dairying purposes a salnbrious climate, pure water, and a fertile soil, producing rich pasturage. In the cheese manufacture the most approved methods are used. Probably in the making of butter more radical improvements have been made within the year past; a better adaptation to withstand the salt or ocean air has been the great desideratum to be attained. Hence, every investigation which science could aid has been used to effect that object: as the manufacturing of butter from the milk as soon as drawn from the cows, thorough working, to clear it of milk when churned, without the aid of water, and the future keeping in an even, cool temperature, after so made, until it becomes solid form packing. Horsesthe number, from the best information, is about 21,012,and value ranging from                         $60 to                                                                                                                                                                                   $150.

Earner; post office address, Sinclearville, Chautauque county, N. Y.

I will obtain them as soon as done, and forward you. Time of corn planting is, with us, in the month of May; and by the annexed table you will see that a good d cal of water fell, and the range was a low temperature. Being very cool and wet, the i planting was much delayed. Prevalence of blight or insects The blight is destroying the pear very rapidly; so much so that we shall soon be without that delicious fruit. The family of a his is the only kind doing us much injury. Their depredations are alike in the orchards and gardens. Our losses from both causes are full 25 per cent. annually. In the following table of the cost of raising wheat and corn, I make no account for the drawing from the field, off setting that for the manure made from the same. We value our wheat lands worth                                   $30 per acre. Mean quantity of rain in 4 years, 48, 39518431844184518461847BI Nghamton, New York, December 20, 1848. Of R: I received your circular in due time. It is not practicable, with a reasonable amount of time and labor, to make the tabular statements which you desire. I think it could be done at a very small cost by the officers who will take the next census. I will attend to some particulars. There is an agricultural society @f this county, which distribute s about two hundred dollars in premiums, besides forty volumes of our State Society S Transactions, and those of the American I institute: Jacob Morris, secretary, Binghamton post office. The weather at early and proper planting time in this region was warm and dry, and diligent farmers got in their seed and had good crops. But a considerable portion did not plant until the latter part of' May, of accbou icid127bf the intervening rain or because their land would not admit of seasonable sloughing, and their crop was considerably diminished. There is no crop, which seems to require seasonable dr -early planting as much as I indian :corn, Though the season be sufficiently long between the spring and autumn frosts for its growth and ripe king, they are more less sickly and imperfect, except in extraordinary fine seasons, unless the crop is ready for a fair start with the first summer weather. The season was warm, with abundant showers, until the first part of August; after which, this whole State, except the western part of it, suffered from drought. The crops of hay j wheat, and corn, were gathered in good condition. There 'was no unusual loss of crops by blight or insects. The cost of raising corn and wheat, I gave you last year. In regard to corn fodder, I would remark that its value is greatly in der estimated, and, as a consequence, very carelessly gathered 47. inches. X. and saved. The corn should be cut up by the roots when thekernel is pretty well glazed, and set carefully up around an uncut hill of corn for its support; then bound near the top with wheat or rye straw. It should remain thus until the grain is fully ripened and the s talks and leaves thoroughly cured, and when the corn ishiusked, leaving as many of the husks on the s talks as is pray, tic able. The s talks should be st owed away on the scaffolding, or other dry and airy parts of the barn. It is eaten with aridity by cattle, horses, and sheep; and if cut fine, and sprinkled with a little br an or meal, nearly all the s talks will be consumed, and is then worth two thirds the price of hay. It is an entire mistake, the supposition that corn fodder will be less injured by being imperfectly secured from the weather than the various kinds of hay. The sac charing and other :nutrition portions are dissipated by rain and wind, and rendered both unpalatable and un wholesome by becoming sour and mould y -SPbtatoes are the chief root crop cultivated with us. The crop was not large, but more free from the rot than in any year sit nee 1842. Successful attention is much our ed to the raising of fruit. Apples, pears, plums, cher rise, grapes, &c. are raised to a good degree of abundance and perfection. n Reaches do not flourish on our main river valley the Suscquehannah. Utter fairies are beginning to furnish one of our staples for export, as well as a full supply for domestic .use. Our rich, :hilly pasturage, with good .ater, skilful and tidy dairy, women, a reproving the doctrine, that good butter making need not be confined to the stinted territory which was formerly assigned to it; The best mode is to c turn the ra milk without swimming it; but some let the milk stand until, it .becomes soucid127, and others prefer v to churnwhilst yet entirely sweet. Our farmers have not engaged largely in the making of cheese, In raising stock, sheep, and hogs, improvements, are being made. Manures are not generally used, except barn and how yard manures and plaster. Time is too scarce and dear to become of general use, though our lands very much need it. ,wages, during the eight farming months, are from 10 dollars to 15 dollars per month and board, for farmers. Transportation from 8 to 12 cents per bushel for grain, and about 40 cents per 100 pounds for barrels and gross freight t more or less depending on canal tolls. Our market is New' Work. I. have lately noticed sound <a name="potatoes74"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> growing on un manured lands, whilst those in adjoining manured fields, were ali not ruined by the rot. Farther experience has satisfied me that early planting is one of the best modes of preventing the min lady. The productive ness of the <a name="potato46"><mark>potato</mark></a> is greatly diminished, not being, much more than half as great as it was from 20 to 40 years since. I ascii be this fact to the habit of very many farmers of using the smallest <a name="potatoes75"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for seed, erroneously supposing that, because they germ innate well, and produce as many tubes as large ones, they are equally good for seed. The product of any seed 414 X. will be like itself; and I cannot well see why the <a name="potato47"><mark>potato</mark></a> should bean exception to the universal improve ability of the productions of nature. There has been to little attention to the quality and suitable ness of soil and the mode of culture, and perhaps the too oft repletion of the crop on the same ground has too much exhausted the food of the plant. With much respect, your obedient servant, A. Doubleday. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Canton, Of. Lawrence County N. Y.,. November 28, 1848. Dear Of R: In reply to your circular I forward the sub joined, respecting the county of It. Lawrence, in the State of New Work. The cultivated part of this county lies in the valley of the It. Lawrence river, on the forty-fourth degree of north latitude. Of course, you will expect here only such products as are common to high latitudes. In territory, this is the largest in the State, extending sixty miles on the It. Lawrence river, and running back from the river one hundred miles or more. About fifty miles in extent on the south end of the county, is an unbroken wilderness. Previous to the settlement of this county, the land was sold in large tracts to speculators. It has been re tailed to settlers with all the evils attendant on that pernicious policy. To this day, many farmers feel, with agonizing sensibility, the oppression thus visited upon them. Of course, there is here considerable negligent and shift less farming. Such farming is passed by in making the following estimate Estimated products for the year X. the foregoing statistics have been collected with care, and a rep resumed to be as near accurate as the nature of the case will ad it. The estimate, in every instance, is supposed to be rather below than -above the fact. At sowing and planting the season was warm and dry just rain enough to cause <a name="seeds22"><mark>seeds</mark></a> put into the ground to ve get ate; Thermometer ranging about sixty degrees. Cry weather continued till the last days of June; then very wet, and, most :of the time warm. Thermometer ranging from s even ty-five to eighty degrees :to the first days of September. Occasionally a few days of chilly weather, thermometer sinking to forty degrees. The wheat crop is estimated five percent. larger than that of, last year. The wheat sown is mostly spring wheat. It is of several kinds more of the Black Tea wheat than any other variety. The winter wheat was considerably injured by the wheat fly; but spring wheat escaped their ravages. This escape was probably occasioned by the cloudy and rainy wet her when the wheat was flowering. It is tolerably well ascertained that this insect does not work on the wheat in wet, cloudy days. The average price of wheat, during the last year, has been one dollar per bushel. The average yield of wheat, on well cultivated land, is fifteen bushels upon an acre. In some instances 40, and even 50 bushels per acre are raised. Barleythe average yield of this grain, is thirty bushels per acre, and the. average price is forty cents per bushel ye- The' average yield of this crop is twelve bushels per acre, and the average price is sixty cents perbushelOatsAccording to the best information I am able to collect, oats on an average yield forty bushels to the acre. The average price is thirty cents for a bushel. Frequently the produce, of this crop is much more. Large fields often yield eighty bushels to the acre, and some pieces i are known to produce one hundred bushels on the acre- , . Buckwheat, in this section is often called, necessity grain; that is, it is sown at a time when no other grain can be sown, and generally on land where nothing else can be raised. The average yield is twelve bushels to the acre, and the average price is forty cents per bushel. , . I indian corn The average yield of this grain on. well cultivated ground, is forty bushels to the acre. The average price is fifty cents for a bushel. The variety planted is the small eightrowedyellow corn. It is planted from the 15th of May to the 10th of June. It is estimated that the crop of corn this year is five per cent better than it was last year. The most approved method of those who succeed the best with this crop, is to plant it in ridges two feet apart each way, with from three to four kerseys in a hill. By extra. maturing and other labor, large yields are sometimes obtained. I have known from one hundred to a hundred and sixteen bushels of good sound corn raised on an acre. The crows were formerly a great pest to the cornfields. As soon as the planted corn thrust its rising germ out of the g found, these free looters would espy416Ex. the rising blade and pull it up; but within a few years, many farmers are in the habit of gazing their seed -corn with coal tar previous to planting it. The process is this: But five or six quartsofcorn into a half bushel measure; pour on to this corn a few spoonfuls of this coal tar; then stir it with a stick until all the corn is coated with the tar- then sprinkle on it a few handful of s lacked lime, and stir it till the lime covers the tar so that thekernels separate, and it is ready for planting. This is an effectual scare crow. Brows never pull corn thus prepared, and will seldom light on a field planted with it until the corn is so large that they will not pull it. Potatoesthere is more complaint of injury and loss of <a name="potatoes76"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by the prevailing disease this year than ever before in this county. Formerly, this was counted one of the best sections in the world for raising the common <a name="potato48"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Your or five years since, the <a name="potato49"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was considered the most certain of any that farmers could raise. <a name="potatoes77"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> were so easily raised and yielded so, abundantly, that our Farmers have not to any extent cultivated any other root crops. From three to five hundred bushels were a common yield, and a much larger amount was often obtained sometimes as high as eight hundred bushels on an acre. In quality, our <a name="potatoes78"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> .were said to be among the best; but during several years past they have very much diminished, both in quantity and quality. It is estimated that the crop is fifty percent. less this year than it was last. Any whole fields are given up as not worth harvesting. Other fields produce <a name="potatoes79"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of a fair quality, but a smaller crop. The crop this year is estimated atone hundred bushels to the acre. <a name="potatoes80"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> planted as early as the middle of April on dry ground are nearly free from the rot. I selected three acres of side hill broke it up in September. manured it with well rotted barn yard manure, at the rate of twenty loads to the acre, last fall; ploughed, harrowed, and fitted it for planting in the spring; nd planted it from the eighth to the tenth of April. While planting, the weather became so cold that I had one man cover as fast as the other dropped the <a name="potatoes81"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, lest they should freeze. The ground froze more than an inch deep; but the <a name="potatoes82"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> came up, and grew well. We finished hoping them the last 'day of May. They then looked fine. That very night the frost killed them down to the ground. Again they grew to about the same height as before, and again the frost killed them down. They were hold the second and last time the twentieth of June. They appeared tolerably well, but not as fine as at the first. About the twentieth of August, the tops indicated disease, and soon died down to the ground. They were, dug the last of September. All the <a name="potatoes83"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were fair, smooth, and sound, except where the manure was not thoroughly spread. In such places, there would be two or three rotten t <a name="potatoes84"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a hill. I should not think there were; three bushels of cotton <a name="potatoes85"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> lithe three acres attribute the disease to an atmospheric ca rise, and infer that my <a name="potatoes86"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had so far matured before the disease commenced, a six. a. 417 mot to be destroyed by it. But still it is difficult to account for the diminution of the crop. I had only two hundred bushels on an acre. In the same ground, with the same cultivation, five or six years ago, I should have expected a much larger crop. Woolthis business does not increase. Our climate appears unfavorable for sheep, and especially for the finest wooled kind. An average price for it cannot be given. Haythis crop is supposed about seven per cent. less this year than it was last. The early part of the season was so dry as to retard the growth of the grass very much. Our having time commences about the 4th of July. To 'much of the hay crop as was cut in July, was very light. In this account, many of the farmers delayed their having till the last of August, and some even into September. Those who cut the latest obtained much the largest yield. The latter, part of the season being very wet and warm, the grass grew rapidly. Two tons of hay were cut on many meadows in September, which it is supposed would not yield over half a ton to the acre in July. The average amount of hay in this county is one ton and a half to the acre. The average price is                          $4 per ton. Sugarno other than map le sugar is made in this county. The quantity depends entirely on the season. This year and the last were both very unfavorable for making sugar. Very little difference in the two. In each of the last two seasons, there is a diminution of the sugar crop of at least seventy-five per cent. The quality is often equal to that of the best brown cane sugar. The average price is seven cents per pound. Dairyour farmers find that the dairy business is the best inn which they can engage. The amount of butter and cheese made in this county is increasing every year. Such of both of these articles is of as good a quality as can be found in any section. But still there is a drawback. In several parts of the county, emigrants from I re land and Scotland, in considerable numbers, who were unacquainted with the business, are engaged ii making butter and cheese. They produce articles of an inferior kind. Their productions injure the price of that which is good; but they are improving, and, no doubt, will continue to mend. The average price, of cheese last year was six cents per pound, and butter 12 cents per pound. This year, the average price of cheese has been give and a half cents per pound, and butter fourteen cents per pound. With these prices, the estimated avails of cows is twenty dollars' per head for this season. Fruitour climate is not favorable for most kinds of fruit trees. Apple trees grow well, but are so often killed by the sudden changes of weather, that little is done to increase or improve orchards. The amount of apples is something more than it was last year. Any complain that the ,apples are affected with decay, similar to what the <a name="potatoes87"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are. Horsesraising horses is more profitable than raising cattle The price of horses varies with their quality. They are from fifty to a hundred and fifty dollars per head14Ex. a. Seat cattle The price of neat cattle is from eight to ten percent. lower than it was last year. The larger part of our young cattle are sold at two years old. The average price of such cattle is thirteen dollars per head. In the fall, after the dairy season is past, cows are worth from twelve to fifteen dollars each; and in the spring, they are worth from eighteen to twenty-five dollars per head. Working oxen are worth from fifty to a hundred dollars by the yoke. During the summer, after s hearing, sheep are worth one dollar ahead. The common price of lean hogs is three cents per pound, and the average price of fresh pork is five cents per pound. Laborthe common price of farm labor for men is from ten to fifteen dollars per month in the summer season, and from eight to ten dollars per month during about four months of the winter season. The price of female labor is from seventy five cents to one dollar per week. Needs for distribution take the liberty to enclose two heads of wheat. It is spring wheat, and would, I think, be worth trying in il any parts of the country, if it is not already generally known. Should you think it an object to distribute this kind of wheat from, the Patent Office, and let me know it, I will another year send you, for that purpose, one barrel. Obediently, yours, H. S. Johnson. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. The following report of J. Cela field, esq, president of the Seneca county Agricultural Society of New Work, to the New York Stateagricultural Society, is so valuable, and presents so fine a specimen of the aid which might be rendered in preparing this report, that although it has .not yet been published in the Transactions of the New York State Society, it is believed they will not object to such a use of it, by which a wider extension of usefulness will be given, to it, and in this point of view is accordingly placed here. Oaklands, Near Geneva, N. January 3, 1849. Dear Of R: In compliance with your request to furnish information in relation to the crops, &c, of this county, I transmit here with the report recently prepared by me, as president of theSenca county Agricultural Society, for the State Society at Albany; it will give replies to all the queried in your circular excepting only such as are annexed. Respectfully, yours, J. Delafi Eld. Of on. E. Burike, Commissioner of Patents, &c, Washington, D. C418ex. a, 41. Ssenecacounty Agricultural Society formed under the act of the State of New York in 1841: John Cela field, president, Geneva post office, Ontario county; William R. Schuyler, secretary, Said post office, Seneca county 192 members. Farmers' Association, Gazette, Seneca county: John Cela field, president; Alexander Boris on, secretary 35 members. Though I keep a meteorological account of the year, my table is not so perfect as to present it. I may be able to transmit a very accurate table made from observations by a gentleman in this neighborhood. Respectfully, J. D. I Copy of the report transmitted by the president of the Seneca county Agricultural Society. To the executive committee of theJVew York State agricultural Societythe agricultural condition of the county of Seneca through the past year (1848) has been much improved; the cultivation of the soil has received more careful attention than for many previous years, and the barn yards and manure heaps are better managed a necessary consequence is cleaner fields, with larger crops. Seneca county is more devoted to the cultivation of wheat as a principal product than any other grain, yielding annually about 550,000bushels. The cultivation of I indian corn has increased within two years, and may be estimated this year at 400,000 bushels. The o at crop is unusually large, amounting to about 400,000 bushels. Barley is not extensively cultivated, but may amount this year to 120 000 bushels. Heretofore the Hutchinson wheat has been preferred to other varieties, and fully maintains all its excellence is; the You les wheat has been much increased, and finds additional advocates from year to year. During the past season many farmers have cultivated a wheat from Ohio, which has yielded a good return, but needs more experience, to be adopted in competition with the Hutchinson or You les varieties. The product of this county in wheat will average about 20 bushels per acre, and as compared with the crop of 1845, the excess of this year is equal to 14 percent. The demand for I indian corn for export in 1847 has given an impetus to the cultivation of that grain hitherto unknown in this county. Until, within a year or two it was a neglected plant, many farmers doubted the applicability of the soil to a full development of corn; now, however, it seems that large crops yielding a high average are produced. The quantity raised in 1841 was 1786 74 bushels; in 1845 we produced 205,000 bushels; and the crop this year is probably 400,000 bushels. The average yield per acre is 32 bushels, and fast increasing, as we have many farms which produce at the rate of 60, 75, and 80 .bushels per acre. The o at crop, as stated, is very large and good this year, th.420 X, opening spring having been very favorable. As an example, the town of Lodi produced in 1845 about 26,000 bushels of oats, and this year the crop in that town is 50,000 bushels. The adjoining town of Covert will present an equal yield of this grain. In 1845 the o at crop was 292,397 bushels; this year the county produces 4000 00 bushels. Barley has deteriorated in this region generally; the quality of the barley produced this year is believed to be inferior to that of last year, and the grain less in weight per bushel; the straw, when harvested, exhibited a shortness and feebleness unknown heretofore. This grain has not at a ;y time been a favorite object of cultivation in this county, and probably receives less attention than is due to it. As a crop, it consumes from the soil a far greater amount of its riches than the more valuable wheat plants, yet by a proper cultivation the product per acre of barley may be raised so high as to give an equal profit with wheat, and prove a powerful aid to the farmer as a spring crop, occupying his ground little more than three out of 12 months. The deter i oration of the seed in this section has induced the attempt to introduce, direct from England, the Cheltenham barley, which is a variety of the six bowed, and said to weigh over fifty pounds per bushel at all times. The average yield of barley this year will not exceed 21 bushels per. acre. Eye is favorably cultivated* in the towns of Genius, Lyre, and Waterloo, where our enterprising farmers have a lighter soil than other portions of our county. The crop exceeds the usual average about one fifth; it is not large, as the more important articles of wheat and corn take a prominent precede once. The very favorable state of the atmosphere during the spring months, and at the season of the hay harvest, enabled the farmers to secure more than an average crop of hay, probably one third more than the previous year. An annual loss is incurred on this crop by the too late in gathering of the timothy hay. As the grass ri pens here generally at the period of our wheat harvest, it is cut too late; that is, not until the seed has nearly ripened, and when the straw and leaf has parted with most of its nutritions power. Either a greater supply of agricultural laborers, or more perfect agricultural labor saving machinery, must be presented to remedy this annual loss. The crop this year may be estimated at thirty-eight thousand tons. Buckwheat is raised to some extent, and frequently as a green crop for sloughing into the soil as a manure. The <a name="potato50"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop has suffered much from the disease usually called the rot; a disease beyond the comprehension of any one in this section, and without any known remedy. There are several farms on which it has not yet made its appearance, while on the far dies adjoining, it appears in its most destructive form. Either the mode of cultivation, the composition of the soil, nor the position of the ground, nor the observations of careful men, offer any reasonable conjectures for results so widely different. The whole crop of the x. county this year will not probably much exceed two hundred thousand bushels. Flax has for many years been a source of early income, and the proprietors of oil mills have offered inducements for its cultivation. Is, however, the exhaustion of the soil by this plant is from year to year better understood, the cultivation falls off in several towns in this county it is wholly abandoned; for it is ascertained that the elements of flax make a heavier draft on our soils, for the growth of the plant, than any other, and without giving any compensatingreturn; while, for its proper cultivation and full development, it requires a high degree of maturing, which can be applied with more enduring benefits to the cereal than to the oil producing <a name="seeds23"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. Such and increasing attention is given to the propagation and production of the best varieties of fruits; extensive orchards have been planted during this year, and more careful p runing of the older orchards has been practised. One of our excellent farmers in Senecafalls has established a p each orchard of great extent, besides other fruits' Another enterprising farmer in Gazette has planted an extensive pear orchard; so, likewise, in every town in the county has every choice variety of fruit been cultivated and extended. For many years the apples of Seneca county have found an extensive demand and ready sale in Albany and in the city of Newyork, at an average cost here of 25 cents per. bushel. There is one exception to the general and successful propagation of fruit: the plum trees have suffered severely; and in some places have been totally destroyed by the worm, which causes the unsightly excrescence commonly called here the "black blotch Timely care and p runing would probably have prevented this disaster, and we have reason to hope that our farmers will hereafter examine into and study the causes of such frequent and mortifying losses, most or all of which are inflicted by the insect tribe. And here I would state that we have, from time to time, suffered much from the Hessian fly, and the grain moth; their ravages have, in many instances, been extended to our crops of barley. The g rub, and the wire worm, annually diminish the profits of many of our industrious farmers, and as often do we quiet our murmurs by the comfort of hope for exemption hereafter a vain hope, unless we cautiously examine the habits and changes of the countless insects which naturally infect our fields and crops. This remark is called for, because notice has of late been drawn to the destruction of grass in meadows, wrongfully attributed to defect in the soil; for the insect a his has been found in numbers beyond enumeration, all of them feeding on the herb age of the field. That the remedy is within the easy reach of the farmer there can be doubt; and there are many who, from precaution, do not suffer materially. We owe many thanks to' the several gentlemen connected with the State Agricultural Society for the information derived from them upon this subject, and indulge the hope that the agriculturists of this county will benefit by it, and in time add to the knowledge on record422Ex. a. It may well be doubted whether any particular variety of wheat is exempt from the attacks of the insect tribe; the same variety which was reported to withstand their ravages during one season has fallen before them in another. In this wheat growing region the dairy receives that attention only which will supply the farmer with the needful milk and butter for his establishment; and it may be stated that the county barely produces a quantity sufficient for the supply of its population. The product of butter in 1845 was 816,000 pounds, giving an average of about thirty-four pounds per head, per annum, to each inhabitant. The quality of the butter is generally excellent, causing a demand which will naturally affect a better supply. The stock of Seneca county is good, the prevailing breed being the Durham or short horn, from stock imported from England; and also Devonshires. The cross of these cattle with native cows is found to produce good milders. Such attention is paid to the breeding and raising horses, and they improve yearly. The sheep of this, county are, for the most part, Peri nos of fine wool; the flee ces average 3- pounds each. The low prices of wool through the present year has induced many farmers to reduce the size of their flocks, a course probably improvement; for, upon a careful examination of the subject, we have reason to believe that a regenerating benefit can be derived even at present prices. More careful foddering of the flocks under shelter through the finger months, and more economy in the mode of feeding, will probably meet the difference in the market values of wool. The number of sheep in 1845 was 72,000; they now amount to 71,000. Wine offer but little inducement for their propagation, except to consume the off al of the farm. The stock mainly consists of Berkshire, By field, and the common swine. Recently, a bear and sow direct from China have been introduced into the county, and across established with the Berkshire. The result is a breed calledToriquins; they have the small bone of the Chinese sow, consume but little food, lay on fat very readily, and at the age of fourteen months they average about three hundred pounds each, running at large. The introduction of well constructed farm machinery and implements has undoubtedly contributed much to the improved condition of this county, and enabled the farmers to obtain larger profits by means of the great saving of manual labor and of time. Among the most important of these machines is Husseys reaping machine, many of which were used here, for the first time, during the last harvest. By the aid of this reaper, with the previous use of the cultivate or named below, several farmers have been able to raise and prepare their wheat for delivery, in perfect order, at a cost varying from twenty-six to thirty cents per bushel. The cultivate or alluded to was introduced among us by Mr. Gray, of Newark, in Hayne county; it is an improvement on des' patent, which our farmers find an admirable implement twenty-three were put into active use the past season. X. :a. 423 The recent improvement in the plough by Mr. Burr all, of Geneva, and other men of sound scientific and mechanical knowledge, has materially abridged our labors in the field; while the stock fee der has been no less benefit ted by the corn and cob crusher ofPitts & Sinclair, and the valuable portable grist mill of Loss & Roof New Work, by means cf which the food for a large stock of cattle is prepared in a short time, as well as meal and flour for domestic use. Another advantage has been obtained from the use of Loss &los mill, by converting all the foul <a name="seeds24"><mark>seeds</mark></a> collected from the wheat crop by the fanning mill into a highly nutritions meal and food for cattle, thus avoiding the reproduction of pigeon weed, cockle, summer grass, &c. An attempt has been again made to collect the agricultural statistics of this county, under the auspices of the county society; the returns or reports from the several towns are transmitted here with. They are not presented as entirely correct, and must be received as the nearest approach to the truth which can be had, until the legislature shall adopt the easy and more accurate method of annual returns from the whole State, through the instrumentality of the town assessors. The great importance of information thus derived must be admitted by all p for it is the test and very foundation of the principles of political economy. It gives us the condition of our whole State, and the comparative advantages of each county. By this knowledge spread before us, we more readily avail ourselves of the benefits enjoyed by our sister counties, and impart to them any peculiar benefit possessed by our own. True, this is a very narrow view of the importance to be derived from official reports of the condition of our State; but even this renders it very desirable. From the several town reports a table has beenrcompiled, and here with transmitted, exhibiting the principal products of Seneca county for the year 1848, the number of acres devoted to the several crops, the quantity of seed sowed per acre, the quantity raised per acre, and the cost of production per acre; from these data and others given, the profits derived from each crop are ascertained and noted both per acre and per bushel. In the estimation of the profits, neither rent or interest on the cost of the land has been included. Various valuable inferences may be drawn from a careful examination of this table. Thus you have a general view of the agricultural condition of this county, which, if incorrect, will be found to err in the endeavor to under value quantities. The gradual improvement in cultivation is manifest, and a commend able strife for excellence and neatness in our agriculture is openly showed by very many of our excellent farmers. The annual fair and cattle show did not draw out as large a number of our farmers as upon some former occasions; nor could it be expected that they would drive their cattle and other stock through roads rendered very heavy and wet by a continuance of rain for several days preceding the celebration; nevertheless, the exhibitiomEx. was highly respectable and interesting. The annexed report of the secretary will detail the proceedings of the society. The treasurers account and vouchers have been forwarded to the comptrollers of the State, and exhibit an amount of cash received from members equal to                                                                                                                                                              $192.25, and from the treasurer of the State             $74; making the aggregate receipts to be                                                  $266.25. The amount of premiums and expenses paid is                                                 $221.61; leaving a balance in the treasurers hands of                           $44.64. In conclusion, it must not be omitted to state that the distribution of the Transactions of the State Society is shedding a vast benefit on this county; they are sought with aridity, and per used with care and industry, causing discussions, and incur dating lessons not to be derived from other sources. This annual work from the State society has, in very many instances, provoked an appetite for agricultural and horticultural knowledge, and induced many to seek more frequent contributions of facts connected with farming, and thus has been the means of extending the thinking and reasoning class of men who examine the pages of the Cultivator, the Geneseefarmer, and other publications so zealously devoted to our farming interests. From these sources science is made to confer lasting benefits upon us, driving away and steadily diminishing the misty baleful influences of ignorance and empiricism. J. Delafi Eld, President Seneca County Agricultural Society. December December 2, 1848. Dear Of R: I return here with the form you politely sent me with such statistics as I could gather. The return is imperfect, but is as full as I could make it this year.  We have had quite a dry season, and somewhat cool in the early part, which has been favorable to small grain, and the yield is larger than usual. X. a. 433Cornis of excellent quality, but the drought in August somewhat diminished the quantity. <a name="potatoes88"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> were planted in much larger quantity than. usual, but the dry season prevented full growth, and the yield is small. The p each business has been over done, and 'there is consequently a reaction. I judge that there were not more than two thirds as many trees planted last spring as the year previous. I append an estimate of the cost of culture of several crops, promising that our land is a friable loam, and portions of it sandy. This is the general character of the land, and the tillage is consequently very There is no agricultural society or club in our vicinity, and the estimates are made up from the opinions of the best informed farmers about us and our own results of labor. Our association is an industrial and educational institution, on the joint stock principle, and was organized in the summer of 1843. Each industrial department is committed to the charge of a group of laborers, and the groups are responsible to the executive council for the proper conduct of the business of the department. Our labors are mainly agricultural: A certain rate of wages for labor, and six per cent. for the use 'of capital, is first awarded as a basis of cost, and the profit or loss after this is distributed pro rate to capitalist and laborer. Each department is charged with the capital and labor employed in it, and each laborer and capitalist is credited with his contribution. We thus have the means of determining with precision the results of our labors, and in two instances have marked the actual results thus* I suppose, however, that our results will vary somewhat from the average of the country about us. I am, very respectfully, yours, Chas. Sears, Secretary. On. Edmund :BURKE, Commissioner of Patents. I am unable to give the consumption of food per capital, but could do so after our annual settlement, say sometime in January next, if that will be in time* We have a population of about eighty persons, and our property is about 43. X. a. Of Of, Delaware County, Panovember 30, 1848. Dear Of R: Your circular of queried respecting the agricultural crops, &c, received by the Delaware County I institute of Science, was referred to the undersigned, with instructions to furnish the desired information. We regret that our present means will not enable us to comply with your request with a degree of precision which the importance of the investigation demands. Being practical farmers, however, and observers of the progress in the various subjects embraced in your circular within this county and vicinity, we are induced to believe the following remarks and estimates bear a close approximation to their true condition. Our institution under the above title, of which honorable Georgesmith is president, and In shall Fainter is secretary, (post office address, Him a, Pennsylvania) is the only one contemplated in your circular as " other industrial associations." To agricultural societies or farmers' clubs exist in the county. Our institution was established in the year 1833, and numbers at present 32 members. I to means consist of a hall, and valuable collection of specimens in natural history and other interesting subjects, together with spacious lots appropriated to the various purposes connected with the object of its formation, and in a fund arising from and sustained by donations, annual contributions of its members, proceeds of public lectures, exhibitions, &c, situated near the centre of the county, 14 miles south from Philadelphia. Devoted to the advancement of its members and the community generally in everyiiseful knowledge, it commenced, in the year 1846, a series of annual exhibitions, embracing products of the county in all the leading pursuits of its citizens. Continuing to be sustained by our citizens in 1847 and the present year, their indefinite continuance is probable. The accompanying reports of the committees of arrangement for the last and the present year, will afford you more precise information of their scope and the result. Our county adjoining that of Philadelphia, and having communication with that city by tide water, and a railroad on the north and also the south side, the enterprise of our citizens, however employed, is stimulated into action by the advantages of their situation. Hardening, milk dairying, butter dairying, grazing beef cattle, and agriculture, engage their attention, 'as they are located at a short or greater distance from that city. The value of land, consequently, diminishes as the distance from the city increases, from an average of                                                                                                                                                                                   $150 per acre to about                         $60. We assume                              $35 per acre as the average for the whole county. Numerous mill streams, of from twenty to thirty miles in length, and a fall of 350 to 0 550 feet, cross our county at a distance asunder of s om three or four miles, affording a great amount of power to drive machinery. A large portion is already appropriated, and the balance gradually becoming so, and has concentrated in our county a large amount of manufacturing population, requiring the whole of many of our agricultural products for domestic consumption. X. 
4371Our soil is of various qualities, included entirely within the, primitive formation, except a strip of alluvial bordering the river Delaware. This is succeeded by belts of one iss, mi ca, slate and serpentine, each three or four miles in breadth, lying northeast and southwest, followed by a broad zone of ten miles in breadth, characterized by several varieties of rock, generally modifications ofgneiss, extending to the slate ridge south of the great primitive limestone valley of Chester county. Wholly destitute of limestone or mary, the natural condition of about two thirds of our county, embraced within the one iss and serpentine ranges, may be termed" thin hi though not sterile, and owes its present productive ness largely to artificial means resorted to within the last twenty or thirty years. For the balance, nature has been less sparing of the elements of fertility; and the present productive capacity of the whole will probably equal any other district of equal area in the State. Our vicinity to the city of Philadelphia, with its rapidly increasing demand for fresh provisions of every description, in connexion with the comparatively low price of beef cattle since the existing railroad facilities with the interior, has induced our citizens to extend the area formerly appropriated to dairying to nearly the whole surface of the county. Hence, the course of dropping the land has a direct reference to the production of the greatest a mount of suitable provision for dairy stock. The natural grasses, so pre eminently valuable for that purpose, are more injuriously affected by our usual droughts than the artificial varieties on ground recently cultivated; and experience has taught that an alternation of grain and grass crops will result in a greatly increased production of the latter. Our agricultural system, moulded to our interest under these circumstances, will apply to .all the adjoining counties appropriated to grazing dairy stock or beef cattle. It consists in the division of the farm of whatever size into six, eight, or more enclosures of arable land; one of which, after being de pastured several years, is broken up in the autumn, winter, or spring, and planted with corn, followed by oats the succeeding year, by wheat and timothy seed in the fall, and c lover seed in the ends iting March or April. The first year after the wheat is harvested, the field is appropriated to pasture; the second and third to hay crop; then to pasture until its turn for corn again. Very field taking its turn regularly. Thus three fields are at all times under cultivation, viz: one with I indian corn, be with oats, and one with wheat three in grass for hay, including. natural, meadows, and the remainder, more or less, in -pastures. Variations from the above occur to an inconsiderable extent. <a name="potatoes89"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> occupy a portion of the corn or oats field, and are followed by wheat and grass. Heat occasionally follows corn, without an intervening oats crop. Oats are occasionally, but rarely, sowed upon fresh turned sod ground, followed by wheat both doing well. Buckwheat, in small quantities, also supersede corn and oats on newly cleaned or intractable ground, and is followed directly by wheat and grass seed438Ex.  a. The latter sometimes is sowed with oats after corn and the wheat crop dispensed with. But these (except <a name="potatoes90"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>) are merely exceptions to the general course of dropping described above, and will account for the difference observe able in the quantity of land appropriated to the three leading grain crops in the estimates below. Under the regular routine, or any of its variations, the manure is applied to the soil at the time of sowing wheat and grass seed, and also previously to planting <a name="potatoes91"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Other minor crops, sugar bees, turn is, sweet potatoes, &c, receive comparatively but little attention. The high price and difficulty of obtaining agricultural labor constrains our farmers to apply it on a system of operations co extensive with his limits, greater or less, that will be most productive in proportion to the labor expended, rather than the amount of capital invested. The system of farming, including the care of live stock, either dairy cattle or others, requires nearly a uniform amount of labor throughout nine months of the year, equal to that of two active men and a boy to each 100 acres of cleared land, at a cost as follows: wages for two men, nine months, at                                                                                                                                                                                   $12 per month each,                                                  $216; boarding,                  $6 each,                                                                                                                                                                                              $108;clothing and board for boy twelve months,              $76 =a=                                     $400, or                         $4 per acre. In accordance with your wish to collect information respecting the "state of* the weather at the planting season' &c, &c, we furnish below an abstract of a diary kept for the records of our institution. The daily indications 'of the thermometer, -baroneter, and rain gage, it is presumed, are not desired, and they are omitted.  A few passing remarks on the crops, &c, are added, as more appropriately placed here than elsewhere. The months of May, June, and beginning of July, 1847, were characterized by the most intense drought ever recollected here at that season, greatly injuring the crops of hay, grass, oats, <a name="potatoes92"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, &c, followed by an universal quantity of rain until the end of the year. The corn crop revived under its genial effects, and produced an average yield. September, our seeing season, was very wet. The wheat crop, however, was well put in. Second crops of hay on the meadows abundant. January, 1848.-The weather was moderate and pleasant; not a trace of snow, and but few cold days. Heat crop continues to present a fine appearance, Battle doing well. Mercury fell, on the 10th and 11th, to 200 and 210 Fahrenheit, at noon. Februarywas equally mild, with but little rain or snow. Farmers sloughing extensively for corn. Marchcommenced cold, with six inches of snow; disappearing on the 7th, with heavy rain. The remainder of the month mild.

Farmers availed themselves generally of the rains on the 14th and 17th to sow their wheat crop, which vegetated satisfactorily. The pastures, though green from the effects of the same rains, are short, and a real scarcity generally exists. Octoberthe weather during this month (except from the 18th to the 2 3d, very cool) was mild, and very genial to the interests of the farmer. The wheat crop wears a promising appearance, though the early sowed, as was the case last year, are slightly attacked by the fly. Worn generally housed in good condition.

The great snow storm in Virginia andrew England, on the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 2 1st, presented to us a cloud, but neither rain nor snow. The earth slightly frozen on the 6th. A few drops of snow appeared on the 11th. The wheat crop has a very encouraging appearance generally, except a portion of the northern section of our county. The Hessian fly is found in nearly all sowed previous to the 20th of September. Having given an outline of the conditions under which our agricultural operations are pursued, we proceed to furnish replies to the -queried" contained in your circular, promising that, as the operations in the several branches of business referred to continue some two months before they close, and the agricultural crops not generally thresh d or measured until January, or later, nearly the whole will be based on destination.

Wheatall the varieties of our soil are more or less friendly to wheat, and, in ordinary seasons, will produce a greater or less quantity; not strictly in proportion to the natural fertility of the soil, but to the quantity and strength of the manure applied at the time of seeing. Lay soil generally produces the heaviest growth of straw, and in dry seasons, of grain also; but, being more liable to injury from excess of moisture, and by mildew, it is scarcely* In our usual seasons, it is believed the quantity would average 140 pounds. X. a. 443 preferable. Several varieties have been cultivated in succession within a few years the "red chaff, bearded" "mediterranean, "and `mountain" or "stewart wheat' The character of the two former is well known; and, though formerly in high repute, will probably yield to the present high opinion entertained for the latter. The -mountain" is a beautiful variety, nearly beardless ,and has been extensively cultivated the last year, yielding a product of 30, 40, and, in a few instances, 45 bushels per acre; more than doubling the usual acre able product of any hitherto known variety. In the cultivation of all the varieties with us the treatment is the same, viz: 25 to 30 ox cart loads per acre of good mature is spread on o at stable in August, early, and ploughed under at once. From the 15th of September to the 1st of October, the ground is re ploughed and sowed broadcast, or drilled. In some instances the grain is covered with the plough deemed preferable in flat, heavy grounds; in other cases, harrowed in after the plough. In all cases the ground is sowed immediately with four or more quarts of Timothy seed per acre. The quantity of seed wheat per acre, when sown broadcast, is from seven to eight peck s per acre. When drilled, six pecks. The early sowed wheat has recently proved most successful, though attacked by the fly in the fall. The increased strength acquired has enabled the plant to overcome the effect to a great extent; while the late sowed continues feeble through the winter, escaping the fly for the time, but uniformly attacked and seriously injured on the following spring, To spring wheat is cultivated with us. Usual time of harvest, from the 4th to the 15th of July. The present year, from 26th of June to July 10th. Early sowed crops very fine, late, very light; the whole estimated to produce 20 bushels per acre; being an increase of 20 per cent. over the crop of 1847. The cost of wheat per bushel to the producer cannot be arrived at with precision, where its cultivation is merely a link in a chain of operations, and it is by no means the most important one. The actual labor and expense incurred during the time of its cultivation and growth, 00 Whole cost, at                                                                                                                                                             $1.02 per bushel. .a. .a. . 20 404 4 X. a. Men per cent. damage by the "fly" is believed to be a fair estimate. It is estimated that the whole wheat crop of the county is consumed within its limits, in the form of bread, &c, and in ourmanufactories, for seizing, and other purposes. Oats is one of our standard crops, cultivated extensively, and reluctantly, as one intervening between the corn and wheat crops. It is considered very exhausting to the soil, and if corn could be cleared from the field sufficiently early to admit the necessary preparation for wheat in good time, would be abandoned. A black variety is in general favor at present. The expense and labor attending its cultivation is comparatively small. Worn ground of the preceding year is once ploughed, 3 bushels of seed spread upon it to the acre, and twice harrowed, in the month of March or April, indifferently. (early sowing generally yielding the heaviest grain) the crop harvested in July, and threshed at leisure; yielding this year a full average crop, estimated at 35 bushels per acre being an increase over that of 1847 of 75 per cent. Most of production after de ducting             $7 per acre for value of straw, 21 cents per bushel. Consumed in the county as food for horses, cows, and hogs. Present value, 35 cents per bushel. Manure is never applied to this crop. Moderately fertile land of any of our varieties of soil, is most suitable to this grain to insure a heavy yield. Eye, formerly cultivated here when growing grain was the leading business of the farmer, has been almost abandoned within the last '20 years. A blight attacked it some 12 or 15 years since, and reduced the product to about the quantity of seed. A few patches the present year appeared clear of disease, and produced a tolerable crop. We venture to estimate the quantity cultivated at 600 acres, and the product 15 bushels per acre, worth at Philadelphia 65 cents per bushel. Thin and serpentine land was formerly esteemed more profit ably employed in the growth of rye than other crops. The increased attention to accumulation g manure has changed this condition, and it is probable that rye will soon disappear from the list of our cultivated crops. I indian corn is decidedly our most important grain crop. Pasture ground of 4 or more years standing, (the longer the better) is ploughed during the autumn, winter, or spring, at convenience well harrowed, and laid off by furrows 4 or 41 feet apart each way, and planted at the inter sections about the last of April or beginning of May, as the season may admit. After the plant is above ground fairly, the number is reduced to 3, or at most 4, in each hill, and the " cultivate or" is passed twice each way between the rows, and again each way at intervals until the ear shoots; allsuckers, in the mean time are turned out. When the dusk is ripe and grain nearly hard, the whole crop is cut off near the ground, and shocked 48 hills together, around 4 hills left standing for the purpose, secured by a band from falling; and left in that condition until October, when it is his kid in .the field, and crib bed in an open late work building, of any length and height, but not more than 3 or 4 feet wide, to admit the air freely through the ears. The s talks, with the husks remaining upon them, are bound in convenient sized bundles and shocked or stacked where they are x. 445 wanted for use. In thin ground a shovel full of manure from the how pen, or other rich earth is frequently put in the hills previously to planting; and on all grounds plaster is either "placed on the hill or sown broadcast over the field the latter is preferable. In a greater degree than any other grain crop success with corn depends on the natural fertility of the soil, the length of time the ground has remained in sod, and continual stirring the surface. The " cut worm" has been very destructive several years past until the: present; and the " heart worm" is a great enemy to the plant in its early stages, particularly in clay soil. A loss of 10 percent may be safely charged annually, to the destruction committed by these two insects. Several varieties of I indian corn are cultivated here, more or less approaching the "you rd seed" character a tendency observed in all varieties after a few years' domestic at ion; none of it in its purity is in use. Fellow flint, of from 12 to 24 rows, more or less, pitted grain, is the character all varieties assume eventually. Soil inclining to sandy, perfectly dry, is most genial to this crop, and in ordinary seasons produce the heaviest yield. Early planting generally succeeds best, by escaping the effects of our' usual droughts of August, at a critical period of its growth. All or winter sloughing is found to be the only defence against the " cut worm." Average yield the present year 45 bushels per acre equal to the crop of 1847; present value 60 cents per bushel; cost 1 00 45 bushels per acre, at 36 cents per bushel, cost. 16 20 or 20- cents per bushel, when             $7 is allowed for corn fodder. Nearly the entire crop is consumed in the county as food for beef cattle, hogs, dairy cows, horses, and for human food in small quantity. Potatoesmoderately fertile soil, slightly elevated and inclining to sandy, well manured, is esteemed most suitable to this crop. In portions of this county adjacent to Philadelphia, <a name="potatoes98"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are cultivated extensively for sale in that city, in other localities for domestic consumption. In a corner of a field appropriated to corn or oats, from 25 to 40 ox cart loads of manure from the barn yard is spread per acre, from the 20th of March to the. middle of May, and ploughed under immediately; <a name="potatoes99"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> divided into for 6 pieces are dropped at the distance of 8 to 12 inches apart in every third furrow; when the plants are fairly above ground the surface is thoroughly broken by the harrow, without regard to the plant; the cultivate or is occasionally passed between the rows until 446 X.

To: 59.the tops fall; on level ground the operation is ended by throwing alight furrow to the rows, and it is left without further attention, except to eradicate weeds, until the crop is ripe in August or September. To escape the disease, the crop was generally gathered this year much earlier than usual; and though fears were entertained that the warm weather might be injurious to the <a name="potatoes100"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> after taken from the earth, they have been well kept in the usual way without loss. Several varieties are cultivated, but the "mergers" constitute nine tenths of the whole. A new variety, calledElwyn, has been recently introduced, but their character has not yet become established, To marked distinction in liability to disease has been' observed the present year in the different varieties; a trace of it was very general in all. Our present loss from that cause is esteemed an ample allowance their exemption is attributed to their being taken from the ground early principally in August while the drought continued. 'his latter cause contributed to diminish the crop sensibly on dry southern exposures altogether, however, the yield was fair estimated at 36 60 The crop of <a name="potatoes101"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is generally consumed in the county as human food, the balance sold daily in Philadelphia market.

Straw and corn fodder are chief amongst the valuable auxiliaries of the farmer in passing his stock over the long foddering seasons. Though not generally given exclusively to any description of cat x. 447 tie, they form a valuable alternation with hay for all. Worn fodder is much relished by all horned cattle, and steers in some instances have been confined to it exclusively, and improved satisfactorily. The quantity of all descriptions of straw and corn fodder, collectively, is estimated at 1 ton per acre, cultivated with wheat, rye, oats, and corn equal to 24,400 tons, worth for fodder                            $5 person, and for manure                                               $2-==             $7 per ton. Pasture, though not named in your circular, is a product of the soil of such vast importance in every view, that a few remarks on that head would not be out of place here. Our pasture grounds vary widely in productive ness, from difference in soil, situation, seasons, and interval since cultivation. Rich soils, recently cultivated, yield largely in bulk, but pastures of longer standing, if top dressed with almost any of the usual manures, will produce a larger aggregate amount of food, annually, of a greatly superior quality, either for grazing beef or dairy stock, were it not for the injury from our usual droughts, to which it is very susceptible, the cultivation of grain crops, now resorted to mainly to obviate this difficulty, would be in a great degree abandoned. Something less than two acres per head of our average, pastures are necessary to the profitable support of our mixed stocks, commencing about the 1st or 10th of May and continuing until the middle of November or later, The drought of the present year commenced in July and continued until late in September, with such intensity as almost to destroy vegetable life, and though a fine growing season succeeded, the pasture was consumed as it appeared, furnishing at no time since July a full sufficiency, and ceased altogether as soon a sit ceased to grow. We estimate the value of pasture per head, to our 10,200dairy cows, to be 80 cents per week each, for 26 weeks                                                 $212,160Ditto for 6,000 beef and working cattle, at 50 its.

Until recently, the owners of woodland have been reluctant to diminish the quantity; but the present more profitable appropriation of our cleared land, in connexion with the cheap end price of fuel since the introduction of coal, has induced a change, and a rapid encroachment on its former limits is observe able. It is estimated that the annual increase of timber does not exceed one cord per acre, nor its value                          $3, as it stands in the woods. Foot cropsTurnips, bees, and sweet potatoes, for family use, constitute the bulk of our root crops. Sugar bees were cultivated in considerable quantities some *ten years since, and succeeded448Ex. well. In a few perches, in 1839, the writer raised a ,very heavy crop, exceeding the rate of 1,000 bushels per acre, intended for beef cattle; but observing that hogs eat them freely, the whole were fed to eight confined in a pen during three months of severe winter weather, excluding all other food They throne vigorously, drank but little, and wore a smooth healthy coat of hair never witnessed under other treatment. The ,quantity given was three bushels per day to eight hogs of some 120 pounds weight each, gradually increasing the quantity to four bushels daily. Their cultivation has greatly decreased, the principal obstacle being the inconvenience of diverting the necessary attention from the regular routine of the farm, under the scarcity of labor always experienced. Turnips and sweet potatoes are seldom cultivated beyond the necessary quantity for family use. We venture to estimate the quantity of land appropriated to all at 600 acres. Value of produce                                      $50 per acre. To increase over 1847. In all fruit The cultivation of raspberries, strawberries, grapes, cher rise, plums, &c, for domestic consumption, and for sale in Philadelphia market, is increasing, and already constitute important it e ras in the catalogue of our exports, bidding fair to rival at no distant day other now far- more considerable interests. With but slender data, other than personal observation, we estimate the quantity of ground so appropriated at 300 acres, and the value of produce at                                                                                                                                                                                   $150 per acre. I increase 20' per cent. over 1847. Other hands than those of agricultural laborers are competent to their cultivation, and an indefinite increase is probable. Such attention is recently bestowed on the cultivation of grapes for table use. The I s abel la and Catawba are the favorites. To foreign variety is found to succeed so well, and are generally neglected. Orchardsthe increasing value of land for other purposes, and the recent disuse of cider as a beverage, has diminished the credit of apple orchards; and the progress of decline has been quite perceptible the last few years. As a market able article, however, much attention has recently been given to the production of varieties suitable for table use. The cultivation of peaches and years is also increasing. The former, ten years since confined to the garden, and a small corner of our county besides, has since expanded to a large interest in every district. Of peaches, the crops of 1847 and the present, were very heavy, perhaps about equal. Apples in 1847 was a total failure, (from a small lead colored insect infecting the bark and leaves, answering the description of your correspondent from Long I s land in last years report) the present a very large crop quality fine. An increase of 15 per cent. may be estimated for the quantity of land appropriated to orchards of all kinds the present year.

The whole quantity cannot be accurately determined but may amount to 200 or 300 acres. The crop is esteemed equally x. a. 449 profitable with corn, and is believed to be increasing. The brush" is manufactured into brooms on the spot, and sold in the neighborhood probably equaling the demand. Carrying is decidedly the leading business of our agriculturists, as the direct and indirect means of converting a large portion of the produce into cash. It has been mainly instrumental in changing the worn out and impoverished aspect of our farms some 25 years since, to their present cheering and profitable state of productive ness. Our dairy stock consists largely of our native breeds of cows, preferred for their profitable dairy qualities to any pure blood or cross of imported stock. After considerable experience, a small number are annually raised on our farms; but the chief dependence for our continual supply is on those raised and annually driven from districts west and northward of us in this State. The estimate of the quantity and value of dairy produce is given in another place. It is believed that an annual increase of 10 percent. in the number of cows, and much greater in products, has occurred within the last 25 years, as a consequence of diminishing the wood land; increasing capacity of our soil in productive qualities, and in displacing beef cattle; greater attention to and increased demand for dairy products, with skill acquired by experience in the general management, and the diversion of a considerable portion to supply the recent increasing demand for ice cream. In 1847, a backward spring and severe drought in A and June, materially diminished the product below the average. I i 1848, a drought of greater intensity, commencing in July, and continuing until September, almost annihilated the pastures, and affected the quantity to even greater extent. The enhanced price, however, from the scarcity produced, amounted to a full equivalent. Th6high estimation of "good springs" as the cause of the excellent quality of our butter, has recently become shaken by the result of experience. A properly regulated temperature in well ai red milk houses without water, above that of the spring house in winter, spring, and fall, and below it in hot summer weather, has been found to produce the greatest quantity of butter of a quality fully equal; and the cause of alleged superiority, if such exists, may probably be attributed to some peculiarity in the soil, grasses, and water, upon which the cattle subsist. An abundance of pasture during the summer, liberal winter feeding on an ample quantity of good hay and corn fodder, and, after calling, an addition of corn and oats meal mixed, or wheat br an, in any form, comfortable shelter, free access to water, with perfect cleanliness throughout, are the usual and necessary conditions of a profitable dairy stock. Cheese has long since ceased as a product of our fairies. The difficulty of procuring the necessary assistance in conducting our fairies has, in some instances, led to a change from the usual mode. A family properly constituted is furnished with a dwelling house, garden, &c, gratiswho milk, c turn, and prepare the butter for market with all necessary business at the spring house. The usual price for all these services is 3- to 4 cents per 15 450 X. pound for all the butter made, in addition to dwelling house, &c. This method is convenient for all concerned, and is increasing. The cost of conducting a dairy of 20 cows is as follows, viz House rent for family. .a. .a.                                                       $25.00Making 2,500 lbs. of butter at four cents (estimated 125 les. per cow. .a. .a. .a. .a. 100 00 Marketing the same at two cents per pound. 50 00 Six months' care of stock in winter (one hand at                            $5 per month and board. .a. .a. 60 00 interest on cost of 20 cows at                                   $30 each. .a. 36 00 Annual dec lesion in value of each cow at                          $3........ 60 00 most per head,                                                                                                                                                                $16.55 .a. .                           $331.00Estimate product,                          $47.73 each. .a. 95 4 60 Leaving                           $31.18 per head to pay for hay, grain and pasture .a. .a. .                   $623.60Raising stock his branch of business has greatly declined within a few years, and is confined at present to a few calves from superior cows in the fairies, and to a still less number of horses by farmers for their own use. I interesting specimens of both appear at our exhibitions annually, but as a business it no longer exists, owing to the more profitable application of provisions and attention to the dairy. Sheep, as permanent stock, has, for the same reason, disappeared from our farms. Some 25,000 heads are annually driven into our county from the western sections of our State, fatted on our usual spare pasture after harvest, and sold principally for the Philadelphia market. The average advance received upon them may be 75 cents per head. Dogs form an important append age to every dairy establishment for the consumption of sour milk and other refuse. They are generally taken to the pens at four or five weeks old, at a cost from                                                                                                                                                              $1 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.50 each, in the spring, and butchered for the Philadelphia market late in the summer and fall, commanding seven to nine cents per pound; 80 lbs. of pork is counted upon as the net produce of each cow in the dairy. Exclusive of these there are raised and fatted annually on the far his, and by other householders, a number estimated at 6,000; weighing, when slaughtered, at nine to fifteen months old, an average of 250 lbs; worth at an early market in 1847,             $7 per hundred pounds, and the present year                  $6. After supplying the local demand the surplus is sold to sausage makers for Philadelphia consumption. The application of our agricultural produce to more profitable purposes will probably prevent any increase in this description of hogs. The Berkshire breed, introduced some fifteen years since with such favorable anticipations, has been repudiated. A cross, however, of that, with our mixed x. 451 breeds previously used, has resulted in a stock far more valuable for the dairy than either, and much attention is given to improve it. Poultrythe continual opportunities afforded by dairy men for a market at Philadelphia, for their own produce, and that of their neighbors, induces considerable attention to poultry by our inhabit, t ants generally. The number of hens kept permanently in the county is estimated at 80,000, or 18 to each family; worth 25 cents each, producing an average of 72 eggs and three chickens annually, the former worth 15 cents per dozen, the latter 25 cents each, in the Philadelphia market; worth altogether                                                                                                                                                                 $132,000. Turkeys, geese and ducks, together,                                                                                                                                                                                   $12,300; total                                                                                                                                                                 $144,300. This estimate is considered rather too low. Sees are gradually and permanently dear easing in the county. The improved methods of treatment have very generally been applied by those who continue to give attention to them with decided success against the common enemy. We have very slender data for the estimate given in another place, but believe it to be sufficiently low. Manurestable manure, lime, street dirt, gun no, bone dust and plaster are the principal fe utilizing agents in common use. Largedeposites of primitive limestone, of excellent quality for the purpose, exist in the great valley of Chester county, at a distance of 12 miles from the centre of our county. From this source our land has been treated, within 30 years, with from 40 to 100 bushels per acre; a large portion of it repeatedly with great present and permanent advantage. Very variety of our soil (primitive formation destitute of lime) is found to be greatly benefit ted by it; and the process is still going forward with spirit. The average cost per bushel to all parts of the county is about 15 cents. Our methods of application vary but little; spreading it on the grass so done or more years before breaking it up for corn, is generally practised merely as being convenient. But in any form, season, or quantity, its benefits are satisfactorily realized. The chief dependence, however, is on the stable manure, produced in wintering our comparatively large stocks. Very convenient means is resorted to to increase the quantity by the accumulation of vegetable matter in the stable yards, how pens, &c. In some instances the yards and stables are covered to the depth of 10 or 12 inches with earth from hedges, ditches, &c, which, after remaining during the winter, absorbing the urine and other valuable liquids usually suffered to escape, is mixed and heaped with the un fermented manure on the following spring; the whole left until wanted for the wheat crop, or for top dressing grass grounds, when it is spread on the field in the usual quantity of 25 ox cart loads per acre. Men years' practice of this method enables the writer to say, confidently, that the quantity of manure usually made at our farm yards may be thus doubled, and the' quality entirely equal. The only extra cost is the hauling, which may be compensated by the destruction of trash of all kinds liable to accumulate in such places, and in the improved neatness of his farm. Street dirt is obtained from Philadelphia for use in the vicinity of tide water, and is deemed the most economical out 452 X. lay for manure when practicable. One dust has been applied to some extent with satisfactory results. Pua no has also been extensively experimented upon; its immediate effects are highly satisfactory on every crop, but the benefit compared with the present high price of the article will probably preclude its general use by farmers 'under our present system. Plaster is in high repute, and extensively used in this county, particularly on soils inclining to sandy. I to benefits are less marked on heavy clay soils. I indian corn, c lover, and, indeed, all grasses, give immediate evidence of its genial properties when assisted by the necessary quantity of rain to dissolve it. One bushel per acre sown broadcast is the usual mode of application. I to effects continue nearly unabated for three or more years. And it is remarked that c lover and old pastures ve get ate earlier in the spring and later in the fall, when treated with plaster, than otherwise. The. formation of com posts, so prevalent twenty years since, has been nearly discontinued no adequate return for the extra labor being realized beyond that from a direct application of the materials to the soil. Probable consumption of wheat, beef, your county contains about 130 man factories of various kinds, furnishing employment to a large portion of our population, whose liberal earnings enable them to procure all the necessaryes of life without stint, affording to the adjoining agricultural districts a convenient and profitable market for fruit, <a name="potatoes102"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, vegetables, firewood, meat, flour, &c.

The same by the agricultural class, except that the animal food used is mainly salted beef and pork of their own production. Under these circumstances, with the assistance of personal observation, we deem it safe to estimate the consumption of each individual of our population above 10 years of age, says 15,000, as follows 180 lbs. of annual food at six cents. Articles of produce not named above, are generally consumed in the county. A large proportion of the surplus corn, oats, hay and straw find ready sale at our man factories, mills and villages, for other purposes than agricultural stock. The balance is sold at Philadelphia, together with all others enumerated above, conveyed partly by railroad and water conveyance, but principally in private vehicles by land. Average cost of convey an ce and sales is about 8.per cent. on the gross amount.

455BETHANY, Wayne County, Pennsylvani A, 1848. Dear Of R: For your favor of the last report of the Commissioner of Patents, you will please accept my hearty thanks. Your circular of inquiries for 1848, I had the honor to receive. I have proposed to, several gentlemen, more at leisure, and better able to answer the interrogatories than myself, to take it and furnish the answers. After an unjustifiable delay, I hasten to reply, in my way, to such interrogatories as seem properly to belong to this section of the country. Heat culture Ours is a hilly district of country, rich in soil, but not naturally adapted to the growing of wheat; scientific farming may be said to be in its infancy with us. Any of our best farmers are now occupying the same lands on which they commenced with the axe, having succeeded, after years of toil, in subduing and bringing back the forest, year by year, until, at last, they have opened to the sun a sufficient quantity of land to induce the belief that it will do to quit farm making and commence the more agreeable business of farming. Growing of wheat on the new land fallow, rich with the decomposition of an annual crop of foliage, a thousand times repeated, quickened in its action upon the few first crops, by the all ali consequent upon the burning of a heavy growth of timber on the land, was not sure to return a regenerating crop; we were sure of a luxuriant growth of straw, which too frequently fell, or lodged, and spoiled the merry. Eye was more generally sown on new land, and great crops almost invariably harvested. Our fields, after having been in grass a few years, and properly summer followed, are tolerably sure of a crop of wheat. But the growing of winter wheat is too uncertain to receive much attention, as with a majority of the once good wheat fields in the counties of Duchess and Range, in the State of New Work; we do, however, get good crops of it. The premium crop in our county was this year about twenty-six bushels to the acre, by weight. Spring wheat is with us evidently the safest and most reliable crop. Different varieties of it are cultivated with good success. Iberian and I italian are most approved. Black sea has been introduced recently, but has not succeeded a swell. Spring wheat is commonly sown about the 1st of April, 11 bushels to the acre; some prefer 1 bushel. Harvested first week in August; average yield sixteen to eighteen bushels per acre. Average crop winter wheat about the same; worth                                                                                                                                                             $1.25 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.50 per bushel. Red slate, or what is commonly called red shale, is best wheat land. Heat crop this year double that of '47; more sown demand is always good; markets handy. Barleybut little attention is paid to raising it; have known large yields of it in this neighborhood; 40 to 50 bushels per acre average about 30, worth 80 cents per bushel; two bowed surest stands up best, yields best. Oats are grown abundantly. The temperature of the weather during the spring and early part of the summer, the natural moisture and frequent showers with which we are commonly favored, tends to promote the growth. The crop of this season full one -quarter better than that of '47. X, a. The land generally better prepared, and sown in better season the last of April, or the first of May. A man desiring to raise light oats would sow in June. Field per acre depends mainly on the condition of the land, season of sowing, quantity and quality of seed. Two or three bushels generally sown to the acre. Some of our farmers prefer sowing 90 to 100 pounds to the acre. Fromseeding to harvest, 12 to 13 weeks. Average crop per acre, 35 bushels have known 90. Fifty-five to sixty i- a good crop. Driving farmers I have known to sow the same field four, six, and even eight years in succession, with tolerable success, by turning in the stubble immediately after harvest, and crossing it in the spring. Average price 40 cents per bushel eye is better this season than in 47 near 50 per cent. It is, as usual, well filled and plump. In '47, it was, from some cause, light and poor. Generally sown in September. Average yield about 14 bushels per acre. Harvested in the early part of July worth 87- cents to                                                                                                                                                             $1 per bushel. Buckwheat is an article considerably used in this section; grows luxuriantly. The crop this season was good; perhaps never secured in better order. One third more raised tar i in 47. It is generally sown in the last week in June, or first in July, about three pecks to the acre. Harvested first of September. Average yield, 35 bushels per acre; worth 50 cents per bushels. Buckwheat cakes, manufactured and cooked in the style of the day, served up with butter and honey, are regarded a lawful tender in north eastern Pennsylvania. I indian corn- There have been many excellent crops in this county this season; but the average is below an ordinary crop, compared with the crop of '47; I think less 25 per cent. The weather at the proper seed time was fine; but, before the corn came up, a cold rain storm commenced, and continued so, with little exception, three weeks, endangering the terminating of the seed. In .many instances it came up badly; continued feeble and sickly into July. The middle and latter part of summer has been too dry. Commonly plant about the 15th of May; harvest, 10th of October. Average yield per acre, 30 to 35 bushels. Fellow flint is the most approved kind. It grows best on sand and slate shale soil. North six to eight shillings per bushel. Premium crop this season, 99 bushels shelled corn per acre. Potatoesdifferent varieties have done much better than in 147 think 70 per cent but little complaint from the rot. It is believed that planting sufficiently early to have them reach maturity before the ordinary season of rot arrives, has nearly worked a cure of that loathsome malady. Small tubes have, in many instances, been selected for seed. We formerly planted for winter use, as best suited our convenience, from 10th of May to 25th of June. , This season, most of the crops were planted in April, some in March. Different notions are entertained respecting the seeing. Even to ten bushels of full grown tubes are planted to the acre in this school district. Some good farmers prefer seven to ten bushels to the acre; and this they plant on the surface, cover shallow, and, at hoping time, hill slightly use lime and plaster. X. 
457Average yield per acre, 250 bushels. Long red kind grow best, and yield best. North 50 cents a bushel generally. Mergers the best for table use, and sell best. Mayo better hay can be found than is made in this county. Have an average crop this year of an excellent qualitycloverand timothy on the upland; timothy and red top on the low lands. Average crop two to three tons per acre on newly stocked meadows. Any farmers in this county secured their entire crop this season without one drop of rain or rum generally secured between the 10th of July and the 15th of August. North                      $8 to                                                                                                                                                                                              $10 per ton, occasionally much higher. Hemp, flax, silk, and tobacco But little attention is paid to the cultivation of these articles. Sugar from the map le tree is made in abundance, and that, too, of superior quality. With suitable care in the manufacture, it is equal to the best that can be made from the sugar cane. North eight cents per pound. Horns talks and straw are of less value in comparison to grain here, than in other sections of the country, where hay is less abundant. I think them equal to about one third their weight in hay. Probable proportion of cultivated and uncultivated lands t is entirely out of my power to answer this question definitely. Different individuals, of whom I have made inquiry, differ widely from each other on the subject. The land in our county, with very little exception, is susceptible of cultivation. Our valleys are fertile, and abound with excellent water power. Our hill slopes are arable to the top, and seldom broken with ledges. Any tracts of timber lands are, on account of timber, regarded more valuable than cultivated fields. Economy is constantly crying" spare that tree." Great improvements have been made in this county since 1840. It is rapidly filling up with an enterprising and industrious population. Thriving and beautiful villages are to be seen along the line of the railroad and canal of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, and along the improvements of the Washington Coal Company. In these villages, rendered brisk and lively by mercantile and manufacturing operations, the farmer finds ready cash markets for all his produce, generally a little above the New York prices. The improvements of the Delaware and Hudson Company have been of immense profit to the farmers in this county. The great New York and Erie railroad, just now going into operation, skirts our county on the east and north. Other projected improvements, waiting only legislative sanction, will, in a short time, perforate this county, and assist in making it what nature designed it to be, one of the richest counties of the commonwealth. Most approved rotation of crops Until within a few years, there has been but little attention paid to regular rotation of crops; and even now, there is is not a uniformity of practice on the subject. Good farmers, differently circumstanced, or occupying different soils, may be expected to pursue different methods for bringing out the capabilities of the soil, as well as for the sustaining of their families. In our immediate neighborhood, we prefer turning in 458 X. is ward in the spring, planting with corn, follow with wheat, the none or two crops of oats, before stocking with timothy and c lover, Some prosperous farmers of my acquaintance practise maturing, and running the same field eight ten, and even fifteen years, with alternate crops of corn and wheat i Foot cropsRutabaga, and yellow and white turn in are cultivated somewhat extensively for feeding cattle, horses, and sheep. Wine are frequently wintered on rutabaga. It is agreed that rutabaga for feeding working oxen, in winter, is preferable to grain. 300 bushels to the acre is an average crop. 1,200 to 1,300are sometimes raised, worth about 31 cents per bushel. Sugarbeets and carrots less extensively raised. They do not yield so much per acre; worth about the same as turn is. God fruit seas grow luxuriantly, yielding 25 to 80 bushels per acre; worth                                                                                                                                                             $1 per bushel; are not exhausting to the soil. I think the pea crop should be regarded as a fertilizes. Orchardsmany of the apple orchards are youthful, and in an excellent bearing condition. But few apples have as yet been exported. Choice varieties for domestic use are now worth 50 cents per bushel. Fruit trees in general are receiving increased attention. Wider apples are worth, delivered at the mill, 12" cents per bushel. The growing of superior apples is now a source of wealth to the husband man. I know of one apple tree in this county thats but 31 years from the seed, not grafted, that has been three times transplanted since 1820, now on a lot of 50 acres good improved land, that has for the last ten years yielded fruit sufficient to pay the entire taxes on the said farm. This season it yielded but ten bushels, most of which have been marketed at                                                                                                                                                             $1.50 per barrel. Small fruitCurrants and cher rise flourish remarkably. Strawberries and grapes are cultivated with tolerable success. Our winters are too severe for the spontaneous growth of choice grapes, and strawberries do not grow as large and abundantly in our meadows and fields as in sections of country less natural to grass. Hairy butter and cheese handsome increase upon '45; near one third, perhaps quite. Our stock of cows has improved in quality; more are kept, and more attention is paid to the different departments of the business. The demand this season has been good better than usual. Utter is now worth 18 to 22 cents per pound at home. Cheese is worth 8 to 10 cents per pound. Raising stock commend able zeal for improvement has kindled among the farmers of late. Our native shrub oak cattle, dwarf is, rough, and frightful, are fast giving place to the fine, beautiful and quiet Devonshires. There was present at our agricultural fair in October last, gratifying evidence of improvement in our neat stock; indicating what may be done in the improvement of stock in a short time, by a few ambitious, enterprising farmers. Valves of the Devonshire and Durham stock are, at four weeks old, worthicid127ore than those of the native stock at five; if kept for the dairy or the yoke, are more profitable; and, finally, when fattened, are found not to be so great consumers, while their pro density to fatten give six. a. 459 increased advantage to the fee der. The increase in number and value of farm stock has been great within the last few years. All kinds of stock are high. To this, perhaps, may be attributed the fact, that more calves have escaped the butchers knife the few last seasons than usual. Any good horses are raised here, but not enough for the convenience of our population. Beef is not as high, in proportion, as cows and working oxen. The quarters are worth from                            $5 to                  $6 per hundred; hides,                          $3.50 to                         $4; good cows, in May last, worth                                   $30 to                              $35; oxen,        $95 to                                                                                                                                                                                      $120. Sheepsheep husbandry connects admirably with the common branches of farming in north eastern Pennsylvania. The price of wool is now lower than usual, 20 to 50 cents per pound, according to quality. But few fine wooled sheep in the county; flocks are principally native, in many instances crossed with Berkshire. The marshal for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, in 1840, reported 348 78 in this county. I am quite certain there are now twice as many as then. Average pounds per head, 31 to 4. Button iscid127worth, in spring season, 5 and 6; in the fall, 4 and 5 cents per pound. Skins, this season, three to five shillings apiece; winterfleeced and large, more. A friend, in writing to me a few years since, says: "sheep are to be admired for various reasons; for the warm and healthy article of clothing they produce, for their valuable mutton, for their ability to produce two crops in a year, viz wool and lambs, for their quiet ness, and for various other reasons. Unlike other animals, they have no disposition to injure one another. The stronger will not oppress the weaker, and the stranger may eat at the same rack. In this respect, what a valuable lesson is taught to the shepherd by his flock. A sheep may die in debt to its purchaser, but it cannot to him who raised it. The reason for this is plain. It pays all charges once a year, and the moment it has settled for area rages, it commences to accumulate at a rate which is sure not to fail where withal to meet the next annual settlement; and, die when it may, it always leaves a fair compensation to its owner for what little it has consumed of his substance. Notwithstanding the opinion of some men to the contrary, sheep are a greater benefit to a farm than any other kind of stock have ever kept. They will turn thorns, and briars, and noxious weeds, curses pronounced on Dam and his seed, into useful substances, and in the end cause them to become extinct, and valuable grasses to grow in their stead. Thus do they lighten the toils of man; thus do they turn the curse into a double blessing; yea, treble his t horny fields into green rich pastures, into warm clothing for his body, and into wholesome food for his subsistence." The wool growing, like the wheat growing business is travelling west and south. Of wool should fall off in price for two years to come as it has for the last ten years, it will not be worth the attention of farmers in the eastern and middle States. Hogsno great or material change has taken place in this kind of stock since '47. More pork is made, and more consumed; but not as much in proportion to the population as then. Average460ex. weight per how, when fatted, about 270 pounds; market value, while fresh,                  $6 to             $7 per cut. Poultry and eggs hung hill fowls receive increased attention. Poland hens are much sought for perhaps more than they will be two years hence. The full blooded lay remarkably well; but are quite scrupulous about watching chickens. Ours had rather lay two eggs a day, and work in the corn field or garden morning and evening, than to busy themselves watching and taking care of chickens. Eggs are worth 121 cents per dozen. Sees, like the husband nan of northern latitudes, have a short summer in which to procure provisions for a long winter. But so far as I know they are as healthy in this as in any other section of country, and as seldom die of starvation. Average yield per hive 45 pounds. Market value 12. cents per pound. To material change since 1847. Manureless attention is paid to the preparation and application of manure in this county than in many other sections of Pennsylvania. Warns and stables are not often moved for the purpose of getting rid of a troublesome manure heap; but manure is often permitted to accumulate about them and waste before it is removed to the field. Justice to our farmers, however, requires that I should report great improvement in saving and management of manure, and making of com post for top dressing, &c, since 1845.

Hope Bushnell, president post office address, Beth une, Hinsdale. Samuel E. Dimmick, secretary. The prosperity of our agricultural society is flattering. We had an interesting exhibition this season. In all probability our annual fair will elicit much greater curiosity, and be increasingly advantageous. Thus, dear sir, have I, at much greater length than I, intended, replied to most of the inquiries in your circular. Of any part of my response can be of service in enabling you to make out your next annual report, I shall feel amply compensated for the little time I have spent in preparing it. I have the honor to be, with respect and esteem, your obedient servant, Pope Bushnell. On. Edmund Brrke. X. a. 461NoTEPaul S. Preston, esq , has resigned the office of president of our agricultural society. I have been in due form chosen. Bushnell. Delaware. Of R: With this you will receive a statement of some of the principal crops grown in school district 58, taken as a data whereby an estimate may be made of the crops grown in the entire State of Delaware. The following gives the estimated crops for 1847 and 1848 Bushels of wheat n 1848, 14,392; in 1847, 12,333. I ncrease2059. Bushels of oats n 1848, 31,838; in 1847, 25,617. I ncrease6221. Bushels of corn n 1848, 41,260; in 1847, 427,18. Decrease1458. This shows an increase in wheat of 2,059 bushels, of 6,221 bushels in the o at crop, but a falling off of 1,458 bushels in the corn crop. This latter was very much lessened (say ten per cent) in consequence of dry weather in the latter part of July and August. The quantity of seed wheat sown varies from 1 l to 2 bushels to the acre. It will be seen that the fields which were sown the thin nest produced the most wheat to the acre. One field, (86 acres upon which 103 bushels of Mediterranean wheat was sown, produced full 2,400 bushels, or nearly 28 bushels to the acre over 23 bushels for one bushel of seed sown. The average acre able product of each of the crops grown was about 14 bushels of wheat, 26, bushels of oats, and 28 bushels of corn to the acre. School district No. 58, Newcastle county, and State of Delaware, is divided into 24 farms, cultivated as follows1848Wheat. 1,020 acres." Oats. .a. .a. .a. 1,144 "a" Worn .a. .a. .a. 1,436 Of <a name="potatoes104"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> .a. .a. 14 "the usual course of tillage is a five field rotation. This system has varied more or less, as the price of grain has varied in the market. The regular course is, 1st, corn; 2d, oats; 3d, wheat; 4th, c lover; 5th, pasture. This system, adhered to, will show 6,230acres under cultivation and pasturage, leaving 1,993 acres, or something over one quarter, uncultivated or in wood land. There are but few acres of this district but what are susceptible of high cultivation. This is not far from the ratio of the cultivation in the un improved land of the county of Newcastle. North of us, in the neighborhood of Wilmington, the land, although not so good naturally, is more highly cultivated. South of us, and 462 X. further from the market towns, there is more wood and uncultivated lands. The proportion of uncultivated land in Went county may be put down at one half, and that of Sussex county at more than three quarters. The land in the entire State is in a healthy condition of improvement, and so is also the entire peninsula from the Pennsylvania line to Gape Charles. Some of the most rapid improvements that I have heard of on our poor old worn -out lands, so called, have been made by our neighbors of Cecil county. Cornelius Smith paid             $7 per acre for land a few years since, and, by improvements, he has raised its value so that he has recently been offered        $90 per acre. Any instances might be cited where land, but a few years ago deserted by the owners as not worth cultivation, has been resuscitated, and now produces from 60 to 80 bushels of corn; in some cases over 100 bushels have been reported, and from 30 to 50 bushels of wheat to the acre. The most approved manure for the renovation of these worn out lands is lime and c lover, with a free use of plaster. But how is this to be applied ?a? Slough in the autumn pretty deep; then spread 40 or 50 bushels of well soaked quick lime to the acre on the ploughed ground. In the spring plant with corn, sow wheat in the growing corn early in August, or oats in the spring after; but in either case, sow about one bushel of c lover seed to every five acres of wheat or oats. Met your c lover grow until August of the fifth year without either mowing or past during, not forgetting to sow plaster, at the rate of one bushel to the acre, at least twice. Met the first dressing be as soon as the c lover is up in the third year, and also in the spring after the earlier in the spring the better; let the c lover grow until the August of the fifth year without either mowing or past during; then turn under all of it well with the plough, (routs No. 50, or some other plough that is quite as good) harrow length wise with a light harrow, so as not to disturb the sod, and then roll it; immediately, before sowing with Pennocks drill, one bushel of seed to the acre, and you may be pretty sure of twelve bushels of wheat to the acre or more for one sowing. Pursue this course for three full rotations, and you may fairly count of twenty bushels of wheat to the acre. More than twenty has been obtained by this course in No. 58. This course of rotation is recommended because it is known to have succeeded well. The concentrated manures might be used to force on heavy crops at once, but not with as much certainty and economy as the lime and c lover. But little attention is paid to any other of the branches of agricultural industry called for in your circulars, except in about the proportion of the increase of population, which you may put down for Delaware now at least 100,000. The city of Wilmington, a swell as many small towns in the State, have doubled their population since 1840. Our farmers, too, have concluded to remain in Delaware, where, for a series of many years, they have been getting an average of                                                                                                                                                             $1.25 for wheat, and 60 cents for corn, rather than go to the west. I still adhere to my estimate of the value of straw x. 463 and corn fodder. The prices I fixed were based upon the value of wheat and corn in Delaware. In the east, where grain is higher, the price of corn and fodder is increased. In the west, where corn is worth but 12- cents, then the value of straw and corn fodder falls in the same proportion. I have been offered                            $5 per ton for my straw on the farm by men who have presses, and who can press it and take it to Philadelphia, where it brought, last spring, from                                                                                                                                                                                             $10 to                                                                                                                                                                                   $12 per ton. The price of straw this day, 8th January, 1849, on Pennsylvania avenue, Washington city, was 60 cents per hundred pounds. It sold on Wednesday last, in Boston, at 70 cents for the same quantity. Straw is used in the city for feed for stock, cut up and mixed with shorts, rye, or I indian corn meal, and for litter for stables, and for packing crockery ware and other merchandise; and also by the how slaughtereds. One firm in Baltimore has slaughtered over 10,000 hogs for the British market this season; and instead of scalding, they since the hair off. The process is this: They have brick buildings about 12 feet wide by 30 feet long, with high stories, so as to keep the flames within the buildings. They bring in about twenty in a row at each singing, and place the hogs first on their bellies, with feet spread out, so as to get as much surface as possible, then on, around, and between them, they scatter straw rather loosely, so as to make a quick flame, which will burn the hair without scorching the' flesh of the how. After the first firing, they then turn them down on their sides, give them another covering, then turn them again; and after three firings, which require but a few minutes in each operation, they are removed to another apartment, where they are shaved, hung up and dressed, ready for the packers, consuming, by the three firings to each twenty hogs, about 400 weight of straw, or about 25 pounds to each how. The price of straw and corn fodder may just as well take its value at the city or markets where it is consumed, and where it commands the highest price as these are the places where the grain wheat and corn took its price, that seemed to swell the value of exports so enormously high the past two years. Such of the corn shipped abroad the past year was purchased in the west at 12- cents per bushel. I need, notwithstanding the foreign demand for corn, owing to the famine in Europe, yet it was as low as 17 to 18 cents in It. Louis, for months together, in 1848, although that corn had been brought, much of it, no doubt at least 500 miles by steamboats, and paid two cents on the commission out of that, reducing the low price of 18 cents at least one third, if not one half. Worn is now, what tobacco was in Virginia in times past; -it is the best basis for all our calculations.  The value of our lands depends upon the price that corn will bring. In your valuable report of 1817, you presented a table which showed that our exports of corn for 25 years, from 1820 to 1845,had averaged less than half the growth of Delaware, not one fiftieth part of the growth of Tennessee, being only about 1,400,000bushels per annum. I have no means of ascertaining the amount of any kind of bread stuff exported for the year ending 30th June 464 X. a, 1848, owing to the fact of the report of the Register of the Treasury, for the past year, not being published. Your report of 1847 shows that 6,053,845 bushels of corn were brought from the west by the single outlet of the Erie canal, four times as much as our annual exports to all the world in ordinary seasons. Was it not for the western corn that is brought to our market, Delaware land, and all agricultural products grain, hay, straw, and corn fodder would be much higher than they now are. We have two agricultural societies, one farmers' club, in Newcastle county; and at least another farmers' club in Sussex county 1st.

This calculation includes the seed, consumption and waste by man and beast. This mode of ascertaining seems to me to be the only one by which we can arrive at anything like an approximation to the true results. Supplies will only keep pace with demand. The heavy exportation of 1846 47 emptied our granaries, although our supplies had been accumulation g for a quarter of a century; during which time, we had not exported over one million four hundred thousand bushels of corn on an average. Contingent surplus we must have, sometimes less, or more, as seasons affect us, which they do, much more than any foreign demand. It will be seen that the foreign demand amounted to only a small per cent age of the whole amount produced; whilst it would seem that forty bushels to each individual is a very small amount to cover expenses of seed, consumption by man and beast, and wastage. The p each crop of Delaware was very full in 1848, perhaps at least half million of baskets in the State, of which the Reyboldfamily may be credited with 125,000 baskets at least; the balance grew in Newcastle, 125,000, and each of the other counties of Sussex, &c, 125,000. The average price was very low, not exceeding 25 cents per basket. I am glad to hear you have determined to institute an inquiry as to the component parts of such soils, minerals, and vegetables that may be sent to you for that purpose, so far as the means within your reach will enable you to do so. I would suggest the experience of extending the inquiry to that of manufacturers' goods, to wit: Now much of the cost of making iron. goes directly or in 15 466 X. directly into the pockets of the farmer, and how much duty paying goods are consumed by the process of manufacturing in all its manipulation from the otherwise useless ore in mountain or bog, till it is fashioned by the hand of the skilful American artist, ready for the consumer. Extend this inquiry still further to the wool, cotton, and American china fabrics, with its effects upon population and the value of property. I was led to make the suggestion by the fact of having purchased one yard of British muslin, for which I paid twice twelve and a cents, which muslin weighed one quarter of a pound, which, after being washed and weighed on the same standard scales, showed a falling off of one hundred and eighty grains of starch, made of British wheat, of course. This muslin was called Ohio extra heavy sheeting. By carrying out this estimate, and fixing the crop of cotton of the United States of the growth of 1848 at 1,225,000,000pounds, and supposing the whole crop to have been manufactured in the same kind of cloth goods with the same amount of starch in it, this would have given us a market for over 13,000,000 bushels of wheat American wheat much more than we have ever sent to England and France in any one year, except possibly in 1847,when the loss to England from <a name="potato51"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot amounted to 33,000,00sterling-equal to                                                                                                                                                                              $156,000,000. A good dat up for the amount and value of manure made on a well managed farm, from the produce of the farm, by feeding hay, straw, corn fodder, and roots, with a little grain, may be found by reference to Some of Mr. James Iowans reports, as published in the Farmers' Cabinet; all of which is submitted. Respectfully, J. Jon1es. On. Edmund Burke. After my first experiment in sowing wheat with the drill, in which I was successful, I was further encouraged by reading the experience of Retro Full, who was a practical farmer, and wrote about 150 years ago. Up to that time, farming in England was at a low ebb, owing to the low price of wheat the average product not being ten bushels to the acre. The small quantity yielded induced Retro Full to experiment with machinery and improved culture, as the price of grain at that day would not justify the farmers in purchasing manures. His experiments were eminently successful; for in a very few years he had brought up his yield to 75 bushels per acre from gallons sowing with the drill, upon land that but a few years before he could not get 10 bushels from by the old mode of culture. His neighboring farmers were then, as many of our farmers are now, prejudiced against book and experimental farming, and viewed him as an inn orator upon their old established customs. They finally came into Pulls plan, and now drills are there extensively used, and but little wheat is sown broadcast in the highly cultivated counties of England. X. a. 467 When. I commenced drilling, and for two or three years, I was ridiculed by my neighbors; some would advise me to take the implement home, break it up, and cook my dinner with it 1, however, disregarded their peers, and persevered. And now the best evidence that I can possibly bring forward in support of the drill over the broadcast system, is the fact that all my neighbors have adopted the drill for sowing their wheat, and most other small grain; and that we have three or four drill builders besides H. W. Pennock, the inventor of the improved drill, all of whom could not supply the demand for drills for Newcastle county the past season. I think I am warranted in saying that three fourths of all the wheat that will be grown in Newcastle county the next year, will be from land sown with the drill. One of the great advantages of the drill over the broadcast is, that they can be constructed for sowing the concentrated manures, gun no, poudrette, bone dust, &c. I have one lot of 160 acres upon which I sowed, at the same time with my wheat, fifteen tons of gun no; on a part of which I sowed 300 pounds, and other parts 200 pounds per acre. The experiments with the drill and broadcast on D. C. Nobles field, resulted in a yield of 27 bushels per acre of broadcast, where two bushels had been sown; and 35 per acre, where 1 bushels had been sown with the drill; land similar in every respect; the variety of wheat Mediterranean; showing an increase in favor of drilled including the saving of seed) of 81 bushels to the acre. See C. Nobles letter as published in the American Farmer. The yield of additional straw on the drilled acre, 12 per cent. Field of additional wheat on the drilled acre, 27 per cent. Another experiment by a Pennsylvania farmer, published in the October number of The Slough, Room, and Until, was equally favorable to the drill. I am much in favor of sowing with the drill, and of thin sowing. I harvested 24 bushels to the acre from a field of 80 acres in 1847,from 88. bushels sowing with the drill. This field had had a dressing of 40 bushels of quick lime to the acre in 1838. In 1846 1 ploughed in and covered well (say 6 or 7 inches deep) a heavy growth of c lover, which had neither been mowed nor pastured that season; harrowed twice length wise with the light harrow; then sowed with the drill as above described; all length wise with the sloughing. rolling before drilling would have been much better rolled my field the past season just before seeing; rolling should never be done after drilling. Wheatland, February 7, 1849. On. E. Burke: The enclosed paper on the subject of straw and corn fodder, as provender for stock, and the manner in which it should be used, is from one of the best and most experienced horse masters in this country. I remain yours, respectfully, J. Jones468ex. a. Port Deposi Of, February 3, 1849. Dear Of R: Hours of the 1st instant came duly to hand, inquiring of me the value of straw and corn fodder as provender. Good clean wheat, rye, or o at straw, is always valued at half the price of hay, provided the distance to haul it to market does not exceed three miles. When hay is worth                                                                                                                                                                              $15 per ton, if the distance is greater, the charge is more. Worn fodder, when well cured, will always command as much as good hay. The fodder is principally used for much cows. When I can buy good clean wheat or rye straw at half the price of good hay, I prefer it to hay for horse feed; and, at all times, when I can get straw, I feed it to my horses in preference to hay, for the reason that hay has a tendency to make a horse short winded. And I have known instances where horses have been kept all winter on hay, without grain, and were not worked any to require grain, and when spring came, they had the heaves. And I have also known horses have the heaves that were cured by feeding them on clean straw, with a little grain and I am fully convinced that a horse that is constantly worked as a stage horse, carriage horse, or saddle horse, will stand more fatigue, and his wind will be better, by being kept on oats, or corn, and the clean straw, than he would, if he had the hay. But when you feed corn, it is important to give the horse plenty of salt. When I feed corn altogether, I make a tub full of salt and water, (about one gallon of salt to twenty gallons of water then put the corn (in the ear) in this pick le, in the evening, what I intend to feed in the morning; and put in, in the morning, for noon; and put in at noon for feed at night, &c, and give plenty of straw with it, and horses will stand the heat of summer, a swell as they would on oats and straw; and I am confident they will stand it better than they would, if hay were substituted. I do not wish to be understood to say that a horse would do better on straw alone, than he would on hay; but if you will take straw, and take the balance of the money in favor of the straw, and buy oats and corn, and feed it with the straw, which will make the same cost, then your horse is better than he would be on hay alone. But when you take a horse that is always grained fit for service, you save by the straw. In 1847, 1 paid for wheat straw,                      $8 per ton; and hay sold in that year at                                                                                                                                                                $16 to                                                                                                                                                                 $18 per ton. In 1848 and at present, I am paying                 $6 per ton for straw, and hay can be bought for                                                                                                                                                                                             $10 per ton. I n quire the advantage of the use of clean straw of some of the old northern stage contractors, and I think they will agree with me. I remain, with respect, your most obedient servant, J. J. Heckart. Mr. John Jones. X. a. 469 Ddlebrook, Montgomery County) Mdfebruary 11, 1849. Of R: Montgomery county was formerly (unfortunately for her a tobacco growing county, which impoverished her soil to that degree that it was scarcely worth tillage, except on alluvial bottoms, and on small lots around the mansions of the residents; but within the last four years the improvements in many parts have been very considerable, taking into view the limited resources of the inhabitants and the costly material (gun no) used in restoring it. In 1847, there were upwards of 100 tons used within, a few miles of me, and about the same quantity in 1848. The amount, I have no doubt, would have been much greater, could it have been procured in proper season and at a suitable price; in fact, I believe the amount would only have been limited by the means to procure it. The effects realized by the application of guanohave been so favorable on a great portion of our worn out lands, as to create almost as great a fever to procure it as appears to affect some sections of country at the present time in regard to the gold region of our newly acquired territory; and could this desire be gratified by bringing the article within reach of those disposed to use it, the advantage to the country at large would, no doubt in proportion) be as great. The newspapers announced last year that a treaty had been concluded between our government and that of Peru. The particulars of that treaty, or whether anything relative to gun no was embraced in it, has never transpired, (that I have seen) It would be gratifying to know if the monopoly of the article by an English house has been removed, or whether our vessels are allowed to bring it direct. In an article of so much importance to Maryland, Virginia, and other portions of our Atlantic sea board, the restrictions should be as limited as possible. The amount of wheat raised in 1848, in consequence of the use of this manure, I believe to be double of that of the year 1847;not that the average crop was so much better, but owing to more having been sown on land that, without this or other artificial aid, would have yielded little or nothing. The rye crop has failed for so many years past to yield a regenerating profit, that it had almost been abandoned. I, however, procured a small sample ofmulticole" from my friend, Mr. John A. Smith, of Washington, a few years since, which has succeeded admirably. The yield last year, notwithstanding it was prostrated by a severe storm, was nearly an average of twenty for one sown. The length of the straw was, on an average, upwards of seven feet; before it was prostrated it was the admiration of all who saw it. One year the yield on good land was forty for one sown. I need, from my experience, I view the introduction of the "multi come rye" as a great acquisition to every section of the country where the common rye has proved a failure, as it has in ours for so many years. Of you think it worth your notice, I could supply you with a bushel or two for distribution; and next year (from present prospects) will have a quantity to dispose of. Barley none raised here.

The wheat sown in the fall of 1847, was put in in good, clear weather, and looked very promising until some time in the spring, when we had a long drought; so much so that we despaired of making our seed; but just before harvest there was one or two shower which revived it. The weather whilst cutting our grain was fine; but before securing it we had one week of constant rain but being cool, did no further injury than to occasion a loss in opening and. again securing it. The present growing crop is promising, particularly the late sown; the early has been a good deal injured by the fly. Respectfully, your most obedient servant, T. C. Clopper. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patentsolwoodlands, February 18, 1849. Of R: It is my intention to send my wagon to Washington tomorrow, and I will send a bushel of multi come rye by it to you, as requested in yours of the 16th instant, with instructions to be left at the Patent Office. It will probably arrive on the evening of the 19th or morning of the 20th. As it is for distribution, I make no charge x. a. 471 for the rye, being desirous of contributing my mine towards advancing the agricultural interest of the community, and in a pecuniary point, of too small value to put you to any further trouble. I am tolerably well fixed for experimenting on any grain or grass <a name="seeds25"><mark>seeds</mark></a> that may be likely to prove advantageous to the country likewise roots, &c, from abroad, or, different sections of our country. Of it meets with your approbation, and is conform able to your rules to distribute to private individuals any articles of this kind it would afford me pleasure to be the recipient of such small favors occasionally. In my last communication I omitted stating an experiment I had made with regard to the production of chess or cheat in wheat, for my own satisfaction. In the fall of 1847 I directed my manager to select about a peck of that article, to be nicely cleaned, and land of an excellent quality, prepared in the best manner, as if for wheat, on which to sow the cheat without any admixture whatever. This was done, and the result was the production of neither cheat, wheat, or any other vegetable substance, until the warmth of the spring brought up weeds, grass, &c, common to our country; from which I infer that there is no danger to the farmer from a reproduction of cheat that may inadvertently be sown with wheat, and that cheat is nothing more nor less than degenerated wheat. I have upwards of twenty acres in orchards, containing all the most celebrated and valuable varieties in our country, and amongst them one, in particular, superior to anything of the apple family I have ever met with; samples of which I have sent to some of my friends in Baltimore and the district, who all have told me that my apple sur passes anything of the kind they have ever met with in their markets, and that they have never seen any resembling it. The late Matthew Are y, e squire, of Philadelphia, procured it, among many others, for me at the nursery of the celebrated Or. Box, cf He i Jersey, many years since. Not wishing to give you any further trouble, I will conclude by saying that I view your (a( Reports" of immense value to the country; they should be spread "broadcast" through the community. I see your last eulogized in the papers as even superior to its predecessors. I hope it may be re published, so as to be within the reach of private individuals who may be desirous of obtaining it. Respectfully, yours, &c, &c. C. Clopper. Honorable Edmwnd Burke, Washington city. London Bri Dge) Pri Ncess Anne To, Vaoctober 16, 1848. Dear Of R: I have received your circular asking for the agricultural estimates of the present year, and have the honor to forward 472 X. you, with this note, a table of statistics, which, though confessed ly imperfect, may possibly assist you in making up your report. A marked similarity will be observed by comparing my estimates for the present, with those for the past year; and this similarity maybe traced to the geographical position of our county, which has but few natural advantages, and is sadly deficient in capital. These disadvantages conspired to keep us measurable stationary, even in this age of "steam and telegraph" and while the more important elements of good living are cultivated with an improved degree of attention, and a marked increase in productive ness, the "fancy stock 2 is turned over to the management of other hands. The information which I have gathered upon the subjects enumerated in your circular, has been collected at different periods, and at a season when my professional engagements leave me but few spare hours to devote to other employments; and you will, consequently, perceive a great lack of order in the compilation which I have made. This deficiency, you will feel yourself at liberty to supply, by a better and more systematic arrangement. I have reserved for this communication what information 1 possess, upon the "state of the weather, &c" as also some additional remarks, which may be necessary for the better understanding of my estimates.

The mean quantity of rain which fell I have no means of ascertain ing. I indian corn is the great staple production of Princess Anne, and there has been a rapid increase in the crop for the past five years. The crop of 1848, as compared with 1844, will, I am conscious, exhibit a difference in favor of the former year of 30 per cent and this increase is the result of an improved system of culture, and the great demand for this element of food, in consequence of the repeated failure of the crops of the old world. In March, 1847,the price of corn ranged in the Norfolk market from 80 cents to                                                                                                                                                             $1.25 per bushel; and, although immense quantities were poured in from the rich lands of Carolina, and from the counties across the Chesapeake, yet the supply was not equal to the demand. I n consequence of this extraordinary call for I indian corn, greater attention was bestowed upon the crop, and wider breadths were seemed in the spring of 1847. But the European crops of '47 turned out to be heavy; the sliding scale of duties was imposed upon the grain by the British government, and the price of corn declined to 60 cents. N notwithstanding the dec lesion, the crop seemed in April last was larger than the preceding, and will exhibit a considerable per cent. increase. I have placed the increase at five per cent, which I think is a fair estimate. The fodder is now housed, and the corn crop placed beyond the probability of serious damage from wind or flood; and I hazard nothing in saying that, notwithstanding the prevailing dry weather in the growing season, the crop of I indian corn for 1848 is the heaviest, and most productive, which has been grown in the county for the last twenty years.

Oatsthe crop of oats has decreased in quantity for the past three or four years, as rapidly as the crop of corn has increased. The protracted drought of the growing season, made the present crop very short, and the 5 per cent, given in the accompanying table, is a very liberal estimate. The quick growth of the o at crop exhausts the land to such a degree that it is becoming exceedingly unpopular; and this, together with the ascertained cost of raising, has materially contributed to its decrease.

There are some fine wheat lands in the county lands which may compare with any in the wheat growing counties for productive ness. But, in the main, the soil is rather light and sandy for its general cultivation. The early red and purple straw, are considered the most productive varieties, and the average yield, as marked in the table, may be set down at about 10 bushels per acre. The samples which you kindly furnished me with I have placed in the hands of gentlemen who are engaged in the culture of this grain, and whose lands are suitable to its growth. I hope during the ensuing summer to give you the result of these plantings.

While the foregoing estimates speak but poorly for the condition of our agricultural affairs, they teach us that the corn crop is the most valuable, and the o at crop the most worthless. Cattlewe cannot boast any valuable varieties. Some unsuccessful attempts have been made to introduce the Durham and pureAyreshire breed, but our stock remains the old "pine barren" race which has grown among us for the last century. And yet large numbers of cattle are annually raised in Princess Anne. The county cannot be classed as a grazing county; but vast marshes of luxuriant grass skirt the ocean near the line which divides Virginia and North Carolina, and to these marshes herds of cattle are driven in the fall months, and left to winter. They usually thrive without any extra feeding, and are driven home fat during the ensuing summer. The city of Norfolk being an important naval depot, is necessarily a large beef market; and the cattle thus raised are sent upon the hoof to the city butchers, who slaughter for city and naval supplies. A cow which will net 300 pounds, X. 
475vwill command                                                                                                                                                                              $15; and a steer of 600 pounds weight will sell for                                  $30, being just 5 cents per pound; which is the average marked in my sheet of estimates. The cost of raising cattle upon the marshes is very small. It is true that casualties sometimes occur which seriously affect the interest of the cattle breeder. In March, 1845, a violent storm prevailed for two days, and the waters of the Atlantic burst their prescribed bounds, in undated all the marshes, and indeed passed, for several miles, over the high lands. It is estimated that 2,500 or 3000 head of cattle perished in this storm, beside large numbers of sheep and swine. The labor of years was thus swept away in a moment, and the energies of some of our enterprising citizens partially paralyzed. Horses, hogs, sheep, cattle, poultry, &c, were drowned in the farm yards, at a distance of two miles from the ocean; and even families were compelled to retreat to the upper stories of their dwellings to save themselves from the advancing flood. Such a calamity, however, had no precedent in the memory of " the oldest inhabitant" and possibly w' l not befall us again during the next century. While, then, a visitation of the above nature may blast the fruits of industry, and the hard winters may destroy, annually, a portion of cattle sent to the marshes, and thus reduce the net gain, I incline to the opinion that this mode of rearing cattle is exceedingly profitable. The wages of labor have marked mechanics at                                                                                                                                                             $1 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.50pert die m and board; agricultural laborers, at                            $5 per month and board; female domestics, at                                               $2 to                                               $2.50 per month and board. The adult male slave hires, during the present year, at              $70 to                        $80 per annum; to which we must add his board, clothes, taxes, &c, which will amount to at least                            $45 more. Assuming              $70 as the maximum hire, the cost of the male slave reaches      $9 71 2 per month; and this sum is given for a class of laborers notoriously indolent, and who perform at least one third less work than the white laborer. The female slave hires at                                    $40 to                             $55, which, at the lowest estimate, brings their hire at             $7 per month. The slave is not exposed to wind or weather more than the white laborer, and there is no reduction from the hire of the former by reason of sickness or casualties; which circumstance sometimes makes a very great addition to the real expense of the slave. I should be pleased to write down a few reflections upon the comparative value of slave and white labor; but I am reminded that such a course would possibly involve a question of political ethics; the discussion of which would be inappropriate in a paper of this character. I, therefore, dismiss this branch of inquiry. Probable proportion of cultivated to uncultivated lands n my last report to the On. Commissioner, I represented 121 per cent as the probable proportion of cultivated to uncultivated land. Under the head of " uncultivated" I, of course, classed marshes, swamps, forests, sands, &c, and all other places not under tillage. I thought the per cent. a fair one; but a judicious friend, whose judgment may always be relied upon, suggests 20 per cent. as a nearer approximation to the truth. I have, in the present instance476Ex. adopted his view upon this subject; and you will find the latter figure placed against the question of cultivated and uncultivated land. The pea crop is increasing. At the final sloughing of the corn crop, the land between the rows is sown broad cast with the cornfield pea. This crop shades and improves the land, and produces a fine yield. The pea is sold for about 70 cents per bushel; but the process of picking is so very slow that but few more are saved than may be necessary for the succeeding crop. Enough to seed the land are housed; and, after the corn is harvested, the hogs a returned in upon the remnant of the crop, which is speedily devoured, to the manifest improvement of the gaunters. The corn which, but for the pea crop, would necessarily be consumed by the hogs, is thus saved to the farmer, and the pea becomes a subject of profitable culture. Dogs are raised by the owners of oak and beech lands, with but little expense in those years which are termed "4 good mast years that is, when there is a large yield of a corns, beech nuts, andchinquepins. During these "mast years" the hogs are suffered to go at large, until they become fat, when they are butchered from the .woods. An opinion prevails that, if swine are fat upon the mast, they decrease in weight if put up and fed upon corn or peas. Hence, they are slaughtered while at liberty in the forests. The pork thus raised is easily detected by the purchaser, from its flabby and soft appearance, and sells at                                                                                                                                                             $1.50 per hundred less than cord fed pork. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to extend this communication. I appreciate your noble desire to furnish the country with a faithful portrait of its actual condition; and regard the annual report of the United States Patent Office as one of the most interesting and valuable publications of the republic. Whatever of information  may possess upon those subjects which you have made matters of inquiry is at your disposal. That information is so very limited, that it will hardly pay you for the perusal. Limited, however, as it is, I venture to forward it for your inspection; and, while I cannot claim for my estimates the merit of entire correctness, I am persuaded that they approach very nearly to the truth. I shall be pleased at all times to give you any assistance in my power, relative to the agricultural and other statistics of the county, and hope you will feel yourself at liberty to command my services. With sentiments of respect, I remain, very respectfully, yourscROBERT B. Hall. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents, Washington, D. C. X. a. Southampton County, Of    Rgi Of A, December 4, 1847. Dear Of R: I have been so occupied that my attention to your circular has been delayed to a later period than I designed, but so meager is this detail I have to give that it can be of no moment. Permit me, in the outset, to return my thanks for your report of 1847. Such is the varied and useful matter disseminated thereby, that it cannot fail to be of great service to the agricultural community. I am under further obligation for a package of seed, especially the little parcels of wheat; they have been sown, vegetated well, and look promising. Having premised this much, 1 proceed, to the best of my ability, to respond to your injuries so far as they relate to our staple products of the present year as contrasted with the crop of 1847. The indian corn, or maize crop, came in very well, and at an advance of 15 per cent. on the crop of last year; yet the arable product will make a beggarly exhibit, not being able to place it higher than 10 bushels per acre. Of course, those who have considered 15 bushels per acre the smallest quantity that would pay the expense of tillage, must conclude we are on the high road to pauper ism nevertheless, our population subsists in great comfort. The season with us for planting the maize crop, is from the 25th of March to the 1st of May, depending on the peculiarity of the soil and state of preparation, though the crop will mature on good ground if put in by the 1st of June. Last spring was cold and backward. In June we had an excess of rain, which was very injurious, but in 'the month of July, the season was peculiarly auspicious, and crops improved rapidly. About the middle of August, when the corn crop no longer stood in need of genial showers, a remarkable drought set in, which continues even at this time the farmer now finding it difficult to get his corn converted into meal, the mills all being still for want of water. The pea crop has proved uncommonly short, not more than half an average crop, and 25 per cent. below the crop of last year. <a name="potatoes107"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, (sweet) contrary to all expectation, came in well. The general impression was, that the drought, so fatal to peas, must seriously affect <a name="potatoes108"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. But a full average crop has been gathered in, being 25 per cent. less than the crop of last year, which was injured by an excess of rain. The <a name="potato52"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop varies from one to two hundred and fifty bushels per acre, depending on the adaptation of the soil, and pains taken to prepare and fertilizes it. The wheat crop was good, though I can give no advance on the crop of last year. The spring and early part of the summer were highly auspicious to the healthy condition of this plant, preserving it free from disease. The merry was consequently good, with some more straw, but the heads are shorter than last year; the average product not exceeding that of 1847, which I set down six bushels per acre, bearing in mind that I speak only of my own county. One bushel of seed per acre is the quantity most usually put in the ground. The variety mostly cultivated is a red bearded wheat, with us called478Ex. the golden chaff. The red May was growing into favor, but it lost reputation in consequence of great injury in 1845 by a late frost, which nearly destroyed the crop by reason of its early maturity. The white flint and purple straw have been sufficiently tried and discarded. The o at crop was nearly a failure, from some cause, probably the cold spring. There was generally a thin crop on the land, and about the season for crawling, we had a gale which so prostrated the crop that few attempted to save more than seed. Of apples we had a good average crop. As to agricultural societies or clubs, we have no such machinery, and I fear it will be a long time before we shall. The last attempt at a society proved a signal failure. As a beginning, clubs would probably do better; and if once well established, they might lead to an organized society. We farm it in a manner so very promiscuous that it would be difficult to give, with any accuracy, the cost per bushel of corn or wheat; but it is the generally received opinion among us that less than 50 cents for corn, and 80 or 85 for wheat will not remuneratethe farmer for the time and capital employed. As to individual consumption of bread stuffs and meat, the best guide to an answer is to be found in the usual estimate per annum for an able bodied laborer; that is to say, three barrels of corn and two hundred and fifty pounds of well cured bacon, seldom using either beef or pork. About this quantity is usually portioned out to slaves in weekly allowances. There families are provided for, the quantity is graduated according to the number and size of the children. 1 incline to the opinion that peas and <a name="potatoes109"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> substitute from a fourth to one third the allowance of bread. With regard to the portion of our land annually put under tillage, I think I cannot be very wide of the mark when I set it down at one fifth, bearing in mind that our population, for the most part, cultivate on the two field system, being alternately in corn and peas, and the scant crop of herb age which nature may put forth, without any attention whatever, unless it is in a few rare cases, to the cultivation of artificial grasses. Therefore, it is not to be wondered that our lands are reduced to a low state of production. But a better day is dawning upon us. The people have waked up to the importance of maturing. Such use, is now being made of top soil and much, carried either through the farm pen, or directly from their locality, and spread broadcast upon the land. With considerations of great respect, yours, J. Of . Massenburg, Jerusalem post office. Honorable E. Burke. Home) Warren County, November 28, 1848. Of R: In reply to the circular of queried from the Patent Office, 1848, I make the' following answer x. a. 479 The wheat crop is estimated at 15 per cent. better than the crop of 1847, owing to the favorable season, more fallow ground being sown, and less corn ground, and but few Hessian flies. The average quantity of seed per acre will be a shade over 1 bushel per acre. Such the largest number of farmers sow but 1 bushel; another portion sow 11 bushel; and still a smaller number sow 1 bushel. Time of sowing varies from 20th August to 20th October, and sometimes early in November. The time mostly preferred is from 1 5th September to 15th October. Harvest commences about 22d June; the May wheat and Mediterranean wheat some eight or ten days earlier. The average this year is estimated at 8 bushels per acre. Price, 80 cents per bushel and from 20 to 30 per cent. consumed where raised. The kinds of wheat said to be most successful are the Georgia, Mediterranean, Blue Item, Zimmerman, White Blue Item, Newyork, Genesee, Golden Straw, Holland, and Eturian; the Georgia, White Blue Item, Zimmerman and Eturian but recently introduced into this county. I I had 31 ounces of Eturian wheat presented to me last fall, which yielded 32 for one, besides a loss of more than my seed in the field and barn. The soil most successful for raising wheat is the river bottom, limestone lands, clay lands mixed with limestone and the round sandstone, and the body of land generally between the limestone land and slate lands. Barleynone raised in this section of the country, unless very small quantities of spring barley as experiments, of which I do not know the result. Oats is 121 per cent. better than 1847, owing, probably, to late sowing. The early sowing nearly a failure. Average seed per acre, 1 bushels; 15 bushels average crop. Price, from 25 to 30 cents per bushel. All consumed where raised. Time of sowing, from 1st of March to 1st of May. Time of cutting, 10th July to August. Kinds most preferred are the <a name="potato53"><mark>Potato</mark></a>, Iberian, and small black oats. Eye about equal to last year. Very little sown; un productive cause not known; 1 bushel of seed to the acre in many places not producing more than the seed to the acre. I immediately under the mountain, and a few more favored spots, the product is better. Price, about 50 cents per bushel; all consumed in the county. Time of sowing, 1st of August to 15th of November. Time of harvesting, 15th to 20th June. The large white rye used to be preferred. Buckwheat equal to last year, but less sown. Time of sowing, from 12th June to 15th July; -bushel seed to the acre; average, 20 bushels to the acre. Price, 40 cents per bushel. All consumed in the county. I indian corn is estimated at 25 per cent. better is quantity and quality; cause, favorable season, winter sloughing of lands for crop, and good tillage. The average quantity of seed planted to the acre varies much, say from 1 'to 2 gallons. Average per acre480Ex. Doc.  No. 59.this year, 25 bushels. Price, 35 cents per bushel, delivered. About 80 per cent. consumed where raised. Time of planting, 9th April to 15th May. Commence cutting up corn about 15th Septembershuck and, house, last of October, November and December. The, white and yellow varieties are planted; for home consumption the white is preferred; the yellow is preferred for distant markets. The river bottom, a sandy loam, is preferred for corn. In the improved upland, with a fair season, we I take nearly as much corn peri acre as on the bottom. Sweet potatoes But few raised; about 1 bushel of seed per acre product per acre, supposed 120 bushels. This result is only estimated from small patches. Price, 75 cents to                                                                                                                                                             $1 per bushel. All consumed in the county. Planted about 10th April; harvested latter part of August, September and October. Spanish and Paroling red most successful. Soil, rich sand or rich gravely lands. Common <a name="potatoes110"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, about 25 per cent. less; probable cause, early season not so favorable; 10 bushels seed average per acre; product, about 100 bushels per acre. Price, 50 cents per bushel; 80 percent. consumed where raised. Planting, from 1st March to 21stJune; harvesting, 15th June to 15th October. The kinds most successful are Verser, Pink Eye, Round Blue, Carolina Blue, Loan, London Lady, Blue Eyes, &c. Rich sandy loam is probably the best for <a name="potatoes111"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; a poor sandy or light soil, well manured with half rotted barn yard manure, ploughed in, with a favorable season, will produce good <a name="potatoes112"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Previous to harvesting the <a name="potato54"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, there has been but little complaint of the <a name="potato55"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot. The cause of the rot I cannot account for. Thomas F. Luck, e squire, planted part of his crop of <a name="potatoes113"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in new ground about the 15th of June, protected on the north and west by a large body of wood land on the south and east, grass and wheat, and about a quarter of a mile from the South river. Any of his <a name="potatoes114"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were found rotten in the hill early in the season. Part of his seed <a name="potatoes115"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was procured from me. I planted of the same seed 10th of June, in sandy loam, between rows of water melons, cucumbers and muskmelons; corn on the east, north and west; south shaded by a chestnut tree; and in the range of the shade of the chestnut tree I found five rotten <a name="potatoes116"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, that part of the ground being moister than the other part. These, and one rotten <a name="potato56"><mark>potato</mark></a> found in another patch, were all the rotten <a name="potatoes117"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> found in my crop of about 100 bushels. Part of my <a name="potato57"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was planted in ground that had been planted in <a name="potatoes118"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the last season, where nearly one half of the <a name="potatoes119"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted before taking up. A part planted in ground that had been planted in I indian corn and broom corn the year before, all contiguous, planted at the same time, manured and cultivated alike, no difference perceptible, only that the <a name="potatoes120"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were smaller and more of them, and not a rotten <a name="potato58"><mark>potato</mark></a> amongst them. The <a name="potatoes121"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were shaded by a few apple trees and twenty rows of corn on the east; on the south, wheat; and west, rye; on the north, a few cherry trees, plum and dams on trees; a limestone clay soil, with small round sandstone.

Very respectfully, yours, &cJOSEPH S. Spengler. Of on. Edmunda Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Morri Ssani A, Amhurst County, November 13, 1848. Dear Of R: In answer to the circular you sent me I Will proceed to give such iifformatibn as I possess. Tobacco, Heat, and corn, are our principal crops; and, as the increase or decrease of the crops of the present year compared with those of the year 1847 is the first of your queried, I will proceed to answer it as far as my limited information extends. Tobacco is, I suppose, the most important crop to this section of the State, (though in this county wheat would rank first) yet in the adjoining counties of Tucking ham, Appomattox, and Campbell, tobacco yields the greater revenue, and to the town of Lynchburgh is of much greater importance, as this town has the third largest inspection in this State, and perhaps is the largest in the manufacture of this article. The crop of tobacco made in Virginia in the year 1847 was far below the average, being only about 36,000 hogs head; but this was not owing to the seasons, but principally to the price of corn for exportation, which induced the planters to reduce their tobacco crop and increase that of corn. From the best information I can obtain, the tobacco made this year in Virginia will not much exceed that of 1847, as the season for planting was unfavorable, and the crop consequently late. I suppose the quantity made will not exceed 40,000 hogs heads. The wheat crop of this year is large in quantity, and of excellent quality, perhaps equal to any ever grown in Virginia, and would have been still larger, but for the highest fresh et in James river which has occurred since the year 1795, and several hail storms in the month of May, which destroyed the wheat in many localities. The corn crop of the present year is, I suppose, above an average one, but at least one third less than the crop of 1847, which was perhaps the largest ever grown in Virginia. This was owing to the high price this grain sold for in the fall of 1846 and spring of 1847, which induced many planters to curtail their tobacco crop and put their best land in corn; and, in addition, there was a plentiful supply of rain during the corn growing season. As there is no agricultural society in this county nor in this section of the State that I can give any information about, I Will484ex ' D .d. 59 proceed to your next inquiry of the state of the weather at, planting season, &c. Tlthe first crop we plant is 6 can, as <a name="potatoes125"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, peas &c, are only grown for family use. We usually commence about the first of. April to plant our corn, and there is scarcely ever any difficulty about the season. Sometimes it is cut down by a late frost; butt his does not injure the crop, as it soon springs up again and grows as vigorously as ever; nor does this crop require much rain until July; and during this month and August frequent and plentiful showers are necessary to cause a large yield. For planting tobacco, however, it is quite different, and rain insufficient quantities thoroughly to we the ground is then necessary. The best time for setting tobacco plants is from the 1st to 10th of June, but frequently this is done as. early as the 20th ofM3ay, and sometimes as late as July. 1 the present year there was, a plenty of rain for planting tobacco in  Of ; but the month of June was dry; consequently much of the tobacco :was planted in oily, and, therefore, the crop will b less the ann average one he usually co m men ce sowing wheat between the 20th September and 1st October, and finish between: the 1st and 10th November. This fall has g been very dry for seeing, and those who did not :nail themselves of the wet weather in July to break up their c lover fields, found it difficult afterwards to fallow; yet there has been an average crop sown. The crops of the present year have sustained& but little injury from blight or insects; some of the late wheat was destroyed by rust, but much less than usual; indeed, the quantity was so small as to be scarcely worth noticing, and the ravages of the Hessian fly were inconsiderable. A new enemy to the wheat has made its appearance, in that sowed this fall; I mean the g rub worm, which has entirely destroyed the wheat in some places and red end re, sowing necessary; and as this fall is the first time I have ever seen the wheat injured by -the g rub worm, I thought t it well to mention it, though the injury done is scarcely sufficiently extensive to make it a subject of serious comment. Your next inquiry; the cost of raising wheat, corn, &c, is one of great difficulty, and one on which but few farmers would agree for the different qualities of land and the various crops made at the same time, would cause different estimates to be made I he, however, paid considerable attention to the subject, and from calculation and reflection, I have come to the conclusion that on lands which will produce from ten to fifteen bushels per acre, the average cost of raising wheat in this county (if it were a certain crop) is about 40 cents per bushel; but as it is liable to so many casualties, such as rust, fly, and falling before it is ripe, that at least 50 per cent. should be added, and, taking ten years together, that the cost of production will be from 60 to 65 cents per bushel. Worn is a much more certain crop, is not liable to fall or to rust, suffers but little from insects, and yields double the quantity that wheat will to the acre; yet requires much more labor in its cult ix, 
485yation. I will, therefore, put the cost of making corn on good land at 40 cents per bushel, taking ten year together. Tobacco is a very laborious crop, and its average cost cannot be less than                         $4 per hundred to the planter. The last inquiry which you make, "the probable consumption per individual of wheat, &c, I indian corn, <a name="potatoes126"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, beef, &c" I will now proceed to notice. I indian corn is the chief article of bread stuffs we use in our families. It is food for the master and for the; slave; for the horse, the cow, the how, and for the poultry; and even the wealthiest persons use it at almost every meal. I suppose, the quantity used on an estate, including that fed to stock, &c, is from 30 to 35 bushels to every man, woman, and child. But little wheat is used, perhaps not exceeding an average of three bushels for each member of the family, both white and black. <a name="potatoes127"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> are only raised for family use. Each family of negroes has its own garden, and raise both sweet and round <a name="potatoes128"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> without stint or measure. They are very fond of the sweet, but not generally of the round or I wish <a name="potato60"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Not much beef is used on our estates. The old cattle are fattened and used by the family, and some of the young for early beef; so, also, as it regards mutton and lambs. Bacon, however, is used much more freely, three pounds per week being the usual allowance. The slaves also raise as many fowls as they .please, which they eat or sell as they think proper, and all the milk not used by the white family; and as no cheese is made, and few sell butter, the quantity of milk used by the slaves is frequently considerable. Having replied to most of your queried, permit me to notice a few subjects which I consider of importance to agriculturists; and first, as to the appearance of wheat when in the best state for cutting. Some years ago, I cut several heads of wheat, in what is usually called the dough state; two days afterwards, I cut several more heads, which had turned yellow from one to two inches under the head; and two days afterwards, several more, when the straw was yellow its whole length. After all were thoroughly dry, I weighed each parcel carefully. The first cutting was five percent. lighter than either of the others, and the two last were of the same weight; the second cutting had much the best appearance. I therefore concluded that, when the straw became yellow under the head, though the remainder was green, that it was in the best state for reaping. I am aware that in this opinion I differ with many persons, most of whom contend that wheat in the dough state ought to be cut and an English farmer contended it ought to be cut some 14 or 16 days before it turned yellow, and gave his experiments, which were published in most of the agricultural papers; yet I am satisfied from the experiment which I made, that if cut before the straw turned yellow under the head, the wheat will lose, in weight, and if cut as advised by the English farmer, that the whole will be sacrificed. Of t is the general opinion that tobacco exhausts land more than x. gray other crop. Now, I differ entirely from this general opinion, and believe that corn exhausts the soil much more than tobacco. It is usual for a planter to have his tobacco lots on which he parts all his manure; and the balance of his land is hard worked and hard grazed, and becomes poor. Now, let him change his system, manure his poor land for tobacco, put his old tobacco lots in corn and wheat, and sow c lover on his wheat and use plaster freely, and he will make more tobacco, more corn, and morevkeat; and his land will improve. It is true, that if you put the mane land several years together in tobacco, that the food of that plant will be exhausted and you a must manure, and it is the same with corn and wheat; but adopt a rotation of crops, and give the attd rest, and it will improve. It is a fact known to all planters, tcid127at wheat grows much better after tobacco than after cornthatAt least one third more may be expected after the former than after tie latter crop. I s not this proof that corn exhausts the soil more than tobacco? It may be said that the cultivation of tobacco pere is the land better than the corn crop; but both may be worked alike and the same results will follow. The number of fields or shifts on an estate is also a subject on which great difference of opinion exists some persons contendfcid127r the three field, some for four, some for five, and some for the six did system. Upon high lands, I believe the six field system is the ha est: first, corn or tobacco; second, wheat dr oats, with clever third, c lover; fourth, c lover; fifth, wheat; and sixth, c lover. The reasons why I prefer this system are, that the land improves faster ad you get clear of the cockle and cheat which spring up on ac lover fallow of the first year. Upon low grounds I prefer the three field: first, corn or tobacco; second, wheat or oats, with c lover; fifth, c lover; and under this system the land will improve rapidly, and is too valuable to give more rest. Respectfully yours, Of Of . G. Morri Of. Bucki Ngham County, Of    Rgi Of A, November, 1848. Dear Of R: ll health, together with some time necessary to make inquiries and compare opinions with others to aid my limited information, has delayed my responding to the queried in your circular. Accuracy, although very desirable, cannot be expected upon subjects having no fixed data to found correct opinions upon, however, with pleasure proceed to give my crude opinions and estimates in reply to the various topics in your circular, endeavcid127ring to approximate probable accuracy. First as to the probable increase or decrease per cent age of the w heat crop this current year, as compared with the crop of 1847. The crop the present year is greatly superior to any crop made n. Virginia for several years past, both in quantity and quality. I climate fully 33 A increase per cent age over the crop of 1847, which x. a. 487 you estimate in your last report at 12,000,000; with my estimate the present years increase will make 16,000,000 bushels. You request to be informed the cost of growing a bushel of what. I reply as follows, making my estimate upon an acre of land, and give you the average bushels and the cost.

Heat of late years has become a delicate and uncertain crop, subject to the fly, rust and mildew. To guard against the former, many farmers delay seeing till about the 25th September; no remedy known among us for rust and mildew. You ask my opinion of your estimated consumption of wheat-three and a half bushels per head, of all free persons? It does seem to me too low, especially in the free States, where but little worn bread is eaten; and in the slave States you allow our negroes none. It is very true, they are fed mainly upon corn bread, which they much prefer; still they enter largely in the consumption of wheat, for most masters supply their slaves with wheat flour at Christmas, Master, Whitsuntide, when they get married, and in all cases of sickness. I need, when great drought prevails, and the corn crop proves short, many farmers consume a large portion f their wheat, rather than buy corn, which, in such seasons, is at a high price. I also regard your estimate of five bushels corn to each heacid127d, white and black, much too low. I respectfully suggest that you extend it to ten bushels to all the slave population; ten bushels of corn, well ground, will make twelve bushels of meal, which gives per head the week little less than a peck; small children will nm that a pack, but what they do not eat they will waste! Negroesae not satisfied with enough, they all require some for waste; besides, they have their poultry and a dog to feed; moreover, a peck per week is not sufficient for a man; I own many that will cocid127sume a half bushel a week, having their three regular meals a day. Your estimated consumption of corn to some domestic animals is greatly below their consumption, to wit: horses, five bushels per head. I verily believe every riding and work horse in this Stateconsumes thirty bushels of corn per head per annum, and less .will not sustain a work horse to do good labor. An exception may be made as to a horse of our poorest people, who buy a poor old hors 488. E Toe Mob. 59.in the spring, and when i inter approaches and the grass dies, why, he dies also; such cattle do not enter into this calculation. Coulcid127it be done, I would abstract brood mares and colts from the whole number (5 289 516) horses, as they are mainly kept upon cut oats corn is considered too rich and heating for colts, renders their legs meal y, and hoofs soft and spongy. Your consumption of corn by hogs is also five bushels per head. I have raised hogs fifty-seven years, and the lowest estimate' I ever made was ten bushels per head to raise and fatten in and very often twelve and a half bushels, according to their condition when put up to fat. The corn crop of 1847 I judge to be the largest ever made in Virginia; more ground was planted seasons very favorable. I think it probable that there is now remaining nearly enough for another years consumption. Still, the crop of the present year which is a very good one, must be rated less, as less was planted, and season not as favorable; I am inclined to rate the decrease at fifteen per cent. It is now a ascertained that the crop of tobacco of 1847 is 15,000hogsheads less than the crop of 1846. The season for planting, May and June, in many districts was very dry, which delayed setting out plants till July, consequently a late crop, and not time for the plants to mature before frost. The <a name="potato61"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is very good, both long and round; and I hear no complaint of rot in the round <a name="potato62"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The o at crop is a fair average say 20 bushels to the acre. I tis not a market crop. The best land is seemed in wheat, and the most exhausted in oats. Eye and barley are not cultivated anywhere in my knowledge. Very few indeed raise buckwheat raise enough for breakfast cakes and to feed poultry. It isa grain too much neglected, yields well, 30 to 40 bushels per acre, but a great exhaust or of land when harvested. A good i green fallow, when prostrated by a heavy roller, and well turned under with a Livingston plough. The root crop is not fashionable with us further than for family use. The turn in, the great. crop of England as an improved food for sheep, is very scarcely cultivated, and in this climate is very uncertain from the attacks of the fly before the plants put out the rough leaf. We substitute pump king, a richer food, for all our domestic animals, by planting them with our corn every fifth row, and planting thirty feet apart along the row. We obtain them without any extra cultivation, and believe the corn sustains no injury. They can be kept very well if housed before a frost, aid packed in layers, with dry wheat straw, in the barn, so that they do not touch one another. I have packed away about forty wagon loads, and have fed them daily, since the 10th of October, to swine for slaughter, much cows, and work oxen. I have cultivated this year about the one-fourth of an acre in angel Wurtzel. The crop not weighed, but the yield very good, X. 9
489the roots weighing 10 and 12 pounds. The pump kin, I think equallynutritious, and the stock rather prefer them. I My knowledge of agricultural societies is very limited and necessarily so to our reproach, as we have very few in the State. There is, and has been for many years, a very respectable agricultural club at Charlottesville, Albemarle county; but who' are the officers, the state of their funds, &c, I cannot inform you. Your address to Colonel Thomas Jefferson Randolph, would obtain the information you desire. There is the Men rico Club, who hold their sessions i Richmond, and I think General William Richards is the president. By reference to the Southern Planter, I see a communication to the editor, signed E.  Herbert, advising that a club was formed in Princess Inn county, at Level green. I hear of another, called Le e and Corner. For further information, I refer you to the On. Wider Head: We formerly had a club in this county, from which anticipated favorable results' but from want of public spirit, an an unfortunate bickering in awardingpremiums, i wet wen down. Such subjects, dependent upon incid127dividual donations, flourish but for a season. I consider agricultural societies second only to public education, and that it would by a wise policy to establish one by law in every county of the, Union, with an adequate capital levied upon the tax able property of the county. As to the remaining queried in your r circular, I must answer negatively, not possessing the information required. Your goodness will pardon my comments upon your estimated consumption of corn and wheat. They are submitted in all due respect and candor, trusting and believing that, under your administration, the Patent Office is now the most valuable public institution in the country. It is all that Congress bestows upon the great agricultural class. I hope they will extend the publication of more copies. It is a document read with more in true ion and p lea urea nd more sought after, than every other document emanating from that honorable body. With high consideration, I am, very respectfully, yours, Chas. Taney. The On. Edmund Burke . Commissioner of Patents. Ussx Court House, Of, November 28, 1848. Deacid127) Of R: I return you my thanks for the copy of your last report made to Congress, which you were pleased to send me. 1 have, in compliance with your request, taken some little trouble upon myself this year, in order to ascertain, as near as I could, the amount of the different crops raised in the county of Sussex in 1848; though the period at which you require the several reports to be made to your department is too early to ascertain with exact x. certainty, (as by the first of December few farmers have housed their corn, gotten out their entire crop of wheat and oats, picked art their cotton, or killed their pork) I have, therefore, had to rely upon something like guess work, assisted by those to whom I he applied; and I am pretty certain that, if I have erred in my statistics, I have erred on the safe side. I have taken for my basis school district No. 3, in which I reside the city of Sussex is said to contain 592 square miles, and is said off into nineteen school districts, which gives to each district19941acres of land; one-fourth of which I will say is in cultivation of the different crops annually. The third school district contains thirty families, though there ate several of them who cultivate most of their crops out, of the district; and there are also included in the number five families of free negroes, who make but little of any kind of crops. These thirty 'farmers in 1848 made 4,113 barrels I indian corn, 1,326bjishels wheat, 4,800 bushels oats, 177,800 pounds seed cotton, I i 50 bushels peas, 65 3 gallons apple brandy, 83,600 pounds pork. I have said nothing about root crops, blade and top fodder, straw c, which is very considerable. There are two farmers' or agricultural clubs in this county, namely, The Sole and Soons Club No. 1; formed in June, 1847,3Behj. W. Belschis, president, Victor M. Up pes, secretary; post office address, Hawkinsville, Sussex county; twelve members; no premium as yet paid. I am informed that, though this club is yet n. its infancy, much good has been effected in its vicinity. Thesouth Side Club, formed in June, 1848; William Horn ton, president, John T. J. Mason, secretary; post office, Sussex Court House ten members. This club has bee of too recently formed to judge of it' effects. I have no doubt, if these clubs were formed in the true agricultural spirit, and were conducted upon that principle, that they would be productive of much good in stimulating the farmer to greater exertions in the improvement and cultivation of his farm. Slave labor is altogether used in the cultivation of our farms, and they are hired by the year; and the average price per year for pale hands is about                         $60; for females and boys, from                                                       $25 to                                   $30. The wages of mechanics are from 50 cents to                                                                                                                                                             $1.25 per day. The price cf transportation to market about 25 cents per 100 pounds. Our lands are generally poor and very much worn, though they are susceptible of great improvement, and many of the farmers have turned their attention to improving their lands with mary, lime, gun no, and other manures. But we are too extravagant; and as long as pride, fashion, and extravagance prevails amongst us, we are destined to be a poor people. To give you some idea of our economy, the county of Sussex pays a revenue tax of about                          $3,300, and the assessed value of please carriages in the county the present year amounts to upward soft 35,000.

Dear Of R: The principal crop of this region, wheat, has been unusually abundant the past season, and of superior quality, I                                                                                                                                                             $195,3            $7 D0251m4 0027,360 0 9 97 5 0042,2 re 44,442 1579,4,26                           $383, 985FI :::I _a_ -a' (did 127- :I it! J. . i492Ex. have obtained from owners of threshing i machines the amouintthreshed in this neighborhood, over an area three miles wide and five miles long, containing, of course, 15 square miles. I find this amount to be in round number 17,000 bushels =a= 1, 133 1 bushels per square mile. The remaining portion of the county will have yielded less wheat in proportion; but I think the average will not be less than 800 bushels. We have now 82 square miles in this county, and, at the above estimate, the production of the wheat will be 65,600 bushels. From the census of 1840, and the best judgment I can form of the present number of inhabitants, I would put this number down at 50 to the square mile 4,100 in the whole county. From careful estimates based upon observed facts, I should set down as the annual consumption of each inhabitant 4 bushels. This will give18i450 bushels as the amount used 1 for food. Of to this we add 2 200 bushels as the amount used for seed, we shall have 20,650bushels, which, taken from the entire product, 65,600, will leave 449 50 bushels for exportation. The above estimates will apply without material alteration to the contiguous portion of Ohio county, embracing, say, 100 square miles. For the counties west and south of this district, a large reduction, probably one half, must be made in the estimate of the product of wheat. The estimate of 4- bushels of wheat, or one barrel of flout r, as the annual consumption of each inhabitant, will by no means apply to the southern part of this State; neither will it apply to Kentucky; nor, indeed, to any of those States in which   indian corn forms the chief bread stuff. In this region, wheat being the principal grain crop, wheat bread is almost exclusively used; and I am certain that the consumption is not less than 4.bushels of wheat to each individual. <a name="potatoes129"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> have never been very largely cultivated in this quarter, and are much less so at present, owing to the uncertainty of the crop. This as, adds to the consumption of wheat. The early <a name="potatoes130"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> last season were unusually fine, the late ones inferior, and prone to rot in the ground. Such as were left, however, by the disease, appear to keep well thus far. The disease appears to be as yet a mystery, nor has any remedy yet been discovered, unless it be found in the plan lately recommended in Germany to stop the exuberant growth of the stem by cutting of occasionally an inch: or so of its extremity. A very large amount of I indian corn is produced in this quartercid127jbut it is all consumed at home, in feeding hogs, sheep, horses, and cattle, in our restricted . American use of this word. I should estimate the cost of raising I indian corn here at 20 cents per bushel, and that of wheat at 62 cents. The spring, summer, and autumn of 1848, were in this region remarkably cool and shower y. The showers, though frequent, were light, and the amount of rain has not been much above theP18546, in 1840, as per cent s in Rook e oontyEX. ,to co No. 59.493average quantity, ,I think, of former years. Pasturage and meadows were unusually fine; but much hay was injured by the rains. During wheat had est the weather was. more favorable, and this crop was secured in good order. The weather here during the winter thus far has been exceeding variable, un seasonable, warm, and r, any; but little snow, much freezing and thawing, so ,that the, wheat now in the ground has been already much injured. The crops during last season were unusually free from insects, blight, and rust. The number of horses in this county, as I have ascertained from the books of the commissioner of the county, is 1,182. There is a large number of cattle in the county; but I have no means oft determining : ' ' t. We leave here also an immense number of sheep, The number reported in 1840, was 33,948. Since this time the county has been divided; but within the same limits the number, I presume, is now not less than 50,000. This region has the credit of furnishing the finest wool in the United States. The have an agricultural society here called the "rook e and Ohiocounty Agricultural Society." It is small, and its resources limited; It meets annually at West Liberty, and distributes prizes to the amount, probably, of f                                     $50.: The president is Samuel Kitchen, and the; office of corresponding secretary was committed to me.

Kinds most successfully raised, the yellow bark, this variety being the only sale able one the Spanish is most preferred for home consumption; about ten per cent. of the crop consumed at home; price 40 cents. The sweet potato e is largely cultivated near our navigable waters, and constitutes the most profitable crop raised with us. During the months of September and October, large quantities ar, e purchased at our landings by northern traders, and taken to all the accessible markets on the coast, from Baltimore to Boston. Experience, so far, has taught that the supply cannot be made to exceed the demand. Nature has so defined and circumscribed the soil and climate where this crop can be successfully raised, and at the same time be accessible to the northern markets, as to see in to tide water Virginia a monopoly of this crop for those markets. The railroad and other facilities for transportation, which penetrate the northern States, enable purchasers to supply all the interior villages and towns, and hence the continual increase of consumption aid demand for this crop.

These blades are cured in the sun, and tied, with blades of fodder, into bundles of 1 lb each. Average product per acre 180 lbs, or 60 lbs. to the barrel of corn. The fodder, thus made, with oats in the straw, constitutes the chief food for stock as hay. A hand cannot save on an average more than 150 lbs. of blade fodder a day. Probable proportion of cultivated to uncultivated laniOnethird of the land may be set down as in cultivation. The quantity, however, is believed to be diminishing annually, because the number of laborers is diminishing, large numbers being annually sold away to the sugar and cotton growing States, and because increasedatteitionis being paid to improvement of land, it being preferable to cultivate a smaller quantity of improved to a larger of poor andunptoductive land. Peasthe field pea, black eye of several varieties, and red and black, is extensively cultivated among the growing corn and in separate fields.

Dunlapvi    Lle, S. C., December 1, 1848. Of R:, I n side I have endeavored to fill out the blanks as well as my information would permit. What is said is intended to apply only to the granite regions of South Carolina, extending from the first water falls to the mountains. :to be more full than the blank space in your circular will permit on some subjects, I will add the following remarks: This season most of our crops have ,been injured, by droughts, commencing ,with July and running through summer. Until July we were favored with very seasonable rains, and our crops were promising. In the latter part of August, during fodder and pulling time, we had one wet week, after which we were dry until the middle of November. The drought, I believe, was general; but; some r locations suffered lesss than others. The wheat crop was winter killed, hurt by the fly and somewhat by the rust, and was below an average say 10 or 15 per cent perhaps more. It is not, however, a principal crop with us. Surplus perhaps one third is sent to market. Oats, owing to the seasonable spring, were very good; above an average, and perhaps 15 per cent. better than last year, when they were also good. Were they are more sown than wheat. They are, mostly consumed on the farms. I indian corn is our principal crop; most of it is planted in March, and goes through the process of curing in July, and was, consequently, much injured by the drought. I think it is one third less than last years crop. In the creek bottoms it was good; on the ridges very inferior. The large remnant of last years crop on hand, and the fine o at crop of this year will probably prevent any deficiency. But little of it is ever sent to a distant market. The cotton crop is, I think, near an average, and perhaps 10 or 12 per cent. better than last year. It was also injured by the drought, but not as much as corn; it stands drought better. Last year it was injured by too much rain. During the picking season we had very favorable weather, and but little was lost from windsor other casualties. It is needless to say it is our principal market able crop, and that present low prices are not remunerative. Our region, however, produces all the cereals abundantly, and hasunrivalled water facilities for moving machinery; and I have no doubt that in a short time a more proper diversity of employment will take the place of the present too exclusive attention to cotton, and that our favored region will again be prosperous. Already there is a much increased attention to raising stock. We now buy few mules, fewer horses, and but little pork; and what, perhaps, is more encouraging than all, we are more earnestly engaged than ever before in improving our lands by manures and other means.

November 28, 1848. Dear Of n: I have delayed my communication to the Patent Office until after the State agricultural fair, which came off three days ago, hoping to be able to give you some useful information gathered there. In that I entirely failed. I believe there were some delegates from the whole State; they met at Part a, An cock county, with the An cock Agricultural Club, and but for that, there would have been no organization; and, if there were any returns from county societies, I was not so fortunate as to procure them; so you must excuse my meagre report. The governor is for the time being the president of the State Society, at Milledgeville, and D. W. Lines, at Part a, is secretary Thomas Turner is president of the An cock Club, at Part a, andTuttle H. And is, secretary, also at Sparta500ex: Doc N. 59. This has been a remarkably favorable season for planting; the winter mild March, and April also in the gentle seasons, a little too dry; May, June, and July, gentle showers, and general y enough; August and September, too dry for exhausted land in cotton, though favorable for land in good heart; and since that, gentle, regular seasons, and' healthy all the year. In relation to the cost of our various products, it is difficult to make an accurate estimate. We work our own. hands, ,of all sizes, ages, and sexes, that are fit for the field. Our plantation is ,a little colony, where blacksmiths, carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, and butchers, are all carrying on their trades for the use of the colony all have to be provided for and maintained, and the provisions are generally made by the hands in a way that it is difficult to separate one thing from the whole. When the legislative, executive and judicial functions of the ,colony must be furnished (sometimes paid for) and supported, and cotton being the only product for market, and varying so much in price, it makes it very difficult to collect the data for correct calculations on the price of producing i At the present price of land and slaves, on a well; managed farm, I think cotton can be produced at 7 cents per pound; corn at 30, oats at 25, and wheat at 60 ceiitsper bushel, and the capital invested made to yield 7 per cent. increase but in this estimate the natural increase of the slave stock, &c, in the growth of an establishment, as well as the support and education of the owners family, are counted. To you see that precise accuracy is difficult to arrive at, and various opinions are formed of our property. In our farms, we generally allow 180 pounds of pork, 50 pounds of beef, and 15 bushels of corn, for each individual, little and big, to consume in the year; besides, milk, vegetables, and some molasses, flour, sugar and coffee, amount not estimated; and, i addition to that, sweet potatoes and fruits, almost at will, for two thirds, of the year. For this year, wheat, I think, did .not yield over one half an average crop. The cause in most cases was from the injury of the fly, or a small worm in the roots and s talks of the plant. It commenced early in the winter, and continued its ravages until the wheat was headed out; the yield not over four bushels per acre. We sow in October and November about three quarters of a bushel per acre, and harvest about the first of June, and expect it to yield eight or ten bushels per acre. The early varieties are the surest crop, on account of the rust; though they do not yield so, well, or make as fine flour, as the winter wheat when it matures well. He are increasing our wheat crops. Barley but little raised, and that for seed and feeding off green. Coats are an important hay crop with us this year, and produced about an average yield; we sow, in January and February, about one. bushel per acre, and cut in July, and expect a yield of twelve or fifteen bushels per acreRyeAn uncertain crop, from the rust; sown in the fall, a half x, I 501 bushel per acre, and harvest in June or July, and expect six or eight bushels per acre. You will discover our grain crops are thrown on the ground; n the blade grows large, and if we crowd the plants, as is done further north, it fires, and does not produce fruit. Buckwheatnone sown. I indian corn, our great grain crop, has this year yielded finely, from the favorable season throughout, particularly June and July, the months to mature the corn crop. We plant in March, generally, in drills, and gather in October, and expect an average yield of fifteen or twenty bushels per acre, though our best ridge land will yield thirty bushels per acre, without manure; and allusions, below fertile uplands, will yield fifty or sixty bushels per acre before they are exhausted. By cultivation, here, the common or I wish <a name="potato63"><mark>potato</mark></a> can only be raised successfully as a spring crop. We plant in February, and have them on our tables by the first of May, though it is difficult to keep them either from terminating or rotating through the summer and fall; consequently, we generally purchase for seed, Throughmay, June and July we can raise them plentifully for any uses after that the sweet potato takes their place: on our tables; this year a good crop. The sweet potato is grown as a field crop for stock, as well as for the table. We plant in March, and gather in October; this year a good yield no dis temper. The cotton crop may be put down at ten per cent. over a fair average, and 200 pounds of lint as the average yield per acre. The cotton opened early, and the fall has been favorable for picking consequently, the gathered crop will be over an average. The small crops and large crops are always under and over estimated, when examined in the field. We can only gather so much, and do justice to our stock, provision crops, and farms; and, at the picking season, no hands are to hire. When the crop is light, we gather it all, and in good time the product is over the estimate. When the yield is over a certain amount, we cannot gather iritis wasted, and left on the field, and the product falls below the estimate. May, hemp flax, tobacco, rice, sugar, and silk, all can be grown here, and some of them profit ably; but our slaves being deficient in fore thought and contrivance, we diversity and change our pursuits as little as the market will admit of, and those products will be but little attended to until we are drawn from cotton, The blades of our corn, after the ear slaves, are stripped off and dried for fodder. This is our principal hay crop, and, I suppose, every 100 bushels of corn yields 1,800 pounds of fodder; very little green corn is grown here for hay. The turn in is cultivated here as a field crop for stock, as well as for cooking, and is certainly a great addition to our agriculture. We leave them in the ground until wanted, and they continue to grow in warm weather through the winter. All the varieties are grown and do well; we sow in August- This year a good c top, X. where we got a stand which was difficult on account of a dry August. With the exception of the <a name="potato64"><mark>potato</mark></a> and the turn in, but few roots are grown out of the vegetable garden j New beans are grown out of the garden; but we plant peas in all our corn crop. Sometime in the month of May, the last sloughing but one, we drop the seed between each corn row, seven or eight together, every three or four feet, and afterwards give them one sloughing and one narrowing. Of a good season, they will yield some six or eight bushels per acre, in addition to the corn, and serve to fatten our stock after we have gathered the corn, and what peas we want; and the little left on the ground is thought to be peculiarly fe utilizing; probably, the pea vine is the most economical fertilizes we can use for our lands. The most of our bacon is fattened in our pea fields. Fruits and ferries have done well this year. I think some increased attention is being paid to stock and stock products, particularly butter; though in that we are wo fully deficient. To think one million is expended annually in Georgia for stock and provisions that we can raise as cheap, or nearly so, as where they are brought from, and cotton hawked in the market, at four or five cents, to raise the money! For the details in prices, weights, &c, I will refer you to my last years report. Rules and pork are twenty per cent. lower. Wages of labor for farm managers or overseers are                                       $300; on small farms,                                                              $200; and from that price to four hundred dollars, in proportion to the number of hands and skill of. the manager.

Carrolton, Carrol To, Gajnovember 22, 1848. Of R: At your request, I here with transmit a few answers to theinterrogatories forwarded me sometime since. You will readily perceive that my reply is limited to but very few of the many questions asked me, owing to the total inattention of our farmers to the culture of many of the articles contained in your circular. This inattention is attribute able, in a great degree, to the large quantity of gold that has been found in this county, from its earliest settlement to the present time, estimated at twenty thousand dollars per month for a number years past. This has diverted the attention of the people from agricultural pursuits, it being much more tempting, and much more easy to extract from the bowels of the earth the precious metal in a pure state, than to undergo the x. a, 503 tedium of clearing, planting, gathering, selling, &c. *I t has, in every gold region, had a corrupting influence destructive to the morals and industrial habits of the people. Until within the last two years, very little attention has been given in this county to the culture of cotton, owing not only to the cause above stated, but to the great distance we have heretofore been situated from market; which last and principal obstacle is now removed by the Western and Atlantic and Georgia railroad bringing a market within fifty miles of our courthouse. The crop is much larger this than last year, and I have no doubt it will continue to increase until as much is raised in this county as in the older cotton planting counties. The present crop of I indian corn, wheat, and oats is much larger this than any previous year, owing not only to a larger amount, being seemed, but to an increased interest being manifested in agricultural pursuits generally. Our crops of wheat especially, for the last few years, have been good, and not so uncertain and precarious as formerly. I think I might safely say that our soil is better adapted to the culture of this article than many of the counties around us. The sweet potato e is raised to a considerable extent here, but is principally consumed on the table and by stock. They grow large and fine, and are not subject to many of the maladies that prove so destructive to this root in other sections. It is worthy of remark that, while the people of this county have almost entirely neglected every thing pertaining to agriculture, except only what was necessary for a support, such good attention has been given to apple orchards. In passing over this county, it is not uncommon to see fine large orchards of well selected apples, which rarely ever fail to produce abundant drops, owing to the elevated situation. of the county. Little attention is given by our farmers to c lover, grass, &c, depending for provender entirely upon fodder gathered from the corn, which frequently proves very injurious to horses, owing to the bad condition in which it is put up. I regret, exceedingly, that I am unable to give you a better report of the state of agriculture in this county, but content myself by saying that the interest taken 'in this great and important pursuit is manifestly growing; and I trust we shall soon be able to give a better account of ourselves. Respectfully, your obedient servant, E. B. Marti  N, On. Edmund Burre, Commissioner of Patents. Barbour County, Alabama, October 25, 1848. Dear Of R: Accompanying this report will be sent the "circular of the Patent Office Department" filled outs which has been 504 X. gathered frcid127om such sources as deserve respect and confidence, a swell as from personal observation on my own part, and I trust that it may meet your approval and official purposes. My report of 1847, for your department, covers a general view of the agricultural condition of this immediate section of Alabama. The period of one year just passed has produced no change worth noticing or reporting. Hence, I shall merely add the present crop, as compared with that of 1847, without reference to particulars, &c, as regards cultivation and general management. Small grains are on the increase. Heat, rye, and oats, turned out well, the yield fully sustaining the figures set down in the circular. Cornthe spring was unusually forward and favorable. His cop was put into the ground early, and the land in fine order to receive it, being warm and dry, (in 1847 very cold and wet Stands were readily procured, the s talks grew off rapidly, and seasons throughout favorable, which resulted in a heavy yield, full three weeks earlier than the crop of 1847, and at least ten percent. greater in the quantity made. From all quarters do we hear that the corn crop is a full one. The wants of the county are more than supplied; what will be sold will rate low. Cottonthe .r op is not a full one, having been injured by the ball worm and rust, the early season being favorable up to the 25th of July. The weed grew off rapidly, and the bottom crop was a full one; the middle and top fruiting were seriously injured by the disasters above named. But, notwithstanding, there will be more cotton made the present year in this county than the previous year. In relation to the crop of this State, the accounts are very conflicting, and as yet no satisfactory results can be obtained. In my opinion, the whole crop of the cotton growing States will not turn out more in quantity than the crop of 1847; for Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia, complained of no disasters last year, while the present we have observed, in the papers from all quarters, complaints of the ball worm and rust. A general disaster, no matter how small, will produce results far different than when only partial. In 1847,South Alabama was more infested with disasters than anywhere else, while in the States above mentioned a regular favorable season was experienced throughout, and heavy crops made. Still this opinion amounts to nothing, as the impression now is that 2600 000 bales will be the crop of 1848; as such, we must wait the returns as made out at the shipping ports. But be it 2,000,000 or 2600 000, the prospects are gloomy and disheartening to the cotton planters; from all sources we learn that prices will range very low. Stock. large portion of the planters in South Alabama heretofore have been dependent on Tennessee for their pork. Whilst cotton sold high this department of our domestic policy was entirely overlooked, believing then that it was more profitable to grow large crops of cotton than to devote more land to corn and pasturage, for the purpose of raising hogs. In a word, it was cone x. Doc. To: 59.505sidered cheaper to buy than to raise pork. Such a system might then be considered politic; but since the fall of cotton to 6 cents, and pork rating high, it was at once manifested who was the most fortunate the buyer or the seller. Millions of dollars have thus been carried from the cotton States, owing entirely to our own mismanagement and negligence, and at the same time impoverishing us by the over production of cotton, and their dependence on a market for the meat necessary for plantation purposes. For the last two years a different policy is being pursued. The low price of cotton has clearly shown that the planter must depend more on the resources of his own farm than on markets for his supplies. This has caused much attention to the raising of hogs; and we are now carefully seeing to this valuable stock, and fast producing the number requisite for our own wants. As such, the increase of hogs has been surprisingly great; and we now hear the planters boasting of their pigs, as much as it once was customary to boast of their cotton fields. In all new countries we generally find that domestic economy is very much lost sight of, from peculiar and necessary circumstances; a market crop is urgent, which causes this negligence in home supplies being more cared for; hence this dependence on other section of countries, particularly for pork. The age of this country is now undergoing this change passing from the habits of a new country to that of an older; and with it the farming system is being adopted in the stead of the planting. The results will be, that less cotton will be raised in future, and more provisions of all kinds. When this shall have been thoroughly effected, more contentment and happiness will be depicted on all hands, and y ve shall then witness the permanent y and comforts springing up in all quarters in regard to residences and plantatiodfixtureschurches and schools that so loudly be speak the prosperity and happiness of a contented population. Jno. H. Dent. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Rates. Edwards, Of Nds County, Of ssJVovember 6, 1848HONORABLE Of R: In reply to your circular, I beg leave to be indulged in making up a report in the manner as follows; and when  dare to suggest alterations in your report, believe me, sir, as actuated by the warmest personal considerations for yourself, a deep sense of gratitude for the selection of myself as one to reply, and with an exalted opinion of the usefulness of your report. I know your labors must be of an herculean order; and I believe, considering all things, that your statistics are very good. That your report is prized I know; for I could distribute, even among my acquaintance, hundreds of copies. As an agricultural work I feel proud of it, and I humbly hope to5Q0Ex. be of some little aid in giving hints that may suggest to your mind a more perfect work. The population of Mississippi you estimate at 640,000, a vain on 1840 of 265,000. I should not place it over 500,Q00, as the immigration here has not been great for the last eight years. The cotton crop of Mississippi you place at 250000, 000 0 lbs, or 62 5000 bales; that of the United States at 1,041,000,000 lbs, or 2600 000 bales. Last year I placed the crop at 2,200,000 bales, and that of New Orleans at 1,150,000 balescid127The extraordinary fine weather and a late killing frost (2d November) made the crop yield to exceed my expectations; but it only reached, say 2,300,000 in all, and about 1,220,000 in New Orleans. My impression was that Mississippi would make one half of what was sent to New Orleans, but I did not think the New Orleans crop would go so high. Mississippi is the largest cotton growing State, but she will fall short of the best crop, and I place my figures now for the Unitedstates at 2,300,00 bales, and that of Mississippi at 525,000. I n 1845, the census of mississippi gave 213,000 slaves. Of thes, e4pQ00 were under five years of age, leaving 173,730 over five; deduce from these 53,730 as too young and too old to work as house servants, &c, and add only 10,00 whites who labor at cotton, it will give 130,000 employed in cotton planting. At an average of 4 bales, we will have 520,000 bales. I think the crop of Mississippi may have exceeded this last year; but the unfavorable season for cotton, though very fine for gathering, with an early killing frost November 2,) must reduce the crop; and I would not be surprised if the receipts at New Orleans fell under that of last year by 100 000 bales. The effect on the low grounds has yet to be seen before we can form a fair opinion. In your report you allude to Mastodon cotton as promising something. I regret to say that you was mistaken, and that, like other bubbles, it burst. It never would have done more than excite some attention in this country had it not been for the press. The introduced of that seed puffed them so much that many were deceived. After trying them one season I put them down as unfit, and so worded a report to a public journal. The editor thought me wrong, and would not publish. I tried them again, and was induced to send a few seed to Carolina, from the favorable reports made to me by upland planters. Again I experienced the same thing, and threw the seed into the manure pile. At present they are not planted. There are other <a name="seeds28"><mark>seeds</mark></a> on trial, and been used two to four years. To far they hold to all the introduces promised. I allude toSSuugar loaf" " Kicks 100 seed" and " Organs seed." The first is the earliest maturing, and easier to pick of any I have ever tried, yielding as well per cut. of lint (and better from the field) as the best Met tit Sulph. The balls are rounder, and thinner hull than any other variety; balls growing on sides of stalk, limbs, in clusters of two and three or more. Kicks 100 seed is the result of the most patient, persevering, and scientific selection from the field, X. 
c507and a judicious selection in the house as to staple. It is Mexican, or Met tit Sulph highest improved. The production is better than Mexican, fair yield of lint, better in maturing and picking qualities. The Dog an exceeds all in productive ness and yield of lint. I have not planted it, but visited the largest patches of it; grown within a few miles of me for two years, and holds its own. I maybe deceived, but I am willing to risk a trial. There is no deception in yield or quantity of lint thus far; but it may fail, as others have done. There is no mistake in saying, whenever a half acre or more has been planted, the yield has been over 50 per cent. n tone who plant it come down that low, nearly every one say 100 per cent or over. The yield is astonishing to myself, who has been reared in a cotton region, and accustomed to see the largest yields. I believe select s talks can be found to yield over double what the best s talks of the Met tit Sulph can do; and I have bought one bushel selected from the field (by favor of the introduced) for                                                                                                                                                                                              $10 to test its production. There are other cotton <a name="seeds29"><mark>seeds</mark></a> planted in this section of the country, none of which I have seen, except one of them, and another very limited. The Banana cotton has been higher landed than any other; but the price of seed,                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100 per bushel, precludes all further trials until the price falls. I have seen about the half that was planted, and know its history; but being bound to keep it to myself, I can only say the the product is as good as Organs. Grown seed planted a few seed to test it with Sugar Loaf, and I prefer the Sugar Loaf. I to friends give it far more credit than I can the Sugar Loaf. Another of the same family, Tarverseedi brought a few from Alabama, and planted with Grown and Sugar Loaf. For me, neither yielded or picked as well as the Sugar Loaf. Pitts Prolific I never saw, but have heard from others that it is the best yet known. I would not be surprised when prices rule down to                                                                                                                                                             $1, that there is found to be only two kinds, and that the six names are all the result of competition. At all events, before this meets the public eye, I can injure no one. Of the Dog an seed holds its own, the rich lands of the southwest will produce all the cotton, because we can grow all we can gather, and thus gather more than now, which will cause a greater crop than has ever been made. Reduce prices, and the old States and their land planters must quit or starve. I have a letter from a friend in Georgia, one of the best agricultural writers south. He says: "the planters of Georgia and Southcarolina must abandon their homes or their system of agriculture. Three or four bales of cotton per hand, at present prices, cannot sustain nature. We must quit or starve That the culture of cotton has improved in the southwest, there is no kind of question. I settled here in 1830, and worked harder on fresh land, and thought then six bales was a big crop; now I think it a small one. I had five bales of 400 out and off to 508 X. market by the 1st of November this year; my corn, peas, and po toes all housed Cotton is the most important crop grown in the United States. By it thousands are fed, and millions are clothed. It is the bond of Union between the south and north, between the old and new world, therefore I have dwelt long upon it. The o at crop was about as last year. It is only planted for food in summer. I indian corn The planters of Mississippi are best owing more attention upon corn. Very year gives a larger yield. I think the crop of 1848 is the largest ever made, the seasons suiting, and more being planted. I know a valued friend who declares that he ma do 1,200 bushels with one horse and only one regular hand that he stole some additional homework from his wife by taking her house chaps, his plantation not being where he resided. My own crop is full 250 bushels per hand, and an average of 35 bushels per acre. The sweet potato crop is one quarter short at least from general report. Too wet a part of the time, too dry a part, and too grassy all the time. May, corn blades, or fodder, and pea vine, are all used as the forage crop. There is not as much hay gathered as the northern people gather, yet we gather a large quantity of blades, and some pea vine. Early fodder was much injured, but late fodder saved well. I house all my provender, and as a specimen of what some do, I give you from my note book what I housed 7 240 bundles, say at 1 I lbs. .a. . .a. .a. .a. 10, 860 5 loads of hay of 4 mules, say. .a. .a. 5, 000 4 loads pea vines, say hay value .a. .a. .a. 6, 00021,860 lbs. fodder and hay, or a ton per hand. 21,860Admit I save greatly over the average, and place it at an average of three quarters of a ton per hand; then will the crop of Mississippi be 90,000 tons instead of 800; Suppose we have only one horse to two hands, this gives 60,000; add to this carriage and riding, race and livery stable horses; these were assessed in 1845 at                                                 $270,460; placing at even                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100 each, there would be 2,700 more, say 6,500 horses, and then hay one half, it would take 100,000 tons to feed our stock. The orchard There is a certain progress made in orchards, and in less than five years Mississippi will certainly ship largely fruit to New Orleans and elsewhere. The spirit of improvement is gradually progressing, bringing into its pleasant circle many who were opposed to it five years ago. Any of our people, are early feeling their want of comforts, as the means of acquiring wealth by cotton culture are passing away. The consequence is they #re becoming more devoted to home and its enjoyments. X; a. Stock generally are receiving more attention. Dogs are increasing in number and the more expensive cattle are becoming less, numerous. There are more horses and mules reared, and should present prices of cotton and the high prices of mules and horses be kept up for a very few years, Mississippi will rear the most of her work stock might say something on the subject of the use of improved implements, but really I am so discouraged by the want of patronage received by R,. L. Allen & To, in New Orleans, that I cannot feel as if there were improvement. 'I dare not affirm that the planters of the South are the only persons. who are so afraid of being humbugged that they often become alarmed if they see, a plough painted, but they are nevertheless exceedingly cautious of new things. I have owned some of the improved ploughs, cast mould boards, shares and points, for about five years. I have taken every opportunity to show them and to allude to them. They have not cost me a cent for repairs. I *admit that some I have bought have had the points broken, and one had the mould broken. Such things happen with the best wrought ploughs, in our rough land, and the more especially with, this kind of ploughs light ones; and the point secured by only one pin, the corner where hole was, broke out. :the south will not resort to labor saving implements, nor to permanent improvements, until, like our brethren at the north, we are forced to exertion and to economist t requires no skill, no knowledge, no science, to make five or six, or eight or ten, bales per hand, owing to land; all that is required is to plant enough, and then to push every thing to keep the crop above grass. There are many who rate themselves as very superior planters, because by working 14 to 16 hours per day they make more bales than their neighbors who, work only 10 to 13 hours. I f, sir, any thing in the above can aid our good cause, I beg you to use it as see me th to you most proper. With sentiments of the highest regard and profound respect, I am, very sincerely, yours, Of. W. Phi Of Of. On. Edward Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Edwards, Miss, November 6, 1848. Of R: There is one subject that I would like to bring to the consideration of the planting interest, especially of the south. It is the keeping of a full team, or rather what would be called a surplus team. There is too much reliance on the he for cultivating crops; the consequence is, land cannot be cultivated as it should be. Any object to a full team, on the score of the cost of feeding. I admit if no more corn and provender ere made than is now done, that510Ex. 1 it would be a bad business. But when there is team to rest, and some pasturage provided, there is no need of so much corn; and work horses will be found to live longer, and less liable to colic and other diseases. I know of one plantation where there are over fifty hands, with a horse to each; and the owner assures me that there are horses there over twenty years old, and that in two years he has had but one case of public. The stock are regularly fed in proportion to what they eat, not feeding any as much corn as is usual; at no time are all the horses at labor, and frequently one half are in the pasture. From the fact that they get grass nearly everyday, and do not get a superabundance of corn, they are not burnt out like the whiskey drinkers. The gentleman above alluded to lived with rhine nearly five years, and says the horses where he now lives are always in better condition than any farm horses in the south that Works Well that he eh as ever seen. The saving of horseflesh is one gain, and the ease with which a planter can brush over and over his crop in a press of work is another gain. For the past six years, I have kept a full team, and I had been enabled to hi a ke corn to spare very year but ore, and that one I had the largest cotton crop in i the ground I ever had twelve acres per hand. The consequence was, I fell short not te ii bushels per hand, though I am satisfied, from my own experience of six years, and I might say pirie, for the other three years I used more team s than is usual, that true economy lies in having a superabundance of teams. I will close by adding, that, n my neighbors will, to a aah, agree that I have improved my laid since I have token thedirectionsine years although I have averaged over seven bales, with my meat and corn. With great respect, yours, M. W. Phi Of Of. On. Of Eiwd Burke. Stati  Sti  Cal Bureau Of The State Of Loui Of Ana, New Orleans, December 15, 1848. Dear Of R: In compliance with your request and my promise, I shall make a few hasty notes touching upon our industry, etc confining myself, as nearly as possible, to the line marked out in your circular and private communications. I cannot suppose you will attribute my delay to any want of interest in the great cause in whose promotion you are engaged. Correct and reliable statistics are most difficult of attainment in our country, and especially in the newer States. The southwest his only lately taken any interest whatever in the matter, and Louisiana, hitherto as backward as her sister States, has made what may, be regarded the first movement. At the last session of the legislature, an act was passed establishing a bureau of statistics, with a view in some degree of amending this defect; and, although the appropriation made was x. 511 small, there can be little doubt that, a beginning being had, the best results will be realized hereafter. The example, too, may he followed in other States; and to this end I have directed, to the executive departments of each of them, copies of the annexed circular, (A,) calling for a general co operation on their part. The circular has also been extensively circulated throughout Louisiana. It is quite clear to me that the statistics of this Union can never be had through the unaided power of the general government, although very much be p one by means of the decennial census, and the. invaluable labors of the Patent Office. The States themselves must move con jointly; and were an annual report provided for by each of their legislatures, embracing all the subjects of industrial interest a and an embodiment in a single volume of them all at Washington, would shed a flood of light upon the resources, capacities, and powers of the nation, which in vain we seek from other quarters. The expense of this to the States would be trivial, the advantages incalculable. Nothing is more important in sound legislation than a knowledge of the country which is to be governed. In many parts of Europe, statistical researches are pushed to an extent which must surprise us in this country. Nothing is omitted which can tend to show the condition of the people and the operations of their industry. They even elevate these researches to the dignity of a science. In arbitrary governments this may appear a dangerous and offensive inquisitive ness; but where men are free, such jealousies cannot be felt. In republics, and especially in ours, an enlightened appreciation of the public weal will induce a general cooperation upon the part of every citizen. To man has an interest in concealment none may shrink away from the tyrannical exactions of the rapacious tax collector. Met all the States imitate Massachusetts, for example, in the spirit which she has already exhibited, and the minute statistical reports of her population and, industry she hasqqntribbteed for the benefit of the nation. In respect to Louisiana, I must say that our bureau is too much in its infancy to have produced any results; answers have not come in to the circulars, so that an elaborate report is not at present practicable. The law, too, which establishes it is defective. The appropriation is not large enough, and parish officers, under penalty, should be called upon annually to report to the bureau. Voluntary information cannot be depended upon. I intend suggesting such an amendment of the act, at the next session of. the legislature, as will entirely provide for all the ex agencies of the case, and doubt not it will be carried into force. The late establishment of a professor ship of Political Economy, Commerce and Statistics, in the University of Louisiana, through the liberality and public spirit of the honorable Counsel White, evinces an increased sense of the importance of these subjects; and without doubt the chair, the only one of the kind in the Union, will exercise salutary influences here, and be adopted in the colleges of our sister commonwealths. The chairs of Practicalagriculture, . Agricultural Chemistry, i Manufactures, Civil Engi512 X, sneering, &c, which are springing up throughout the Union, evidence a sound progress of public opinion. But I must leave these subjects, to turn to the equally important ones of your circular 1. In regard to agricultural societies, I am sorry to confess our extreme backwardness. The planters have not been partial to these valuable associations among themselves, which in other States have produced such valuable results. I know not of any parish agricultural societies in the State, and I hardly know if I ought to say that our State . Agricultural Society is still in existence, This society was established by a number of gentlemen at Baton Gouge, and has had four annual celebrations. Orations were delivered, reports read, and agricultural and manufacturing products exhibited. To general interest, however, was evinced in the society, and the attendance and patronage were always very limited. I know not whether the enterprising gentlemen of Batonrouge, now that the State government is removed there, will allow this institution to remain in its present drooping condition, as the last anniversary was not celebrated; or whether they will go to work in earnest, in an efficient organization, which shall extend its influences to every section of the State. The legislature made an appropriation of                                       $500, a year or two ago, in aid of the association, and would, without doubt, always be liberal in the matter. Colonel P. Picked is president, and S. D. Renders on, e squire, secretary, Baton Gouge. The only other industrial association I know of is one for mechanics, now forming in New Orleans. I ought to remark that several years ago an effort was made to establish an experimental farm in this State; but from some mismanagement, the only result was a large expenditure of public money, and a prejudice against a really excellent measure. Several thousand dollars were appropriated for a botany cal and geological survey of the State; and why the results were not published, it is difficult to say. Even the manuscript reports of them, which must be very interesting, cannot be found after utmost search among the archives. Met the money has been spent. At this moment we know literally nothing of the geology of Louisiana. Our legislature, at the last session, passed the following act, which is important to you. (2. 1 come now to speak of the agricultural products of the State, and the prospects for the present season. Sugar, which is the important staple of Louisiana, presents itself first. In this, however, I will be brief, since the mission of. Mr. Fleisehmann to this State, where he is now engaged prosecutingresearches upon this crop, its machinery and manufacture, in the service of the Patent Office, will present everything that is of interest or desirable. He is an enlightened and scientific man, whose opinions, I think, may be relied upon. I have not yet, however, had an opportunity of inspecting any part of his report though I trust it will be published in extensor, with all the drawings and illustrations, so little is known of these matters in other States, and so much desire is there for information. The planter six. a. 513 of Louisiana will be indebted to you for this act of attention to their interests, and to the present government for the scientific investigation of Mr. Mcculloh. I know of nothing that would be more, important and valuable now than a rigid analysis of the sugar soils of Louisiana and Texas. One has yet been made that is satisfactory. To be done thoroughly it would be an expensive matter, but could not otherwise than amply repay the expenditure. The sugar limit of Louisiana is rapidly extending. At present it embraces the country on both sides of the Mississippi as far upwards as Joint Couple, It. Francis ville, and fifty miles below 'the city of New Orleans; westward of the Mississippi, it includes the whole region of the Atchafalaya to Her million bay, etc. The extreme eastern parishes above New Orleans are engaged upon cotton. It would be fair to say that the sugar region, territorially, constitutes about one third of the State. It is extending west and northwest, and at the present time the Red river country is substituting very largely this crop for cotton. The experiments have been attended with signal success where, some years ago, it was supposed impracticable to cultivate sugar at all. The latitude was supposed too high. However, the great improvements in machinery, enabling the crop to be much more speedily taken off, and the depression in the cotton interests, have been working a i evolution. The Red river planters turn anxious attention to sugar, and it is not improbable, eventually, the major portion of them will be engaged in its production. This motion, it is true, is now retarded by the discouraging prices of sugar, and the very large out lay of capital required upon a sugar estate. Of this I am sure, that Louisiana is alone capable of producing the whole supply of sugar demanded for the consumption of the Union, though it will require many years. With present prices, I scarcely can say how long, unless cotton remains at its extraordinary depression; an event altogether improbable. Even at present prices, the preference must be in favor of sugar, all things considered. The crop of the present year will fall greatly short of expectation and, if I mistake not, of the last years figure. In some parts the rains have done great mischief, and the general complaint is, that the canes at the mill have yielded badly. I know not what estimate to make in safety, as it is yet early, but am of the opinion that 200,000 hogs heads will be about the amount. I send you, annexed, meteorological tables (C) kept in New Orleans for the last few months, by D. T. Willie. I have not be enable to get any results from the country, though it would be very interesting to compare notes, for example, between New Orleans and Alexandria, Red river. You will perceive that the amount of rain which fell last summer was extraordinary. It is not clear when the culture of sugar cane was first introduced into Louisiana. Mr. For stall carries it back as far as 1725 for almost come val with the colony; whilst Dr. Annette, in his i" History of the Valley of the Mississippi" states the first attempt to have been made in 175 1 by the He suits, and that Mr. Debreuilin 1758, introduced the first mill. The product was first sent to 17 514 X. the mother country in 1764, the yield being stated as 3,000 lbs. to the acre, and the quality equal to that of It. Domingo Muscovado. After the cession to Pain, the sugar industry declined ai together, until near the close of the last century. Under the American government it rapidly improved, and in 1818 had reached 25,000 hads, The first steam mills were introduced in 1822. The varieties of cane planted are the Are ole, originally imported from Mala bar; the Otaheite, introduced long after; the Ribbon brought from Georgia in 1817, being an Last I india variety.

Between 1827 28 and 184 344, the manual power employed in working sugar, according to Mr. For stall, increased from 2 1000 slaves to 50,670; the steam engines, from 82 to 408; the horse mills, from 226 to 354. Total capital, from                           $34,000,000 to                        $60,000,000. The last figure we regard high. It will, however, fairly represent the sugar cap i al at the present moment, and shows a capital of                                       $300 required in the production of each hogs head of sugar, and barrel of molasses of the value of (say)                            $45 gross. The expenses of working an estate, including wear and tear of machinery, have been estimated at                $75 to the slave. Sixty dollars would be a fairer estimate. Averaging the product at five hogs heads to the hand, we have the value of hogs head, &c, as before, X. a. 515                            $45-12=                          $33 net, or about 10 per cent. upon the capital engaged in its production. Mr. For stall, however, estimates the per cent age as low as 5, and even 2. per cent. in some years, and draws the general inference from many tables, that when sugars average 4 cents and cotton 61 cents, and both equally good crop, the results per slave are very nearly the same; with this difference, that the, capital in machinery on a large cotton estate to that on an extensive sugar one, will be as                            $5,000 to                                                            $20,000. Cotton is the n, ext important staple of Louisiana. The crops for the present season may be considered somewhat better than last year; the season having been more favorable with us, and the cater pillar spared its depredations. The cotton plant is mentioned in Louisiana from the earliest days of the colony. Mr. Seabrookconjectures that the Louisiana cotton of the present day is derived from a species of Tea I s land, grown at the period of the revolution, and degenerated in the progress of tillage by inter mixing with other kinds. Tie crop of the United States will exceed that of last year. Complaints are heard of over production, and in the older cotton States they find it necessary to look to other means of support. Capital with them in this industry produces nothing. A convention of cotton growers is daily becoming more and more popular, though it is hard to see what good such a convention can effect. The south must undertake the manufacture of her own products, and thus diversity her industry. This opinion is prevailing generally, and every few days we hear, of new factories established, under the most favorable auspices, in Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi. This is as it should be. In heavy products, our southern manufactures are very superior, and pay handsomely. There experiments have been tried with slaves as operatives, they have been successful. My own impression is, that in a state of peace existing throughout the world, the present American crops of cotton will by no means exceed the demand. Large quantities of rice are produced in the State, though of a character inferior to that of Carolina. This deficiency is said to be in the manner of preparing it. Certainly the culture and machinery used by us is of the most primitive kind. The grain is bad, and it is said will not stand a sea voyage. The rice estates are mostly of small capitals, and generally owned by Roles on the Mississippi. Below New Orleans, 40 or 50 miles, a large number of these rice planters may be found. The crop is understood to be even more profitable than sugar. We can little doubt that rice will one day become an important staple of Louisiana, for which we have abundant soil; but then it will be necessary to borrow from the experience and skill of our Carolina friends. I indigo was formerly produced in this State by the French in quantities. We now hear no more of it. The finest qualities of leaf tobacco may be grown, and we have 516 X. seen specimens produced on Red river, and in the Florida parishes, equal to the best Havana. Some attention has been given to silk, and a bounty allowed for its production. Scarcely any results, however, have been achieved of a general character. Sugar and cotton have absorbed the whole capital and industry of the State. We grow no wheat, barley, rye, &c, as crops. The planters have been compelled to buy their corn from Kentucky and Tennessee, though they are very generally giving attention to its production. We know a great many large estates that buy very little, and cannot but think it the interest of all to supply their own demand in this article of food. The crops with us this year are good, and the yield to the acre may be, estimated at from 25 to 50 bushels. The orchard receives no attention, though we might doubtless have very fine fruits. Our apple sand peaches are very indifferent. We had occasionally seen very fine strawberries "in private gardens. Hi grape is attracting attention, and we know several who are experimenting with the Scuppernong. Our figs are superior. We produce fine oranges in abundance, and many small planters make them a source of profit. The trees have been greatly injured by the rust. Our butter and cheese, pork, land, &c, are brought to us from the western States; we import thence also cattle, horses, mules c; although upon the prairies of Louisiana the finest herds of cattle are found, which supply the markets of New Orleans to a considerable extent. This should be an abundant cattle region. Rules are being generally adopted in Louisiana for agricultural purposes. Our mutton is celebrated, though little attention is paid to sheep, and none whatever to the subject of wool. The specimens of side foreign wools which were sent from the Patent Office are now preserved by this bureau. I can give you no particulars about the minor products. Our agriculture is not sufficiently advanced for anything to have been achieved in regard to the rotation of crops and manures. The only rotation I may mention is corn with peas. Our manures are compose, cane trash, and pea vines, &c. The wages of agricultural laborers will vary from                                                                                                                                                                                   $12 to                                                            $20 per month; the former for female, and the latter for stout males. Agricultural laborers however are seldom hired, at least for field work. The average price of the transportation of a hogs head of sugar, by water, to market in Louisiana will be                                                                                                                                                             $1 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.25, and about the same for a bale of cotton; this will, however, depend upon the state of the waters, &c; rates may sometimes go up very high. Our State, by means of ba you and rivers is blessed with abundant water facilities, though in the western portions the difficulties of transportation are very great. It may be found almost impossible to get a crop to market, and then the land carriage necessary will be considerable. Doubtless many improvements could be made in the common roads of the State, and some short railroads built to advantage. We know of two or three in projection, though our x. a. 517 past experiments have been such failures that we move with hesitancy in the matter. The legislature has expended, and still expends, annually immense amounts for opening water communication, &c; more, perhaps, than any other State in the Union. But I must draw this hasty paper to a close. I look upon the Patent Office as destined to be a kind of Home Department, and trust to see it organized to that end. In looking over my circular annexed, you will find I have drawn attention to the subject of the trade between the States, which cannot appear in the tables of the general government, and does not now appear at all. You have earnestly pressed this matter, over and over, and I notice many pages in your reports calculated to shed light upon it. We must get the home trade. Now important is it to know the relative dependence of State upon State in this great confederacy! Would it not correct and allay those jealousies which so unhappily show themselves at times? Now much does Louisiana receive from Ohio, from Kentucky, from Massachusetts c, &c ?a? Now much does she annually send to those States, &c c? Now can these data be obtained Another important subject is taxation. An we not have an annual table showing the proportion of taxes to wealth or population in each of the States? In this way better notions can be formed of the excellency of their political institutions, &c. I have not made any remarks in regard to the commerce, &c, of our great em corium, New Orleans; as, without doubt, your statistics will be full from other sources. The present summer population may be estimated at 120,000-winter population, 160,000;though no reliable census has been taken for many years. The city still grows in population and trade, at an extraordinary pace. The number of new buildings every year is immense; rents continually rise. The city of Lafayette, which joins us, advances in the same progression. Should a southern overland communication be had with the Pacific, China, &c, New Orleans must become the greatest commercial mary upon the continent, perhaps in the world. In any instance, she will press hard upon New York within a generation or two. With such a back country, and such proximity to Mexico, the West I n dies, California, &c, what may not be anticipated in the future? The past of New Orleans appears almost adreamWith great respect, your obedient servant, J. D. B. Of Bow. Of on. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. A.

B. No. 211.--Resolution. Whereas, the culture of the sugar cane is one of the chief resources of the wealth and prosperity of this State; and whereas, it is apprehended by many that the ribbon cane, the most valuable variety now cultivated in the State, may eventually become deteriorated as the Are ole cane has already been, by constant reproduction, without any change of soil or climate; therefore.

Regular hours of observation 8 a. mi 2 p. m, and 8 p. m. The baroneter is located at an elevation of 19 feet above the level of the ocean, and is suspended clear of the wall of the building. The rain gauge is graduated to the thousandth part of an inch, and the receiver is elevated 40 feet from the ground. It will be perceived, by reference to the rain column, that but a small quantity of rain has fallen during the last 9 weeks say about 4' inches.

Of R: I have received, today, the circular you did me the honor to address to me, making certain inquiries relative to this portion of the country, and regret I had not had the ni earlier, for at this late hour, when your report, I presume, is about made up to be laid before Congress, it is not in n my power to obtain all the information required in time to be embodied in your present report. Being, besides, but a temporary sojourner in this land, I am in possession of those facts only which I was led to obtain with, at the time, no other object but to gratify my curiosity as a traveller in a strange land. But I have seen enough of Last Tennessee to satisfy me that it is a land abounding in rich agricultural soil, and in abundance of various minerals, such as iron, lead, zinc, every, copper, copper as, coal, saltpeter, Bosom salts, marble, burst one, gypsy m, &c, &c in the mountains. The climate is represented to be excellent andhealthful by the inhabitants of the low lands and high lands. Not above one quarter part of Last Tennrissee is under cultivation, the, original forests covering yet, at least, three portions in four of the whole district. I indian corn is chiefly grown, of the white and flat kind; next, wheat, oats, and rye. The first of these cereals is gathered at an average of thirty-five bushels per a ere, at a cost often cents per bushel. The second at an average of twenty seven bushels, and at a cost of thirty-three cents. The third at an average of twenty bushels per acre, at a cost of five cents. As to rye it is very uncertain. At least three quarters of the population are white, and as there is but little demand for labor, it is comparatively low, say one hundred dollars per annum, including finding of food and lodgings, for white men; and sixty-five dollars per annum, with food and clothing, for male slaves. Agriculture, generally, is at a very low ebb in this sequesteredpart of the Union. I can hear of no societies in existence for the promotion or improvement of that branch of industry. Rotation of crops, if at all known, is not practised; for in nine cases in ten a field is worked in I nl dan corn, without being once manured, until the richness of the soil is exhausted, when it is abandoned, and anew clearing is made which undergoes a like treatment. Very little attention has been paid to the rearing of horn and other cattle for grazing, although it may be done at scarcely any out lay of money or trouble, as the mountain ranges f irish abundance of food in the spring, summer, and autumn, and generally in winter, as but little snow falls, and it very seldom lies a whole week on the ground. The formation of the country, a succession of hills and mountains abounding in fine pasturage, and water everywhere, together with a mild climate, would make it one of the first for the breeding of sheep, were it not for the legions of dogs to be found in every farmhouse, but principally in the log cabins of those who can less afford to feed them, who destroy them522Ex. and have ruined every one who has attempted to raise a flock of these valuable animals, and deters capitalists from coming here to embark in the raising of wool. The only manufactures consist of small cotton, woollen, and iron mills. The whole country affords water power to any extent. Fruit of almost all kinds are plentiful, and various varieties of grapes introduced here from other sections of the Union and Europe have realized every expectation. As the tea plant is attracting some notice at the present time, I should think the conformity of this country and its climate, to that of the best tea districts in China, would admit of little doubt of its satisfactory cultivation in every part of Last Tennessee. Owing to the absence of means of transportation over turn pipes, canals, or railroads, not one of which is to be found, the expense of carrying the produce of the country in wagons, for any distance, would more than absorb the value were it attempted to convey the min this mode to any of the great markets, and hence the cause of the low state of agriculture. Raising of cattle has a better chance as they may be driven off, at any time, to the northern or southern cities. With regard to that part of your inquiries respecting the probable average consumption of food per individual, I am informed that in a family consisting of six persons of all ages, it would be found to be on the average, viz: forty bushels of I indian corn, twelve of wheat, thirty of I wish and sweet potatoes and turn is, twelve hundred pounds of pork, four hundred pounds of beef, and eight dozen of poultry, besides game and fish, per annum. I may be allowed the pleasure to add, that as far as I have had means of observation, I have found temperance the general rule, and departure from it the exception, in private life and at county meetings. I need no spirituous liquors, even cider, is kept on sale by the general it y of country store keepers; certainly by none of the respectable ones. Except grocer is, and some hard and crockery wares, the articles to e had at the country stores, for domestic use, consist almost wholly of American manufactures. There are three banking establishments in Last Tennessee, and all these are branches of banks located at Nashville. As I have already, said I regret that I have neither time nor opoteity to give you the statistical details you require. I am here for the winter only, and my residence of two months in differentSeations of this portion of the State makes me but poorly competent to fill the task you have put on me without previous notice. But I have endeavored to answer your call as soon and as well a sn my power, and I may say with every desire to add my mine of information to the great mass which you embody, annually, in your useful and valuable reports to Congress. S have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant, J. Balesti  Of. On, Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. X. a. 523BAGDAD, Smi Of To, Tennfebruary 8, 18494DEAR Of R: Although unsolicited, and not at a time of making up of your report, I thought it probable that I might be able to give you some information, which might assist you in some small degree in making up your next report to Congress. Through the kindness of my representative in Congress, Mr. Will, I have been favored with the use of your report for 1847. I believe that I should not have ventured to give you any of my weak opinions, and quite limited information, only that I notice in your report on tobacco that some person or persons have given you certain statements which I think calculated to mislead the mind of those who are unacquainted with the cultivation of that article. I see on page 168 of your report, where our journal, in speaking of the ravages of the tobacco worm in its vicinity, says: "' That some of the fields were literally stripped by them, and the tobacco was hardly worth the housing." I suppose that he alludes to the common worm which we here call the horn worm, as I have never heard of any other worm injuring the large tobacco. (I should first have informed you that tobacco is our chief produce for a foreign market) We are beset with three sorts of worms: The cut worm in the spring of the year, and until hot weather sets in; these cut off the small plants; our remedy is re planting and killing them until hot weather, which finished them. We have the bud worm, which eats out the bud of the half grown tobacco; and lastly, the horn worm, which eats and consumes the leaves; some of these grow as large as a mans little finger, and, if let alone, would eat it up before ripe. For the last five or six weeks before housing, we are compelled to pull them off and kill them as often as once a week. I industrious, good managers never lose much tobacco by them. He also worm the half grown plants for the bud worm, which is seated in the bud, and, if let alone, would top it too low. Also, on page 170, where your correspondent, speaking of an experiment between fire curing and air curing, says: " When one parcel was put into the barn and fire cured; the other into a house where there was no fire, and suffered to remain about five days, when it was perfectly cured. Now, I will not dispute as to which is the heaviest, or seems preferable to the inspectors; but, in this country, tobacco will not cure in a house without fire in five days, nor will it be perfectly cured in one month without fire. I have never tried it without fire; but my opinion is, that it would not be sufficiently cured in three months. Tobacco, when cut, is nearly as green to look at as fodder or weeds, and will not bear fire until it wilts and turns yellow; then we put fire to it. Of we should fire it before that time, it would cure up green like fodder or hay. I have housed some; and in warm weather, I have kept it in the house for two weeks before it was yellow enough for fire; then we fire it every day for two or three weeks before it is considered safe. We then quit the fire, except on wet days, for about a month, when it will do to strip; but we hang it up again after524Ex. stripping, and let it hang near two months before we bulk it down for prizing. In cool weather, it takes longer to yellow, and longer to cure. To cure it at all without fire, it would require double the room that we give it, and that would be more expensive than the firing. To crowd it in the houses without fire, it would rot which we call house burn) before it would cure. The tobacco has a large green stalk about one inch in diameter; also large green stems growing out of that stalk, which serves the leaves as a back bone; from these are smaller stems, as ribs. These large stems are as large as a mans finger; and of a wet season, it takes two or three months to cure them, and that with the help of fire. We commence cutting tobacco in August, and finish about the middle of October; and then there are very few planters that think their tobacco is sufficiently cured to bulk down for prizing until February, and some put down as late as April. At this time, I know of no man that has any put down. As to fire, all carpenters, or other workmen in wood, know that plank, seasoned without fire, will swell and shrink with the changes of dry and wet weather; but when cured by fire, it so kills the nature of it that wet weather will not swell it, if kept dry. To in corn or meal to be shipped, it will mould, unless dried by fire; and so with tobacco, if cured without fire, it will be more apt to mould and sunk when put on water. We are in the habit of selling at New Orleans. I live in Jackson county, but on the Smith county line, near a post office called Bag dad, six miles north of Cumberland river. The south end of Jackson makes tobacco nearly to a man the north end, grain and stock. I suppose we make, in this south end of Jackson, about six hundred hogs heads, of twelve or fifteen hundreds pounds each. We calculate on from one thousand to fifteen hundred pounds per acre. Very hand will make a hogs head of tobacco, besides other produce sufficient for the family. For the last few years, we got from                                               $2.50 to             $7.00 per hundred average, about                          $3.50. At that rate, one acre of land will bring more money than in anything else we can cultivate. The county of Smith makes tobacco largely; I suppose at least double Jackson county. Our crop of 1848 is very good in quality, but not an average in quantity. Some of our large tobacco planters are turning their attention more to stock raising, particularly mules. He make no cotton for market, and not half enough for home use. I know some women, who have small families, who will plant a little patch of tobacco near the house, and make enough to bring                                   $30 or                                    $40, and buy their clothing out of the store. We catltivatelargely of oats, which we cut and feed to our horses, mules, sheep, oxen, and much cows. We make no hay, and but little corn fodder, by reason of being pushed with our tobacco. We cultivate considerable I wish <a name="potatoes132"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and turn is; and of late years, begin to feed them to our much cows, and fattening be even; but, as to quantity, I cannot tell. I think not so good as the colder States. I have never noticed any of my <a name="potatoes133"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> diseased, as you relate of Europe, and some of our northern States; but my crop has sometimes been destroyed by small flies, somewhat like a lightning bug, X. 525 only larger, of a yellow color, nearly .as large in the body as ano at straw, and near and n ch long. They eat up the vines, and then the <a name="potato65"><mark>potato</mark></a> e stops growing; but early planting will nearly make themselves before the fly comes. We make considerable wheat, but not for market, for want of good mills to manufacture it. He make no hemp, no buckwheat nor barley, and very little rye. I indian corn flourished well; we make largely, and send it down the river Cumberland. Worn will produce from five to ten barrels per acre; wheat will average ten bushels; oats, I suppose, twenty bushels to the acre; turn is, I would think, three hundred bushels per acre; I wish <a name="potatoes134"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, one hundred and fifty per acre. The article of geese feathers constitutes a very considerable item in the profits of small families here; many of them nearly defray their store expense with feathers. The merchants buy them at about 25 cents per pound; and one retail merchant will barter, for fifteen hundred or two thousand pounds in a year. Sees wax and honey has heretofore been considerable; but of late years, the moth has so destroyed our bees that but few are left. The moth is a small white worm that kills the bees, and cuts up the comb and eats the honey. I have heard of many preventives, but nothing does much good. We sell considerable pork, and raise cattle, some horses and mules. We make a little flax for home use, but none for foreign market. We make considerable cabbages for family eating, but not for stock; but, for a few years last past, I notice that lice or bugs nearly destroy them every fall. We have declined the silk business. Some few years since, our legislature chartered a silk company, and the excitement was considerable. They had a loom or two in Nashville, but I hear nothing now no inquiry formulticaulis, or worm eggs. When I get through the book containing your report, I may have something further to write. Very respectfully, your most obedient servant, James Young. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents, Washington, D. C. Prospect Of Of, Dear Washington, By, January 4, 1849. Dear Of R: I take the liberty of sending you one of my books on agriculture, and desire to call your attention particularly to a table of grasses, at page 234, given on the authority of Air Humphrey Navy, and the remarks thereon in the two following pages. Number 1 in that table is supposed to be the common blue grass of Kentucky, by some called spear grass, (po a pratensis) You will perceive that some of the other species of the po a greatly exceed the po a pratensis in the quantity of grass, hay, and nutrition matter. Numbers 3 and 8 (augustifolia and po a fertile is) would seems be greatly sup error (at least for meadow) to the po a pratensist would like very much to have an opportunity of testing the 26 X. utility 'of these grasses by actual experiment; but have had no opportunity of procuring any of the seed. I presume you could, by your correspondence in Or gland, procure some of the seed. I f you can procure any in time for spring sowing I would be glad to procure a small supply. The po a merit aim would seem also to be a valuable grass, but probably would suit best for the sea shore. You will observe that there are two kinds of the po a fertilisNumbers 7 and 8,) both of which are very rich in nutrition matter. You will see also in table I I I., page 236, that the different species of c lover would seem also to be worthy of experiment, for the purpose of ascertaining their relative value. As a census will be taken in the course of next year, it will lay a good foundation for correct estimates of our agricultural products, if carefully and accurately taken. Very precaution should be taken to secure so desirable a result. A small additional expense in taking the census can be of no importance, compared with the perfection and accuracy of its statistics. Permit me to suggest that, in giving the statistics of our agricultural products, (at least the most important of them) if would be proper to give separately the total product of each kind; and also that part of the product of each farm which will not be consumed by the family or stock; in other words, the net surplus for sale in kind or in value. The crops of corn in the west are enormously great; being ranked as bread stuffs, foreigners would be at a loss to imagine how they could be consumed. But when it is considered that more thannineteentwentieths of these crops are converted into beef, pork, mules and horses, the mystery would cease. Now if we give the whole value of the corn crop, and also the amount of beef, pork, mules and horses, there would be a double valuation; but if each farmer should give the value of the beef, pork, horses and mules sold by him, and also the value of that part of his crops which he does not consume or feed to stock, all would be right. Although farmers may not have actually sold their surplus productions when called on by the census take r, they can easily estimate the amount of their surplus produce for sale as contra distinguished from the amount reserved for consumption and feeding X. a. Leesburg, Of Ghland County, Rio, October 8, 1848. Of R : I avail myself of the opportunity of giving you the information you requested in your circular. In regard to our crops of the present year, it is gratifying to know there is everything in abundance compared with the year 1847; 50 per cent. better in the aggregate. Our corn crop will average throughout the State 75 per cent more than last year, and. of a greatly superior quality. Our spring was rather cool and dry about planting time, which is about the 1st of May, and continued so until about the 1st of July. When we had very wet weather during that month, which caused our corn to fill out well. We consider a dry June and a we truly favorable for a good corn crop in this region. Our corn crop in Ohio the present year will perhaps average 50 bushels to the acre, and of a well matured and good quality. Our farmers are adopting a better mode of cultivation in regard to their corn crop, and the result has amply paid them for this enterprise. In many instances, from 80 to 150 bushels are now produced to the acre; and I am clearly of opinion that, with proper treatment, any of our land can be made to produce 100 bushels to the acre on an average. But, as a matter of course, we should have to confine our ourselves to a less quantity of ground, and cultivate in a better manner. To raise 100 bushels of corn to the acre, I should want good sod of, any kind of grass, at least three years' standing, well turned over, in January or February, with a double plough in gone plough to cut and turn the sod, and the other to follow immediately after and break the sub soil at least ten inches. In the month of April, and immediately previously to planting, and when the ground is in a dry state, roll it with a roller sufficiently heavy to pulverizethe ground on top and settle the sod beneath. When harrow it until you can stir the ground with your foot. When spread about ten loads of manure to the acre, and harrow or plough it in immediately, in order to save the strength of the manure. Burrow off poor ground four feet apart, and plant the corn one foot apart in the row, two s talks in a hill. Work it well when small with thecultivator and afterwards with the plough. To not disturb the soda, and I guarantee from 80 to 100 bushels to the acre, instead of frequently not more than 30 or 4.0, and that of an inferior quality. Our wheat crop is at least 50 per cent. better the present year than last, owing I suppose to the cool, dry weather during the whole of spring up to the time of harvesting. The amount sown throughout the State would not perhaps be more than an average. But the quantity to the acre and the s quality is far superior to anything since 1839. I live in one of, perhaps, the best wheat counties in the State, which is High land, and it seems to be one of the great staples of the county. I was informed by Mr. Mlaifield, one of the principal wheat buyers of Chillicothe, that the best wheat he had ever bought, or ever saw, came from High land. He also informed me that the golden straw was the best wheat. There seem six. a. 533 to be considerable enterprise among our farmers about the manner of cultivating the wheat crop in this section of the country. The amount of wheat sown this fall will, perhaps, about average with our last crop. Our oats crop will, perhaps, fall short this season about 25 percent. less than the last, owing to the dry, cool weather in the fore part of the season, and the wet weather at the time of taking care of them. The quantity sown perhaps was not far different from last year. Of any difference, it was something less. Eye, for the last few years, has not been cultivated; I suppose from the fact that our distilleries have, to a great extent, gone down, and rye does not make as profitable feed as other grain that can be raised as easy and with as little expense. Buckwheat is an article that is not cultivated to a very great extent. The most that is raised is for home consumption. The quantity sown this year will fall short perhaps 10 per cent. of what it was last year. But the deficiency in quantity will be made up in quality; so that, perhaps, there will be 10 per cent. more this year than last. It is not considered among our farmers a profitable crop. A cool, wet August is considered the kind of weather for a good crop of buckwheat. The present season has not been considered the best for hay. I n the spring it was too dry and cold, and continued so till it was too late for the meadows to recover without a considerable failure. The season also was bad for taking care of or making hay, so that our present crop must fall short of last year 15 per cent, and of a greatly inferior quality. Lover hay was better this year than last, as it was wet enough very early in the spring for it to' commence growing, and the weather for making and taking care of it in June was very favorable. The crop of this year was, perhaps, 10 per cent. better than last year. The crop for seed has been very good, owing to a we truly and August. I think it would be a safe estimate to put the yield of the present crop of c lover seed in Ohio at 20 per cent better than last year. Some of our farmers in High land have told me they counted on a yield of two bushels to the acre, which is worth, on an average,                                                                                                                                                             $1 per bushel. It is an article which is cultivated to a considerable extent in our county, and generally throughout the State. Hemp and flax are articles that are not cultivated to much extent in Ohio. Whether the neglect of these articles is owing to the want of adaptation of our soil to their growth, I am not prepared to say. The amount of hemp raised in High land county is small; and as I have no reliable means of knowing the quantity or quality raised, I must decline further particulars. Flax is more of an article of husbandry, and, to some extent, is raised by most of our farmers, and its growth is pretty well adapted to our soil. I have understood that some of our farmers have sown it in quantities for the seed, and cut it like wheat. Whether it is a profitable crop or not, I am unable to say. The past season, I think, was not a good one for either of the above articles. Tobacco is not in much cultivation in Ohio, although I believe it534Ex. might be made a profitable crop, I know of but one cultivatorwho manufactures it to any extent, which is Mr. Carlyle, of High land county. I am not sufficiently acquainted with his manner of cultivating and manufacturing to give a detailed account. His tobacco has a high character for being the best that is sold in our market. But of what quantity he manufactures annually, or what the difference is in the this year and last, I am not able to say. Barley is not raised in any great quantity. Perhaps about an average crop this year with last. Fruit of all kinds is fine and plenty, particularly apples. The crop of this fruit this year is at least 100 per cent. better than it has been for the last five years, and of a very fine quality. Foot crops of all kinds are very fine, except <a name="potatoes135"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. His will not average with the last year by 10 per cent. Sweet potatoes about in the same proportion. Warships, bees, and carrots, are fine, on an average of 25 per cent. more than last year. There has been considerable complaint about the disease of the <a name="potato66"><mark>potato</mark></a> more than last year, perhaps 10 per cent, which will make the crop short 20 per cent. There seems to be considerable enterprise in raising stock, both in quality and quantity. Our cattle men are taking considerable pains to improve the stock of cattle in Ohio. The number of cattle in Ohio this year will perhaps amount to 25 per cent. more than last year. Dogs will perhaps average about with last year. The price of beef, on an average, about                          $3.50 per hundred, and pork about                          $3. Sheep are about on an average with the past three or four years. In the eastern part of the State there are raised more for their flee ces than there are in the south or western part. Consequently there is more attention paid to the raising of them, and more regard to the quality of wool than there is in other parts of the State. Utter and cheese are both manufactured according to the wants or demands at home, and will about average with the past year. But there is no country, perhaps, better calculated to make these articles to profit than Ohio, from the fact that our pastures a refine, and we can have as fine fairies as any set of people in the world; and there is nothing wanting but industry and enterprise porous to compete with Os hen, or any other county, in these two articles. Utter is, on an average, worth about 121 cents per pound, and cheese from 6 to 8 cents. Since we have got a statute law for the benefit of agriculture, a large number of the counties are availing themselves of the benefit of it which is, that the amount which is subscribed by the agricultural society is to be equalled by the, like amount paid by the county treasurer, which enables the societies to organize, and to prosecute their enterprise without much trouble.

535TRoY Townshi P, Of Chland County, Ohi o. Dear Of R: Your Ccircularcid127) calling for agricultural statistics for the year, A. D. 1848, was duly received, and would have been answered sooner had I not delayed to collect information from gentlemen whose business lay from home. It is only possible here to collect agricultural information by intercourse with intelligent farmers; consequently, after obtaining the best, our report must be imperfect. We have no agricultural society no systematic farming, except what may be done by a few isolated individuals. Under such difficulties, you will readily see how imperfect must be our reports. I have done the best with the means at command. Wieatfor the reasons above assigned, it is impossible to give the amount of bushels, tons, &c, of any of our products. The wheat crop with us is not an average one; but we estimate a gain of 5 per cent. over the crop of 1847. The winters of 1846 47 and 1847 48, were open and rainy; that of the former, perhaps, the most so, attended with more sudden and violent freezings. The injury done by the fly was, perhaps, greater this year than last, and more general. Our best farmers prefer sowing from 10th to 5th of September; but we estimate the average, or most general, from the 15th of September to the 5th of October. Our time of harvest depends upon the season sometimes earlier and sometimes later. Our best yield per acre is 35 to 45 bushels. The Club and Nova Scotia were, this year, most successful. The early white was almost a failure, being nearly destroyed by the fly. Some other kinds, the valley, river, and Mediterranean, being under test, did tolerably well. The "white blue stem" is coming into repute here. We find the yellow clay soil the surest and most productive in quality and quantity. The sandy or loose loam, however fertile, is liable to be severely affected by the rains and freezings. A snowy winter makes wheat. In the winter 1845 46, the surface was covered nearly all the time with snows of various depths hence the abundant, nay, super abundant crop of wheat harvested in 1816. I have been an inhabitant of a wheat country nearly all my life, and never knew a failure in wheat, the harvest succeeding an evenly winter with plenty of snow. But I have spoken of the fly. I had supposed at one time that I had found a remedy to destroy that "fell destroyed" of the wheat crop; but my sons, in applying the remedy in the fall of 1847, and not being successful, has caused some doubt. In the fall of 1840, I commenced and continued for three or four successive years, till the fly a bated, with good success. The application of lime to the seed is the remedy. Barleywe estimate a loss of 20 per cent. on barley less being sown and season too wet. It is an uncertain crop with us, and, the price is so low as not to make it an object of attention. Oatswe estimate a gain of 8 per cent. on oats. The weather favorable for early sowing, and the season congenial to its growth good in quality and quantity. Ryethis crop we suppose 3 per cent. short; season too wet at 536 X. filling time; not extensively cultivated; not very productive; price low. Buckwheatgain of 5,per cent; season favorable; not extensively cultivated, being considered injurious to the land. I indian cornea in of 5 per cent; season favorable. In the low or level lands, we had an abundant crop; but on the high or very hilly lands, the white or g rub worm is said to have injured the crop very much. Some of my neighbors, with myself, have raised more per acre than we ever did in one season here. <a name="potatoes136"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, common Similar to last year; season rather rainy the common disease very prevalent; no remedy yet ascertained much in demand at this time for consumption. I tried an experiment with lime, plaster, and ashes, putting the mixture first, and then dropping the <a name="potatoes137"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on it, and covering with soil; but all of no avail. One of my neighbors delayed planting till about the middle of June. His crop was good, and very little injured by the disease. Sweet potatoes are cultivated on a small scale here; but scarcely worthy of notice. May -our grass, c lover, -nd meadow, were excellent. Hemp, flax, and tobacco Very little raised. Cotton, rice, and silk one raised. Sugarnot as extensively manufactured as formerly. Horns talk and straw fodder we do not use systematically, as is done in some parts, but conjecture the proportion of to grain, asset down in the circular. Probable proportion of cultivated to uncultivated land, perhaps 66 per cent. Perhaps, reference being had to the annual report of the auditor of the State of No, would be more satisfactory on this subject, and many others, than any other source with which   am acquainted at this time. As to the balance of the "circular" there are several items on which 1 cannot say a word. To market; no demand of any consequence; prices so low that no attention is paid to culture. I tis a lamentable fact that nothing, except wheat, c lover, timothy, and flax seed, bear transportation; consequently, little attention is paid to any thing more than a bare supply of home consumption. Give hogs were currently sold and bought last summer at                                                                                                                                                             $1 50 per cut. Any of our farmers have resolved to raise no more than a bare supply for their own families. It would afford me the greatest pleasure to give you a more perfect account of our agricultural affairs, bat 1 cannot. I should be more than wanting in common courtesy not to acknowledge my highest respects for the favor of your agricultural report for the year 1847, duly received, and also the honor conferred on me, and the confidence reposed in me, by again for warding your circular" to me, who can can so ill y repay such high considerations. I shall be happy, at any time, to contribute in any way that my feeble efforts may be available. I would gladly send you some specimens of <a name="seeds31"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, did I know x. a. 537 how to convey them' with safety. I inquired last fall of several gentlemen who I thought could inform, but they could not. With high considerations of respect, I remain yours, &cJAS. D. Summers. Ll on. Edmund Burke. Laporte, I Ndi Ana, November 6, 1848. Dear Of R: In accordance with your request, I have the honor here with to transmit a partial answer to the questions forwarded to me in your circular. I am unable to answer but few of the questions you desire, but I will endeavor to give you such information of this section i of country as I am able to do. Vapor te is the most northwest county of the State, bordering on take Michigan. Michigan City is our seaport, and Vapor te is the county seat, located on a prairie called Door Prairie. We have good water, first rate timber of every variety, from the scrub by beaver oak to the lofty pine. We have no good stone, but we have clay that makes a good article of brick. We have many small lakes, the waters of which are as pure and as limp id as the waters of Take Erie or Michigan. Our town, Vapor te, is situated on one of them. We are in a high attitude, where we can see waters flow to the Gulf of Mexico, and at the same time see others flow that fall into the Gulf of It. Lawrence. Consequently we have a good country for sheep, which do well here; they are as healthy here as in any country I ever knew. There is more attention paid to wool growing than heretofore. Heat is the staple product of the county, yet there is a large quantity of corn raised and some hogs fattened for the eastern market. Heat is sown in September, from the first to the last of the month, and many have sown as late as the middle of October, on account of fear of the fly, which had done much damage last year, and, on the whole, we had rather a light crop. The fly did much damage in many places, and then we had a very unfavorable time for harvesting our crops, grass as well as grain. Heat suffered very much by the wet season; most of the wheat was injured. It grew standing, and if the rains had continued many days more, we should have lost our entire crop; but, fortunately, the weather cleared away, and we had some eight or nine days' good weather, when we had a return of the rain. However, most of the crop was cut and in shock, and some drawn in, but the greater proportion was out. At this time the rains did not continue so incessantly as before, so that the wheat was got in between shower, but generally in a bad condition. Good wheat has brought this fall something like from 75 to 95 cents. Dora was worth this summer, at Michigan City, from 25 to 371 cents. We have this year a new wheat drill introduced among us, which promises well. It comes to us highly recommended by those who have used it. It is the Calling drill, patented, I believe, in 1845.538Ex. the have had a bad season to test them, as it has been sq very wet the land should be dry and in good condition to have them work well. Our corn crop is good this year over an average crop The o at crop is rather light; 20 to 25 bushels of wheat, with good cultivation, may be considered an average crop, although we sometimes raise much more. I have raised 50 bushels to the acre, which was an average of the field; 40 to 50 bushels of corn maybe considered an average to the acre when under good cultivation much more, however, has been raised. It is not uncommon for corn to yield 75 to 80 bushels, and sometimes 100 and over, under very high cultivation; 50 bushels of oats to the acre is considered a good yield, yet we sometimes get 75 to 80. We have heretofore raised the best kind of <a name="potatoes138"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; but we, like poor I re land, have suffered with the rot, which first made its appearance among us last year. We lost more than one half the crop. This year we are still worse off; I think we have lost three-fourths of the crop, if not more. About the last week in July they commenced to rot, and continued for about three weeks. All this time we had a very humid atmosphere, when the weather cleared away and the rot ceased. Since then I have not discovered any attacks of the rot. I r on ore is found in great abundance in this vicinity. We have bad an extensive steam furnace erected in Vapor te this season. The iron is said to be of the best quality. I have omitted to give you the per cent. of increase or decrease of our wheat crop. I can only say that our wheat was literally destroyed last winter by being winter killed, a thing that never happened to us before, as our soil is not of that character to heave and freeze out the wheat crop. It did not at this time heave; the way I account for it is this: the earth was hard frozen when the snow fell, and in the month of January we had a thaw and heavy rain, which thawed the ground about half out, when it turned cold very sudden, freezing the earth very hard, and when the spring opened we found our wheat was killed. I think the freeze so completely closed the pores of the earth when it was so full of water, that it excluded the air entirely. Vegetable life as well as animal must have air, and being deprived of it by this means I consider the cause of the failure. Hours, most respectfully, B. M. Newki Of. Of on. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. I forgot to say anything about our harvesting machines, so I will attach this in the proper place. A considerable portion of the wheat and o at crop have been harvested by or cut by machinespropelled by horse power. Quite a number of the Mccormackmachines have been put in operation this season. I cut my wheat and oats with a Good ward machine, patented in 1815, a model of which you of course have; the principle of which I like much be tax. a. 539 her than any I have yet seen. I think it is destined to be improved upon, and made to do our harvesting much better and faster, and also much cheaper, than to cut with cradles by hand. Hennepi N, November 17, 1848. Of R: I have, with the assistance of Williams on Barley, esq, to whom the enclosed circular of queried was addressed, endeavored to answer the interrogations therein contained, and now transmit it to you. The estimates are founded, in part, on the census of the county in 1845,) in my office, and partly on the c amputations of citizens of the county, whose means of knowing are very good; so that I think it is tolerably correct, at least. The county, viz: Putnam county, I illinois, contains about 4- townships of six miles square, or 96,000 acres of land. As to the quantity of land in cultivation, it is hard to form any correct idea. The most persons with whom spoke about it, seemed to think about one fifteenth part; and some even went as high as one twenty fifth part. I have set it down at one tenth part, as the nearest approximation to the correct quantity, but do not pretend to know. The crops have increased greatly in quantity since last year, except the <a name="potato67"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, which, I think, is not so large, owing to the effects of the <a name="potato68"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, which has reduced the quantity one fifth, perhaps, al thou go there was more planted this season than last. The <a name="potato69"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of last year, I should think, averaged near 150 bushels to the acre, while that of this year will not average more than 100 bushels to the acre. There has been a favorable change, lately, in the minds of the people in regard to the cultivation of fruit. There is beginning to be considerable attention paid to this important part of agriculture lately; so that we have now several very good orchards in the county, and a good many others in fair progress. Apples do very well. Reaches do not do quite so well, on account of being cut off about every other season by the late frosts c. The weather during the planting season was tolerable cool, with frequent rains, and on the whole was more favorable this season than it was last season, or has been commonly; was warmer while growing and at harvest. The <a name="potato70"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot is the only disease which has affected the crops this year. The probable per cent age of loss by it has been given. Heat is principally sown on corn ground, at a cost which I estimate at                         $4 per acre, as follows For putting in (per are. .a. .a. .a. .a. .a.   $0.50For seed, , .a. . .a. .a. .a. .a. . .a. .a. 00 For cutting, .a. .a. .a. .a. .a. . 1 0 For threshing, C .a. .a. .a.

Heat and oats are commonly threshed in the field; sometimes without having been stacked or put into a barn. <a name="potatoes139"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> yield well on any kind of land wheat or corn stubble. The cost of raising <a name="potatoes140"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, &c, is about the same as corn, except the digging, which costs more. The probable average consumption per individual, of wheat, &c cannot estimate with any degree of certainty, but suppose it to be near 10 bushels of wheat, 2 bushels of corn, 5 bushels of <a name="potatoes141"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and 200 pounds of beef and pork to the individual. I have now answered all the interrogations contained in the circular to the best of my abilities. I regret that I have not the means in my, power of doing it more satisfactorily to myself, and more certainly for you. I have already extended this communication longer than you will perhaps desire to read, but you can probably g lean something from it which will enable you with more certainty to calculate, in regard to the correctness of the answers given. I should be very happy to communicate anything which lay in my power, which might tend to facilitate you in making calculations to be embodied in the able report which annually emanated from your office, or add to the interest of such report. I am, sir, with much respect, your most obedient servant, Geo. Dent. On. Edmund Buxrke, Commissioner of Patents. Arensvi    Lle, Cass County, I Lli Noi S, December 13, 1848. Of a: Your circulars, calling for agricultural statistics for the year 1848, would have received an earlier answer' but not being able to furnish the desired information in the manner requested, I endears. 
541vored to get some one more able than myself to form the estimates and transmit the replies, without success. There are no agricultural societies or farmers' clubs in this or adjoining counties nor has the county assessor taken any trouble to obtain information, (which I hope will be hereafter) my personal observation and experience admit of a brief reply only. Last winter was a mild one; the season for planting in the spring favorable; the balance of the year up to this time rather wet, and less heat during summer than usual. The wheat harvest produced one fourth more than the preceding year. Worn stood very well, but produces less, say 20.7 per acre; the quantity planted exceeds that of any former season, and the aggregate product will not be less than in 1847. Oats, rye, barley and buckwheat are not extensively cultivated, though the yield of each kind is equal to any former year. <a name="potatoes142"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> suffered in places by rot; nevertheless, the crop is an average one. *the hay crop was large the quality indifferent, in consequence of the wet season, the grasses having lodged, and not well cured. The product of the orchard generally good, except peaches and grapes, the latter being affected with the rot. There is an advance in the raising of stock, especially cattle and hogs. I indian corn cannot be raised here for less than 9 cents per bushel and delivered in the crib on the plantation; and, in my opinion, such will be to und to be the average expense in the corn growing States of the west. The consumption of I indian corn for hogs, during the twelvemonth preceding to being killed, may be set down at twenty bushels per head, which will greatly increase the home consumption, as estimated by you in the report of 1847. Wages of female help, (domestics a name not popular here from five to eight dollars per month; mechanics receive from                                                                                                                                                             $1 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.50 peri day, and boarding. Below, you find a table of exports during the year ending the 1st December. Beards town is the only point on the I illinois river in pass county; and the produce exported, with the exception of pork, is raised in Pass county. Dogs are brought to this point from the adjoining counties, and the large quantity killed and contracted for this season over last is not altogether owing to an increase, which is estimated at about 10 per cent; the demand here and facilities for packing this winter is the main cause. The price for hogs is                                               $2.50 per 100 pounds, net; a few days ago, one lot of 100 head, averaged 320 pounds, net, per head; this lot is rather superior. The entire average of all the hogs killed during the season may beset down at 230 pounds. Respectfully, your obedient servant, F. Aren. On. Edmund Burke. Exports of grain at Beards town, from the 1st December, 1847,to 1st December, 1818: Heat, 100,000 bushels, average price 655 42 X. cents per bushel; I indian corn, 150,000 bushels, averaged 25 cents per bushel. The number of hogs killed for export last year, 28,000; this year killed and contracted for to be killed, 55,000. The grain exported is the product of Pass county. The population amounts to about 6,500; the area of the county is equal to 396sqfiare miles, not more than a quarter of which is in cultivation. The export of other grain, <a name="potatoes143"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and the product of the dairy, is considerable; and the fattening of steers, which are sold to d rovers, and carried south and east, form a considerable item of the farming operation of the county. Mendon, Adams County, I Lli Noi S, January 10, 1849. Dear Of R: A copy of your reports for 1847 has been placed in my hands, and although a borrowed one, I can safely say that I have not per used a volume with more satisfaction for a twelvemonth than the one last issued from your office. The wheat crop of 1848 was not as good as that of 1847; and besides, it was considerably injured by heavy rains soon after harvest. From the 10th of August to September, we had a perfect deluge of water; it was difficult to get a wagon or horses into the harvest field, the ground was so soft; and before we could get as tack built it was very likely to be pickled down with rain water. Thousands of bushels were entirely lost in' the shock as it stood in the field. Any stacks were ruined by being put up in an imperfect manner, and some lost after it was threshed out. The consequences are easily foreseen, that a large quantity of the flour which will be sent into market will be mixed with the flour made from grown grain, which may. possibly affect the market for the next season; at the same time, the flour which is then sent into market may be manufactured from better grain, and not injured by the wet weather in the least. We can raise as good wheat in northern and central I illinois as they can in western New Work, when we once conform to their tillage system. Good prairie, broken in the month of June, cross ploughed and sown by the 12th of September, will produce 25 bushels of wheat to the acre, and a pretty sure crop at that. This is our first and best method of raising wheat. Our next plan is to put the land in corn, and in the month of September or October we sow wheat in the corn, and run a plough through the corn in the same manner of sloughing corn. This a very cheap way of raising a wheat crop, and we get from 10 to 15 bushels per acre. The third way is to turn the stubble under in August or September, (wheat or o at stubble) sow on the seed, and run over it twice or three times, and our wheat crop is sown. By this method we usually get from 10 to 20 bushels to the acre. Our corn crops we manage in a little better way. Of the corn crops follows wheat, it is a most excellent method to turn the stubble under in the fall; all that is necessary in the spring is to give x. a. 543 it a good narrowing, lay off the corn road, and plant the seed. I n 1847, by' this method of cultivating, I raised 87 bushels to the acre, with no other tending than what a good horse and plough could give it. I am told by eastern people that western pork and land do not bring as good prices in their markets by about one third or one half as the pork and land which is fatted at the east. For some time I was sorely puzzled to solve the query, for I well knew that we certainly had as good a breed of hogs, and that I could discover nothing inferior in the quality of our corn. At last I came to the conclusion that the fault was in neither, but that a large portion of the pork fatted at the west is, in reality, mast fed pork. A little corn may be given to the hogs for a month or two before killing time just enough to call it corn fed pork. Again, distilleries are rising up on every side, and thousands and tens of thousands of hogs are fatted on still slops, and sent into market and sold somewhere and to somebody. And yet again, in a grain growing country like ours we must have mills to grind it, and no miller can make 60 pounds of super fine flour from 60 pounds of wheat; there will, of course, be some br an, shorts, &c. Now, where mills are driven by steam power, the expense of fitting up a steam box and running a small pipe from the boiler into it, is comparatively nothing; and then they have an excellent place for cooking the ban, shorts and middlings into food for hogs, and once a year a steam mill can turn out a large number of br an mash pork hogs. There is no part of our proud and happy republic that can produce better or fairer fruit, especially apples, than central I illinois. I have walked through orchards the last fall, 1848, where were hundreds of bushels of lustrous apples; and I searched, but in vain, for one defective or worm y apple. It could not be found. All were fair and suitable for market; and although large quantities were raised in our county, all found a ready market at from 50 to 75 cents per bushel, and at this time none are to be had in the market. There is probably no food more natural to mankind than a good ripe apple. It is antidyspeptic and anti bilious; and if the people in this great valley of the west would eat less corn bread and bacon, and drink less strong coffee and whiskey, and eat more of those rich, juice apples, cooked or un cooked, we should see, hear .and feel less of those bilious complaints, fevers, agues and chills, which every one is more or less subject to every season. Very young farmer can very easily start an orchard, and at a trifling expense. Of he only has the will, he may be sure to find the way. Good grafted fruit trees of three or four years old can be had at our nur series in any quantity for a picayune or a bit a piece or if he does not feet able or willing to be at that expense, he can follow my plan 'of starting an orchard. In the spring of 1839 I bought 100 needling apple trees for                      $8, and paid in work. I planted them out in my garden in rows four feet apart, that I might run a plough between them, and at five feet apart in the rows, and kept them well cultivated that season. In the spring of 1810, in the early part of March, I procured 544 X. from the best orchard I could find (john Goods, e squire, Quincy two or three large bundles of s icons, cut from horizontal branches of the last years growth. These I buried in my garden three inches under ground till I should want them. When the season was so far advanced that the buds on the trees began to crack open and the small leaves to appear, I dug a trench along each line of apple trees about six inches deep and about the same width. I then bent down an apple tree, and, with a fork stick drove into the ground, held it there firmly; then, with a sharp pointed strong knife and a hammer, I commenced grafting. First, I drove the knife through the tree at the root, and made a cleft large enough to insert my schon. I then with a sharp knife cut my schon about six inches long, sharpened the lower end to a wedge like form, drove it into the cleft until the bark on the schon just met the bark on the tree; pulled out my large 'knife; the split in the tree of course closed up and held my schon fast. In five or six inches I stuck in another, and continued on so until I came to the top of the tree. I then filled up the trench with fine loose soil, tramping it down with my feet, leaving only the upper bud out of the earth. The top of the tree I covered up in the same way, leaving the ends of the twigs just out of the ground. In this way I treated my 100 apple trees, and in two days' time I had finished them. I would remark that the trees were about 1 inches in diameter, and very thrifty. The s icons grew astonishingly well. Of about 800 scionsset, all grew but about 20; and in two years the s icons had formed roots of their own, so that when I took them up I broke off the old stalk and threw it away, and each twig of the top grew and formed roots of its own. Thus, by a little industry and management, I made 200 good grafted trees for my own use, now bearing trees, and sold 1,OUO trees, spine for 6 to the dollar and some at 8 to the dollar. Very truly, yours, Of  Mothy Dudley. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents, Washington city, D. C. Of Salle, Monroe To, Of Chi Gan, November 20, 1848. I here with return your "circular" with such returns as I have been able to gather during the limited time it has been before me for, by some fatal it, it did not reach me until late in October. The results of the wheat crop (our staple) for the current year, are very conflicting. There the old varieties were sown, the insect (hessian fly) injured it very much. There the Mediterranean blue stem, Etrurian, and Virginia May (to us new varieties) were sown the crop was very fine, and yielded abundant. The Mediterranean, with me, averaged 27) bushels per acres x. while the old varieties, "hutchinson and red chaff bald" did not reach quite 10 bushels per acre, with the same soil and tillage; in fact, in the same field. I find the cost of raising my wheat crop this year, to wit, 242 10th cents per bushel, falls below the average given in my statement last year. I sold crops in October for                                                                                                                                                             $1.03 and                                                                                                                                                             $1.06. The greater portion of my wheat was sown after barley. The growth of straw after this crop appears to be less than any other have yet tried as a fore crop. Even lands hitherto deemed too rich for wheat, succeed well, treated in this manner. The growing wheat stands up well, and ri pens without rust. Will this mode of culture admit of general practice? Of so, its economy is apparent for it is obvious that, on all well improved lands, the tedious, expensive, and (to the soil) injurious process of summer following may be dispensed with; and, in its stead, with the same labor, nearly, and in the tame time occupied in following, a regenerating crop may be raised and marketed, before the ordinary sowing season arrives, whose profit will more than repay the preparatory expense of the ensuing wheat crop. For does the process interfere in any way with the proper rotation of crops; for barley succeeds equally well with me on c lover lea, old pasture, or corn stubble with fall sloughing; which is, after all, in my estimation, the true mode of following. Respectfully, your obedient servant, S. M. Bartlett. In. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Plymouth, Wayne To. Of Chi Gan, November 22, 1848. In answer to your letter requesting the comparative amounts of increase or decrease of the crops of this current year, as compared with those of the year 1847, together with other information relating to the condition of Michigan, it may be proper here to state, that, from the best information derived by observation, and from the practical cultivates of the soil, some portions of the State have been more highly favored than others in crops. In the counties of Oak land, A comb, A peer, Genesee, from good authority, it is stated that there has been harvested from 20 to 30 bushels per acre in this region. In the counties of Hayne, Washtenaw, and Monroe, the crop has fallen one third from former years in amount. In the counties of I no ham, Baton, Clinton, long a, Went, Livingston, andShiawassee, the crops have been good, with an increase of acres above the previous year. In the counties of Jackson, Calhoun, Kalamazoo, Branch, It. Josephs, Pass, Jena wee, Hillsdale, Illegal, An Buren, Carry, and Her rien, the crop will exceed the crop of the former year, although the early sowed wheat has suffered loss by the insect; while that sowed after the 15th of September18546ex. has produced a good yield. Therefore, taking the crop of the whole State, with the progression of improvement, the amount must exceed that of 1847. The corn and o at crops of the current year are also estimated to exceed those of 1847, owing to an increase of acres. The <a name="potato71"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is short. The vines suffered by the wet weather, and on the clay soils there has been a failure. In the sandy loam sand c lover lays the crop is good. The above named crops compose the staple of Michigan; the root crops are generally abundant. The cost of raising the before named crops heat crop The price of land, and interest of money, at six per cent, is estimated, according to the present tedious mode of cultivation, as follows 1.

The amount of fodder from the above crops forms quite a profitable item to the farmer in this State, for food and litter for his stock, and adds to the manure. Estimating the State to contain 400,000 inhabitants, and that each individual consumes on the average eight bushels of wheat, the amount consumed will be 3,200,000 bushels. The consumption of corn for bread stuff in Michigan does not amount to much, as the people make use of Heat flour for their bread stuff generally. Notwithstanding this large, consumption, added to the vast amount of seed annually sown- some 4,000,000 of bushels find their way to the eastern markets. Together with this surplus maybe added a surplus of wool, pork, butter and corn, so that the young State of Michigan begins to realize the balance of trade in her favor. It may not be out of place here to quote a few words from the reports of an able geological and topographical survey of the revered Ought on, Michigan: "the large rivers and infinity of small interior lakes .give the utmost facilities to internal navigation; add to this the superior quality of the soil, its easy tillage, the heavy and abundant crops, and perhaps the whole is not surpassed by any section of equal extent on the surface of the globe The amount of rain.

Dr. Duffield, of Detroit, through the politeness of Dr. W. W. Dark ham, and it shows an uncommon amount of rain. The rain commenced on the 4th day of July, and, as you see, we have had a wet harvest and seeing time; the planting season in the spring was fair. Since 1836, we have had no season half so wet as this, and even that season was not so wet. The interesting548Ex. reflections arising from facts of a similar character, in the natural world, are admirably adapted to that class of contemplation which reaches that all flesh is but grass, compared with the power that established the foundation of the universe, and marshal led the heavenly hosts, and which instituted those unerring laws to govern the whole. As for the climate of Michigan, it is generally salubrious; as the great lakes wash three sides of the State, her climate is uncommonly b mild for the latitude she occupies. The face of the State is, on the whole, gently rolling, and her soil well mixed with phosphates of lime, salt of notre, potash, and alluvial matter. The soil brought from the deep wells, in various regions of the State, will grow vegetables luxuriantly, and even trees have been found, to great depths in the earth among the highest hills in the State. More might be said touching this interesting subject, but time and space will not permit. A new mode of cultivation is about taking the place of the old soil destroying system, viz: to plough but once for a crop, roll down the turf, and then let it remain for decomposition cultivate the surface to keep down weeds and grass. For this process, N. I dess wheel cultivate or is the thing itself; it does. up the work most admirably, and for the next crop this turf forms a fertilizes, while the surface with the vegetable matter is turned under to form another by the process of decomposition; the soil having been rolled down in a compact state, not much is lost by evaporation. Theploughing should be graduated in proportion to the variety of soils and proportion of heat so far as the heat penetrates the surface, the tendency is upward. In sustaining and supporting vegetable life, as for the rolling process, every farmer knows where he turns his teams there he has the best crop; and when he looks on the forest, and be holds the majestic pine penetrating the clouds, and by its side the sturdy oak defying the tempest, how is it that they have attained this mighty grandeur without cultivation? The fact is, that the earth has suffered no loss by .evaporation. A few words in continuation of this new mode of cultivating the soil. It is matter of history in some of our older States, and in many portions of the old world, that, where thousands of our race, through a mistaken zeal for gain, have followed the soil destroying system, so styled, by exposing it to the atmosphere, so that its best properties have passed off in the vapor, this process has been going on from generation to generation, until those lands have been exhausted and abandoned; and, in the final destruction, them is guided cultivates have met the common fate of exhausted energies, while in those old regions, where the cultivates of the soil have been governed by the common sense principle of preserving the soil and its properties, it improves by cultivation. In some parts of Germany, where the soil has been under cultivation for two thousand years, it is far better now than when first commenced. All of which is submitted to your consideration; and anything in x. a. 549 my power which may be given, that may add to the very useful reports of your office, will be most cheerfully granted. With the highest esteem, truly, your friend. Jonathan Sheaver. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Falls Of Of. Croi x, It. Croix county, Wisconsin, October 26, 1848. In: Your circular of this year reached me some time since. I have delayed answering for some time, to enable me to collect what little information the means at my command would enable me to do so. I find that all the crops of various kinds raised in this section will exceed by fifty per cent. the amount raised last year. The season has been generally good, though a late frost in the fore part of the month of June somewhat injured a few fields of corn; but, notwithstanding, it has been as a general thing more than an average crop. This section of country is fast improving; it is but just commencing, I may say, to settle. This year was our first land sale. This will have a tendency to make the settlement more permanent, and steady in its advance. Any people, I find, have been of the opinion heretofore that we were so far north that some of the small grains could not be raised; but as the country becomes more known, those opinions will be exploded. I m migration is now beginning to flow in, more extended farms to be opened, and the capabilities of the country for agricultural purposes more fully developed. The farmers in this section have a most excellent home market. Being in the vicinity of immense pine forests, the supply will not equal the demand for a long time, if ever; as, when the pine is exhausted, I am of the opinion that mineral will be found; so you see that our distance from the eastern market is a benefit rather than a detriment. We have not yet formed any agricultural societies. Either blight or insects have yet disturbed any of our crops, except <a name="potatoes144"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; they have this year been visited by the rot to considerable extent in some fields, while in others they were not affected; but no person can pretend to account for the cause; one thing appears to affect them in one place, and in another it apparently has directly the contrary effect, and by all I can learn, either from your reports or from various periodicals, it is the same all over the country. Numbering is our principal business. There has this year been sent out of this river (the It. Croix) twelve millions of s awed lumber, worth, at the mills, ten dollars per thousand feet, making a total of one hundred and twenty thousand dollars; also two m il 550 X. lions feet of saw logs, worth here                            $5 per thousand, making a total of                                                                                                                                                                                             $10,000. Considerable has heretofore been done in the fur, trade; but as other interests increase, that is diminishing. White people are crowding the I indians back, and the fur bearing animals are also diminishing in numbers. This must soon be a fine grazing country. Our winters mild, store cattle as yet require no foddering, but will live and increase in flesh on the extensive beds of rushes that abound in the country but as it fills up they will gradually disappear, as they do not grow fast. More hay will then be required; but any quantity of the wild kinds can be had for                          $3 per ton. I am of the opinion that when well cured and in season, it is two thirds as nutritiousas the best varieties of tame half hope ere many years to be able to give a more full and flattering account of the agricultural, interests of this country. The <a name="seeds32"><mark>seeds</mark></a> which were sent me last spring from your office were thank fully received; but sufficient time has not yet been had to test the value of them; it will at least require two years to get them fairly acclimated. The Patent Office report which I received lately is a valuable work. Of more of them could be distributed in the country, they would be of great service, and, I think, would be a great means of inducing the farmers to enter more scientific ally into their business; that, in my opinion, would be the best way of distributing a portion of the proceeds of the sales of public lands; let the people have light, and they will improve by it, and eventually build their own railroads, canals, and harbors, without any assistance from the general government. Accompanying this I send you a small sample of the wild rice which a bounds in this country. I am in hopes some of the grains will be whole when you receive it; but it is so hard and brittle that it is somewhat doubtful. The I indians gather large quantities of it; their method of doing which is, they pass through amongst it with their canoes before it gets quite ripe and collect the heads together in a handful, and give them a twist, so that they will stay together; this prevents them falling down into the water. When quite ripe, they again pass along in their canoes and bend these clusters of heads over into them, and with a small stick beat out the grains. In this manner two of them will collect three or four bushels in a day. Their methods of using it are either top arch it over a slow fire, and then mix it with a little sugar, and in that manner eat it; or to boil it and mix a little grease with it, if they have any, or if not, to eat without anything to make it relish. White men have frequently lived on it in that manner for several days, and found it very nourishing. We use a great deal of it in the same way as the southern rice is used, and find it quite as pal a table, and I believe much more nutritions. I have thought sometimes it might be cultivated to great extent, and made an article of commerce. The I indians frequently sow it when they find a good place for it, if it is not already growing spontaneously. X. a. 551 All matters from your office will be at all times thank fully received. I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant, Joseph Bonson. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Now London, Henry To, I Owa, October 29, 1848. Dear Of R: Your circular asking for information was duly received. I should have replied sooner, but I waited to collect what information lay within my reach on what I consider a very important subject. After all, I have to regret the small amount of information which I can send you. The cod in ty is as yet too new to collect any statistics of the aggregate of the different crops which can be relied on. But I will begin with them in the order in which they are placed in your circular. Wheatthere was probably more sown last fall than in the fall of 1816, but it was very badly winter killed, and the rust injured the remainder, so that there is very little prime winter wheat. I shall set down winter wheat at 10 per cent. less than in 1847, but from the winter wheat coming in short, there -was more spring wheat sown, of which there were good crops. And taking the two together, I think I may set down an increase of 10 per cent. Barleythere was very little raised here. The crop was rather light, owing to the dry weather in May. I shall set it down at a decrease of 5 per cent. Average per acre, 15 bushels. Oatsthe season was very favorable for this crop, which, with greater breadth sown, increased the aggregate about 20 per cent. They are used principally for feeding stock at home. Average per acre, 35 bushels. Ryethere is not enough of this grain raised to furnish data on which to form an estimate. The cause I shall put at the low price and small yield. Buckwheatthis is raised generally over the country in small parcels for domestic use. The warm weather in August and ,september forced the sap into the straw so long, that it left no time for the grain to mature before frost, which made the crop very light, say 8 bushels per acre, and a decrease of 25 per cent. I indian corn his is truly the great staple of the west, and is constantly increasing. The weather this year was very favorable for the growth of the stalk, but the drought at the time it was shooting for ear caused the ears to be rather light. The crop in 1817 was uncommonly heavy, and I think there is a falling off 12 or 15 per cent. per acre. But there was a large increase in the ground devoted to this crop. To I think there is an increase of the aggregate of about 33 per cent. Produce per acre, 40 bushels. <a name="potatoes145"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> are cultivated here almost expressly for the table, as the ease with which grain is raised renders it much cheaper food552Ex. Doc.  No. 59.for stock than <a name="potatoes146"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which causes them to be planted in small pieces. And it is very uncommon to see an acre of them in one piece. The rot or plague has never spread in this section of country before this year, when it appeared very unexpectedly, so much so that but very few experiments were tried to prevent it. Those which were planted very early escaped almost entirely, while those which were planted late in the season, were, in some cases, not worth digging, and, almost without an exception, very much injured. The loss was probably full 50 per cent. Haythis was somewhat light in consequence of the drought in the early part of the season. But still a very fair crop, say 11 tons per acre is realized. And as meadows are constantly increasing, there was a gain of about 10 per cent. The best meadow has proved to be herds grass and c lover mixed at the rate of four qu arts herds grass to four quarts of c lover per acre. Orchardthere is a continued increase of attention, and orchards are constantly being planted, although there are very few apples raised here yet, owing to the newness of the country. But what few orchards are old enough bear very fine fruit. Reaches are a very uncertain crop, owing to the severe winters. But this year there was a tolerable supply raised, which sold readily at 75 cents per bushel; apples                                                                                                                                                             $1 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.25 per bushel. Stock of all kinds are constantly increasing, and this is to be eventually one of the greatest stock raising countries in the world. I think we may safely put down the increase of all kinds at 15 percent. There are many of our largest farmers turning their attention more to sheep on account of the ease with which wool is transported to the eastern market, as all our produce has to find its way to the southern and eastern markets. There are some large flock of Peri no and Saxony sheep here which are doing well. There isa considerable amount of wool annually exported to Boston andPhilapelphia, which nets the owner 20 to 35 per cents per pound, according to the quality. I shall set the increase of sheep ,and wool at 20 per cent. Hogsthe increase of corn has brought a corresponding increase of hogs, which I think may be set down at 25 per cent. Their average weight when slaughtered, 250 pounds. Price                                                                                                                                                             $1.75to                                               $2 per hundred pounds.

But that amount is rapidly increasing. And should the Usage orange come up to the expectation of many who are now trying it for he doing, our large prairies will soon be turned into fine farms.

Prevalence of blight or insects; probable per cent age of loss by them, &c. ?x. a. 555 Answer. There has been considerable loss from the ravages of an insect, called here chin ch bug, on our fall wheat. They are a small insect resembling a ignat, but never fly. It commences on the young corn in the spring; but if not numerous, does little injury, seldom killing any. Last fall it was very bad on wheat. But of a field of prairie sod, containing 40 acres, we had not more than 150 bushels, 15 acres entirely killed; so that we had to sow spring wheat on it, and this last crop was somewhat injured by lit. Our case, however, is not a general one; but few of the kind in the county. In an average crop, we would have made 1,000 bushels, or 25 bushels per acre, as sod is our best ground for wheat. To remedy is yet found; burning the stubble destroys a great many; it is on the decline now as to the per cent. of loss. From the additional quantity sown, we think the crops of fall wheat will be about an average crop with 1847; and the crop of spring wheat, perhaps 20 per cent. more, from additional quantity sown. The wet ness of our fall season has caused the <a name="potatoes147"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to rot. There is, perhaps, about 25 per cent. of loss on that crop. To other insects heard of worth mentioning. As to the cost of raising wheat, corn, &c, per bushel 1' am unable to form a satisfactory estimate; and also the average consumption per individual of wheat, &c. The red chaff bearded wheat is most successful; price per bushel, prime, 60 cents. Worn, 12 cents oats, 13 cents. Of rye, very little raised. Buckwheat not much raised.

Of R: Owing to being absent from home, and a pressure of business, I have delayed to respond to your circular until this late day; but if anything I can make out of such meagre information as it is possible for me to obtain is of any value, I shall be glad of having furnished it. I thought of sending some wild grass <a name="seeds33"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, but learned that our best varieties are known in some localities at the east. For Machine county, our stable product is wheat; of which, we estimate the growth of 1848 at 160,000 bushels 25 per cent. over 1847; the insect did not work in the spring on it; average (say 17 bushels per acre; price 40 to 47 cents. Next in importance is corn; say 100,000 bushels 25 per cent over 1847. More planted and better ripened. May 35 bushels per acre. Price 31 to 47 cents. <a name="potatoes149"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, 40,000 bushels 50 per cent less than 1847; cause, the disease. Price 50 to 100 cents. Oats 100,000 bushels 25 per cent. over 1847. Price, 18 to 47 cents; 40 bushels per acre. Eye, 10,000 bushels 20 per cent. over 1847; 30 bushels per acre. Price, 37 cents. Buckwheat, 30,000 bushels 20 per cent over 1847; 15 bushels per acre. Price, 25 cents. Barley 15,000+20 per cent. over 1847; 20 bushels per acre. Price, 40 to 47 cents. One of the most important branches of business in this county is the rearing of cattle. There are probably 40,000, worth                                                                                                                                                                                             $10 ahead 20 per cent. over 1847. Beef is worth                                               $2.75 per cut. A large amount of pork is fatted, at a loss of                                                                                                                                                             $1.50 per cut.

Poultry innumerable. Chickens worth 12 cents; eggs 7 cents per dozen. But little tame hay is cut yet, and stock is kept chiefly on wild hay and coarse fodder. Large quantities of flax are raised here, and more to the west of us, for seed. The lint is thrown away for want of skill to turn it to some profitable account, and for want of hands to do more with it. I suppose persons having capital and skill in the dressing and manufacture. of flax might turn the lint to great profit. Perhaps about 40 per cent. of our wheat is exported, and nearly all our other grains are consumed at home and in the lumber trade x. on Take Michigan. Some corn and barley, however, is sent east, arid a large amount of hides, some pork, beef, &c, &e. Too much land is under cultivation, and more crops raised than can possibly be secured. The greatest source of profit to the farmers in general is in their stocks of horned cattle, which is raised chiefly on the spontaneous products of the prairies, and the straw and corn fodder fed in the field. Horses, also, are very profitable to raise here. Cheese is worth 7 cents per lb, and butter 12. The season since the 1st of July has been cool, and excessively stormy, which caused a great waste of grain and hay, and prevented the putting in of as much wheat as usual; but the prospect is unusually good for what is on the ground. Now is now near 18 inches deep, and the mercury at 130 this morning, December 22, below zero. With the exception of peaches, the prospect is fair, beyond expectation, for the successful cultivation of all the fruits grown in the northern States. Trees grow thriftyly, and the fruits are very fair and good; but most grapes rotted badly last summer, and the late varieties, as the I s abel las, did not ripe n perfectly, although they did m not rot. There is increased attention paid to the culture of fruit among farmers and others. The past season has been a healthy one. The roads between the ports on the lake and the interior, have been almost utterly impossible for several months, causing incalculable loss and embarrassment to the business of both country and cities, and a strong effort is making to project plank roads from the lake towns, westward, into the interior of the country.

Wheelock, Robertson County, Texas, November 14, 1848. Of R- In reply to your circular of queried issued from the Patentoffice this year, calling for information in relation to agricultural statistics, &c, &c, I would state that it is difficult in this country to obtain the information required to make a satisfactory report of the state of agriculture. Our population is small, arid scattered 5 58 X. over a wide extent of country, and we have no agricultural societies to aid in the collection and dissemination of agricultural knowledge. I will, however, give you the best information I have been able to collect from the counties of Grass os, Leon, Robertson, Limestone, Navarro and Dallas, lying between Grass os and Trinity rivers, and embracing about seven thousand square miles. In all these counties there are vast quantities of land of the best quality uncultivated, yet well adapted to the growth of almost every kind of agricultural products. From this region of country, cotton and hides are the principal articles of export. I indian corn, wheat, cattle, horses and mules, all find a ready home market, the proceeds of which, together with the funds arising from the sale of lands, keep up a supply of currency sufficient to meet the wants of business. Considerable attention is beginning to be paid to the growth of wheat, the quantity raised increasing as you proceed north. The time of sowing in this county is from the 15th of November to the 1 5th of December; quantity sowed per acre, -to 1 bushel; time of harvesting, from the 25th of May to the 10th of June; average yield per acre, 30 bushels. The Mexican wheat, the red chaff, and several varieties from the north and east, do well. The whole quantity raised will be sown and consumed within the year. The average price,                                                                                                                                                             $1 per bushel; cost of production, 25 cents a bushel. I increase of production this year over 1817, in the six counties named above, 33 per cent. In the upper portion of the country mentioned above, and still further north, in the country bordering on Red river, the production of wheat is increasing very rapidly; and were there a cheap and expeditions mode of conveyance to the Galveston and Houston markets, large quantities of wheat would shortly be forwarded to those places for shipment to distant markets. The same remarks will also apply to the increase of the cotton and other crops. The want of proper modes of conveying heavy and bulky articles of produce from this fertile part of Texas will be more seriously felt every year. The following will be found tolerably correct estimates of the number of cattle, &c, and the production of the six counties named, for 1848, compared with the production of 1847 Estimate for Grass os county.

I wish <a name="potatoes153"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, not known; production increasing. The number of horses and mules, cattle, hogs, and sheep, are estimated about 50 per cent. more than in Robertson county.

Estimate of Njavarro and Dallas counties for 1848. Number of bales of cotton, not known, but as yet but little raised, although the soil and climate are well adapted& to its growth; the raising of bread stuffs and cattle being more profitable, to supply the rapidly increasing population. Number of bushels of wheat, 35,000 to 40,000; the production increasing, as well as that of oats and rye. Price of wheat,                                                                                                                                                             $1;corn, 50 cents. Buckwheat has not been cultivated in either of these counties. The number of horses, mules and cattle is very large and rapidly increasing, the pasturage being good the whole year. The number of sheep is also increasing, and will become profitable to the farmer of this country. There are but few fine sheep in Texas. They would meet with a ready market from other States. There is pork enough made in these two counties for the consumption of the present population, but none for any other market; and should there be much immigration this winter, the deficiency would have to be supplied from other sources. The present price of pork is about                                                                                                                                                             $1 per 100 lbs. The above estimates are made from information obtained of respectable farmers and others living in the various counties. The number of live stock is believed to be estimated too low, as I have added but a small per cent. to the number reported last year, which was taken principally from the assessors' books of the different counties. The production of the dairy might be made profitable, but at present there is but little attention paid to the making of butter and cheese. Probably not more than 3,000 lbs. of butter were sent to Houston, our principal market, during the present year, and but very little cheese, and that of inferior quality, owing to want of skill in manufacturing. There is an abundant supply of poultry throughout the country; and honey, both wild and tame, sufficient for consumption, but none for exportation. The p each and plum are almost the only fruit trees yet cultivated. The vine and mulberry grow naturally in almost all parts of Texas. Battle in most parts of this country are ready sale, and commander. 561 money at fair prices. Dogs are principally fattened on a corns, and pork is ready sale at prices mentioned above. It is successfully cured here in the months of December, January and February, and always made into bacon. The price of transportation to market is 75 cents per 100 les for 100 miles; merchandise to the interior,                                                                                                                                                             $1 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.25 per 100 les for 100 miles. The wages of mechanics are                                                                                                                                                             $1 to                                               $2 per day and board; agriuiiltural labor black men,                      $8 to                                                                                                                                                                                             $10 per month; black women,                            $5 to            $7 per month. Erie quantity of produce raised in this extent of country may appear small; but it must be borne in mind that but six years ago the greatest part of it was used as a hunting ground by the I indians.

It is very probable that frequently the <a name="potato74"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease has been confounded with the curl disease, which had already before appeared as an epidemic, especially between 1776 and 1790, where the latter made itself well known as very destructive in the Netherlands and England 3. A general deter i oration of <a name="potatoes156"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> has been observed in Russia since the year 1800. Curl disease and spots of rust on the stalk, have been noticed, (stockman) the dry rot has prevailed since 1825, (a scholar of Thaers4.

The disease appeared more certainly as an epidemic first in Holland and Belgium, and then spread itself over the continent and to England, (Herberger, Locke 6. It at first began very violent, and its progress was extremely rapid, and exhibited the particular aspect that the seed tubes first rotted and did not terminate.

See Locke 8. We have collected the views of 70 esteemed natural philosophers, as well as agriculturists communicated to us and from their writings, and believe that of these probably one third of all are already known; and also have more than 210, well versed in the subject, who have given their opinion somewhat differently. But all these opinions may be ranged under the 7 following classes 9. The disease appears in every kind of <a name="potatoes158"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> at a definite564Ex. period of vegetation.

The disease was also checked in its progress by uniformityofmweather, especially by dryness; but it had a rapid progress generally with any changes and extremes of weather 12. The disease, since the first epidemic commencement, has gained much in extension, but fallen off in power, (intensity of appearance) which was particularly evident the last year. Ithe Fungus Theory.

Planting the seed tubes in whole or parts, is without any influence as to the existence of the disease. As to radical cure, there is none; but, as to a palliative one, the disease is rendered milder, and its extension has been lessened by some aids, of which the following deserve the most attention The cultivation of <a name="potatoes166"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in dry, loose, warm kinds of soil not of 'a binding nature, avoiding a fresh animal maturing; careful loosening, heaping up, shovel long; (which is done in the most imperfect manner with the common plough, but much better with the shovel and hilling plough, and best of all by hand) the digging out of the same, or gathering, in dry weather; drying off the tubes, and preservation in suitably constructed store houses, in dry, airy cellars, or even in well protected pits. We have mentioned the above in the general form of agricultural precautions. Washi Ngton, Vermont, a January 19, 1849. Of R: I have just finished the perusal of your report for 1847,which I received through the politeness of On. William Henry. Agreeably to the suggestions contained on pages 154 and 155 of that report, I have written out in an imperfect manner the result of my experience and observations in relation to the <a name="potato86"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in this vicinity for the last three years. The imperfect knowledge which I have of agriculture, chemistry, and physiology, will render me incapable of giving an elaborate article as one versed in the above sciences; but it will be a plain statement of facts, of which you can make such a disposition as you think proper570Ex. 1. The soil in. this vicinity is generally what is termed a "sandy loam" with a sub soil of either gravel or hard pan 2. The farm which I occupy lies on both sides of a small stream of water, running to the north, with narrow intervals on each side, and then rising into hills, extending in all directions, affording exposure to all points of the compass 3. The soil is moist in some places in others, dry; a field, which is cultivated frequently, embracing both varieties, has been cultivated about fifty years. The land, in a state of nature, is covered with a heavy growth of timber, consisting of map le, beach, birch, spruce, hem lock, fir, &c. I I .1. Our method of preparing the land is, in the spring, weturn over a piece of green s ward, and sow either oats or buckwheat, in the fall, after the crop is taken off; draw on and spread and plough in from forty to sixty loads (thirty bushels to the load) of manure. In breaking up, we plough from six to eight inches after that, "beam deep 2. Use no manure, except a com post thoroughly fermented. Our mode of making manure is this: In the fall, our yards in which we keep our domestic animals are all covered with a coat of much, turf, leaves, vines and all other vegetable matter that we can obtain; this remains in the yards till spring, when it is taken from the yards and composed with the manure which has been invade in the stables during the winter. Our mode of composing is this: We select some convenient place and spread a coat of much, a foot thick, then a layer of stable manure, of the same thickness, then the layers of much, and soon until the heap is completed; the piles are then completely covered with a covering of much, to absorb the grasses which maybe produced by the ferment at ion of the heaps. In the fall, the manure is carted on to the land, spread, and ploughed in. In the succeeding spring, the land is cross ploughed and hard wed, when it is ready for planting. I I 1. The kind I use now, principally, is called in this vicinity the p each blow; I also raise the Long John, Garter, and Verser, in small quantities. I have planted the seed both whole and cut large and small <a name="potatoes167"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; but have as yet seen no perceptible difference in the quantity or quality. The <a name="potatoes168"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are taken from the cellar and planted without any preparation; we plant- in hills in rows; the distance between rows, about 30 inches; between hills in the rows, 20 inches 2. We plant as soon as we get in our grain crops, which generally is from the 12th to the 20th of May. Little attention is paid to the weather in planting, provided the soil is in a suitable con, edition to receive the seed. I 1. To manure or other articles are applied after sloughing the previous autumn; the crop is hold twice 2. I have as yet been unable to discover anything peculiar in the appearance of the vine after it appears above ground, until the leaves begin to turn black, nor do I think the different varieties of weather, one from another, have any controlling influence on x. a. 571 them. During the summer months we have frequent changes from wet to dry, and from hot to' cold; yet the vine obtains its growth in about the same time one year with another 4. We intend to have the rows extend north and south, in order to admit the light and heat as much as possible. 1. The time of the appearance of the "blast" varies in different fields, and with different varieties, generally from the middle of August to the 1st of September. The first appearance of the blast is a small black spot on the leaves nearest the ground, which continues to spread upwards until the whole is dried up. The leaves are nearly dry, generally, before any symptoms of decay are observed in the tube r. The first appearance of decay in the tube r is generally near the root which connects it with the vine, and, in a majority of cases) those tubes lying nearest the s talks of the vine are the first to decay and in the greatest proportion. I have tried the various methods of mowing off the tops, cutting off the blossoms, removing the balls, &c; but as yet have seen no benefit to the crop. Of   .1. We generally commence digging to feed to our hogs about the 15th of September, and dig from time to time as we want to feed them. Those which we wish to keep we let remain in the ground as late as we can without having them freeze. The amount per acre varies from 50 to 400, bushels. The amount of diseased <a name="potatoes169"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> ranges from 1 to 75 per cent. I have frequently planted diseased tubes. Of the eyes are sound, they will grow, although the rest of the tube r may be diseased, and to appearance the vine is as healthy as those produced from a sound tube 2. I have never been able to discover any injurious effect communicated from a diseased tube r to a healthy one by external contact; having frequently found, in digging, a perfectly healthy one lying in the soft mass of a delayed one; and in taking them from the cellar, many tubes, reduced to a soft pulp by disease, are found without any apparent injury to the rest. The effect of leaving them in the ground later than usual is this with us: I think that the tubes receive the infection soon after the vines begin to blast, and by leaving them in the ground the disease will have sufficiently developed itself to be discovered in most of the tubes, consequently the sound ones can be preserved separate from the diseased ones at the time of digging. Am satisfied that a diseased tube r will sooner or later decay, all efforts to the contrary notwithstanding 3. The modes of preserving them generally is in cellars, connected with the dwelling house. Some occasionally dig pits in the field to put them in, these pits being covered with straw and earth to protect them from frost and wet 4. The diseased tubes are used in this place in two ways-one is to fat pork and beef; the other, in the manufacture of starch. Any farmers feed no others in the fattening of their pork. They are cooked before feeding, and the farmers generally think th value is not materially lessened in consequence of the affection 572 X. a. For starch, the tube r is considered equally as good as a sound one, if it has not become so far delayed as to- be soft. It yields as great per cent. of starch, and of as good quality. After the result of three years' experiment, I am satisfied that the best course to be pursued in this section of the country, in raising <a name="potatoes170"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, is this: To use no manure, except that which has been thoroughly fermented, whether it is vegetable or animal; the land to be green s ward, the soil well pulverized, and the manure thoroughly mixed with the soil. I am satisfied thatfermentation of any kind, whether of the manure or the land, is injurious to the crop, the quantity of diseased tubes being in proportion to the degree of ferment at ion in the soil. The course of rotation generally pursued by farmers in this vicinity, is to plant and sow, alternately, the same fields year after year for several years; to manure the land with green manure each year that it is planted. From these fields, the greatest quantity of <a name="potatoes171"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> a reproduced frequently 400 bushels to the acre. The per cent. of diseased tubes is generally as high as 50 per cent, and often as high as 75 per cent. In my method of cultivation, the average quantity of diseased ones has at no time been higher than 1 per cent. The yield this year on two acres was 350 bushels of as good <a name="potatoes172"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in every respect as we ever raised. I plant the each blow variety principally, because it appears to be the most hardy and the least affected by the "rot The Long John produces the greatest yield, but it is not as good to eat, and there is a larger proportion of diseased ends. In closing this communication, I wish to say that; if any information which I can give which will be of use or benefit to you in your reports, I shall be happy to communicate at any time such as I may be able to give. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, C. T. Alvord. On. Edmund Burke. Marengo, Of, Alafebruary -a, 1849. Dear In: A friend has kindly leaned me a copy of the Patentoffice report for the years 1845 and 1817; and I notice the great space occupied in both reports on the subject of the "rot" in the <a name="potato87"><mark>potato</mark></a>. And, judging from what I see there on the subject that i suggestions might be acceptable, I have decided to offer my experience to you, to be used or not, as you deem worthy. I have no doubt, then, that I have found both the cause and the remedy, at least with me. I know it is the cause; and the means of obviationhas been completely successful. They are very simple 1st. The cause of the rot in the I wish <a name="potato88"><mark>potato</mark></a> e is the planting in too high or large hills, and the continuing to hill them up while they are growing 2d. The remedy, then, is to plant in shallow or low hills, and not to hill them at all at any time during the season of their growth. I might here stop. And I venture to assert that whoever plant six. 573 and cultivates in the above way will have good large and sound <a name="potatoes173"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. But I will add the reasons that led me to try the method of cultivation, I here recommend. I am a new farmer, having been engaged for twenty years in merchandise. And in 1844, when I began to plant, I boughtBridgemans Young Gardeners Assistant; and I noticed, then, that he again and again reiterates that hilling, to any extent would force annual vegetation to premature maturity; that is, by excluding the light and air from their proper influence on the roots of all annual vegetables by hilling, they are forced to maturity out of or before their due .season; and experience has satisfied me that that is the whole cause of the <a name="potato89"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease. The first year I planted, I had the usual luck with mine small tubes and many of them rotten, and all rotating so badly that it was impossible to keep my own seed <a name="potatoes174"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Since that year I have not had a rotten <a name="potato90"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I will detail my method of cultivation; and, if like causes produce like results where there is a great difference in the latitude, the farmers at the north, where the <a name="potato91"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is so important, (here it is not important) can try it, and I hope will; and Can assure them the most entire exemption from the disease, no matter what the soil, (except, perhaps, a stiff clay) and no matter whether the season be dry or wet, warm or cool, and no matter whether the land be highly manured or not, so it be rich enough to fetch a crop. I prefer rich sandy land. By method of cultivation, then, is, to break up the land in the fall or winter, so as to let it become mellow; and when the time for planting arrives, run a furrow with what we call a, bull tongue plough; drop the 4" cuts" six, eight, or ten inches apart, and cover with a Are y plough by a furrow from each side. To other filling is done at any time, except what is given in the process of loosening the land about the roots, which is done about three times during the season in the following way: I have a g rubbing he, made for the purpose, four inches wide and ten inches long; this the operator drives into the earth quite up to the hut and near to the plant, first on one side of the row, then on the other. and, while the he is in the earth, the handle is slightly elevated by the hand, so as to break the sod, thereby giving light and air to the tubes, and offering them room to grow, and, above all, not destroying the capillary attraction between the earth below and the hill. Whenthesod is broken, the he is withdrawn without turning over any part of the soil. The weeds and grass are kept under in any of the usual ways by he or plough. In my mind, the method of growing I wish <a name="potatoes175"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in hills completely isolates them, as much so as if they were grown in pots, when the difficulty would be manifest to allisolating them, at one time too wet, and at another too dry. And so universal has the practice become of planting in hills or ridges, and continuing to hill and ridge through the growing season, that it threatens to destroy one of the finest vegetables of the earth. Very respectfully, On. Of Of Norrei On. Evmond Burke574 X. a. Appendi X No. 5.[From the Louisville Journalhemp. Last I india hemp he publish to day, from a distinguished missionary in the Last I n dies, an extract of a letter, giving some curious information in regard to the hemp of that country To the editors of the Louisville Journalagra, (EAST I Ndi Is) October 6, 1848. Gentlemen: After a good deal of inquiry on the subjects of cultivation and manufacture of hemp, I am still more convinced that information upon these subjects obtained from I india can be of little advantage to you, although it may interest you. Without further introduction I will answer your questions in the order they come as fully as I am able 1. "their hemp is called Vanilla, Mute, and perhaps other names. What is it? I s it a list from a stalk, is it grass, is it the fibrous bark of a tree, or is it the fibrous with of a stalk? I think Vanilla is grown nowhere in I india, but that it is a grass which grows spontaneously upon the seacoast of some of the Asiatic islands. I am well satisfied of the truth of this assertion, although I cannot say it is positively so. This seemed to be the conviction of one or two gentlemen whom I questioned upon the subject. The name of the hemp grown in Bengal is Mute. This is the article from which the p ailing cloth, bags, &c, which are exported, are made. It is also used for the same purposes extensively in I india, particularly in Bengal; and is made into a finer kind of cloth, about as fine as the coarser kind of "country linseys" common in Kentucky. It is used in cordage upon Mind oo boats, and I think for sails. It is preferred for those purposes to the up country hemp because it is less injured by water. The hemp grown in Northwest I india is called our. It is a harsher article than the Mute, and rots more rapidly when exposed to rain or used in water; in other respects it is about equal to Mute. It varies in color and softness very much, some of it as white as water rotted in our own county, and some as dark as our dark est dew rotted. I think it is finer though harsher than Kentucky hemp, while Mute is softer. There is another kind of hemp which grows wild in the hills at the foot of theHimmaleh mountains. This is a better article than either of the others; from it a beautiful canvass is made, a specimen of which, together with other specimens, I hope to send you soon. From this is also preserved a kind of liquor which produces intoxication x. 575 of the most dreadful kind, exciting every passion in a high degree. A man under its influence looks like a madman, and exhibits his excitement by dancing, singing, shouting, and tossing his arms. The Windows, some of them, are very fond of it; particularly paltry bearers. They say it makes them forget all their pains and fatigue. The name of this hemp, and the preparation from it also, isBhnmI t grows spontaneously in the hills. The reason assigned for the very limited use of so fine an article (the hemp) is that but few of the Windows can touch it without violating the rules of caste. All of these articles are bark from a stalk resembling our hemp, varying in height from four to seven feet. Besides these articles there is a fine grass which is used a good deal in t wine. This is not as pretty an article as Vanilla. The fibres from the cocoa nut are spun into rope and used' on board native ships, and to a limited extent, on English vessels; at least I saw some of it on the ship which brought me out. It is very light. The chief objection to it is that it may be stretched to almost any extent. I have been told of two or three kinds of plants, the whole of which, except the bark, is a kind of with through which are fibres which may be used as hemp. One of these is the aloe plant. This is used very little. Cotton is also made into ropes (as well as into all sorts of cloth) and used a good deal in this way. 2. "now is it grown, is it cultivated or does it grow wild? Give particulars as to mode of cultivation and preparation for market." I shall answer this question only as relating to Our. Mute is cultivated and prepared, I am told, in precisely the same manner. The ground is prepared by sloughing, making the ground soft, say upon an average of two inches deep, though much of it is not touched with the plough only having a very small quantity of loose earth thrown over it or a small proportion left untouched; the seed is then sown, and it receives no cultivation except pulling out the weeds or cutting them up with a small instrument, resembling a chisel, about four inches wide, with a crooked handle like that of a hemp hook, only not so long or so much crooked. ' It is sown during the rains, as early as convenient. The rains begin to fall generally about the middle of June. It is cut with a little hook resembling a pruningknife, the whole not more than eight inches long, in October or November. It is then placed immediately in the water where it remains ten days; it is then taken out, and, while wet, the lint is picked off with the fingers, then washed thoroughly, sometimes by rubbing sand through it so as to remove all the g luminous matter it is then dried and tied up in bundles for sale. Of course it cannot well be rotted in this country by spreading it upon the ground, as there is very little rain except during the rainy season, which ends a little before the time for cutting, and then the rain falls almost every day for two or three months; so that it would be impossible to rot it in this way without great risk. The time of the beginning and ending of the rains are very uncertain, varying two or three weeks or more. 3. " Does it grow in marshes, by the sea shore or on high lands" To far as I have seen  india, it is one almost unbroken and interminable plain. Any576ex. where in the plain the two kinds of hemp, Our and Mute, or But wa, as the natives call it, grow; Mute, or But wa, growing in the south, and Our in the north. 4. "that is the value of it per pound in our currency ?a" The value of the Our in our currency is about 90 cents per 100 pounds, or a little less than one cent per pound. The son of a farmer told me the price of Our was 82 to 90 cents per hundred. The price of Mute is about 90 cents per 100 pounds. Funny bags, made of coarse cloth of Mute, three feet long by two broad, are worth three cents apiece in Calcutta. A finer cloth, made of the Mute, sells for three to four cents per yard, two feet broad. There are great quantities of cloth made of Our in the northwest, very coarse, but even and strong; price about three quarters of a cent per yard; but this is only nine inches wide. I will give you the price of cotton, also. One person says between 4 and 8 cents per pound; another says 3. Probably one alluded to the price in the northwest, and the other in Calcutta. I suppose this is the case; for with the one I spoke altogether of the price here, and with the other chiefly of the price in Calcutta. You must consider them as the Calcutta price, except the cheaper price of cotton, and the price of Our, and the narrow cloth made of Our. The grass is very cheap, say half cent per pound, or le s. Of this cloth, I do not know the price. 5. "now is it manufactured into cloth, (cotton bagging) Now is it spun? What preparation is necessary before spinning? . Now is it woven" Their mode of manufacturing is as simple as it could well be. Of t wine, a man stands ere et, with a bunch of hemp under his arm, a spindle in his right hand, hooked into the hemp; he t girls the spindle with his fingers, and lengthens out the thread as the spindle descends; when it comes near the ground they catch it, wind up the thread, and begin again. Of a large cord is being spun, the operation is performed somewhat after the same manner as horse ropes were spun long ago, only the machinery is plainer and more rude. They have another rather singular way of giving twist to the cord. They have two pieces of wood, about three feet long; one end placed in the ground, the other resting against a tree or some other support at an angle of 70 or 75 degrees; and there are two spindles which a man turns by means of a small cord passed around them, one end of which a man holds in one hand, and the other, end in the other hand. I have not examined it so as to see how pulling the two ends turns the spindle the same way. The weaving machine, as described to me by a native Christian, is much like thehandlooms used in Kentucky, except they also are more simple and rude. Last, "to what extent can the manufactured article be produced, and at what prices per yard, if there should be a sufficient market for it at regenerating prices" At the present rate of prices, and the present mode of cultivation and manufacture, probably little more would be produced, however great the demand. But if our mode of cultivation and manufacture were adopted, I suppose five times the amount would be produced by the same amount of labor as is now expended upon it. This remark is probably true with regard to everything else produced in x. a. 577 india. Of you were to witch the process of cultivating a crop you would not easily be surprised at the small ness of the yield. The soil of I india does not seem to be very rich, but the same ground may be cultivated year after year without maturing. And when the rains come pouring down upon the hot earth, you would think vegetation would spring out of the very sand banks and walls. This year has not been a fair specimen at all. Throughout I india scarcely half the usual crop will be produced; and great, very great suffering is everywhere expected from the famine. The season is now over. The crops are withering upon the field; and a great part of them could not be restored by any amount of rain. But little if any more can be expected 19 578 X. a. Appendi X No. 6. Culture Of The Arti  Choketranslated from the French by E. Good rich Smith, of the Patent Officer instruction on the culture of the art i choke as a green fodder The art i choke or earth pear, a native of the most northern portions of Mexico, has been known in Europe for more than two centuries, and its culture was established long before that of the <a name="potato92"><mark>potato</mark></a>. It is, however, only since 1823 that a beginning was made of bringing this crop into extensive cultivation, namely, in. Alsace, in the environs of Strasburg1. Use of the product. Two portions of the plant can be applied to use in the artichokethe tubes and the stalk. The tubes are regarded in Alsace as an excellent nutriment form il ch cows, to which they are almost always given, together with bees and <a name="potatoes176"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. They are equally good as food for horses which are thus kept in very good condition and sustain hard labor the daily allowance 0.10 hectolitre for horses, to which is given an equal quantity of dry forage. Sheep are very fond of -this root, joined with dry food; I hectolitre per day may be given for 120 head. It would also be useful in this last case to add a small quantity of salt to this food. We may further say that artichokesare the most health full for animals where they have been .most recently gathered. In the experiments which we have made on the comparative cultivation of the principal root plants used for fodder, we have found that the <a name="potato93"><mark>potato</mark></a> expresses in its composition 22 23 per cent. of dry matter, the art i choke 19.60. M. Boussingault found in theartichoke of Alsace 20.8 per cent. The s talks are nearly of as great use as the tubes, and here is the advantage which it has over the <a name="potato94"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The s talks of the <a name="potato95"><mark>potato</mark></a> cannot be employed either green or dry. Although the cutting of the stalk at the beginning of September may diminish the growth of the tubes one third, the fodder which we obtain may have, at the period when we begin to need green feed, such a value that the loss caused in the quantity of the tubes is amply compensated These directions have been prepared in the name of the Central Society of Agriculture of the Power Seine. X. a. According to Schwerzs experiments, 100 kilogrammes of green s talks equal, as regards nutritions qualities, 31.250 kilogrammes of our hay. In every case this must be given to beasts mixed with other vegetables; its value is thus increased, and it renders the autumnal plants more nutrition by increasing their consistence. Her advises this food especially for sheep which are very dainty. When we can dispense with the use of the green stalk of theartichoke, there is every advantage in cutting them as late as possible, in order to leave the tubes to take their full development when the s talks can be employed or hen they are dry. In this state they furnish a good forage, which all kinds of domestic beasts eat readily. Although seemingly more appropriate to horses and sheep, they yet agree likewise with horned animals. There is no need of trouble on account of the black color which the leaves take in drying; when this hue is not the result of too premature drying, it no more injures their quality than does a species of whitish efflorescence which shows itself on the surface of the leaves, and which resembles a mould. Finally, the s talks of the art i choke have, for fuel, a value which no other product of field culture has. In this case it is best to leave them standing till they are completely dry. To prepare th ba for use more conveniently, they are cut in two and made up intofaggots. This fuel is especially adapted for heating ovens or furnace e. M., Boussingault tried the experiment, and this use of the art i choke is perhaps the most profitable to introduce the dry s talks into the litter of hogs; the with, which forms' the great part of it, absorbs a great quantity of liquid drainings. Climate and soil. Of all plants proper for food, the art i choke is unquestionably one of the most accommodation g in this respect. It bears underground a degree of cold which no other of our tube vous plants will do. Besides, one can, without the slightest risk, leave it all winter in the ground, where it is in no danger except from moisture, which destroys it, while the frost leaves it untouched. I t supports with equal facility a great degree of dryness. We see, indeed, its leaves fade when the heat becomes very great and the drought prolonged; but it resists it, and the night is sufficient to refresh and recover it. With the exception of marshes, all places and all soils are good for the art i choke, from the richest wheat to the most gravely and dry, and even to the most barren calcareous soil. This plant, too, the product of which is always greater in proportion than that of other fodder roots in moderate soils, will yield, it is believed, a more abundant crop than when the ground is of the best quality. The trials which we have made on the production of the differ 580 X. went sorts of roots in the principal kinds of earth, have given us as the result in respect to the artichokeAlluvial land .a. .a. 20.868 kill, of tubes. Hurry sand, very dry. 26.768 " candy clay. 22.568 c calcareous earth .a. .a. .a. 18.908 3" c These products have been furnished us by 8 tubes, weighing each about 0.60 kill. Hence it follows that the dry and light soils are those which best agree with this plant 3. I to place in the rotation. The difficulty we experience in wholly destroying the artichokein the soil 'where it has been cultivated, has determined many cultivates of Alsace not to introduce it into their regular rotations. They set apart to it for a number of years a particular soil, as is done in making artificial meadows of a long period, as luzerne, sainfoin, with which it may be alternated. Made, an Alsatian, saw the same soil produce every year for thirty years a tolerable crop of s talks and tubes of this plant, though it had not for a long time received either culture or manure. But if we wish to obtain large crops, it will be well to re plant every two years and manure only once in four years. I f, however, it is desired to bring this crop into a regular rotation, the following is, according to Avert, the best 1st year. Artichokes, after sloughing and manure 2d year. Spring grain, with artificial meadow. In the sloughings and narrowings, the tubes and roots of the art i choke which have escaped are carefully gathered up; afterwards, it is indispensable to destroy the new sprouts t with the weed hook 3d year. Artificial meadow 4th year. Winter grain 4. Preparation of the soil. The soil is prepared for artichokes in the same way as for <a name="potatoes177"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; it is also manured the same. Besides, as we shall mention hereafter, this plant is less exhausting of manure than the <a name="potato96"><mark>potato</mark></a>, but it supports itself also without the crop suffering 5. Planting. We begin to plant artichokes at the end of winter, as soon as the time and labor of the farmer will allow. This work ought to be over, at the longest, by the middle of April, because this plant will suffer by too rapid vegetation. As the tubes do not dread the frost they can also be planted in the winter. This may even be preferable in dry soils, and there is no danger of too great moisture. It also lessens the amount of tubes, always too numerous in the spring, and the plants are the more vigorous in such soils. X. 
581We may use for planting, with equal success, tubes of all sizes we may even use withered tubes, provided we soak them two days in water before planting. The experiments of Made show that the planting of pieces of theartichoke has not the same success as in the case of the <a name="potato97"><mark>potato</mark></a>; we ought, therefore, to choose whole tulas. The method of plantingartichokes is similar to that of the <a name="potato98"><mark>potato</mark></a>, only they ought to be placed at a depth of one quarter less. Of we use small tubes, it is necessary to put two or three in the same place. The space to allow between each tube r ought to be larger than between <a name="potatoes178"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, because this plant occupies more room. In Alsace they plant, one metre apart in all directions 6. Are of them while growing. As with all the plants set widely apart from each other, this which now requires our attention demands a treatment suitable to keep the soil in good state and to favor vegetation. A first sloughing or digging is given to it as soon as the earth begins to put forth weeds; this again is repeated as often as the state of the ground and the hands at command will allow. These labors are carried on with a horse he the first year after the planting, because the lines formed are preserved; but this regularity disappears in the following years if the field is left without planting anew. We are then obliged to carry on these diggings or weddings by hand. It is necessary in this case to keep the s talks from growing too near, in order that the plants shall not mutually withdraw each others nourishment. One or two cuttings will be necessary to favor the number of the tubes. Of we care not more for the quantity of leaf than for that of the product beneath the ground, we may dispense with this last labor. *7. Gathering. As the gathering of the s talks and those of the tubes do not occur at the same time, we must consider them separately. The crop of s talks, which are designed to serve as dry fodder, must be gathered about the second half of September; sooner, it would too much injure the formation of the tubes, and the leaves would be less nutritions; later, the moisture of the 'season would not allow them to be properly dried. To cut the s talks. we use a sickle a little stronger than that usually employed, and cut them 30 metre* from the surrounding soil. As soon as the s talks are cut, they are bound in bundles of 0.25 metre to 0.30 metre in diameter, avoiding binding them strongly; these bundles are placed together, by parcels of seven in a parcel. After a week, and when the leaves are well dried outside of the bundles, the parcels are taken apart then they are joined together, three by three, in a heap of twenty-one bundles; fourteen of these are arranged in a parcel; the other seven, the cut ends upward and strongly fastened towards that end, are placed in the form of a pointed roof. Thus arranged, the heap* A metre is 3.281 English feet 582 X. obtains the greatest degree of dryness possible, without there being any danger in the most unfavorable season. The crop of the tubes may be gathered without inconvenience from the end of October to the middle of April, since as we leave this part of the plant it is in no danger from the most severe winters. It follows, therefore, that instep of providing cellars, store houses, as is indispensable for other roots, we can gather them at pleasure and as they are needed. War from experiencing any damage, the tubes left in the ground, even to the end of winter, continue to grow, as the observations of Schwerz have demonstrated. The great enemy of artichokes during the winter is moisture, which may rot them. We cannot, therefore, avail ourselves of the benefits of a prolonged gathering except in dry soils, and we shall be forced to gather them at the end of autumn in most soils. As to the method of digging up the tubes, it is the same as that employed for <a name="potatoes179"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, only it is necessary to take great care to gather all the tubes and the roots which may spring out with the next crop, at least always when the soil is not designed for a similar production for many years in succession; in this case, those which remain in the ground will serve as seed for the following years. Preservation of the tubes. As we cannot gather artichokes as we want them, except in dry soils, it is necessary to profit by the thaws to make small supplies during the period the earth is frozen. The following method, if adopted, will prevent us from being obliged to gather the crop in the autumn in moist ground: It is sufficient to make a heap and cover them with earth, for they are not affected by the cold except when exposed to the open air; thence we take what is wanted, thaw them f frozen, and put them to immediate use 9. Product raised. The product of the art i choke on an average, according toSchwerz and Made the portion of the s talks which is not fit to be eaten being deduced amounts to 7,500 kilogrammes of dry leaf per hectare.

I Translated from the Journal d Agriculture Critique et de Jardinage, by E. Goodrichsmith, of the Patent Officemadder and indigo are the two most important dying substances, for they furnish the most beautiful and dura be colors that are know none of them all the red shades; the other, the blue. We make use of the m adder root, known in commerce by the name of a liza ri; of the root reduced to powder, which bears the name of g france, (m adder) from its powder, a solution, saturated by concentrated sulphuric acid, is made garancine; and lastly, from an alcoholic extract of garancine, which is called coloring. The coloring principle, which is called ali marine, crystal ices in red needles on the alcoholic extract being elaborated. The ancients were acquainted with the use of m adder, and cultivated it. Of in y informs u, s (1) that it was a culture reserved for the poor, who obtained from it great profits, and that its root was employed for dying wool and leather. Dioscorides, who wrote in the first century of the Christian era, tell us (2) that the ladder of Tuscans, and principally that of Vienna, was celebrated, but that it was likewise cultivated in nearly all the provinces of I talk. The cultivation of this plant must have been common in Paul, for the invasion of the barbarians had not wholly destroyed it, when, under Dagobert, foreign merchants came to purchase it at the market which he had established at Faint Tennis, which is shown by a chart in which that prince fixed the duty to be paid for its export 3) Faint Tennis remained, for a long time, the market for m adder and word of France. In 1275, the prior of that celebrated abbey entered into compacts on the subject of the ti the of m adder 4) We find in the Cartulary of Roar n transactions relating to the ti the of m adder of the year 1122. (5) Under Henry I V., Liver de Nerves mentions its culture; but the Flemings had possession" of that profitable branch of products, and this author wrote, on the borders of the country, which, at the present day, produces the best m adder, that it was necessary to send to Glanders for ladder of the best quality. (6) In the sixteenth century, Robe L points out 1) Rib. Of X., chap, Natural List 2) Rib. I I I., chap. 143.(3) Recueil des List. de France de D. Bouquet, t.

I I .a, p. 429, de Pledition cite e 584 -x. a. Germany and Zealand as the countries in which this cultivation was most extended. (7) Schwertz affirms that m adder was introduced into Alsace on the plains of Hoguenau, by means of the Emperor Charles V. It was, so to speak, established in the Batavianprovinces, from whence the able Holland merchants dispersed it in all the markets of Europe, after they had mixed it with the ali paris of Meant. But it was in the east, in Syria, in Asia Minor, Greece, and especially Livadia, that this culture was extended, and procured vast profits to its cultivates. Thus m adder, propagated at the north and in the south of France, seemed to be repelled by the ignorance of the cultivates and negligence of the proprietors. It was not till the middle of the last century, that a Persian, namedAlthen, introduced that cultivation into the department of Vaucluse, where was found lands most suitable for its growth, and where it at present is predominant above all other products. The grateful department is about to raise a monument to the me glory of that benefactor of the country. It is apparent, from this review, that m adder succeeds in the most diverse climate s 1. Growth of m adder. The s talks of the other kinds of the genus rupia are long lived but, as to common m adder, (rupia tinctorum) its roots only are long lived, and its stalk withers and dies every year. This plant has nothing to fear but an excess of moisture. When the earth is very dry in summer, its growth is suspended till a return of rain but in fresh soils, it continues without interruption as long as the temperature does not sink below 100, (or 50 War) It is evident, then, that its development, the soil being equally fertile, is proportioned to the period of time in which it vegetables, under the influence of the state of freshness of the soil, a period differing according to the soil and climate. This observation has struck us for a long time; and we have found that in the climate of Vaucluse, and lands of the same nature and riches, of analogous situation, the products corresponded nearly to the power of the soil to retain water, as the following table shows Power of retaining water. Product. Proportion 1. Marshy soil of For. 56.48 77 772. Alluvial soil of Range. 51.30 68 703. Marshy soil of Range. 48.36 60 664. Early soil of Taras con. .a. 43.60 57 605.

Doc. No. in. 585 the entire heat during this period. This principle seems to be established by the relative products of the marshy soils of Vaucluse, which possess a sufficient moisture during the whole period of the summer, and which yield 3,957 kilogrammes* of root per hectare, having received 5,078 of heat, while the ,dry soils, having two months of summer repose in its growth, not having received in that time but 3, 2 150 of heat, yielded only 2,505 kilogrammes3957 x 3,315Thus: -a- 2, 5053,708I irrigation is skillfully employed for the single purpose of keeping up the freshness of the soil, in causing it to act by infiltration every time that the earth is brought to a state of dryness, (at least of 0.10 of moisture at 0.33m. of depth) by means of the introduction of water into the ditches which separate the beds of earth, as a supply to the natural freshness of the soil. The abuse of this influences the quality of the m adder; the tissue of which becomes too loose, and besides, exposes it to the appearance of the rhizoctone, as this takes place in lands which are under the influence of subterranean moisture 2. Component parts of manure for m adder. In its fresh state, the root of m adder pulled at the age of thirty months, retains 0.72 of water; at eighteen months, 0.74.(8) M. Koechlin found in Alsace, 0.78-38 of water. Of the ground is moist, the quantity of water rises as high as 0.80. In that state of dryness in which the root is market able, and which we term the normal state, it loses 7 or 8 per cent. to reach to complete designation. When it gives 9.78 per cent. of ashes, according to the analysis of M. May en. M. Girardin found that the powder of m adder, well cleansed of the mind, contained 5 per cent of ashes; from which it follows that the mind and earthy matters which remain inevitably attached to it represent a weight exceeding 4.78 per cent. The root, in its complete state of designation, according to M. May en, yielded 1.33 per cent. of nitrogen, and consequently, in its normal state, it contains 1.24 per cent. The dry stalk, in its normal state, retains 18.4 per cent. of water. It contains 0.81 per cent. of nitrogen in the dry state, and consequently 0.66 in its normal state. We have three analyses of the ashes of the root the two first made on the m adder of Alsace, by M. Koechlin, and the third by. May, on the m adder of Zealand* A kilogramme is 2.204 lbs.

The soda evidently supplies other alkaline bases in the saline soils of Zealand. The compact ness of the root is owing to the lime in the two first instances, and to the s il ex in the last instance. Theseanalyses tend to show that the essential thing for the growth is that the plants should find so ruble bases in the ground, and that the choice of the bases is of less consequence than has generally been supposed. One hundred kilogrammes of root have in 30 months less than 150 kilogrammes of dry s talks, the roots and s talks both being in a normal state; we have, therefore, as the index for the manure of the plant in the soil 100 kilogrammes of roots .a. 1.23 of nitrogen 150 kilogrammes of s talks. 0.99 "222 The last experiments have proved that the application of i200Ex. 
587wt. of stable manure, yielding 480 kilogrammes of nitrogen, give 340 kilogrammes of roots; 12.5 kilogrammes of nitrogen, therefore, necessary to produce 100 kilogrammes of roots, Now this harvest above takes only 2.22 kilogrammes; that is to say, its proportion of consumption is 0.175 of the entire manure. It is, then, an exhausting and backward plant which can live on abundance but not very profitable. After the harvests, the surplus of the manure, if it has been so prepared as to preserve the nitrogen, remains for the following crops; and, indeed, luzerne and wheat succeed very profit ably to this plant, and exhibit by their vegetation the good state of the soil. The extension of the use of stable manure in the cultivation of m adder, shows that it is, indeed, a perfect manure for this plant when it is derived from animals in a good condition and thoroughly fed; but this kind of manure does not answer one of the desiderataof this culture. I f, in certain cases, we have to fear the too great fertility of the soil, when speaking of plants which we cultivate for their seed or fruit, it is not so when we desire to produce roots or s talks; then the limit of fertility is singularly enlarged. It has been attempted to extend it more and more in the case of m adder; but we have been obliged to arrest it when, by the employment of a great quantity of stable manure, the earth sustained by the latter needs stability, and leaves the seed and roots without support, exposed to the air in the void spaces which it everywhere presents. We might, then, believe that we have attained the highest maximum of the crops when we gather, from soils best constituted 3 375 kilogrammes of roots after thirty months' cultivation; but the employment of powdered manures, and especially oil cake, having been introduced, and this manure being such that it can be spread out in unlimited quantity without changing scarcely the physical state of the soil, we have thus been able to obtain yet larger crops. In the actual state of the culture, the maxim a obtained are 5,620 kilogrammes per hectare in the department of Vaucluse. The proprietor of the p older of Wilhemina at the environs of Does, gathered, in 1846, a mean product of 6,096 kilogrammesper hectare on a surface of 60 hectares of m adder, (9 )a) This crop was the result of the first application of manure, containing 762kilogrammes of nitrogen, in which 135 kilogrammes were absorbed by the plants. They could be supplied by 190,000 kilogrammes of farm manure, or by 15,487 kilogrammes of oil cake of cold a, or better yet by a mixture of the two kinds of manure in proportions, which, without changing the physical properties of the soil, furnish, a sufficient quantity of nitrogen and carbonic acid. In fact, oil cake is not by itself as perfect a manure as that of the dung hill; when any one continues to employ it alone, the crops sensibly decline, and cease to yield in proportion to the quantity of the nitrogenous element; they recover when we mix or alternate the two kinds of manure. This fact being well obs) Comptez End us de Academic, t. xxiv, p. 427,s88Ex. served, will always render the mixture of a certain quantity of litter manure necessary with the more rich sort, but in a much weaker proportion than what is supposed 3. Boils best fitted for m adder. It is a fact which is now generally admitted, that m adder maybe raised on all sorts of soils; that it prefers light ones, provided they are fresh; ano l, in fine, that it does not fully acquire its coloring qualities except in those in which the carbonate of lime forms a large portion. Thus, the marshy soils of Vaucluse have 90 to 100 of carbonate of lime; the holders of Holland are likewise rich in this substance. When the soil is deficient in this respect, we are forced to employ the substance afterwards in the coloring treatment to revive the color. But the presence of carbonate of lime is not always sufficient to obtain red m adder; the physical condition of the soil contributes also to it by the influence which it exerts on the abundance and coloring of its juices. In the department of Vaucluse, on soils very nigh to each other, and of the same mineral composition, is gathered on one red m adder, on the other yellow, without our being able to determine the cause which operates on these phenomena. We know, indeed, that the juice, naturally yellow, does not become red, except by being oxydized; but what is the agent which favors in this case, or which arrests in the other the action of the oxygen? In the territory of Range, in particular, the redder t m adder always is produced on dry soils, where the vegetation, always feeble, is interrupted in the summer; but we dare not say that this is the case elsewhere; and we have seen in Aren ten (in the basin of the Tongue, the principal seat of the cultivation ofVaucluse) lands which appeared to us fresh, and which yielded the red m adder. Besides, m adder at 18 months is always yellow; itreddens more and more as it grows older. That of Meant, which remains many years in the ground, is always of a much deeper color than ours. But, besides this influence, the soil appears to possess another, which is opposed to the formation of the coloring juices. In certain parts of the valley of Baron ne, the attempts at cultivation have only produced grey m adder, though the plants had grown vigorously. Did not the plant secrete its peculiar juices the same as do the varieties with red flowers, or were there present deoxydizing agents or substances strongly oxygenated, which have consumed its hydrogen? Observation has not been complete enough to enable us to decide. We have already mentioned the necessity of the freshness of the soil to prolong the time of the growth of the roots; its want of tenacity is always of great importance; besides, that it produces a considerable diminution of the expense of cultivation. It is necessary that so branching a root, and which buried itself so deeply, should be enabled to penetrate without obstacle deep into the ground We must then, as much as possible, choose a fresh, meelEx. a. 589 low soil. The excellent marshy grounds of Vaucluse, join to the former quality that of being tilled at all times, and without difficulty, with a wooden shovel, as we might do in a sand or ash heap 4. General culture. Ladder is cultivated in two ways by the seed and by transplanting. For both, the land must be first prepared. Before winter or in the spring, we work it over with plough, or better, spade it up. In strong soils, subject to retain the moisture of winter and to dry up in the summer, in those which have not been turned up for a long time, the work ought to be deep, to allow the plant a greater space for moisture; but in mellow soils, it is sufficient to work it about 0.25 metre* in depth. Any cultivates disapprove of deep working, and content themselves with turning up the earth 0.16 of a metre, pretending by this to force the root to form itself nearer to the surface, and thus diminish the labor of drawing out the root. This may answer for land habitually fresh; but cultivation will tend to extend the time in those soils which easily dry up, and the summer cessation of growth of the plant. We must, therefore, balance this loss with the expense of deep working; this result must be attained by experiments in each place of culture. There are fresh, deep soils, where the roots have such a tendency to bury themselves that they go to the depth of 1 metre, and where it would be useful to arrest them by presenting some obstacle; but this is not the case in hard, dry soils. Thus, suppose the soil had had two months' summer repose, and yielding only 1,950 k i log. of roots, and another not having any summer repose, and which yields 3,080 k i log; the difference of 1,130 k i log. represents, at the mean price of m adder, (75 francs the k i log) 84.75 fr, or 314 of wheat. Now according to our calculations, to dig 0.25 metre with a spade costs 52 days' work, and in a soil having, by the dynanometric spade, a tenacity of 45 metre, and 0.50 metre depth to dig 0.45 metre, requires 269 days. Thus, op the one side we have 52 days' work, costing 310kilog. of wheat; and on the other, 269 days' work, costing 1,603kilog., the difference being 1,294 kilogrammes. The advantage of labor of slight depth in allowing the prolonged summer repose is, then, evident in this case. It will be yet more so, if we notice that the price of the days work is much higher than the mean in the season of the pulling of the root. There are then two things to balance the increase of products and that of cost. In a fresh soil, it is profitable to have the m adder grow near the surface; it is not necessary to work in the preparatory labor very deep016metre is sufficient. In the dry soils it is necessary to dig further, but 0.25 metre is most frequently sufficient when it is left to a longer repose from labor. Deep working is indicated when them adder is very dear and labor at moderate price; but when the reverse is the case, it is necessary to change the course of procedure* A metre is 3,281 English feet, X. a. The manure is buried in the earth by the sloughing which follows the deep sloughing, if it is so ploughed; otherwise, with the first sloughing. After' the winter, it receives one or two strokes with the scarificator to finish the breaking of the clouds, and then it is narrowed. When there is no supply of manure prepared beforehand, and the sloughing is continued during the whole winter, the same as when oil cakes or powdered manures are used, these are buried by a light turning up of the ground, done after the winter, and to be followed by scarifying and narrowing. We then trace with a hand marker the streaks which indicate the breadth of the beds on which the m adder is to be planted. These beds are 1 32 metre to 1.,65 in breadth, with an alley of 0.32 to 40 metre between them. In Glanders, they plant likewise on, narrow beds; in Alsace, they allow for them 6 to 10 metres of breadth. We have seen them sown in Arm argue on the whole surface of the field, without divisions, into beds. All these practices ought to be carefully examined. The tendency of the cultivates of Vaucluse has constantly been to narrow the beds. Formerly, they made them 2 metres broad they have reduced them to 1.32 metre. They have been guided in this by the observation that m adder which grows on the border of the beds is always the most beautiful, and compensates also for the empty space left between the beds; that in wedding, the laborer more easily reaches the noxious plants without leaving the alley, and without treading down the plantation, and principally by the facility of finding in the alleys the necessary earth for the strong hilling up and by what it affords for drawing out the roots when it has been changed into a trench. When, indeed, the earth being no more retained on its sides, is cast into the hollow by every stroke of the spade without opposing any resistance; and if it is drawn over by the plough, the slice is also turned over into the trench without any lateral pressure, it is reduced to powder as it falls, and lays open the roots; and finally, if i we wish to irrigate, we make the water enter the trenches; it penetrates the earth by infiltration, and renders it easy to begin pulling in a season when the dryness, having hardened the ground, does not allow us to attempt this operation in the greatest number of soils. Now the first m adder roots drawn out always sell at the high ist price, the manufacturers having noticed that the grindings of summer are better than those of winter All these reasons concur to make us regard as desirable the multiplying of the alleys, and, consequently, the narrowing of the breadth of the beds. The culture of the beds having always for their object to furnish the necessary earth for filling up, it may be conceived that if the high price of hand labor and the want of using the plough, in hilling up in Zealand, has caused them to renounce that operation, they are not exposed to lose the land designed for alleys. It might be added that in Arm argue, the roots not penetrating deeply intothe soil, has been caused, will out doubt. from the salt ness of the lower strata of the soil, as the reaonSa fro the more easy pulling in deep soil, do i not there A e 1 t. X. 591 t follows, then, from this examination, that in all soils which are deep, it is best to make the beds narrow, and that they ought to be the narrower the longer we design to leave the roots in the ground without being drawn out, and as more earth is needed for hilling up 5. Culture by seed. The beds and their alleys having been traced out by the marker, we proceed to sowing. With a hand he we open across the breadth of the beds a light furrow, in which a person scatters the seed, which is covered by the earth of a second furrow opened beside the first, and so on till the whole bed is sown. In soils which have not borne m adder, and in strong soils, we sow 70 kilogrammes of seed per hectare* in light soils, on which m adder has not been raised, we increase the quantity to 82 kilogrammes; but if they have borne many harvests of this plant, it has been remarked that the seed vegetables poorly, or that the young plants die in greater number, and we use for seed as much as 120 kilogrammes. The, seed ought to be covered with from 0.3 to 0.4 metre of earth. After the preparatory labors, which are so costly, we ought to pay great attention to choose the seed. It is observed that the seed of m adder easily loses its germ i native powers; for the second year they produce a less number of plants, and become from year to year less susceptible of terminating. The germ of good seed is white. It becomes brown as it grows old. It is the only means which we have to know the goodness of the grain; but when there is time, it is always best to try it, in putting its germination to the test by the means which we have indicated in our article on seed. (10 f, before the seed is completely up, a heavy rain happens to beat down the earth and form a close crust on the surface, we must without delay pass an iron toothed rake over it to break it up. I n large plantations, we may use instead, to advantage, a roller of wood, furnished with iron points, which may be run over by hand upon the beds, and which produces the effect of taking. The time for sowing in when the heat and moisture combined are most favorable to the sprouting of the germs. Ordinarily, intTaucluse, they sow towards the first days of March, and sometimes even in February. The mean temperature is then only 7' to 8,(or 450 to 500 Ah) but the solar temperature 12 to 15,(or 57 to 600 Ah) The seed then remains in the ground from 20 to 25 days. At a later period, it terminates more readily, unless it is overtaken by drought, which sometimes happens in April. This fear, which is not wholly devoid of foundation, joined to the facility of obtaining the labor of females, before the time when the silk worms employ the population, have caused the early sowing to be very generally adopted. The white frosts which may occur only retard the plants some days. When one has fresh earth to* A hectare is 2.471 English acres 10) Hours 'agriculture, vol. 3, p. 440.592Ex. cultivate, and has not these reasons to advance the sowing, it can can be done with more, if the mean temperature reaches to 120 or 57 War) The sprouting will be more rapid, more complete, and the plants more vigorous. Nothing is more essential for the success of m adder than wedding very carefully by hand, which is commenced when the plants are well up. It is repeated as often as it is felt to be necessary. In certain soils, adapted to produce many plants, this is very expensive; and it has been necessary to renounce this method of cultivation in the alluvial soil of Breech, on account of the vast expense of these repeated weddings, without which our m adder fields become quickly immense carpets of verdure. After each wedding, we take from the alleys a small quantity of earth, well reduced to powder, which is spread over the beds to fill the empty spaces caused by pulling up the weeds. In strong soils, which cannot c rumble sufficiently, this may be dispensed with. Besides, the roots of the m adder fixed in those soils are not shaken by the operation of wedding. Before the arrival of the chills of winter, the plants must be covered entirely over with crumbled earth taken from the intervals of the bed. These intervals thus become the trenches, which gradually grow deeper and support the moisture of the plants. Thehilling up is also thicker when the earth is light. It is from 0.5 metre to 0.8 metre in thickness. The object of this operation is not, as has been supposed, to preserve the plants from the cold. M. Decaisne, in an excellent memoir on the anatomy and physiology of this plant, (11) has shown what takes place on this occasion. But of of the earth the stalk only fills itself with green substance, when the juice of the root is yellow, capable of becoming red by the contact of the air; but if the stalk is protected from the influence of the light, and the contact of the earth and moisture, its juices take the yellow color of the roots. Thus, by the hilling up, we increase the vegetable mass charged with the coloring matter, and consequently the industrial product that is sought from it. The plant thus passes the winter. In the following spring, the wedding must be renewed. Of this has been done with care the first year, it occasions little labor. The m adder plants are then in possession of the soil, and entirely prevail over all weeds and other plants. The growth of the second year is vigorous, and, towards the end of summer, the s talks flower and bear seed. When the culture is but of slight extent, and the price of seed is low, it will be found profitable to cut the m adder tops green, at the period of flower, in order to feed them out to cattle. In this state, it is a good fodder, equal in quality to the best hay. We cannot judge of it by the amount of the stalk at the moment of pulling. It is then only the straw of m adder. As in cutting fodder, the lower part of the stalk is cut, which the contact of the earth and moisture have charged with coloring matter, it has the peculiarity of 11) Alomoirei do 1Acadomie of 1 lPrussl 1837 4 j _a_ _a_ ~li- ix. 
593tinging the bones of animals which eat it. We frequently see in the slaughter houses of countries where m adder is produced, sheep and lambs tinged with this color. As the produce of seed depends on the success of the sowing and vegetation of the plants, we can judge of the weight which we may obtain by that of the fodder cut, and which is nearly the same. The third year we only gather half the quantity of fodder obtained the second year. The mean price of seed for several years in Vaucluse is 1 france per kilogramme. In 1816, it rose to 7.50 francs; and since it has varied from 0.60 to 2.50 francs. These variations, and the hope of having a year when the seed would be dearer, have completely abolished the practice of cutting plants in the flower, unless in those high, marshy soils where the flower drops off. It is impossible to fix on the quantity of seed that may be gathered; it depends on the season and the soil. The strong soils yield grain much better than do the light ones, and the harvest is 660 kilogrammes as the medium one. Constant cultivates of m adder procure seed by planting roots at the bottom of pa lisa des, or of dead hedges on which they may cling. In this isolated situation, the plants f rectify abundantly. M. Haste t has remarked that the s talks of plants which have the most seed, cover themselves in the spring with a viscous substance resulting from the sting of an insect, and that the exhaustion of juices precede the dropping off of the flowers. (12 The harvest of seed is obtained by mowing the plant at the time of maturity of the ferries, indicated by the dark violet color, which they take. The s talks are dried, and, on shaking them with a fork, the ferries drop off; these are gathered, and the portions of leaves mixed with them removed; and, when they are completely withered and dry, they are carried to the granary, where care is taken to move them frequently. The hilling up is done at the end of the second year, as in the former year. The third year requires no labor till the time when we proceed to pull up the root. Were, two methods are employed the pulling up by hand, and that of turning them out by a plough. The mode of taking them by hand, is by means of the spade or he. We dig to a various depth, according to that of the roots from 1 metre to 0.32. In the environs of Monteux, the depth is 075 metre. In our mechanical agriculture, (13) we have given the formula, by means of which can be determined the amount of labor necessary for a simple sloughing. We find by this means for that which is 0.75 metre deep in light soils which has not more than 000 metre of tenacity, by the dynamometric spade, and which is cut at three successive strokes of the spade of 0.25 metre each 52 days are required to be multiplied by 3, giving 156 days' work of men. But as at every stroke of the spade the workman is obliged to break the cold and to pull out the roots of m adder 12) Essay on Ladder, p. 76.13) Hours. d Agriculture, vol. iii, p. 196, &e 19 594 X. which are in it, and then to throw them into the heap before him non the ground already dug up, there is a portion of time in delays which experiment shows us is equal to four tenths of the time employed in digging 156 x 4,We have then, 156+ -2 184 days' work, or 2, 1810 hours. I f, in the same soil, we are obliged to dig only 0.52 metre we have for the result 145, 6 days' work. In stronger soils the roots penetrate less deep, and, supposing a soil of 0.030 metre of tenacity which must be dug out 0.50 metre, we have, after the 269 x formulas indicated, 269 +a+ -a- =a= 376,6 days' work10According to these indications, it will be easy to make a calculation for every case, when we know the depth to be obtained and the tenacity of the earth. At the end of each day, the roots pulled up are gathered into sheets, and then they are carried into the air, where they are dried. In the north, where the benefit of the sun is not enjoyed, we may delay the pulling of the roots till the time when the earth has less tenacity, because the m adder is dried in a warm enclosure. The process of drying by means of hot air may be employed, which will shorten the time of the operation, and render it more uniform. The extraction of the m adder by means of a plough requires it to penetrate by a single furrow to the depth in which the roots extend; in operating by two successive cuts of the plough, we cut the roots in two, to the injury of their beauty and equality for merchandise. This kind of labor will not answer, if we wish to penetrate deeper than 0.45 metre. We have seen (14) that it is necessary to reckon for soils of 0.048 metre of tenacity, and of 0.032metre depth, 'on a force of ten horses, going at the rate of one metre a second, or that 'of eight horses, at the rate of 0.80metre. (15) Suppose that we work on one square hectare, having 100 metres on a side, the alleys 'of the beds take up 20 metres, and there remains 80 metres in full for labor; and the rows, not being more than 0.20 metre breadth, we have 400 rows of 100 metre s length to go over. They require, every one of them, 125 seconds going at the rate of 0.80 metre) and 45 seconds more for turning at the end of the rows, which gives, as the whole time of labor 125 +a- 45) x 400 =a= 68,000 seconds, or 18.88 hours, or in fine, 1.89days. Ordinarily, two ploughs are employed on account of the delay that might be caused by injury to the plough or harness. Are, therefore, should be taken to procure a firm tickling, and to have a change at hand. We have for the price of labor, viz 14) Course of Agriculture, vol. I I I., p. 178.(15) We speak here of stout horses. To do this work, we frequently see 18 or 20 mules, more or less feeble. X.

When the root yields but scantily, a greater space is allotted to a couple of laborers. The experiment of one day soon shows the necessary quantity. Supposing that they should be placed at 10 metres distance, we have on 100 metres' length, ten men and ten women, and for the two days 20 days; work of men .a. .a. .a. . 119 20 kilog20 days' work of women. 0, *a* A....... 60.00 "he allow also for the labor of the plough. 146.36 "325 56 "or 88.01 francs, (wheat being at 27 francs the 100 kilogrammesWe have seen that in a similar soil, dug to the depth of 0.50metre with the spade, the labor amounts to 145 days' work 9 or 86 420 metres of wheat. There is then an economy of more than half in favor of extraction by means of the plough, and which is yet more by the high price of laborers at that period of the year. The work is no doubt more perfect with the spade; there remain less roots in the ground; but all the observations which we have be enable to make on these two methods of extraction have convinced us that the small quantity of roots which is left by the use of the plough do not equal the difference of expense, and so that the extraction by hand ought to be reserved: 1st. For soils where them adder penetrates to a greater depth than 0.45 metre, which is the case oftener in light soils which are deep. 2dly. For a field of too small space for the plough to turn in easily, or in which we are obliged to turn too often. The roots being dried so that they will break neatly without bending, they are put under cover in sheds 6. Extraction of roots at eighteen months. We have spoken of the extraction of the -roots of m adder done thirty months after it is sown; that is to say, the second autumn following; but many reasons may lead us not to wait till that time. The first of these and the most frequent one is the fear lest therhizoctone (a species of fungus) may attack the m adder and destroy it. Wherever we already have experience of the tendency of a soil to produce this detestable fungus, there is no cause for hesitation, especially if it is perceived at the beginning of its invasion in the first year. But there are also economical reasons which we must examine. We have said that the root of m adder is perennial. We cannot assign any ten to its life, and it continues to grow during all the 596 X. duration of its existence. This root is composed of an exterior brownish epidermis, which does not contain coloring matter, and which is rubbed off in grinding; then of cellular tissue, and of vessels containing the immediate principle which is deposited between the cells, and always become more abundant in the degree that the root grows older. The successive layers of substance formed immediately beneath, present this principle in a less forward state of purity; but it seems to grow purer the older it grows, and the central layers offer coloring matter of a purer description, or of the extra fine quality. The ali paris of Meant, which remain a longer time in the earth, bring a much higher price than the roots of Europe. In what proportions do these different parts appear at different ages? According to M. Masters experiments, the following proportion is obtained of these parts in the same space of earth at different ages: (16 n the fresh state .a. .a. In the dry state.

The second column will serve as a basis for our agricultural reasonings. Suppose a dry soil in which the weight of fodder of the second year gives us to hope for 19 50 kilogrammes of roots at thirty months; if we prolong, its period to 42 months, we may hope 23 595 or 400 kilogrammes more, which will cost Manure represented by 88.8 kilogrammes of nitrogen. .a. 594 k i log. of wheat, At the medium price of 73 francs per kilogramme for the 100 kilogrammes, or 278kilogrammes of wheat, the 400 kilogrammes of roots are worth. .0 1,112 " -leaving for the rent of ground. 518 " The whole question is then narrowed down to ascertaining if the ground rent for a year and the interest of capital expended will be covered by this excess of the crop of 518 kilogrammes of wheat value. In all the dry lends of the south the speculation may be good one; and it would appear to be an excellent one in the soils 16) Haste t Essay, p. 90,111-------------"Ex. a, 597 of Asia and Greece, where the period of the m adder is much prolonged. Met us make the same calculations for a m adder of 18 months age. We have supposed that it must yield 19 50 kilogrammes of roots in 30 months; we cannot now, therefore, hope for more than 16 185 kilogrammes. The difference, then, will be 331.5 kilogrammes, worth 921 kilogrammes of wheat. But we shall have to de duct from this loss 1. The difference of labor in extraction.

We conceive, then, in the circumstances in which thecultivators of Vaucluse are, their tendency is to pull up the m adder at 18 months, notwithstanding the inferiority of price of these young roots, which does not destroy the balance, which is favorable to this operation. They delay the extraction till 30 months only when the current prices are low, and they prefer to wait for its rise, leaving the m adder to increase in weight where it is in soils which will pay but little ground rent. Fresh m adder, also, is always sold either to the' merchant or manufacturer. It then brings a less price by 75 per cent. than the dry m adder. This valuation is nearly exact for m adder of 18 months; it will not be so for that of 30 months, which, when it is pulled in a dry time, only loses 0.70 in drying. We shall now speak. of the culture of m adder by transplanting 7. Transplanting of m adder, Of it is desired to trans plant m adder, we prepare the soil as for seed, using a quantity of manure sufficient to give the earth what is equivalent to 9.4 kilogrammes of nitrogen, for 100 kilogrammesof fresh root, which is to be planted. The rows are opened with a he in the same way as in sowing then the roots are spread at the bottom of the rows; 1,200 to 1,600kilogrammes of fresh roots are employed to plant a hectare. The root is then covered up in the same way as the seed, but buried to the depth of 0 6. or 0.8 metre. The cultivation is then the same as for m adder of one year old. Transplanting is a forced method for very porous soils in which the seed terminates badly, and for climates in which the sowing is much retarded. 'met us look at the economical result The m adder plant, bought at its usual price, will cost 2887.50kilogrammes of wheat, at the price of 275 kilogrammes of wheat for the dry root, and, consequently, of 270 kilogrammes for the fresh root.

The method of raising from the seed, then, always may appear the most advantageous, and the great capital which must be advanced to buy plants, always determines in its favor those cultivates who are not obliged to trans plant on account of the nature of their soils or the climate. Such is the culture of m adder. We remark that it dispense with one sloughing, which it would have been necessary to make at a clear loss in good cultivation, and which is occurred by the extraction of the root. In this deep culture we establish without expense plantations of trees, shrubs, luzerne, sainfoin and roots grain does not succeed very well until the soil has recovered itself, as takes place after all deep sloughings.

We have not taken it into the account, because it differs much in another country. In Vaucluse, the mean of the rent of the marshy soils is 1000 kilogrammes of wheat; the strong soils rent at least at 630 kilogrammes of wheat for this purpose, and more if they have never borne m adder. The grain will then be reduced to 313 142 kilogrammes of wheat for the light soils, and at 129 kilogrammes only for strong ones. But it is necessary to consider that the price of labor during the period of the extraction of the m adder root is increased one half besides, which reduces the profit in the first case, and constitutes a loss in the second. The condition of the proprietors of soils for m adder is infinitely better than that of the cultivates, who take the farms on rentKilogrammes.

This favorable condition will probably modify itself, if the cultivation continues to be extended far on the light and marshy soils which we meet on the coasts of the Mediterranean; but even in this case, at least of exceptional circumstances, there remains good profits to those who give themselves to this culture, for the considerable advances which it requires render it impossible for the mass of cultivates, and concentrate it, necessarily, in a small number of hands. We have seen that m adder cultivated in light soils gives a return ofKilog. 8 116 -82 3 194 k i log, in place of 275 kilog3750and for strong soils, 732 6 x 1890 -296027240 kilogrammes2297Ex. a. 601Let us examine now the case where m adder has been made without manure on new deep soils which can produce 1 280 kilogrammes of wheat per hectare, and which, consequently, contain 97 kilogrammes of nitrogen. The . Layer from which the wheat draws its substance being 0.25 metre, and that in which m adder does so 50 metre in depth at least, we have then 194 kilogrammes of nitrogen at the disposal of the latter plant and we may hope for a product of 1 550 kilogrammes of m adder. But, as the lower strata has been less exhausted than the upper, or because the fe utilizing principles are more easily assimilated than those of the manure, the product is ordinarily 2000. There would not be more at a second, and afterward at a third crop, because the whole layer would have been reached by the root of the m adder, which no longer so easily found a nutriment. We shall then have, asaboveFirst year. Right soil. Strong 319.79Medium soils (labor with plough) .a. .a. 114.84We cannot form a mean price of all these different prices, because these methods of industry do not concur in the same proportion in the market. Lie medium price of the market, which is 275 kilogrammes, removes from this concurrence strong soils cultivated by hand without manure; it is much easier to obtain that of strong soils cultivated by hand with manure. The only cultures which may yet be profitable are those of light soils and of moderate tenacity, made without manure when they are new for maid der, (and the number of those who possess such a virgin soil, are reduced every year) or, indeed, light soils or medium ones, cultivated with plenty of manure; these will stand in the way of the extension elsewhere given to this culture, because by means of a sufficient quantity of manure they may always attain to and sur pass the product of land cultivated without manure, especially if we apply to them less costly processes of tillage than those of harnessed machines604Ex. a. In the culture of rhubarb, (them Mode) in Steiermark, by Dr. Hlubektranslated by E. Good rich Smith, of the Patent Officefor a long time, the attempt has been made to obtain the genuine rhubarb on our soil. Manifold experiments have been tried, which have hitherto led to no satisfactory results. The cause of this may, in a great measure, lie in the fact that the seed of the true species cannot be obtained; for even the botanists are not agreed with respect to the species from which the true rhubarb is produced. According to the concurrent accounts of Mu7i ray, Jersey, Doyle, Timkowski, &c, the different species of rhubarb grows in the mountainous regions of Chinese Artery, in Hi bet, on the Himalaya, inNepoul, the For mountains, and other regions which are situated high, of northern Asia, without any cultivation, and, indeed, in sandy loam, dry soil, which is perforated by moles and otherrodentia, so that it may be kept the loose r, and their excrement s may furnish manure. The first and most excellent kind is called the Bucharian; also the Russian, Moscow, and Iberian rhubarb. This, as generally said, is brought from Bucharia and Mongolia into the border and commercial city, Kiachta, in Siberia, in order to obtain in exchange for it Russian fabrics, skins, &c. Were is appointed by the Russian commission, a druggist, who has a salary, under whose supervision the rhubarb which is destined for commerce is sorted out in the, so called, rhubarb courts, in presence of the producer, by certain laborers; divided into halves, bored into, scraped; that part which is injured cut off; the fungus and perforated roots separated, and all this refuse burned up. These roots, thus sorted out, are then packed in chests, so that all the large, and especially flat pieces may occupy the side and upper layers; the cylindrical or globular pieces have the second place, and the least pieces the body of the chests. The chests are then nailed up, covered over with skins of animals, and sent from Kiachta, across Moscow, to It. Petersburg h. But the plant which affords the most efficient roots, which is for the most part sent to Europe, Decandolle describes as a new variety. All ich named it Them Mode, On gave it the name, in his Flora jAepaulensis, of Them Jdustrale; Sweet, finally, not only portrayed it in his British Lower Garden, September, 1828,but gave a good description of it, in which the characteristics are stated as followsRheum ,Australe, D. Oh. papillosoasperum folk is cord ratio, obtusissimis, plan is, petrol is profunda sulcatis, panic la elongated, Tedicellis hexagonis verrucosis. The plant grows on the great plateau of middle Asia, at a height of 11,100 feet above the level of the sea, between 310 and 400 of latitude. The plant, when in blossom, may be distinguished at first sight from the other kinds by its dark red blossoms. X. a. 605 The best kind is brought from China, across Kiachta, to Russia. The foregoing description is adapted to the rhubarb which his imperial highness, the most serene Archduke John, distributed five years ago in the country, for experiments in agriculture, according to the heart shaped formation of the leaves and the deepfurrowedleafstem, very similar to the Them Mode, but does not agree in many other particulars with the same, and appears to be a new, not unknown kind; on which account I take the liberty of communicating what I have discovered in my four years" experiments and cultivation respecting the kind of rhubarb given me by the Royal Agricultural Society of Steiermark. Natural historical distinctions. The seed consists of a marrow y, three cornered berne l, similar to that of buckwheat, the point of which runs up pyramid ally; the dazzling white marrow of the berne l is surrounded by a brownish red shell, which forms the corners; the pyramid al point, as well as the back end, is in a great measure colored car mine red; above this berne l, the veil, or hair net, clings by means of the vegetable gum; and this is surrounded with many skins which are spread out into three wing portions. Of the seed is planted deep, it does not come up. It requires only a covering f ~f of earth, at a temperature of 18 to 20,Reaum., and, with sufficiency of moisture, may be terminated in 14 days. In the cultivation in the open air, the seed springs up in 30 to 40 days from the sowing in the spring, and in 30 days after the snow has melted in the spring, on being sown in Autumn. The autumn is preferable. In the first years, the plants form only 4 to 6 leaves, which wholly wither at the beginning of winter. In the middle of the April of the second year, and earlier also, according to circumstances but, then, more certainly, if, in our softer regions, the White Giant root (stratum Album) has begun to put forth also the red or pale red points of the rhubarb appear, which gradually open, and in time put forth 8 to 10 leaves, which are considerably larger than the former year. In the third year, more and more leaves continually appear which are of considerable size, and in the course of sixty days the plants put forth s talks and begin to blossom. Usually, toward the middle of June, the white blossoms appear in the upright shrubs, in which the flowering buds are seated; these, open, each bud forms a flower of six leaves, a style, and seven seamens. After the fruit has made its appearance, the flowers are of a light yellow color. In the upper part, which are last developed, the ant hers are colored car mine red. The seed reaches to a perfect ripe ness after five to six weeks from the period of blossoming, and many plants bear over twenty thousand seed. The root of the rhubarb is carrot shaped; the knots from which606Ex. the root leaves spring are on the highest part of the same, as in all such kinds of vegetable roots. In young roots, the knots are only furnished with a germ, in which' in the case of the older roots, especially, in a good soil, more germs are always produced around the knots. The tap root, after the knots, is the most useful part. In the root there are small projecting, warty streaks running across, and many fine fibres, which serve as conductors of nutriment from the earth. The root itself is enclosed in a fine yellow skin, which can repealed off; beneath this is found a second skin, which is somewhat thicker, not more easily to be separated, and grows with the other layers of the tissues; the interior is of different layers of tissue, which are formed from the outward portion of the root towards the interior. The later roots are first whitish yellow, and become yellower the older they are; so that, with the younger roots, we may observe a broad ring from without, which becomes more and more lost, the older the root is, and thus the more it is formed out. Of we taste the roots in the summer, every month, the close observer will find that the taste, from time to time, changes, and that at the time when the leaves begin to wither, and the .seed to fall off, the root appears to be most bitter; therefore, the harvest should be at this period, because the root contains the largest quantity of the peculiar bitter of the rhubarb; but the root attains the highest degree of perfection at a height of 3.000' to 4.000', at first, in eight to ten, and at a height of 4.000' to 7.000', in fifteen to twenty years. Cultivation. Our courage, as to the planting of rhubarb, falls, when we reflect that in its native land it succeeds at a height of 7,000 to 11,000Vienna feet, and in our country, at a height of 7,000 feet, produces only a scanty vegetation. In a word, we see ourselves limited in the cultivation of rhubarb to a height of from 3,000 to 5,000 Vienna feet. But as not every one who may be occupied in the cultivation of this plant has a scale of height, so I believe I must determine their successful place of growth, in respect to elevation above the level o of the sea, by means of the following plants of wild growth. In the height at which grow ver at rum album, (white giant weed popular name, Never) ar nice montana, (mountain wolfs bane popular name, Kraftwurzel) germ montana m, (spike hard root popular name, Benedict root) the rhubarb may be cultivated with certainty. Rhubarb requires a free open place 'of growth, for no plants t rives to get at the ' he so much as this. The great plateau of middle Asia, especially the deserts of Champ Mob i, as the greatest convex point of our plant, appears to be adapted to produce this admirable plant; but as we have no plateaus of this kind, we therefore place the rhubarb on the declivityes of the mountains which x. a. 607 do not incline lower than an angle of thirty degrees, and especially those where grow the a jug a re plans, (the creeping Gfinsipopularname, luck oo flower) which, on account of its bitterness, the countryman uses as a remedy for the gout and a tonic for strengthening the digestive powers; or gentian a late a, (yellow gentian which usually spread over the middle regions of the Alps; or where is to be found them monachorum, (or rum ex al sinus) monks rhubarb. In general, rhubarb requires a loam y clay p oil, which is composed of one half of sand and the other of clay and other constituents, such as lime, hum us, &c. A very tight, wet soil is not adapted to it, as the large leaves show, by which the plant attracts much moisture from the atmosphere, and at the same time keeps off too much moisture from the root, in consequence of a fall of pain. The results of the experiments which I have tried with rhubarb on different sorts of soil are the following 1. In hum one soils, the plants appear very luxuriant, the leaves attain considerable size, the number of the root fibres are quite large; on the other hand, no proportioned carrot like tap root is formed. The roots themselves are spongy, hollow and a little aromatic, and thus a hum one soil does not answer for the culture of the rhubarb2. In clay slate which has felt the influence of the weather, the plants grew at first very luxuriantly; but in continued drought are all withered up 3. In wood clearings, with old trunks of trees, the plants appeared luxuriant, and he 4d out through the winter; the soil was sandy loam; sub soil, guess in some spots, granite 4. In burned places of similar composition, on which the seed was scattered in autumn, the plants grew finely, and did not suffer from mice, which are very fond of the rhubarb seed 5. In loam y clay soil, of alluvial formation, the plants succeed very well, and acquire a fine smooth root 6. In the vicinity of alum mines the seed came up, but the plants soon perished From what has been mentioned, it follows that rhubarb requires a free, open situation, is fond of a dry, sandy, loam y soil that it demands a period of from eight to ten years, at a height of from 4,000 to 7,000 feet> till the root 'is so far formed as to yield a useful article of commerce. But that in the last named height, electricity exerts a very important effect on -the plant, every one must allow who has had opportunity to see the extraordinary freshness of the plant, after being subjected to the weather at such a considerable height. The root harvested in autumn must be cleansed from the earth not washed the outer skin drawn off, in which the inner skin must not be injured, cut into pieces, hung on threads, and dried at an artificial warmth of 300 Reaumur. The drying in the open air is not to be advised, as the root continually attracts moisture, like a strong hygroscopic body603Ex. a. State of my planting in Held en. At the end of the month of July, 1844, I produced from a three years' stock the seed of rhubarb, and immediately, in October of the same year, laid in the seed bed 1,800 grains, which, for the most part, came up in the spring of 1845, which I. caused to be transplanted towards the end of March into the beds. More than half of the roots were eaten in the winter by mice, because the young roots do not contain the bitter principle; I transferred the remaining ones, 8 30 pieces, to a limestone sandy lo amy soil, which had a western exposure, and an inclination of about thirty degrees on an average, into rows, so that there were about nine square feet allotted to each plant. The plants, kept as clean as possible, grew tolerably well, but during the burning heat many leaves fell off; yet the roots remained fresh, and after a rain put forth new leaves. The whole plantation occupied 210 square rods, so that one square rod was allotted to four plants. As in the first year thirty plants were lost, there remained in place the second, 800 pieces. In the autumn of 1845, I placed in a ploughed ground, the exposure of which was toward the north and northwest, and partly having an inclination of thirty to forty degrees, 2,400 grains; the s ward was dug up and turned in the form of rows, the intervals of s ward remaining between the furrows being the breadth of a foot. By the protracted drought, about 1,000 plants perished; the number of plants remaining being 1 400, on a space of 400 square rods. These two plantations in Held en lie in 47 2' 16' north latitude, and nearly 309 longitude from Herr o, at a height of 3,200 feet; and they at present exhibit a favorable appearance, so that we may hope that the effort of his imperial highness our serene elector and president, to establish the culture of rhubarb in our country, will be crowned with excellent success.

609APPENDI X No. 8. Strawberry Culture, Grape Culture, &e. Strawberry statistics of Cincinnati. By Charles List, Esq. As Cincinnati has for several years enjoyed a high reputation for the abundance and excellence of its strawberries, I have thought the statistics of this article might interest your readers. Your thousand bushels of this merry w re raised in this vicinity and sold in our market houses during the season of 1845, which was rather an unusually productive one. Twenty per cent. must be added as the quantity delivered at steamboats, hotels, private dwellings, and confectionaries, or sold at stands or agencies in various parts of the city. In 1846, this quantity was increased to four thousand two hundred bushels, with an addition of twenty five per cent. to the sales specified above. This was a cold and wet season, and unfavorable to their growth the increase in quantity springing from supplies afforded by newly bearing patches, which are added every year in the vicinity. In 1847, large quantities were sent off by railroads; and for the last three years additions must be placed to the quantity sold at hotels, steamboats, private dwellings, confectionaries, &c in the consumption of strawberries on the spots where they are raised, by pleasure parties from Cincinnati and other places in their vicinity. I should put down the entire product of the strawberry, therefore, in 1847, at 6,500 bushels, and in 1848 at 7,000 bushels each successive year increasing the proportion of strawberries sold directly to purchasers at their homes; &c, over that disposed of 'in markets. It will be observed that the Monday of each week exhibits lighter sales than the previous Saturday or succeeding Tuesday. I no general, however, these tables present a regular ascending and descending grade of production during the twenty-six days which ordinarily constitute the season. What di parity in supplies exists, is occasioned either by the weather -being unfavorable for gathering, or very heavy stocks so reduce the price as to make the expense of gathering too great to be profit ably borne at current rates of saleTjhe strawberries are brought in cases of five to eight drawers, each drawer containing thirty or forty quarts, which lie an average depth of two or two and a half inches. They are delivered in Cincinnati in time for sale as early as four to five o clock in the morning, when dispersed of at the market houses. A considerable share are sold in tin boxes of a quart each, or wooden ones of two quart s each, which fill up the same kind of drawer j. These usually command a better price, not only on account of more perfect keeping of the article, but because they measure out more than when filled into the ordinary quart measure. In former years they were brought in wagons. I once saw a four horse wagon backed up to our market with two tons of strawberries, packed in cases of drawers. We cultivate strawberries here with reference to their sexual distinctions, and find this treatment very successful. A good p situate or female plant is selected, such as the Hudson or Of over s needling, and the plants set out in rows 15 inches apart, and the rows about 15 inches from each other; then a path two or three feet wide; then a row of male or sta minute plants, such as will bloom about the same time as the female; and then a path a six. 611 before. When another bed of three rows of female plants, with paths and rows of male plants, until the patch is completed. The object is to keep the male plants separate from the female, so that the latter shall b. impregnated without being overrun by the male. This can easily be done by hoping the latter when they run intothe paths. In field culture, the plants are set out in rows eighteen inches or two feet apart from each other, and a male for about every ten or twelve female plants all in the same row. Either one or two rows are planted in this way, leaving three feet between the lands or room enough to plough and keep them clean. They are cultivated with the plough between the lands or beds, and with the ho ein the beds, to keep down the weeds and grass. Field culture.

Hudsonfirmnest, and best adapted for carrying to market. There is cultivated here about as many of the latter variety as of all the first three named, or, I might safely say, all others. The largest ferries produced at the Cincinnati Horticultural Society have been from . Doveys, but the general average of the whole crop, as to size, would probably be in favor of the Hudson. Our horticultural society has stimulated a spirit of improvement that has afforded specimens of extraordinary size and quality otherwise. Strawberries measuring five to five and one quarter inches in circumference have been repeatedly exhibited at its exhibitions of airs. In one or two instances specimens have been exhibited reaching to five inches and three quarters in measurement. The prices of strawberries vary, of course, with the character of the season and the different periods of sale. They usually open at 20 to 25 cents per quart, a price which they command only for a day or two, and soon fall to 15,. 12 k, 10, and 81 cents. When abundant, they command 5 to 61 cents, and occasionally fall to 3 to 4 cents. The season sales will not average higher than 7 cents, unless the season itself has proved unfavorable. I know of ho year in which strawberries have averaged as high as 10 cents per quart. At least two thirds of the strawberries sold here are raised on the banks of Picking river, a few miles above its mouth, which is just opposite Cincinnati. This affords the facility of water carriage, obviously of great advantage to the transportation of ripe fruit of a character so delicate as the strawberry. The entire quantity of ground on both sides of the Ohio which supplies this market cannot be short of two hundred and fifty acres. Such of this x. a. 613 is in small patches of one, two, three, or five acres, the smaller the spot, in general, the more productive (proportion ally) being the yield. One of the Hulbert sons, a family which raises more largely of this merry than any other, has some sixty acres in three patches. One of these comprehends a field of thirty-five acres. Must as the supply of strawberries is through in this market, it is succeeded by that of the ras perry, which, in the course of a few years, will probably be raised to equal extent. At present, the supply of raspberries is about one sixth that of strawberries. They are of vary us species the cane, yellow, black, red Antwerp, and ever bearing; of these, the red Antwerp is the general favorite. Raspberries average 18" cents per quart, during the season.

In our Atlantic cities, and still more in Europe, these articles command a price which denied their use to thousands whose appetites they tempt, and for who mr they would form a wholesome refreshment in seasons of sickness for themselves or families. I need not point out the bitter feelings towards the rich which such and other privations en gender in the, minds of these masses. Whatever tends to remove such distinctions in society, and place enjoyment and comfort alike within the reach of all the industrial classes, is so much gained to the general happiness of society ,at large. To man in Cincinnati feels that he cannot afford to buy his family everything which is sold in its markets. Of Act Nnati , February 12, 1849. I send you, in hope it will be in time for your report, what I know would be better prepared by its writer, Robert Buchanan, esq, one of our best horticulturists, than could be possibly 14 X. done by myself, a practical and reliable article on the grape of the west, and its wine product. L add one explanation, as comment, only. Mr. Buchanan has over stated the expense, and under stated the profits, through a desire not to mislead any person who might desire to enter into the grape culture. Any of his suggestions derive great value from the fact that they indicate a variation from the' treatment of the grape in the wine countries of Europe, which is necessary to success here. One great ,object in Germany and France is to expose the fruit as much .as possible to the drying and ripe king influence of summer heat; while here they need nothing of the kind, by extirpation of the leaves or otherwise, the arid character of our summers being rather injurious than the reverse. Very respectfully, yours, Charles Of Lion. Eemund Bubke. Cinci Nnati , February 10, 1849. Dear Of R: At your request, I now give you the mode adopted by myself, and some others in this vicinity, in cultivating the vine for wine making. At the same time, I feel that it would come with greater propriety from Mr. Long worth, to whom, more than to any other man in the west, we are all indebted for our knowledge in grape culture.

Summer p runing consists in breaking off the lateral sprouts and shoots, so as to leave two strong and thrifty canes or -vines-one of which is to bear fruit the ensuing season, the other to be cut down in spring p runing to a stir to produce new shoots. These may be let run to the top of the stakes, and trained from one to the other, until the wood is matured, say in August or September, when the green ends may be broken off. One of these vines is selected next spring for bearing fruit, and cut down to 4 to 6 joints, and bent over and fastened to the stake in the form of a bow. The other is cut away, as well as the fruit bearing wood of the last year, leaving spurs to throw out new wood for the next, and thus keeping the vine down to within 1. to 2 feet of the ground.

It i estimated that over three hundred acres are now planted with the vine within a circuit of twelve miles round Cincinnati nearly two thirds of which were in bearing last year, producing, notwithstanding th'e rot, so injurious to many, about 50,000 to 60 000 gallons of wine. The Catawba is our great wine grape, and principally cultivated. The Gape is next, but few are planted. The I s abel la is not profitable for wine, and is only raised for fable use.

A bushel of grapes, if well ripened, will produce three and a half to four g allons of wine. By proper economy, a man may have a vine yard of several acres in a few years, without feeling the expense to be burdensome. Commence by trenching one a ere in the winter, and planting it out in the spring; next year another acre, and so on, for five or six years. , After the third year, he will have his own cuttings from the first acre, and also grapes enough to pay for the cost of planting the succeeding additions to his vine yard. Of he has suitable timber on his own land, the stakes can be got out in the winter with but little out lay in money. By this course the cost of a vine yard of six acres would not be half as much as mine. Some prefer planting in rows, four by five; others, four and a half by four and a half; and; on level land, three and a half by six, or even seven feet.

Dai Of. S]. L. Wishs report on cheese to the New York State '1griculturalSociety. Of Tchfi Eld, Herki Mer County, 1847. Dear Of R: At your earnest solicitation, I have attempted to give a condensed account of my observation and experiments in cheese making for several years past; in which I cannot be as brief a spy be desired, and allude to the variety of circumstances which have a bearing upon the intricate science of cheese making. Having been engaged personally in 1845, in some sixty fairies which were located in thirteen towns and four counties, and more or less in the same manner the past two years, I have observed a marked difference in the capacity of soils for producing herb age, under different modes of culture, and the various conditions and treatment of cows, affecting their capacity for milk, both as regards quality and quantity. The inconvenient and improper fixtures, in many instances, for making and curing cheese, which are to be found, all unite in convincing me that any set rules for making cheese would not be practicable, even with the most proficientObeese maker; because n the first place, milk is a very sensitive fluid, and liable to be varied in quality by impure water, damp and un ventilated stables, change of diet, excess of feeding, excitement of temper, irregular milking, salting, &c, when i destroy its susceptibility to produce like practice 2d. Cheese, when pressed and exposed in a curing process, is no less sensitive, and equally liable to be varied in texture and flavor, by size of cheese, exposure to excess of heat, bad air, &c, the effect of which I shall hereafter notice' There are, however, leading principles which form the basis of operations, and should be closely adhered to in all cases in the process of manufacturing cheese. Salt, men net, heat, and pressure are the principal agents used in converting milk into cheese, the flavor and texture of which is determined by their proportionate use. The proportion is varied by different dairy men, according to their notions of propriety, as best adapted to their fixtures, experience, &c. Hence arise the great inequalities in fairies in the same neighborhood, and even in the same dairy rooms may be found as many different qualities of cheese as there are of fruit in an apple orchard. Some of these are matured at an early period, while others mature later, and are unsuited to the same market. Such of the cheese being contracted for before it is made, (in the early part of the season) both buyer and maker are liable to x, a. 619 be disappointed in the cheese being suited to the market for which it is designed, destroying the confidence of purchasers, and injurious to the best interests of the dairy man. It is, therefore, necessary that makers should have sufficient knowledge of the science to determine the result of their practice, which cannot be learned from verbal instruction. It is by practical experience and close observation only, that the maker can learn to adapt his practice to the frequent and extreme changes to which our climate is subject, varying the quality of the milk, and materially affecting cheese in process of curing. I will suggest a plan (in the following table) of keeping a dairy book, or memorandum of each days practice' which I have adopted in my dairy for several years past, and which has greatly enabled me to investigate the science of cheese making, being a table illustrating the experiments made by o. 59. 621 The evenings and mornings milk is commonly used to make-one days cheese. The evenings milk is strained into a tub or pans and cooled to prevent pouring. This is done by running water through a vessel set in the milk, or setting pails filled with cold water into the tub, and stirring till cool; but little cream will rise over night. The cream is taken from the evenings milk, and kept till the evenings and mornings milk are put together, and warmed to receive the men net. This is often done by heating a part of the evenings milk to a temperature that will warm the whole mass. Both are objectionable, because the natural affinity which is necessary to preserve between the constituent parts a perfect coherence is destroyed, by a portion of the milk being over heated. It is better to warm the whole mass in a manner that will produce an equilibrium of heat, which is best done by placing the vessel containing the milk within a larger vessel, with two inches under the bottom, and one inch of space at the sides, into which space water may be put to cool the milk, and into which steam may be let to warm the milk and scald the cure. The more water surrounding the milk, the more uniform will be the heat. The cream, if added, (which is generally done) is best incorporated with the milk, by putting it with twice its quantity of new warm milk from the cow, and add warm water to raise its temperature to ninety-eight degrees. Stir it till perfectly limp id, add cream to milk, and then put in men net, that the same stirring may mix both at once with the mass, I f milk is curled below eighty-four degrees, the cream is more liable to work off with the they. An extreme of heat will have alike effect. Curling heat is varied with temperature of the air, or the liability of the milk to cool after adding men net. (see table, April and June) A fine cloth spread over the tub while the milk is curling will prevent the surface from being cooled by circulation of air. To jarring of the milk, by walking upon a spring y floor or otherwise, should be allowed while milk is curling, as it prevents a perfect coherence. Rennetvarious opinions exist as to the best mode of savingrennet, and that is generally adopted which is supposed will curdlethe most milk. I have no objection to any mode that will preserve its strength and flavor, so that it may be smelt and tasted with good relish when put into the milk. Any composition not thus kept I deem unfit for use, as the coagula to is an essential agent in cheering the cure, and sure to impart its own flavor. Therennet never should b taken from the calf till the excrement shows the animal to be in perfect health. It should be emptied of its contents, salted and dried, without scraping or rinsing, and kept dry for one year, when it will be fit for use. It should not be allowed to gather dampness, or its strength will e vapor ate. To prepare it for use, into ten gallons of water (blood warm) put ten men nets, c turn or rub them often for twenty-four hours, then rub and press them to get the strength, stretch, salt and dry them as before. They will gain strength for a second use, and n may be used when 6 22 Of . Toe. No. 9 the weather will admit of soaking them to get the full strength like the liquor as salt as can be made, strain and settle it, separate it from sediment, (if any) and it is fit for use. Six lemons, two ounces of c loves, two ounces of cinnamon, and two ounces of common sage are sometimes added to the liquor to preserve its flavor and quick en its action. Of kept cool in a stone jar, it will keep sweet any length of time desired, and a uniform strength can be secured while it lasts. Stir it before dipping off to set milk, take of it enough to curl de milk firm in 40 minutes. Squeeze or rub through a rag anal to enough to make the cure a cream color, and stir it in with the men net. When milk is curled so as to appear like a solid, it is divided into small particles, to aid the separation of the they from the cure. This is often too speedily done, to facilitate the work, but at a sacrifice of quality and quantity. The three indispensable agents, heat, men net and pressure, rightly applied, must keep pace with each other in effect. The two former operating to sub divide, the latter to aid co lesion, by bringing the particles of a sameness closer in' contact. This should be skillfully and studiously applied in a mild way, according to the capacity of the cure to receive it. The less friction in working the cure, the less waste. Of heat is raised too fast, or commenced while the cure is too young, the effect of the men net will be checked, and decomposition will not be complete, and will result in a leak y cheese. This often happens when steamers are used in small fairies. Seat may be raised in scalding to keep pace with refine t; if the men net is quick, heat may be raised quick if slow, heat must be raised slow and, held longer. (see, table, April 24 and 26.) Scaldingheat may be carried from 96 to 104 degrees, according to the size of the cheese, and temperature to which the cheese is exposed. During the process of scalding, the they and cure should be kept in motion to prevent the cure from settling and sticking together, as separating it is attended with great labor and waste from friction When the cure is cooked so that it feels elastic, and will squeaky when chewed with the front teeth, it is separated from the they to receive salt. This is done by dipping it into a s trainer over a basket or sink, or drained off and salted in the tub. Either may be done without adhering in lumps, by stirring it in a small portion of they, till cooled to 94 degrees. This is the most critical part of the process, where cheese makers are most likely to, err, as the portion of salt retained in the cheese after pressing will be in proportion to the capacity of cure to receive it when, added. At a particular period and temper of cure when draining, off they, it will absorb salt freely, and after being thoroughly mixed and packed up for a few minutes while warm, it will be evenly shrunk and cleansed by salt and they, and will press out freely; but if the cure is not well cooked, or cooled too fast in draining off they, it will acquire a degree of stubborn ness, prevent the absorption of salt to shrink and cleanse, and no amount of pressure will be sufficient to drive out the fluid, I ft cure is not worked even, the larger lumps will not be cooked x. I of. No. 59. 62 3 enough, or the lesser too much, (like large leaves of bread and small biscuit baked together in one oven) hence, the cheese is left impregnated with the elements of ferment at ion, which increase on being exposed to heat, till the cheese is sufficiently swollen (or huffed) for each constituent to occupy a separate space in the same shell, or mind. The fluids first attract together by affinity, forming small cavities in which they remain unaffected by salt, become foetid, and generate an unpleasant odor, which is a fair proof of the quality of men net used. Ourd should be salted warm; it is then most absorbent, and thoroughly cooled before putting it to press, to suppress th'e combined action of heat and men net. The quantity of salt required varies with the condition of the cure, size of cheese, amount of heat to which the cheese is exposed in curing, and market for which it .is designed. A well worked cheese, from fifty to one hundred pounds, requires one pound of refined salt to forty pounds of cure, to remain in the cheese after it is pressed and exposed to a temperature of from seventy to eighty degrees. This may be varied from two to four pounds to the hundred, according to the texture of cheese required small cheese requiring less, and large cheese more. A degree of moisture is necessary in cheese for a mall table texture, but this should not be from animal fluid contained in the cure. A high salted cheese immediately exposed to high temperature, becomes s out, hard, dry, and crumbling; the same exposed to a cool, damp atmosphere, retains sufficient moisture to be soft, yet solid. A cheese light salted, in a high temperature, will cure quick, become porous, puffy, and stale. Ourd from hay milk requires much less salt than that from grass or grain feed, as it is poorer, and will retain salt like lean meats. The richer the milk, the more salt is required to control the animal properties, and the less absorbent the cure; the pores being filled with the finer battery particles. (side table, April and Augustmore salt is required in hot weather, also. to overrule the combined action of 'en net and heat, neither of which will be effective alone. When cure is ready to press, it is important to dis possess those decomposing agents. The gastric juice (or coagula t oris a fluid, and works off with the animal fluids in they; and the only way to get rid of it is to work the cure down fine and solid, and work the they all out, When cool the cure thoroughly before pressing, and the cheese will be solid and keep its place. But if the they is not all out, the de composer is yet on hand, continues its action (aided by heat) till an equilibrium of chemical action is destroyed in the cheese, and the fluid properties leak out in fetidwhey and oil, leaving it a rank acid worthless article. In short, the proper method of using salt must be arrived at by a close observation as to its chemical combination with the constituent properties at different ages of the cheese with different sizes, heat, dampness, &c. This (although an essential point) has not been sufficiently determined by chemical analysis to be reliable. Pressingwhen cure is properly tempered for pressing, a cotton or linen cloth is spread over the hoop, the cure is put in and 4 X. depressed with from here to twelve tons weight, turned twice in eight and forty .hours, i into clean dry cloth. The press should be faithful, and follow do win as the cure yields, (when young) to press out they before a mind is formed to prevent its escape. There isn op danger of too much pressure after the first ten minutes. The press, hoops, cloths, &c, should be cleaned with let often, to keep the mind from cracking. The cloth is taken from the cheese when it is taken from the hoop. The cheese is set on a table for a few hours, till dry enough to absorb oil, and then painted withannatto mixed in strong let, (from common ashes) kept in a jar for ready use. This tough end the mind so that it will not require much grease after the first coat, to make a smooth mind, if rubbed, often with the hand moistened with oil. The paint will fade to a rich butter color, which is as high a color as is desirable. A firm mind may be formed upon cheese when young, by a careful exposure to drying air, frequent rubbing with the hand, and no more oil than will readily incorporate with the mind. Of more grease is used than will be taken up, it will sooner or later f lake off, leaving the cheese scab by without mind, exposed to cracks, flies, mould, &c. Oil for gr easing cheese is obtained from cream s dimmed from they after standing 24 hours it is churned till separation takes place like butter, then melted over a slow fire till it is turned to oil. A preparation of bees wax, from to , mixed with oil, will make a mind imperious to flies. It is most desirable that cheese designed for foreign markets should be in a proportion half as thick as they are wide, and not to exceed 100 pounds in weight. The size of the hoop may be calculated from the number of gallons of milk; each gallon will make one pound of cheese. A cheese 21 inches wide will weigh 141 lbs. to each in. in depth 20 12 lbs.

The band should not cover more than an inch or inch and a half of the flat surface. Heavy cheese must be banded with cloth that will not stretch, or its gravity will make them ill shape n. In April last, I divided cure into two equal parts, after it was salted and ready to press, and pressed in equal and varied shapes to ascertain the result of varied heat, salt, &c. April 24th, (see schedule of April) No. 1 was kept in a room of from 90 to 100 degrees heat; did not puff, but not having men net enough to keep pace with the heat, soured, was hard, dry, and smart; shrunk twelve per cent. in sixty days.

No. 4 put with No. 2; huffed, cured quick, and was light, porous and sharp. Doubling the amount of salt would control men net, and keep cheese from puffing; but did not prevent them from pouring, becoming hard and un merchant able. The time of curing was in proportion to the amount of heat and men net used. Some of the high salted cheese in a hot room were bitter; but none in the cool room had that flavor, were longer curing, shrunk less, and were better cheese. The same course was taken in August, by dividing several days' cure each day into three equal parts, pressed alike, and exposed to different temperatures in curing. The result was in favor of a -medium rate of salt and heat, high salting, and heat making hard, smart cheese; low salting and heat, soft, mild, and taste less; low salting and high heat, porous, soft, and sharp. In 1845, the experiments alluded to, with sixty varies, being got up expressly for shipment, a selection was made from the largest and most experienced dairy men in thirteen towns. A vigorous effort was made to reduce the whole practice to one general rule, consisting in strict cleanliness in every department, an equilibrium of heat in milk to set, not exceeding ninety degrees, with pure men net to curl de milk in forty minutes; cure thoroughly worked by hand till as fine, when scalded, as wheat or corn; cure scalded in they with heat not exceeding one hundred degrees, and that heat held until the cure appeared shrunk, aid would squeaky when pressed, between the front teeth. The they to be drained off, and the curdsalted while warm, with 21 pounds of refined salt to 100 pounds of cheese, cooled and pressed forty-eight hours. Cheese half as high as wide. These leading points strictly adhered to, were found adequate to produce the article required, where curing rooms were constructed so as to preserve a uniform moderate temperature. The cheese, not affected by extreme changes of climate, fermented slowly and uniform, mind firm and smooth with little grease; texture firm and solid, yetmalleable like butter; the flavor mild and pleasant. The weather being cool til i June, a great uniformity was manifest in shape and texture. A sudden change of weather to 88 degrees heat, lasting several days, produced a contrast in different fairies, equal to the extreme in temperature, which was found in many dairy rooms to exceed the common atmosphere from 8 to 10 degrees. With little or no ventilation in these, cheese were much swollen, and could be kept in shape only by using less men net and more salt. The huffed cheese remaining in same rooms became painted, or generated a sharp, unpleasant flavor; those removed to a temperature suited to .to their constitution, cured quick, and were well adapted to, early home markets. Those salted high enough to stand the excess of heat, were hard, dry, crumbly and smart. A dry room was found 206 26 X. I C.

One se and like experiments, too numerous to detail, confirm my conviction that much of the bad flavor complained of in the American cheese, may be prevented with proper attention to curing. I n addition to the extreme changes of weather in our climate, which are more than sufficient to destroy the constitution of a well manufactured .cheese, the practice too generally prevails, of placing cheese in some left or upper room, least needed for other uses, and often m not to a roof, where heat concentrates, and cheese becomes literally baked as in Los. 1 and 3. I deem such rooms best as are calculated to preserve an equilibrium of low temperature. A tight, spacious, studded and plastered lower room, well ventilated with northern exposure, where heat may be increased, and air dried by fire and ventilation, or cooled and damp end if required, by air from 'an 'underground or adjoining room, where ice may be kept, is best adapted to this climate. A. L. Of Of. B. P. Johnson, Esq, Secretary. X. a. 6APPENDI X No. 1.. -WOOL. Nashvi    Lle, Tenn ~o member 1, 1848. Dear In: Your valued favor, requesting agricultural information, was duly received. After some reflection, I have concluded to confine myself to one subject mainly that is, to wool growing; though your inquiries embrace many other subjects which have come under my observation. The annual import of the United States is about eight millions of pounds of raw wool; when, in my opinion, we should export very largely; and if the opinions which I here introduce should aidirneffecting a change, I shall be fully compensated. In your annual report for the year 1847, I find sentiments expressed by Charles L. Fleischmann, esq, from which I dissent. He, says that Russian "silesian, a province in the north' of Germany, has gained the reputation of producing not only the finest wool, but of being the only market where thorough blood can be obtained." l He again says: "several attempts have been made in the United States to raise fine wool, but they have never fully succeeded; and to effect a profitable result, we must bring from Germany a thorough blooded flock. It will astonish some of our American Farmers, when they are assured that a single ram is sold at from fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars." I contend that the t cited States is a better. wool growing region than any part ofGermanany, o any portion of Europe; and that the low latitudes of the United States have advantages over the high. I contend that as fine wool is now grown in the United States as can be produced in Germany; and as thorough bred sheep likewise 1 contend, furthermore, that the low latitudes, from 36 degrees down to 28 degrees, in the United States, can grow as fine wool as any part of Europe or America; and that as fine rams can be bought in the State of Tennessee for                                      $50, as those in Germany which sell for                                               $2,000. Holding these opinions to be true, I shall attempt to offer some of the evidence which produced them in my mind. In 1814, I found myself a young Tennessean, and the distant fame of the mere no sheep, with his golden flee ce, greatly excited my curiosity, and, in search thereof, I commenced a trip to the east. Were commenced my study of sheep and wool growing; and from that period to the present I have given it close attention. I have kept samples of wool, with labels, giving the date, pe degree, &c for thirty-five years. I n 1823 and 1824, I imported from Saxonymerinos of the purest blood; and from that date to the present 68- X 'have samples of that importation, with all the experiments I have made in crossing for improvements. I have many samples from the most improved American flocks, and many Saxon samples likewise. I have lately received from Mr. Faint or some samples of the best sheep in Europe, with two animals of the selection made for Mr. Co ville, of Connecticut, being from the best flocks in Europe. I have also the card of eighteen samples of wool made by or. Fleischmann from the finest sheep ofSilesia, and other sections of that country. I f, therefore, a study of thirty-five years if endless experiments in the time, with diligence, perseverance and devotion to the subject should qualify me to judge of wool by the samples, and the qualities of the bearer by their presence, I have come to correct conclusions, as above stated; for, by comparison, I find Tennessee growing as fine wool as any of the samples before me, and there are many other flocks in the United States doing the same. His is not a general thing, of course, and I presume the fact was not known to Mr. Fleischmann when he said the attempts in the Unitedstates to grow fine wool had failed. A few flocks in the United States have continued pure the best importation from Saxony, in 1823 24, when she had reached a higher reputation in her flocks than Pain, or any other division of Europe. From and after this period, the history of wool culture in Saxony shows that she gave up quality for quantity. But the thorough bloods that had been sent off to the United States before this, in the hands of a few careful proprietors, who have been true to the subject, still preserve all the beauties of the flee ce which had given distinction to Saxony, previous to her change. Theseflcks now in the United States produce wool as fine in fibre, freer from hairs, and of greater length and softness, than the present German flocks; hence I think it the best broadcloth wool grown on the globe. The descendants of that importation in the low latitudes of the United States are superior to those brought over' which I attribute to climate. I have said above that the low latitudes have, the advantage in wool growing. An opinion has long prevailed, and will not be changed till experience reaches otherwise, that the warm climate will not produce fine wool. This idea seems to be supported by illustrations drawn from those animals bearing fur. This is fair as an argument, but yields to proofs of a higher grade. In 1839, I became a cotton grower in the State of Mississippi, in latitude 321 1 north, and removed my Saxony flock from Tennessee, in latitude 360, to my cotton plantation, where I kept them six years. I have the samples grown in that latitude, and consider them the best samples of wool I have ever seen. They possess more of the requisites for a perfect flee ce and fitness for superior broadcloth than the produce of the same sheep in latitude 360 my present residence. I attribute it to this fact, that in Mississippi the food is better adapted to sustain a healthy .condition of the skin, which x. To. No. 59 his kept oily by warmth; green herb age and succulent food during winter as, well as summer. The pores of the skin were not closed, the wool did not cease to grow, there was no fever from housing, crowding, and from dry food, but a regular, uniform, and continuous growth of flee ce the whole year; which cannot, I think, be produced in any latitude as high as 510; which is the parallel passing through the north of Germany, where it is necessary to feed six months in the year from November till May. But economy I rank as the chief advantage of the low latitudes, where lands are cheap, very cheap, and green food for winter as well as other seasons. My observations for six years' residence, and to the present time, by annual visits, in latitude 320, prove, to my mind that the tendency is to improve rather than deteriorate the quality of the wool, even where the finest wools are attempted. A flock in the warm climates requires but- little feeding, a very small investment in land, and but little labor in preparing for winter; hence, economy points to a region south of 510 as the true sheep region. Of I have offered any evidence which would be satisfactory to others on the subject, I would suggest that the culture of wool be incorporated with that of cotton, as the latter seems to be depressed t fr below its intrinsic value perhaps by over production; but be the cause what it may, it is very low, and a suggestion of any plausible substitute would be worthy of experiment. I suggest wool growing upon the tired lands in the cotton -districts; sow down rye, peas, oats, and whatever else may grow well in that region, and pasture the flocks thereon; and in this wayrenovate and restore the worn and tired lands, instead of a more expensive method of maturing. This would increase the growth of wool and decrease the quantity of cotton The United States export two millions eight hundred thousand bales of cotton, and import eight million pounds of wool annually. In addition to the tired lands in the cotton region, there are many millions of acres of land in the south and west unfit for the plough, but yet growing excellent food for sheep. The tendency of the mere no is to r amble and take a great variety of food; hence they are better fitted for the hilly sections of the south than any other species of stock; and these lands which are now a tax upon the proprietors, might, by industry and attention, at some future day be covered with flocks, attended by shepherds, aided by his faithful dog; and thus convert the scattered herb age into the golden flee ce, yielding profit to the industrious and wealth to the nation. The growth of sheep adds to the necessaryes of life. To food is more health full and delicate for the .table; no clothing more comfortable for man. There must therefore be -a demand for these necessaryes, (wool and mutton) as we are so rapidly increasing in population. When the councils of Europe and America assemble to deliberate and -legs late, they appear clothed in the flee ce, of the superior mere no flocks. National pride should be stimulated at home, and an American630ex. congress man should feel proud when he can say " I wear a coat as fine as any nobleman of Europe, and the flock which furnished it grew in my own State, and was not imported from a foreign land To my brother farmers of the west, and cotton growers of the south, I say it requires no importation from Germany or elsewhere; no large investment of capital in a foreign land to commence the wool culture, and to prosecute it profit a by anywhere in the Unitedstates, from Paine to Texas. Capital, skill, and industry, are requisite to effect great results in all pursuits; but much, very much, may be effected in wool growing, with a small stock of cash, when combined with other agricultural pursuits. Those of small capital may commence the business with a few hundred, or even one hundred eyes of the common stock, which may be purchased at one dollar each. When select rams of thorough blood, from those flocks which have preserved pure the best Saxon importation of 1824. They are to be found in the United States, in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Vermont; and if not certainly found there, call on Tennessee, and know they can be found there. It will not require                                               $2,000,                                                                                                                                                             $1,500,                         $60 O, or even                                     $400, to purchase them as it does in Germany, as Mr. Fleischmann shows, but merely the fraction of                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100. To not hastily conclude that this great difference in price must result from a difference in quality and value. The foreign price is artificial, and far above the true value, produced by accumulated wealth, pride, and strong competition. Our home price is below the true value for the want of these stimulants. My directions for a selection of rams, after you have found the flock of satisfactory pe degree, are these the fine Saxony ram, combining the proper quality for a breeder, should possess a round, long, well proportioned barrel, giving ample room in the chest, and injuring- a constitution of quick, lively action, with a fine, soft, thick, long flee ce, by all means uniform in quality, with a fine smooth skin; for without a fine smooth skin, which is the soil on which the crop is to grow, there will not be that uniformity in the fibre, which is so essential to the manufacture of fine cloths; a rough coarse skin will, like a badly prepared soil, yield an uneven crop, some fine and some coarse, varying in felting properties, and will be seen in fine fabrics. Theroundness of the body is produced by a well arched rib. Avoid flat sided bucks, their offspring will be delicate, sickly, and short lived; they want space for the lungs and digestive organs, and are liable to disease, for want of resisting capacity in the system. Having the eyes and the, bucks, they are to be kept separate and apart until October, generally, here varying the meaning time according to the latitude, but producing the lambs at the opening of spring, when succulent vegetables may be found by the eyes. The period of he station is 148 days, and one buck may be allowed to 50 eyes. X. 
631The first season will yield a young flock of half bloods, and the second and third will begin to show the compounding influence of annual births, with improvements in form and value. I have not space, nor is it designed in this article, to give any system of rules for the management and general treatment of flocks, nor would any general statement of profit be of any service. The system of treatment would vary and become widely different, as different latitudes are find upon for the operations. The management in latitude 320, should vary much i rum that in 450, in the United States; but, as a general remark, I would select dry undulating lands, give daily exercise in all suitable weather, never confine them long on the same grounds or pasture, and furnish moist food and not. dry, if to be avoided. They should not be crowded in close houses and forced to breathe a vitiated air. The mere no is a hardy animal, and free from disease, if not produced by improper management. They have constitution and much vitality, and require exercise, and a variety of moist, nutritiousfood, and a dry resting place, not shelters, if the climate be warm, but hill sides, which send off by the rains, impure ties and allow a free circulation of air. Our botany c doctors select from the herbs of the forest their remedies for all the diseases of the human family; so sheep, guided by the instincts of nature, when allowed to r amble in the fields and forests, will, by a judicious selection of a stringent and la natives, maintain good health. Details of disease are not attempted in this if so, I could report the result of thirty-five years' practice. By remedies, chiefly, with my own flock, are preventives. Cotton has its appropriate latitude 320, and admits of but little variation; but the latitude of wool is from Paine to the mouth of the mio Grande, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In any portion of this wide spread domain, wool culture may be made a fair profitable branch of agriculture. Of I should be governed by my own experience in this matter, I should incline to select those sections of the country which would not be expensive in lands; open and mild in winter, to avoid the six months' feeding in Germany, and where the flee ce can be kept growing all the year by green, succulent food; thereby preventing a check in growth, which injures the uniformity of the fibre, omitting the expense of long housing and feeding, during the rigors of the long winters. An competition be feared from the old world, filled to overflowing with human beings, with lands renting from                  $6 to                                                                                                                                                                                             $10 per acre, and compelled to feed for half the year ?a? I industry and energy answer, no. and may these sentiments, aided by national pride, and a land able desire and competition in the warm and cold climates for the golden flee ce, bring up this neglected subject to its proper influence in American agriculture. The labor of a nation is its wealth; and all good citizens are equally interested in its proper divisions and directions. The excesses in different branches should be directed into other channels by the talents of the nation                                               $2 X. a. Farmers who super intend the fields and flocks are not usually inventive in plans, or skilled in political economy; may I not be excused, therefore, if I invoke the aid of the learned and talented statesmen of the United States (whether in or out of office) in the examination of the subject of wool culture. Our natural resources appear to be boundless. The bearer -of wool may treat with profit those lands fit and those unfit for the plough. My opinion is that sheep may serve as a profitable renovation of tired cotton lands, from Charleston to Matamoras. From my own experience in Mississippi and Tennessee, I can say that the finest wools for the best broad cloths may be grown in all the cotton regions of the United States; but as the greatest consumption of wool is in the coarser fabrics, the habits of the southern people would point to it as most likely to succeed in the medium qualities. After s hearing in the spring, I will furnish at your office samples of wool grown in 321 and 360, showing what has been accomplished in the attempts in the United States to grow fine wool, and furnishing strong proof in favor of the warm climate. In Tennessee, we have no public exhibition of stocks by organized societies at present. I will, therefore, send you samples of wool to test the correctness of the opinions which I have advanced. I should be highly gratified by an opportunity of exhibiting thorough bloods against any man in Europe or America the points of comparison to embrace size and shape of the animal, fine ness, weight, and uniformity of flee ce. This may seem to be boasting, but it is not so intended; for, as before stated, I have a Saxony flock, based upon an importation in 1823 4, when the fame of her f locks was deservedly extended far and wide. I have given this importation i my strict personal attention for twenty-five years, and have labored to cure defects and render them perfect. I only wish to ascertain if any one has done more care not from what country he may come, for I am confident he could have had no advantage in that particular. The sheep has a domestic foe in the worthless our, who often commits depredations upon the valuable flocks. Would this nuisance be lessened by a tax on the extra number kept at many places, leaving always the watch dog, to whose fidelity protection and attachment are ever due? if so, will legislatures generally extend this protection to the herds which I hope to see rapidly increasing throughout the, country f there should be manifested any general disposition to adopt the wool culture in the great west, I will endeavor to make public, for their benefit, in some agricultural journal, the results of my experience on two other points, which might be useful to many whose attention has never been directed to the subject, namely 1st. General directions for the management of a flock in the south and west, embracing feeding, crossing, s hearing, and putting up wool for market, washed or un washed. &c, &c 2d. A system of remedies for the diseases which are most corn x. 633 on among sheep; as signing the causes of the disease, when known, that they may be avoided by care and attention. Any deaths will likely occur when there is a very limited knowledge of disease; but a little attention for a few years will remedy this objection. I should, therefore, recommend be dinners to commence with low priced eyes and a fine buck. The investment would be small, and the improved value of the offspring, from the mere no crop, would prevent any loss, in the hands of the most un informed, unless by gross negligence they should be suffered to perish. In the lower districts of the United States, which are too warm for corn, and therefore unprofitable for the raising of pork, sheep may be grown as a partial substitute for pickled' pork. The mutton, skin and wool, will compensate well for the investment and necessary attention. I feel a, deep and abiding interest in the prosperity and success of the cotton districts, and am confident that wool growing, will aid to sustain them in times of difficulty and depression, like the present, when the great staple, cotton, is forced below its intrinsic value, by. causes abroad over which they have no control. To avoid the influence of foreign wars, commercial disasters and bankruptcies in Europe, let the spindles and looms be brought to the corn fields "of our rich valleys, near the cotton fields; draw off a portion of the labor from the tired lands of the cotton districts, and transfer it to the cotton mills; resuscitate the worn lands by peas, rye and oats, for the flocks. A portion of all large cotton plantations may reduce the number of acres in cotton without affecting the yield, by adopting this rotation, and taking wool and mutton as the produce of the resuscitating portion of lands. Of such a system of management shall be generally adopted in the south, the sun of prosperity would again shine brightly. I am not advancing the opinion that the south is a stock country generally, but I am satisfied it is adapted to sheep; they do not require the rich grass pastures and grain which are so necessary for other stock. The south seems to be designed by climate, and other natural permanent causes, as the great producer of the raw material for clothing. Another law of nature demands a rotation of crops to insure success in agricultural pursuits; but the south 'is not and cannot be a farming country, adopting the rotations usual in higher latitude s yet it may adopt wool growing as a rotation, and still pursue the productions indicated by natural laws. Variety in the productions of all countries is better, as a system, than any one staple; but the substitutes must be suited to the climate and soil. Hence, I say grow both cotton and wool; they will both prosper in the south, In cotton, we have inferior, fair Louisiana, and Tea island, yielding different prices, from 5 to 30 cents per lb. In wool, we 64 X. Doc. N 59 have common, mixed bloods, and superior Saxony, worth from 15 to 100 cents per lb. The superior cotton, Tea island, is confined to a few islands on the coast of Georgia; but the superior Saxony wool may be grown in any State in the Union. We are told that thorough bred rams, in Silesian, are now worth from                                       $500 to                                               $2,000 each. Of any combination of circumstances in Germany could produce such a result, it certainly furnishes much encouragement to growers of the same stock in the United States, where lands are cheap, and the cost but little for wintering. At one tenth of those prices ii the United States, the business of growing me rings for sale would yield very large profits. Your report is a valuable public document, and I hope to see your office sustained and encouraged by Congress, and your inquiries extensively answered. Your labors promise much good to agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, and to the property of the country at large. I thank you for the distribution of the samples of wool brought over from Europe by Mr. Fleischmann. They furnish valuable information to the owners of thorough bred flocks in the Unitedstates; for, by comparison, they can see what progress they have made in growing fine wool. You will by no means consider me as retracting from the labors of Mr. Fleischmann. I disclaim any such design. His report, as published by you, contains a great deal of valuable information on the subject of wool and sheep; but, believing some of his opinions were calculated to produce erroneous impressions among those who are not informed on the subjects, I have endeavored to furnish some facts which have caused me to differ from some of the views expressed in his report, with no other object than a desire to have the whole facts presented to those who may read it. I have lately seen a statement of a "letting for one year only, "of 65 rams in England, of the mutton stock, which averaged                                                                                                                                                                 $135,some bringing                                       $300. This was for the services for one season, when they are all returned to their owner. What peculiar value do these rams in England 'and Germany possess, which may not be given to them here? One. These facts show promising signs for the future, to those who may steadily prosecute the subject of sheep growing in the United States. The importation o of raw wool, and the importations of immense quantities of manufactured woolen goods annually into the Unitedstates, shows that an extensive home market may be found for wool, which I hope to see soon supplied from our own farms, plantations, and mountains. Prosperity to the spinners of wool and cotton at home and abroad; but especially to the former! Way with all all antipathies between the spinners and growers of these great clothing staples of our country! They y should be identified in sympathy and mutual support, and, by concert, add to the 'profits and prosperity of both. I individual man is weak and impotent but associated man is powerful. To with interests of a kindred kind acting separate and apart; and with jealousy towards each other Doc. 0 .59 635 all may l anguish ant decline; but, by association and mutual support, they may flourish and produce wonderful results. Our great interests should be leagued together, as the States of the Union, if we hope for general prosperity. They are dependent\ one upon another, and the destruction or depression of any great interest is felt, by its recoil, on others throughout the land. Sheep husbandry in the south and west is in its infancy; but a wide field is open for its development. It is a permanent, substantial branch of agriculture; because wool and mutton are among the necessaryes of life, and there must be an increasing demand with an increase of population. The price of sheep in Germany and England shows this to be so. It is a stock which multiplied with rapidity. A flock of an hundred eyes should in eight years produce at least a flock of a thousand. It may be commenced with a small capital, and with but little preparation; or it may well engage capital, talent, learning, industry, and energy. I remain yours, very respectfully, Mark R. Cockri Of. To the On. Edi (cid127ND Burkecon. of Patents, Washington City 636 X a. Of P Endi X No. 11.. Hog Crop. We are indebted to Charles List, esq, editor of. the Cincinnatidaily Advertise r, for the following statement of the how crop of the west, which he has forwarded to us in a slip prepared for his journal We have added to this appendix also the account of the farm stock of Ohio reported to the assessors for the State of Ohio, land operations, &c. The pork market. Our friends in the Atlantic cities are reluctant to credit the falling off in the pork crop, asserted to exist by the statements made here and at other pork packing points in the west. They ask how can we reconcile the assertion that a smaller number of hogs has been put, up recently than a year ago, in the face of the known fact, that up to the 24th multi mo 383,361 barrels had been received in New Orleans from the pork regions of the west, while 355,000barrels formed the entire receipts last season at that ports his is a fair question, and shall be fairly met. The facts necessary to place this subject in the proper light, arrange themselves under several heads, as follows 1, The eastern market had been rendered bare in August last to an extraordinary degree, and extensive supplies being required at this juncture for California, high prices became a necessary consequence. I shall not stop to prove this state of case, there being no dispute as to its existence 2. As a result of the continuance of this pressure on the market, pork packing in the west commenced earlier than usual, and a larger share of barrelled pork was put up, and less of the articles laid aside in bulk meat and bacon for later sales, than was ever known before, As evidence of this, the New Orleans tables of the date referred to, in the query to which I now reply, state wounds bulk meat. Barrels of pork 1847 48 .a. .a. 5,026,900 193, 146 1848 49. .a. .a. .a. 2,989,180 383,564This table on its very face reverses for the late season the proportions of these articles as they existed the previous one. But facts to which I shall presently allude place the disparity in a still stronger light, by showing on the one hand that 17,336 barrels of pork should be taken off the list and added to the first line, and that still greater deductions should be made, on account of has pickled in barrels, and shoulders, sides, and hams, in hhdsshipped in December and January last, which, reduced to barrels, X God. No. 59.637enter into the great aggregate of mess and prime pork in the Neworleans table 3. Concurrent with the un exampled scarcity and high prices at the east, and with the early packing thus engendered, the western streams, usually low or frozen up in December, January, or February, were not only un obstructed by ice, but unprecedented ly full throughout that whole period. The I illinois and Wabash had overflowed their banks, and the Ohio maintained during the pork season a stage of water fully as high as was desirable. The season of the year being that at which steamboats are usually idle, freights were also at uncommonly low rates 4. As a result of these things, the banks put draft time on the Atlantic cities at sixty days, in place of three and four months, as heretofore, furnishing thus added motives to forward pork products earlier to market, as a means of meeting their short date engagements. I independently of the motives already alluded to for putting up and for warding barrelled pork, land was at prices at the east too low to justify shipment, and the banks refused to take drafts on New Orleans, where the bulk meat might have found a market 5. The business year of New Orleans begins and ends September 1st. The increasing scarcity in August, 1848, drained the entire stock of barrelled pork from Cincinnati and other pork packing points west, where it had been held for a rise. All this reached New Orleans, of course, later than the 1st of September, and accordingly forms a share of the pork published in this table as the packing of the recent season. This taken from one period and added to the other would reduce the difference 34,672 barrels. I say nothing of the deduction of hams in barrels, and hams and shoulders in sides or hogs heads put up in pick le, which are reduced to barrels as mess and prime pork, simply because I have no means of ascertaining the quantity. It is undoubtedly large 6. The extremely high water for weeks past on the Mississippi river has, to a great extent, prevented de liveries of bulk meat and pork on the plantations, and compelled its deposit e at New Orleans until that stream subsides. All this is included in their tables, and tends to deceive dealers abroad as to the stock in market. The supplies for the coast, as it is called, it is well known form an important share in our shipments. All these facts are susceptible of proof, and they prove incontrovertibly that the large amount of barrelled pork received at New Orleans at the latest dates, affords no just reason for supposing that the pork crop of the recent packing is, as our eastern brethren infer, an increase upon the previous one. I am abundantly satisfied that it is a fall off in both quantity and weight of hogs, in both respects a deficiency of from 20 to 25 per cent. I have no pecuniary interest in the subject, as is well known, but am under the strongest possible motives, as a dealer in statistics, to spare no pains to ascertain the truth, and to state it correctly. I :confidently predict a heavy rise from present prices before the season is through, and am willing to risk my reputation for judgment on that result 38 X. a. Work packing in the X. a. 64 3 gets rid of this difficulty by a very simple but ingenious process, the invention of their principal, Or. E. Wilson. Your iron tanks are constructed of boiler iron to receive the pork, which embraces the entire animal, the hams excepted, which are too valuable to be rendered into land. These tanks are circular in form, 6 feet in diameter and 12 feet in height, and weigh each from 5,000 to 5,500 pounds, being made of the thickest kind of rolled boiler iron. The hogs are cut up as nearly as possible into four pound pieces, which are thrown into the tanks, when they are subjected to a pressure of steam of seventy pounds to the square inch, or a temperature of 308 Fahrenheit, which, in the course of ten hours, reduces the bones to a substance like s lacked lime, and, consuming the gelatin e, which becomes specifically heavier in these operations, precipitates it into the lees. The rendered land runs off 'from the tanks into cookers in the ordinary way; whence it is drawn into barrels, or kegs, as the case may require. These four tanks will daily render from fifty thousand to sixty thousand pounds of the gross material, according to the precise article. They require the attendance and labor of twelve men. The land produced in this mode is of a quality as ,pure in taste and keeping as that which is rendered in kettles. E. Wilson & To. have made this season land of the various qualities to the amount of 1,500,000 pounds, which would be equal to thirty-five thousand kegs of the ordinary size, and worth, at the usual prices, over one hundred thousand dollars. Of this quantity three-fourths is strictly prime land; the other one-fourth being made of inferior stock. It must be borne constantly in mind that the finer quality of this land, as compared with a steam rendered article, in the ordinary mode, results from the intense heat which consumes or decomposes every element in the car case but the land, affording, in that operation, a thorough separation of the land from every thing else. But the efficiency of this process is still less extraordinary than its cheapness. The whole expense of rendering in this mode does not exceed 331 per cent. of the ordinary process. There the inferior raw materials are employed the disparity is vastly greater, This mode of rendering land is equally applicable to the rough fat of sheep or cattle, to which purpose these tanks are applied in other establishments. There are twenty tanks in employment here, and nearly as many more in operation throughout Kentucky, I n diana, I illinois, and Missouri. Two or three years will suffice to introduce them through the entire how producing regions of the west. The whiskey and alcohol of Cincinnatiby C. List, Esq. Cincinnati is not only the greatest market in the world for hogs *but for whiskey also. And for the same cause that of being the great business centre of the largest district in which corn is raised, with facilities to convert it into some convenient shape for export, it her by feeding it into hogs or cattle, grinding it into meal, or x. dis tilling it into whiskey. The State of Tennessee, with its adjacent country, doubtless raises more grain as an export in the form in which it grows, but manufactures a very small share of the crop, by converting it, as in the Ohio valley country, into other products. When I refer to Cincinnati as the great whiskey mary of the west, or of the world, I speak of points in which the article finds its first sale, although it may prove also the fact that whiskey will be found at all times in larger quantities here than in any other market. It is certain that the rise or fall of whiskey here affects every market in existence. Cincinnati receives for sale the whiskey made throughout the greater part of the States of Ohio, Kentucky, and I n diana, with a share of that of western Pennsylvania, and the river Ohio, the Miamiand White water canals, and the Little Diam i railroad, affording cheap and convenient transportation to this market. It is also wagoned to the city from neighboring distilleries; as well as manufactured in Cincinnati and its suburbs, probably to the extent of one seventh of the whole. One thousand barrels, of forty gallons each, as an average, are the daily supply of Cincinnati. One house alone receives one third that quantity as its proportion of the business. The share of whiskey consumed annually in Cincinnati, for every purpose, would not exceed its market supply for one week, and even of this limited quantity, the largest proportion is employed in medical preparations and the arts. That portion of the community which elsewhere drinks whiskey, drinks beer and ale in Cincinnati. The whiskey brought here is rectified, and exported in steam and flat boats to New, Orleans. The coast, as it is called, of the lower Mississippi, is a heavy purchaser of the article. From this general aggregate must be deduced about one-eighth of the whole quantity, which is converted into alcohol or pure spirits, and applied to various purposes in medicine, manufactures and the arts, its principal market being our Atlantic cities. In this process the whiskey is reduced in quantity thirty-nine per cent-one hundred barrels of whiskey making only sixty-one barrels of pure spirit or alcohol. The quantity and value of the whiskey and alcohol disposed of here or shipped off may be stated thus 27 6000 barrels of whiskey, averaging 40 gallons to the barrel, at                      $8............................. .                                               $2,208, 00036,000 barrels reduced to alcohol is 21,960 barrels, at 1 15...... .a. .a. .a. .a. 329,000                                               $2,537,400.. In estimating the average value of whiskey as above, at eight dollars per barrel, it must be recollected that as it has usually brought here ten per cent. above proof, the same per cent. must be added to the current price of the article. At the usual product, the quantity of corn requisite to supply x. a, 645 this extent of whiskey would amount to 4,056,000 bushels, which would not be three per cent. of the entire crop of the region which supplies the whiskey. The genius of the age displayed in labor saving machinery is illustrated in the laboratories in which the alcohol is made here. One of these, that of Lowell Fletcher, occupied but twenty feet square of space. Met such is its simplicity, efficiency, and adaptation to its purposes, that within that bounds a capacity exists to manufacture, with two stills of eight hundred gallons, half a million of alcohol annually. To that this establishment alone can consume more than eight hundred thou and gallons of whiskey in ft s business operations. 6 *x. a. Appendi X No. 12. Tables Of Vari Ous Of Nds.

It would have been gratifying to have presented, a complete view; but it was not possible in these cases of failure. The other tables, relating to estimates of the proportion of cultivated land to uncultivated, of corn stalk and straw fodder to the grain, the rotation of crops, and the cost of raising different crops, with amount of consumption, and the prices of various agricultural products and wages of labor, can of course be viewed only as the results of the conclusion of a few in each section of the country. Met many of those who have furnished this information are among the prominent successful agriculturists, in their respective districts; or practical farmers, who show that, though the subject is new to them, they duly appreciate its importance, and have gladly lent their aid to promote the object. The replies, generally, relate to a county or district, though in a few instances, perhaps, they have been confined to a single town. The number of the returns was not sufficient to allow a condensation in a tabular statement, in respect to some of these subjects; and they have, therefore, simply been drawn out and entered in the order of the. States as used in the tabular estimate of crops. Though defective in many respects, yet at the same time they are of some value, and may lead to better ones hereafter. Table Of Averages. Wheat.

APPENDI X No. 13. I Of Tradeby N. J. Wyeth, Cambri Dge, Mass. The ice trade of the United States was commenced by Frederictudor, of. Boston, in 1805. This gentleman, having previously sent agents to the West I n dies to procure information, determined to make his first experiment in that region. The first cargo was taken from a pond in Aug us, and was laden on board the, brig Favorite, for It. Pierre, Martinique. This first enterprise resulted in a loss of about                         $4,500; but was, nevertheless, followed up until the embargo and war put an end to the foreign trade, at which period it had yielded no profit to its project or. I to operations had been confined to Martinique and Jamaica. At the close of the war, in 1815, Mr. Tudor recommenced his operations by shipments to Havana, under a contract with the government of Cuba, which enabled him to pursue his undertaking without loss, and extend it, in 1817, to Charleston, South Carolina; in the following year, to Savannah, Georgia; and, in 1820, to New Orleans. In the meantime, it had been tried again (by o her parties) at Martinique and It. Thomas, and failed, and by Mr. Tudor at It. Ago de Cuba, where it also failed after a trial of three years. In the 18th May, 1833, the first shipment of ice was made to the last I n dies, by Mr. Tudor, in the ship Tuscans for Calcutta; and, since that period, he has extended his operations to Had ras and Bombay. Previous to 1832, the trade had been chiefly confined to the operations of the original project or. The increase of shipments to this period were small, the whole amounting in 1832 to 4 352 tons, which was taken entirely from Fresh pond, in Cambridge. Up to this time the ice business was of a very complicated nature. Ship owners objected to receive it in freight, fearing its effect on the durability of their vessels, and the safety of voyages; ice houses abroad and at home were required, and the proper mode of constructing them was to be ascertained. The best modes of preparing ships were the subject of expensive and and almost endless experiments. The machines to cut and prepare ice for shipping and storing, and to perform the operations of ho i sting it into store houses and lowering it into the holds of vessels, were all to be invented, involving much expense and vexation. Any of these difficulties have now been overcome, and, since 1832, the trade has increased much, and appears destined to a still more rapid increase. It has also been divided among many parties, and its methods have been improved, and a knowledge of them more widely diffused. The ice has been chiefly taken from Fresh and Spy ponds, and, since 1841, mainly transported ontheEx. a. 697 Charleston branch railroad. Recently, ice establishments have been made at most of the ponds near Boston, and it is probable that in a few years the ,product of all these waters may be required to supply the trade. In the year 1839, the great quantity of ice cut at Fresh pond, and the consequent difficulties ,which had arisen between the proprietors of its borders as to where each should take ice, induced them to place boundary lines, which were settled by Simon Green leaf, Levi War well, and J. M. Felt on, on the principle of giving to each the same proportion of contiguous surface of the lake as the length of his shore line was to its whole border. This settlement was made by partition deed, executed by all the parties, and recorded in the registry of deeds of Middlesex county. Published maps were also placed in public institutions and private hands. These maps show the length and direction of the boundary lines and the area of each owner. This arrangement has been of great advantage, enabling the parties to secure more ice than could otherwise be taken from a pond of equal extent. The shipments of ice from Boston coast wise for X. To . No. 59.699During the year 1818, a very small supply of ice was stored near Boston, and the cost and price were much increased, which will account for the, reduced amount of the trade, as compared with the previous .year. It is probable that the commercial marine of the United States has been materially increased by the opera ions of the ice trade. A large portion of the vessels formerly engaged in the freighting trade ffomBoston sailed in bal last, depending for regeneration on the freight of cotton, rice, tobacco and sugar, to be obtained in more southern latitudes, often competing with the vessels of other nations, which could earn a freight out and home; bit since this trade has been established, a small outward freight from Boston can be obtained for the transportation of ice to those places where freighting vessels ordinarily obtain cargoes. The ice trade has generally been unsuccessful to places where profitable return freights cannot be obtained, because to such places a heavy freight f dust be paid on the ice, which it cannot bear; and, also, because southern places which do not produce valuable exports are usually unable to consume expensive luxuries. The methods and materials for preparing vessels for the transportation of ice have been various. Formerly, the holds were veiled up at the sides, bottom and top, with boards nailed to joint ribs secured to the skin of the vessel, and with double bulk heads fore and aft. The spaces thus formed were filled with refuse t an, rice hulls, meadow hay, straw, wood shavings, or like materials. These spaces were made of a thickness proportionate to the length of the voyage and with reference to the length of the season. The immediate surface of the ice was covered with the same materials, excepting t an. At the present time, sawdust is used almost exclusively for voyages of considerable length. It is placed immediately between the ice and the skin of the vessel, This material is obtained from the State of Paine, and before its use for this purpose, was entirely wasted at the water mills, and falling into the streams, occasioned serious obstructions. During the year 1848, 3,900 cords were brought to Boston, at an average value of                                               $2.50 per cord, delivered. The lumber. is also wholly from the State of Paine; the value of it is, however, small in the present mode of fitting vessels. About the whole value of the returns of the ice trade, including freight, are a gain to this country. The ice itself, the labor expended on it, the materials for its preservation, and the means of its transportation, would be worthless if the trade did not exist. The prices at which ice sells, in places where there is competition, vary constantly. In Havana, where there is a monopoly, it is sold at 61 cents per pound, and there the trade has not increased since 1832, when the shipments were 1,112 tons; while at New Orleans, where it has been sold from half a cent to 3 cents per pound, it has increased during the same period from 2,310 tons to upwards of 28 000. At Calcutta, the trade commenced in 1833 with a shipment for that year of 201 tons, and the price has never been above 6 cents per pound, and is now about 2" cents. The export to that place had increased in 1847 to 3,000 tons, but probably less than700Ex. one fifth of that quantity is actually sold, owing to the great length of the voyage. The consumption of ice in Boston and its vicinity during the year ending 3 1st December, 1847, was 27,000 tons, about two thirds of which was transported to Charles town in the Charles town Branch railroad, and thence distributed on wagons through that place and Boston. The remainder was sent direct from the ice houses on wagons to the place of ultimate delivery; 22 two horse and 44 one horse wagons were employed in the delivery of this ice, for a time 65,000 tons 9000 "1 1000 .2 4000 "1 2000 c 10000 "3, 00012,000 "5000 "8 000 c 3, 0001.,000 "1500 6 The ice stored is chiefly for use in and near the city, the shipments being very small; it is supposed that 40 per cent of the ice cut for the use of families is ordinarily delivered at the doors of the dwellings, or 65,800 tons. The average price obtained may be stated at                                               $2.50 per ton of 2,000 lbs, which will give 164,500 as the value of the ice consumed in and near the city. From the Kennebec river there was shipped, in 1848, 4,000 tons, chiefly to Philadelphia and Baltimore, at a price of                         $4 per ton, delivered in those places. The trade in ice from this river is i very uncertain, and depends almost entirely upon a scarcity of the article at Boston, which occurred in 1848, from whence ice can 5,000 000 2 X. a. Reducing the amounts stated above, and calculating the average delivery at 50 per cent, there would be left from 8,000 tons stored, 1,000 tons for the family consumption of this vicinity, which, at                          $3 per ton, delivered at the dwellings, would give. 3,060 00 taking the whole value of the trade in this vicinity.                                                                                                                                                                 $18,500.00The ice houses now in use in this vicinity are built above ground. In southern countries where ice is most valuable, they are constructed at greater expense, usually of brick or tone, and the protection to the ice consists in air spaces, or in dry light vegetable substances enclosed between two walls. In the borders of the lakes where ice is least valuable, hey are usually built of wood, in which case they are of two walls formed by placing two ranges of joint upright, framed into plates at the top, and placed in the ground at the bottom, or framed into sills; these two ranges a received with boards secured to that side of each range which is nearest the other, and the space between the two boardings filled with refuse t an wet from the yards. This wet t an is frozen during the winter, and until it is thawed in the spring and summer little waste occurs. Afterward the waste is more rapid, but as a large portion of the ice is shipped or used before this takes place, the loss in quantity is small, and occurring before the expenses of transportation have been paid, is of less pecuniary moment. I none instance brick has been used in the construction of an ice house which covers 36,000 feet of land; the vaults of this house are 40 feet in depth, and its walls are four feet thick from outside to inside, enclosing two sets of air spaces. Such a construction is more costly, but has the advantage of durability and safety from fire to which ice houses are much exposed from the frequent juxtaposition of railroad engines to the light dry materials used to cover and otherwise preserve ice. In the winter of 1848, about                 $750 were paid daily for labor of men, and about                                       $300 for that of animals, in the vicinity of Boston, when the weather was most favorable for cutting ice. Such activity, however, is of short duration, as there are not generally more than twenty days in a season which are really favorable to the operations of %securing ice. The price paid is usually                                                                                                                                                             $1 per day for horses and men. At first the implements of husbandry only were used in securing ice, but as the trade became more important other machines and different methods were adopted, and abandoned when better were brought forward, or when the increased magnitude of the business required greater facilities. The endless chain, moved by a steam engine, has been used for elevating ice near Boston and New York with success, and in one instance, by this method, over 500 tons have been elevated 35 feet in one hour; butt his method involves much expense, and is suitable only for extensive operations; and at present horse power is more used than any other. More ice is now secured in one favorable day than would have supplied the whole trade in 1832. Ordinarily before x. 
703there has been cold enough to form ice of suitable thickness, snow falls on its surface. Of this occurs when ice is four or more inches in thickness, and the snow is not heavy enough to sink the ice, it can be removed by using horses attached to the " snow caper and under such circumstances this is the method in common use. But if snow falls so heavy as to bring the water above the surface of the ice, it is removed after it is congealed into snow ice with the " ice plane~ which takes off about two inches deep and twenty-two wide of its surface. This machine is drawn by two horses, and is guided by inserting its guides into two groves previously made with the " ice c utter." The chips made by it are scraped off in the same manner as dry snow. These preliminary expenses are often very great; frequently after much expense has been incurred to remove a body of snow or snow ice, the weather becomes warm and spoils the ice on which so much has been expended. And, on the other hand, if it is not done, and the cold continues, there will be little or no increase of thickness to the ice, which is equally a disaster. When ice has been formed of sufficient thickness, and freed from snow ice, it is reduced to blocks of uniform size, ordinarily 22 inches square, by the "ice c utter." This machine is similar to a carpenters plough, except that it has a series of cutting chisels, one succeeding another, and deepening the groove. It is drawn by a horse, and cuts at one passage about two inches deep, and if the ice requires to be planed to remove snow ice, the guides of the snow plane are used in grooves of this depth; but, when grooves are required to split it, the "ice c utter" should be drawn two or three times through each. These grooves should be parallel to each other; and, to make them so, the "ice c utter" has a guide, which is placed in the last groove made. When the grooves in one direction have been made, others at right angles with them are produced in the same manner. After this has been done, one groove at the end is opened, and also the two outside grooves; a wedding bar is then stricken intothe groove next the end one, and at several places along its length, which detached it easily from the mass; the same bar is forced with a slight blow into the transverse grooves, which reduces the ice to very uniform square blocks. The blocks thus formed are brought to the receiving doors of the ice houses (which are built on the immediate borders of the ponds) either by placing them on <a name="seeds34"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, or floating in canals cut through the ice. The ice is placed in the houses in regular courses, every block covering the next below itoWhen a vault has been filled, it is immediately covered with wood shavings, and the receiving doors fitted up to prevent waste, until the contents are required for shipment abroad, or use at home. The weight of ice for shipment is usually determined at the wharves, immediately before being put on shipboard, on scales which have been constructed for that purpose; and this single operation settles the weight to be paid for by the party for whose account the ice is shipped, the amount due for freight on shipboard, for transportation on the railroad, and that which is to be received by the owner of the ice704Ex, a. Appendi X No. 14. Revi    Of Of The Engli Of Markets For Ameri Can Flour, Grai N, And Provi    Of Ons. For the following review by Messrs. J. & C. Dirk patrick. of Liverpool, of the English trade in American flour, grain, and provisions, and for the very valuable tables which follow it, we are indebted to Charles Dirk patrick, esq, of the city of New Work. Of vERPOOL, 10th February, 1849,Having delayed our annual exposition of the trade between the United States and this country in bread stuffs and provisions, for the purpose of being able to embrace some statements of imports c, from the " Board of Trade Tables" just published, we now purpose to take a review of the trade during the past year, with the view of eliciting such facts therefrom as shall serve to guide our friends who are interested in forming a correct judgment as to the probable future course of prices. The peculiarity which marked most prominently the transactions of the past year in every department of business was the almost complete absence of speculation the course of prices throughout having been regulated accordingly as each article was in demand relatively with the supply. This has been the case especially withbreadstuffsthe trade, during the whole year, having been in a very lifeless state, thus presenting a very marked contrast with the prevailing tone of the market during the preceding year. The disasters which attended the excessive speculation of the former period sufficiently account for this change, while the yet un revealed effects of a prospective free trade in grain served to induce caution on the part of all parties in advance of the period when the new law was to come into operation; and, by leading farmers and other holders to part with their stocks more freely than usual, caused the result of the repeal of the corn laws to be in some measure anticipated. The fluctuations in the value of wheat have been less than usual the highest gazette average being 56s. 10d. on September 9, and the lowest, 46s. 10d, on January 17. These averages, too, being made up from sales of English wheat only, show a wider range of fluctuation than characterized the general market the difference between the highest and lowest points of prices, when taken fro i the average of the total sales of the year, being under is. per quarter. The imports have continued on an extensive scale, showing a larger aggregate than in any previous year, with the exception of 1847. The necessity for such an extensive import arose from the different distribution of the land in the United Kingdom, in 1847, under crops the breadth under <a name="potatoes211"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having been only x. a. 705 one third of 'the usual quantity, and recent inquiries having shown that one acre of <a name="potatoes212"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will support as many people as three acres of grain. The comparative freedom of the <a name="potato102"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop from disease in 1847 induced the farmers to plant an unusual quantity last year; and, though there was a very extensive failure of the crop in the southern and western counties, both of England and re land, the loss was compensated for by the greater breadth of land under crop, as well as by its general productive ness. As respects the other crops, it appears that, taking the whole of the grain districts of England, the crop of wheat was considerably below an average, and of grains, about an average. In I re land, wheat was also a deficient crop, but oats a very abundant one. In Scotland, the crops generally were equal to the usual average. That there was, on the whole, a very deficient supply of food yielded by last harvest is evidenced by the fact that, while a larger proportion of the product of that crop has been brought to market up to this time than usual, there has been, during the same period, the largest i port of agricultural produce into England that has ever taken place. Of grain of all kinds, the import has been over four millions of quarters, from the 1st of October till the 3 1st January, besides <a name="potatoes213"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and vegetables to a large extent, from the near European ports. The whole of this quantity has passed into consumption the stocks at the present time being hardly in excess of those held at the commencement of that period. The sliding scale of duties came to an end on the 3 1st January; and on the 1st instant, the whole of the stocks of grain in bond were released at the new fixed duty of I s. per quarter. The total quantity then released was about one million of quarters; but, as usually ,happens in the case of all similar commercial changes, the effects of the change had been more than anticipated, and prices, instead of declining under the pressure of such a supply, have since then shown a tendency to advance. In view of so many circumstances which now combine to disturb ordinary calculations, we cannot speak with much confidence as to the immediate future of prices; but looking at the enormous import of grain during the last four months, the comparatively small stocks now on hand, the increasing activity in the manufacturing districts, and the general employment of the population in profitable labor, together with the fact that no early arrivals can take place for the ensuing three months, there seems a strong probability that prices will advance, rather than recede from the present level. It is evident that we shall require a very large import of bread stuffs 'before the next harvest. What sources they will be drawn from will depend on the relative prices at the various shipping points. The latest quotations from all parts, as given in the comparative statement annexed, show that Europe at present offers the most inducement to purchasers. With reference to the more remote future of prices, it is difficult to predict with anything like certainty what are the limits within which prices may fluctuated, under the operation of a free trade in grain, the establishment of which has introduced new ele23706Ex. events for consideration in any attempt to construct a theory as to the future course of prices. As respects wheat, Mr. Looked, in his History of Prices" assumes that 30s, and 603. will be respectively the lowest and highest limits of such fluctuation, and that 45 s being the mean between these extremes, will, probably, be the central or pilot point round which prices, will ordinarily range. This, it will be seen by reference to the sub joined table, is considerably under the average of prices for the last twenty years, as taken from the official returns made to the government the mean average of those years being 57s. 5d. Still, we are of opinion that Mr. Looked has under estimated the effects of the repeal of the corn laws, and that the average price of wheat during the next ten years, with fair harvests, will not be over 42s, For I indian corn there has been a continuous demand throughout the year, without any of the violent fluctuations which characterized the trade during the previous year; and this cereal may now be considered one of the leading articles of import to our corn market. The extent to which it may be consumed will depend more on its price than in the case of any other grain; meeting, as it does a large demand for cattle food when it bears a low value, and from which high prices would completely exclude it. In ordinary seasons, its range of price will probably be between 24s. and 32s. That England will become, to some extent, an entr e pot in which the surplus products of the corn producing countries of the world will by stored up, to be distributed again, as the necessities of each country may demand, seems one of the most certain results of a free trade in grain. Her central and insular position, her commercial connexion with all countries, her financial and other facilities for carrying on such a trade, joined to the circumstance that she is always an importing country, will combine to secure this result. The disturbed state of the continent during the past year prepared the way, and partly introduced such a trade as we have indicated; large quantities of wheat and flour having been poured into England from France and other neighboring countries for the purpose, and as the only means that offered of realizing the value of such produce. This course having been taken without reference to the ultimate wants of those countries, it is probable that some of them will have to import again before the next harvest, and that such import will be drawn from England, under a continuance of present prices, Should these views be realized, and the same policy in other departments of trade in this country be fully carried out, England is likely to become, as a place of residence, one of the cheapest countries in the world; and, whatever may be the influence on the farming or other special interests, it is certain that the general interests of the country will be promoted, and the position of the laboring classes be much improved. In reviewing the trade in provisions little more is required than a reference to its rapid and satisfactory extension as indicated by the returns of imports in the annexed tables, the increase not being x. 
707confined to certain articles, but embracing all. The arrivals, too, for so far this season, promises a still larger increase in the present year, while the more thorough adaptation of all articles to the requirements of the English market is certain to secure a still wider extension of the trade. Of beef, the import in 1848 fell off considerably from that of the two preceding years, but it is likely to be the largest in the present year that has ever taken place. The best brands continue to give great satisfaction, and to bring prices highly remunerative, being generally preferred to I wish, while secondary and inferior bands are much more difficult of sale, even at a wide difference of price. The recent arrivals lead us to infer that the great bulk of the beef cured this season is of an inferior character, and the result of the shipments is likely, in consequence, to disappoint the owners. The present range of prices is from 78s. a 90s. per tierce, Of pork, the only kind which has a continuous and steady sale is "prime mess" cut in 4 lb. pieces, and being used exclusively for ship stores, must be packed exactly in conformity with the established standard brands of I wish. In consequence of the extremely irregular quality of the imports, prices ranged from 34s. a 75. during the past year. Our present quotations for prime brand s are 70s. a 72s. 6d, owing to the bare state of the market. The ordinary range of prices will be from 50s. a 60s. American "mess pork" only finds a sale as a substitute for bacon, and its shipment to England is only justified when it bears a low value relatively with bacon. We have at present none on the market. The trade in ba son has had during the past year a remarkable increase, the import into Liverpool alone being over 7,000 tons against 2,500 in 1847, before which year the trade can hardly be said to have existed. The late arrivals show a great improvement in quality, and in cut and cure over former receipts, and this article will now become one of steady and increasing import. Dams have been imported more freely; but do not offer any inducement to shippers, except when they reach a very low price in the Unitedstates, the flavor being so much injured by the modes of cure usually adopted, and by remaining so long in pick le or dry salt, that they cannot compete with the I wish cure. The duty of 7s per cut. imposed on dry camp, prevents their being shipped in that form, unless the quality is so superior as to warrant the payment of this duty. There is no article that would better reward cures for best owing extra cake in its preparation for the Englishmarketthe trade in land has also exhibited a remarkable increase, the import during the past year into this port having been 9,600tonsagainst 4,600 tons in 1847. Of this quantity, the principal parts old for c urinary purposes, the price having remained too high relatively with tallow to induce any considerable demand from soap and candle manufacturers. Prices were well sustained during the greater part of the year, and ranged from 38s. a 45s; but have continued to decline since November, owing in part to heavy in 708 X. port, but principally to the low rates to which butter and tallow have declined the one excluding it from manufacturing, and the other from c urinary uses. I to present value is 34s. a 36s. for barrels, and 35s. a 37s. 4 for kegs. Of cheese, nothing need be said, the steady increase of the trade affording the best evidence that it is conducted with advantage both to the producer and consumer. It will be seen that the import of the past year has far exceeded that of any former one. The present range of prices is from 36s. a 48s. It will be seen that, with the exception of the nominal duty of 1s. per quarter retained on grain, and a duty of 10s. per cut. on cheese, all the articles referred to have a free admission into England; and this review of the trade, in connexion with the annexed tables, will show its progressive average up to this time. We are your obedient servants, J. & C. Of Rkpatri Of. On. Edmund Burke, New York, March 8, 1849. Of R: Enclosed I hand you, as promised, a circular giving some information as to the trade in corn and provisions between this country and Great Britain during the past year, accompanied by tables showing the growth of the trade, the yearly imports of grain into Great Britain, and the sources whence these supplies have been drawn, &c; and, in order to show the movements of the trade in the present as compared with the corresponding periods of the two past seasons, I annex a statement giving the exports from the principal shipping points in this country to Great Britain and re land, from the 1st September till the 28th February in each season. I am, sir, yours respectfully, Chas. Of Rkpatri Of. On. Edmund Burkejfor the tables above mentioned, see pages 71 5 to 718. Six. a. 709This article should have preceded the letter of Messrs. Dirk patrick, at page 704. The mistake was discovered too late to rectify it otherwise Supply of grain raised in the United States for exportation to foreign countries; foreign demand; English demand for bread stuffs; Russia the great rival of the United States in the production of grain; quantity exported from Russia in 1847; quantity exported from Odessa during eleven years, ending with 1848; review of the English market for American flour, grain and provisions; valuable tables; estimate of the value of the production of labor and capital in the United States in 1848, C, 'y c. In an appendix to the agricultural report for 1847, (to. 19,) we submitted an estimate of the production of the cereal grains of the United States in 1847; the consumption, and supplies for exportation; the den and of foreign countries for corn and bread stuffs, and the surpluses of grain raised by certain foreign countries for exportation. We do not deem it necessary to go into similar estimates for the present year, as the general results cannot vary much from those contained in the paper alluded to, which was annexed to our last report. The general conclusion, in relation to the production and consumption of the Union, was that we could supply all the wants of our own population, and have remaining for exportation to foreign countries a surplus exceeding 200,000,000 bushels of grain of all kinds the far greater proportion of which was maize or I indian corn. In our circular, issued during the last year, particular inquiries were made with respect to the consumption per head of the population, to which answers were obtained from almost every section of the Union. The general result, which a comparison of these returns (see appendix, Los. 3 and 4, to the present report) enables us to arrive at, does not vary very much from the estimates in our report of 1847.--(See appendix No. 19.) He, therefore, do not deem it necessary in this report to go into similar estimates and calculations for the present year. We believe, if the foreign' demand should require it, this country could export from 150,000,000 to200000000 bushels of wheat and I indian corn. Of wheat, we could export from 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 bushels, if the foreign demand would require so great a quantity. In the paper alluded to, (appendix No. 19, report for 1847,) we presented tables showing the probable annual demand of the grain importing countries, to which our farmers must look for a market and the probable annual surpluses of the grain exporting countries, which, of course would be our rivals in the corn trade. Our conclusion was that the demand of the grain importing countries would 10 X. be not far from 33,000,000 bushels annually; and the surpluses of the grain exporting countries would probably amount in the aggregate to 20,000,000 bushels. We should except Russia. Of the grain importing countries, Great Britain demands the largest supplies from foreign countries, equaling about 200000,000bushels annually. The following returns show the amount of corn of all kinds imported into Great Britain during eleven months ending December 5, 1848TABLE. Heat .a. quarters. Oats. .a. .do. . adorn; .a. .a. , .do.

Our estimate of the demand of Great Britain was, therefore, not too great. Great Britain has not for years produced a sufficient quantity of wheat to supply the consumption of the population. In appendix to. 19, of our report for 1847, we showed from the most authentic sources that the average quantity of wheat imported was17762557 bushels; and the average quantity entered for consumption was 17,216,321 bushels. It is safe, therefore, to calculate upon an annual demand in future by Great Britain of 20,000,000 bushels. In our survey of the countries which produce more grain than is consumed by their population, and therefore have surpluses for exportation, we pointed to Russia as the great rival of the Unitedstates in supplying the grain markets of the world. Subsequent information which we have been able to obtain assures us that our conviction of this fact, expressed a year ago, is well founded. I t being always the best policy to look our rivals, as well as enemies, fall in the face, we hold it to be our duty to lay before the country all the information which we can obtain respecting this subject, that our farmers may see what competition they chetwerts; , it to, 1847, about 700,000 chetwerts; ditto1848, about 615,900 chetwerts; and it is reported that Odessa will henceforth be able to supply 2' millions chetwerts, or about 1,800,-000 quarters equal to about 14,400,000 bushels. A chest wert is equal to about six bushels, From the preceding table it will be seen, that, of the large quantity of wheat exported from Odessa, but comparatively a small portion is exported to England. It must, therefore, go to other countries probably to countries on the Mediterranean. Besides, it should be borne in mind that the quality of wheat exported from Odessa is not so good as that which is raised in the other parts of Europe and in the United States. We observe in the current prices of wheat quoted in the Dark Lane Express, of February 19, 1849, Odessa wheat is, quoted at 42s. to 46s. per quarter. Other Black Tea wheat at 38s. to 44s; while American wheat is quoted at 46s. to 52s. per quarter. Another advantage* Probably 397,904 chetwerts. X. 
713which the American wheat grower has over the wheat grower of Odessa, is the heavy freight from the latter place, and the risks of the voyage; which it requires forty days to make. Therefore, notwithstanding the formidable surplus of grain of all kinds which Russia produces for exportation, we believe it to be in the power of the American wheat grower to command, to a great extent, the English market. We have noticed recently a paragraph in many of the public journals of this country, to the effect that Dantzic is the great grain mary with which the farmers of this country must compete; that the average price of wheat in Dantzic, based on the experience of twenty years, is one dollar per bushel, and the freight to England 6d, or about 12 cents. We believe there is some mistake in these statements. In a table published in Macgregors Commercial Statistics, vol. 2, p. 738, we find the surplus for exportation from the port of Dantzic, put down at 315,000 quarters, or 2,520,000 bushels. The price in Dantzic is stated at 40s. per quarter, or nearly                                                                                                                                                             $1.25 per bushel; freight to England is. 9d. per quarter thus making the aggregate cost in England 43s. 9d. per quarter, or                                                                                                                                                             $1.32- cents. The American wheat farmer can put his wheat down upon the wharves of Liverpool at as low a price as the grain can be imported from Dantzic. Hamburg is a more dangerous rival than Dantzic. It is one of the great depots of corn in northern Europe. It can export, according to Macgregor, 538,000 quarters, or 4,304,000 bushels, which costs in England, freight included,                                                                                                                                                             $1.341. The quality of the grain is as good as that exported from Dantzic, if not better. In relation to Dantzic, Mcculloch, in his Gazetteer, has the following paragraph4Duringthe period from 1770 to 1819, the average price of wheat at Dantzic was 52s. 4d. per quarter. The demand was very limited from 1820 to 1829, and the price proportion ally low. The same cause reduced the price from 1832 to 1837; but whenever there is any considerable demand for Dantzic wheat, as, for instance, 150,000 quarters and upwards, the price inrtabaly amnicid127cid127Mtto from 40s. to 50s. or 55s. a quarter. We incline to think that from 40s. to 45s. a quarter would be about the average price of wheat in Dantzic in ordinary years, were the British ports always open, under a fixed duty of is. or is. a quarter. It is, at all events, abundantly certain that its price could not be under 40 s per quarter. But, taking it only at 38s, if we add to this I Is. or 12s. as the cost of conveying a quarter of wheat from Dantzic to London and putting it into granary there, including insurance and profit, and is. or is. duty, it is immediately seen that it is the greatest imagine able error to suppose that our agriculturists should be sensibly injured by the importation of Dantzic wheat. Under the circumstances supposed, it could not in ordinary years be offered for sale in this country for less than from 55s. 58s. per quarter, a price mere than sufficient to insure the continual progress of British agriculture, --M cCullochVs Universal Gazetteer, vol. 1, article, Dantzic714 X. Dec. No. 59. That Mcculloch is correct with regard to Dantzic wheat, the prices in London show conclusively. The prices of Dantzic wheat quoted in the Dark Lane Express, of February 19, 1849, are from 4 8s. to 52s. per quarter. The duty having been taken off, the prices are of course a little lower than they would have been if the wheat had been subjected to duty. These facts utterly dis prove the statement that the price of wheat in Dantzic, " based upon 20 years' experience' is                                                                                                                                                             $1 per bushel, and the transportation to London 12 cents, making the cost in London only                                                                                                                                                             $1.12. We give the following tables, showing the production of certain crops in Great Britain and France at different periods, believing them to contain matter interesting to the farmers of this country, and not inappropriate in this place. Table. Exhibiting the quantity of land cultivated and the quantity of grain produced in the United Kingdom in 1835. General Observati  Ons Of The Foregoi Of Table. In the report of 1847, a table like the present was embraced, exhibiting an estimate of the value of the products of labor and capital in the United States for that year, upon the following basis, viz the amount of the articles embraced in the table, as given by the census of 1840, was assumed as the basis of the estimate, and 22 per cent. was added to that sum, which is the ratio of the increase of population since the taking of that census; it being reasonable to suppose that the value of the industry and capital of the Union increases in the same ratio as the population. The same basis is assumed for the estimates of the products of the labor and capital of the United States for 1848. Political economists assume that the labor and capital of a State, without regard to age, sex, or condition, (an assumption which may not be precisely true) indicate, more truly than any other bases of calculation, its productive power. See the Madison Papers, pp. 28 to 30.(a) The prices of when, and the other grains, and also of hemp and flax, tobacco, cotton, rice, sugar, hops, bees wax, honey, and molasses, included in this table, are generally the medium prices of those articles, as quoted in the prices current of the New Work market, published in the New York " Shipping and Commerciallist" of February 17, 1849. B) In the table for 1847, the quantity of beans produced in the United States was estimated at 25,000,000 bushels, and peas also at 25,000,000 bushels. Subsequent information has satisfied us that those estimates are too high. The present estimates of these articles are deemed a nearer approximation to the truth, and not very far from the quantities actually produced c) The estimates of the quantities and values of hemp, flax, hops, bees wax, molasses, wine, products cf orchards, and our series, are based upon the census of 1840 e altolwingV : per cent. for increase, except when later information justified a departure from this ruled) The census of 1840, contains no returns of honey.

This of course included all kinds, a swell that manufactured from currents as that made from grapes. Since then the production of wine from grapes has considerably increased. Extensive vineyards are now in existence in the neighborhood of Cincinnati, which had not been planted in 1810. The wine culture has extended in other States, and we think we under estimate the quantity produced when we fix it at 500,000 gallows of all kinds72TEx. g) In our table for 1847, we estimated the value of pasturage, including ordinary, and that of fields from which crops had been taken, at                                                $27,500,00, We are convinced that that sum is greatly lower than its real value. We now estimate it at                         $60,768,136. The following are the data from which we derive our estimates Number of animals. Value of pasturage Total value of per head. pasturage, Sheep. .a. .a. 25000,000 $ 50                                                                                                                                                                                   $12,500,000Neat cattle. . .a. 18,714,482 2 00 37,428,964Horses, mules, &c .a. 5,419,586 2 00 10,839,172                        $60,768,136(A) In our table for 1847, we estimated the value of the residue m of crops at              $74,000O000, Our estimate was made from a comparison of the estimates for other countries, particularly for France, in which 111 per cent. upon the value of the products of the land and forest is allowed for the refuse of crops, and from the limited information derived from practical farmers in this country. I to accuracy has been called in question, and the sum at which we placed it considered not only too high, but greatly erroneous. Fortunately, however, in our last circular, issued for the collection of agricultural statistics, this very matter was made the subject of particular inquiry, and the result was, a large variety of returns and estimates from practical farmers in almost every State and locality in the Union. These returns have been condensed into a table, which appears in another part of this report, and to which the reader is respectfully referred for a great variety of valuable and interesting facts, Those returns more than sustain our estimate for 1847, and justify us in adding to the amount. Although many of the returns go much higher, we have taken those upon which we believe full reliance may be placed. Any of the returns allow one ton of straw to every 20 bushels of English grain produced, and, one ton of fodder for every 20 bushels of indian corn. Some place the ratio of straw and fodder to the grain above, and others below those just stated. We have allowed one ton of straw to every 20 bushels of English grain, and on eton of fodder to every 25 bushels of corn. The former we have valued at                                               $2.50 per ton, and the latter at                                               $2-prices which we think below the average of the returns. According to our estimate, in the table preceding the agricultural report, the whole quantity of wheat, barley, rye, oats, &c, produced is 363,576,150bushels. Allowing one ton of straw for every 20 bushels, we have18178802 tons of straw; which, at                                               $2.50 per ton, amounts to                            $45,-346,005. The quantity of corn produced is estimated at 583,150,000bushels. Allowing one ton of fodder for every 25 bushels, we have 23,326,000; which, ate 2 per ton, amounts to                            $46,652,000-inthe whole, to       $91,998,OC05 Of we add the refuse of the cotton, sugar, rice, and other crops not so important, it will more than exceed                                                                                                                                                              $1w0cO0000~ 00 the s m we have 'assumed in our table.

723England, the value of straw used annually for thatch, &c, is estimated at 8,000,000 pounds sterling, or about                                    $40,000,000. (SeeMJcQueens Statistics, p. 79.)(i) The item of manure was omitted in our table of 1847. It is, however, an article of great value, and worthy of a place among the estimates of the products of a country. According to Marshalls Rural Economy, each head of cattle requires 10,950 pounds 100 cut. of 110 pounds of dry c lover annually as food, and each ox, or cattle, while fattening, "will yield annually 16 full double loads of dung? According to Mcqueen four sheep are equal to one cow, as to food; and six sheep may be taken as equal to one ox. After c iting various data, Mcqueen concludes the average of all was "above 13 cart loads, or square yards [cubic yards] for each cow, from the 1st of November to the 1st of May, during that period of the year when cattle are considered to be almost wholly in the house." He also says "that there is little difference in the quantity of dung produced by the cow and the horse: " Taking the number of cattle, horses, &c, in the United States as stated in the table, and making a proper allowance for the sheep, we have equal to 32,384,068 cows as the basis of our estimate. Assuming that they produce as much manure as Mcqueen estimates, the quantity produced would be 420,992,884 cubic yards, or about90000000 cords, as it is measured in many of the northern States. In the New England States, it is valued at from                                                                                                                                                             $1.50 to                                                                                                                                                             $1.75 per cord, and in the neighborhood of large cities much higher. I not her parts of the Union it is esteemed of no value. We have, allowed                         $60,000,000 as the total value, being 662 cents per cord. Mcqueen, estimates the quantity of manure produced by the cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, poultry, &c, produced in Great Britain, in 1835, at 329,300,000 loads, valued at 59,860,000, or about                                                $295,-000,000, "exclusive of the quantity dropped by cattle, &c, on land during the summer, autumn, &c, perhaps one third or more He adds in a note: "in intelligent agricultural proprietor in Scotland informed me that he had ascertained that this latter quantity namely, the manure dropped] to be 2| tons for each cow. The value of animal manure alone, applied to the land yearly thus, greatly exceeds the whole foreign trade of the country. 1 (SeeMcQueens Statistics, pp. 50 and 51.(j) In the United States, particularly in the country, every family has a garden. It is believed that three gardens to every four families will not be an unreasonable allowance for the number, and fifteen dollars per garden for the value of the products. Mcqueenestimates the value of the vegetables and fruits in Great Britainaand I re land, in 1835, at 16,000,000, or nearly eighty millions of dollars. The value of the products of the orchards and gardens in this country must be equal to five-eighths as much k) In our table for 187, we estimated the number of sheep of all kinds in the United States at 25,000,000. We think accurate returns would show a still greater number. In the celebrated report of the Harrisburg Convention, in 1827, the number of sheep in the United States was estimated at 30,000,000. This number, at724Ex. that time, was in all probability too large. The census returns give 19,311,374 in 1840; this number we think was to low for that time. And 25,000,000 at this time is probably less than the real number now in the country; and as there has been little or no increase during the last year, in consequence of the depressed state of the wool growing interest, we have concluded to take our estimate for 1847 as the nearest approximation to the true number for 1848, and therefore estimate the number of sheep now in the Unitedstates at 25,000,000(1) The number of neat cattle in the United States in 1840, according to the census returns, was. .a. . 14,971,586I increase since then estimated at 25 per cent .a. 3,742, 89618,714,482(m) In our table for 1847, for reasons then given, we estimated the number of swine in the United States at 35,000,000. The returns of the "how crop" of the western States show a little falling off for the present year. He, however, believe that there has been no diminution of the number of swine raised, and therefore adhere to our estimate for 1847.(n) Butchers meat is an item which was not included in our estimate for 1847 As the amount consumed during the year must be produced in addition to the yearly increase of the flocks and herds of sheep, cattle and swine, it forms a very proper and a very important item in an estimate of the production of a nation. I your circular, issued during the last year, particular inquiry was made in reference to this subject, and a variety of statements and estimates were received in the answers returned, and which will be found embodied in a condensed form in another paper annexed to the agricultural report. We give a few of the estimates of our correspondents in this paper. In New Hampshire, one return allows 20 pounds of beef and 25 pounds of pork to each person; in New Work, 150 pounds of beef in New Jersey, 100 pounds of beef and 100 pounds of pork; in Pennsylvania, in" one estimate, 100 pounds of beef and 100 pounds of pork in another, 180 pounds of animal food for each person over ten years of age; in another estimate, 100 pounds of beef and in another, 60 pounds do. In Virginia, 250 pounds bacon; in South Carolina, 150 pounds pork and 50 pounds beef; in Georgia 180 pounds pork and 50 pounds beef; in Mississippi, beef or pork 200 to 250 pounds; in Tennessee, 100 pounds of beef, pork and poultry; in Kentucky, 200 pounds beef, or 150 pounds pork; in I n diana, consumption j including adults and children, 15 pounds beef 100 pounds pork, each person another estimate, 50 pounds beef 150 pounds pork; in I illinois, 200 pounds beef and pork. In England, Mcqueen takes the consumption of the large cities of And $ h, Birtncid127gham, Manchester, Glasgow, Dundee, &c, &east he basis of calculation for the British empire, from which he shows that the consumption of animal food of all kinds, including s wines flesh, amounts to 169 pounds per individual. There animal food is so ab und it that every individual can have as much a six. a. 72 the wants of it, it cannot be supposed that the consumption is less per individual than in Great Britain. R But, to be on the safe side, we have estimated the same quantity per head (namely, 169) for the consumption of butchers meat and s wines flesh by the people of this country. This gives upon our estimate of the population for 1848 the enormous quantity of 3,664)934,000 pounds, which, at four cents per pound, amounts in value to the sum of                                                                                                                                                                 $146,597,360.. Mcqueen (pp 23,42, 43 and 56) estimates the quantity of butchers meat consumed by the people )of Great Britain at 2,871,749,790pounds-to which is to be added 6,080,000 swine, averaging in weight 1 cut. 3 quarters, or 196 poundsl1191680000 pounds thus giving 4,063,429,790 pounds as the quantity of animal food consumed in 1835 by the people of Great Britain and I re land, then numbering 24,000,000 souls. The value of butchers meat is estimated at 58,283,759; value of swine, at 21,000,000-equal to 79,283,-759, or about                           $395,000,000. This is exclusive of hides and tallow the latter he estimates at 4,500,000, or about                                                 $22,000,000. I n view of these facts, we believe our estimate of the consumption of animal food in this country is not too great, enormous as it may appear in the aggregate o) Horses, in 1840......... .a. .a. .a. .a. 4,335,669I increase, 25 per cent r. .a. .a. 1,083, 9175,419,586An increase of three per cent. per annum gives 162,586 animals, worth                                      $50 per head p) In the "journal agriculture Critique et de Jardinage, it is estimated that each of the inhabitants of the city of Paris consumes 138 eggs per annum. It is probably very much above the aggregate number consumed. We have in our estimate allowed 50 eggs for the consumption of each individual of the population of the United States per annum, and estimated their value at half a cent each egg. The number of eggs imported from France for London alone, in 1833, was upwards of 70,000,000. The domestic supply was, of course, immensely greater q) Of the quantity of feathers produced in the United States, we have no information. We put the item in because it exists, hoping hereafter to obtain satisfactory information in relation to it r) We are unable to say whether or not the item of milk consumed, exclusive of the quantity used in manufacture of butter and cheese, was included in the census of 1840, under the head products of the dairy." Toe are inclined to think it was not, as the value of the products of the dairy is very low in proportion to the population of the Union, by comparison with the estimates for other countries. In 1840, the population of the Union exceeded 17,000,00; therefore, according to the census returns, the consumption and exportation of the products of the dairy would not be quite                                               $2 per the ad. We are, therefore, inclined to think that milk was not included in the returns. Of so, we might with propriety add                                                                                                                                                                              $15,000,000 to our estimate of the products of the dairy. In Great Britain, ac726Ex. cording to Mcqueen, the value of the milk, butter, and cheese consumed in 1835 was, milk, 12,000,000; butter, 13,500,000;cheese z7000000total, 32,500,000, or                                                                                                                                                                 $160,000,000 in federal money. In our belief, the value of the products of the dairy consumed in the United States and exported, is nearer                                                                                                                                                                                                          $100,000,000than                          $42,000,000.(s) Estimate based upon the census of 1840, with 25 per cent added t) Returns of the census of 1840, with 25 per cent. added u) Estimate based upon the census of 1840, with due allowance for increase and decrease of the different interests v) In consequence of the embarrassments experienced by the commercial world during the year 1848, we have estimated the capital employed in manufactures at the same amount as last year. Our estimate for 1847 was founded upon the aggregate capital returned in 1840, with a little more than 22 per cent. added for increase w) For reasons like those stated in the preceding paragraph, we have made but little addition to our estimate of the products of the mines in our table of 1847.(x) The last four items are crude estimates, there being no sat is tory data on which to found them. In Great Britain, the rental of houses and lands amounts to 65, 0000,000 or                            $315,000,000. There are in the United States, probably, 10,000 lawyers; 15,000physicians and surgeons; 20,000 clergymen of all sects and religions; besides authors, editors, professors of science, belleslettres, arts, and music; clerks, school teachers, &c, &c. But there are no returns or other satisfactory data from which their incomes can be calculated. Thus it appears that the aggregate amount of the products of labor and capital in the United States, in 1848, was                                               $2,323,564, 656 if the estimates in the preceding table are correct. It is proper, however, to remark that, in the census of 1840, among the statistics of manufactures, the following items appear, viz: mills, and articles produced              $76,545,453; houses,                          $41,917,401; ships,             $7,016,-094; manufactures of cotton,                            $46,350,453; manufactures of wool20696999; household goods,                                                $29,025,380. From the items enumerated, it is apparent that a large portion of the aggregate value of manufactures produced in the United States consists of raw material, which has been included in the census statistics, as well as in our estimates in other forms, and therefore should be deduced from the aggregate amount. In England, the value of raw material to products in manufactures is usually estimated at three fifths of the whole. In this country, where labor is higher, and materials cheaper, it would be nearer to the truth to estimate the cost of the raw material at one half of the value of the products of manufactures the other half representing the wages of labor and the profits of capital. Having been estimated in other forms, it is proper that the cost of the raw material should be deduced from the aggregate amount. One half would be                                                 $275,000,000; thus show x. 
727ing the grand aggregate of the products of the labor and capital of the United States, in 1817, to be                                               $2,048,564,756. Perhaps other deductions and allowances of a similar character should be made, and very probably some additions. Precise accuracy is not pretended in the estimates above submitted. With the materials at hand, and within reach of this office, it could not be attained. Our table, as was remarked in our last report, may therefore be deemed an experiment. It is hoped, however, that it will attract the attention of the intelligent investigator, and be the means of eliciting suggestions which will enable us to make a nearer approximation to truth in future estimates which we may make. Friendly criticism will be very gratefully received, and any suggestions which will enable us to render our work more perfect, will be carefully considered. It is designed to re publish the table in the reports of this office for a series of years, with such corrections and improvements as more accurate information may justify. By this method, we hope, in time, to make it as accurate and reliable as such a table can possibly be. During the season, we have observed in the public journals criticisms upon the table published in the report for 1847; some of a friendly and liberal, and some of an unfriendly and il liberal character. We have, however, as yet seen no suggestions which should induce us materially to alter the principles upon which we have constructed the preceding table. Some persons who have done us the honor to criticise our table have found fault with our, taking the medium market price in Newyork, the great commercial mary of the country, in which the general prices of all products and commodities are fixed, as the rule by which to estimate the different articles and commodities, mentioned in our table. For instance, the price of wheat in the market of New York is not deemed the true price by which to estimate the value of the wheat crop of the country. But, on the contrary, the true rate, it is alleged, should be the price which the producer obtains in the million localities of the Union where wheat is produced and sold from first hands. We do not admit this criticism to be founded on sound and correct principles. When we revert to first principles in political economy, we think it must be admitted that the surplus of any crop or commodity which is sold by the producer and enters into the general commerce of the world, is the only part of it which has in truth, so far as the accumulation of wealth by the nation is concerned, any value. That portion of his own production which the farmer consumes in his family or on his farm, is of no account or value whatever in the general commerce of the world, and has, in fact, no price. It is the surplus which enters into commerce only that has price, and that only, strictly speaking, it is of importance to estimate. Therefore, to be precisely correct, the true rule would be to call the amount of wheat consumed by the producer nothing, and estimate only the amount which he has to sellBesidcs, the price is not deemed very important. It is import 28 X. it ant to get the true quantity, and when that is obtained, we have all that is necessary, Of we have produced this year 126,00,000bushels of wheat, when we have ascertained the quantity, we have by 'far the most important part of the information we need on that subject, and we may put such a value, or rather price, on the whole quantity as we please. It will fill no more mouths under one principle of valuation than it will under another. We therefore have concluded to assume, as our rule of estimate in relation to the articles in our table, the medium price in the New York market at the date of preparing the table; and we have very good authority for this course. We find the same principle followed by eminent statisticians in Europe. Coachman, in his estimate of the annual produce of the United Kingdom for 1846, values wheat at 60s. the quarter, whereas the imperial average price per quarter was only 53s. 4d during that year. But, if others are dissatisfied with this rule of calculation, we have, in another table in this report, supplied the means by which estimates may be made more in accordance with their own views. In appendix No. -a, will be found tables exhibiting, among other things, the cost of production and the prices of the different grains in nearly every State in the Union. And in another table will also be found the prices of agricultural products of all kinds in the principal markets of nearly every State. From these tables materials can be obtained by which estimates may be made more in accordance with the views of those who differ from our principles of calculation. We have also seen some criticisms upon our estimate of the quantities of agricultural produce. We allude more particularly to one published in a western city in relation to our estimate of the quantity of flax and hemp produced. The criticism was il liberal and arrogant, but it led us to investigation, the result of which was a thorough conviction of our own general correctness, and the want of information on the part of the person who called our estimate in question. I need, we think it can .e clearly shown that there is more than twice as much flax produced in the single State of Newyork, as the person in question supposed was produced of the same article in the whole Union. We candidly admit that we a reliable to great error for want of the means of obtaining correct information. But we think we can safely say that no other person has such ample means in his possession from which to make an estimate of the crops of the Union as we have. They are to be found in the facts which we carefully collect from every agricultural periodical, and many other papers, published in the different States of the Union; and from the returns made by practical farmers in answer to thousands of circulars which we send yearly into every neighborhood of the country, asking for information. Until we a rep provided with better means of information and more reliable data, we must adhere to the estimates which we have submitted, believing them to be as near an approximation to the actual truth as has yet been made by any one. As a matter of curious interest, we give Mcqueens estimate of the produce of the land" in the U. Kingdom, adding a column containing the value w reduced to federal money, at                         $4.85 per pound sterling. a. 729Table. Value in pounds sterling. Value in federal money.

I obtained let. services of Or, S. Cells Williams. a citizen of the Unitedtastes, who is an old and highly esteemed resident in this placed has a thorough knowledge of. horticulture and botany. I. Mad ed over to him the box of <a name="seeds36"><mark>seeds</mark></a> with which I was charged, an in a partial report made to me, here with sent you, you will see i fat he is making every effort to effect a valuable exchange. E had hoped to find some China man to whom I could have c omitted the management of this subject; but, upon inquiry, no onekqalified for the business could be found. Mr. Williams understands the language of the country; and is well acquainted with its, its, vegetables. &c, and their adaptation to. the soil and c li- mate of the United States; and for the purpose of procuring such is will live and thrive in our country, he has sent to the moreNfirthern parts of China to obtain such as are new and valuable. To soon as exchanges can be effected they will be sent to you by6aTe first suitable conveyance. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, On. E. Burk, Com of Patents.  John W. Davi   . Canton, November 22, 1848. A: In compliance with your request that I would take charge f the box of vegetable <a name="seeds37"><mark>seeds</mark></a> sent out by Mr. Burke of the At Office, I have opened the box, and distributed the contents t contained four parcels of <a name="seeds38"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, one of which lay loose in the+ the others were done up in a wrap per. I have sent two of these larger parcels to the Rev. Dr. Bridgman at Shanghai, actesmpanying them with a letter requesting him to distribute one ofifetl to gardeners, and other persons in that place, in exchange' fr the <a name="seeds39"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of fruit and vegetables common in that region, and. send the other to King po, to Dr. D. B. Mccartee and Dr. Sac swan, two physicians residing there, both of whom will be william, 1 think, to forward the views of Org Burke. I wrote them, City explaining these views, and assuring them that the slight, open ses they might be at in putting up and for warding such <a name="seeds40"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. they could procure, would be repaid to their order in Cantonfram both these places, returns may be looked for during the cornzigg year; and, as soon as either of these gentlemen return an answer respecting the reception and disposal of the packet of <a name="seeds41"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, in will inform you. The third packet is still here waiting an op aet unity to be sent to Fuhchau. I S have distributed the rest of the <a name="seeds42"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, 218 parcels in all, to a <a name="seeds43"><mark>seeds</mark></a> man and florists who has formerly received such parcels and wanted them himself or distributed the <a name="seeds44"><mark>seeds</mark></a> among the gardeners- raise vegetables for market. I gave him the Chinese names f all those I had, and shall endeavor to collect through him all2cid127ommoa <a name="seeds45"><mark>seeds</mark></a> and fruits grown whereabouts. Doc N59740with respect to the articles required or suggested by Mr. Burke in exchange for these <a name="seeds46"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and to the information he wishes respecting agriculture, I have time now only to make a few general remarks. I have mentioned to the gentlemen at Nin1po and Shanghai' that the <a name="seeds47"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the tallow tree (Stillingia semi fera) are particularly wanted, and think they will be able easily to collect them the plant grows in this region, but its <a name="seeds48"><mark>seeds</mark></a> furnish little tallow, perhaps because the warmth of the climate induces a different habit of the plant, pre judicial to the deposit e of this natural covering of the seed. They have been, moreover, requested to get some jars of the <a name="seeds49"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the Shantung cabbage, and send them down. The various processes attending the watching and rearing of silkworms, preparation of silk, and cultivation of the mulberry, have been carefully translated from native works upon the subject, byStanislaus Julie n, of Paris; and the manipulations of the Chinese in the tree have been described by He Guignes, formerly French consul at Wanton; both their works can be obtained in Paris. Almost every point relating to the agriculture of this people has been investigated by the latter, whose overland travels to He kin furnished him with unusual opportunities of observing the crops of the country, and most of the 'modes of raising them. Mr. Fortunes book, lately published, also contains -one valuable details on flora culture. The Chinese are rather gardeners than farmers j and one reason why they produce so much, and support such a large population, is the interest so large a portion of the population have lathe soil, inducing them to cultivate it themselves, and the, la geproI portion of vegetables in their food. They have no inducement to learn any of the principles of agriculture from us, inasmuch as the ,plats of ground belonging to individuals are too small to allow many experiments, and no one has the means of showing them the advantages of other modes by actual experiment. Among thecid127cid127egetable productions of China, there are several which might be carried to the United States with a fair prospect, of introducing them, if proper means were employed, and funds furnished for sending them. The camphor tree, the tallow tree, and the varnish tree, would probably succeed in the Southern. States, and all of them prove sources of wealth or convenience, The oil bearing camelia is largely grown in the provinces of Meany se and Soon an, for the oil; in the <a name="seeds50"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, which is obtained by pressure, and used for c urinary purposes and in the arts; this plant would be of use in furnishing a vegetable oil serviceable in domestic life. All these plants are grown at a distance from the coast ,and at present more expense would be required in procuring them but, if their utility here is an index of their probable uses in America, money and care would be well bestowed in obtaining them Accounts of the condition of laboring men, their wages, rank in society, and skilful ness, requested by Mr. Burke, can be found da the works of He Guignes and Air John Davis, both of whom are trustworthy, and their writings easily to be obtained. With great respect, I have the honor to be yours, truly, S. Wells Of Lli Ams. His Excellency Soil W. Davi S,
