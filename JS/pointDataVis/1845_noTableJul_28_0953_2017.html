29th Congress, a. To. Of Reps1st Session -ANNUAL Report of The Commissioner Of Patents. Report the Commissioner Of Patents, For The Year 1845. February 24, 1846. Head, and referred to the Committee on Patents. Patent Office Of, January, 1846. Of  R: In compliance with the act of Congress, entitled "in act in addition to the act to promote the progress of science and the useful arts, "approved March 3, 1837, the undersigned has the honor to submit his annual report, exhibiting the operations of the Patent Office during the year ending December 31, 1845. The whole number of applications for patents received during the year 1845, is -twelve hundred and forty-six. The whole number of caveats filed during the same time is four hundred and fifty-two. The number of patents issued in 1845 is five hundred and two, including six reissues, six additional improvements, and seventeen designs; classified and alphabetical lists of which, with the names of the patentees, are annexed, marked K and L. During the same period four hundred and seventy patents have expired, a list of which is annexed, marked M. There have also been eighteen applications for extensions, three of which only have been granted. The claims embraced in the respective patents issued during the year 1845 are also here to annexed, marked N. The receipts of the office for the year 1845, including duties and fees paid in on applications for patents, caveats, re issues, additional improvements, extensions, and for copies, amount in the whole to            $51,076.14; of which sum        $8,223.33 have been repaid on applications withdrawn, and for money paid in by mistake, as per statement marked A. The expenses of the office during the year 1845 have been, for salaries                                                               $15,545.20; temporary clerks,            $4,097.09; contingent expenses, including postage,        $8,224.58; compensation of district judge,                                                                         $100; library,         $813.04; agricultural statistics,                          $2,392.41; amounting in the whole to                 $31,172.32; leaving a net balance of                                                               $11,680.49, to be credited to the Patent Fund, as per statement marked B. There has also been expended during the year past, under the act of March 3, 1837, the sum of                          $2,938.75 for the restoration of records and drawings, and the sum of           $593.58 for duplicate models, as per statement marked C. The whole number of patents issued by the United States for inventions, up to January, 1846, is fourteen thousand five hundred and twenty-six. The general business of the office, as well as its receipts, has, during the year past, greatly increased over that of any former year. The excess of applications over the number received in 1844, is two hundred and one the excess of caveats filed during the same period, compared with the former year, is seventy-two, and the excess of receipts,     $9,850.08. The statement here to appended, marked D, will exhibit the progress of the business of the office from January 1, 1840, to December 31, 1845, inclusive, and will be interesting, inasmuch as it furnishes abundant proof that the march of improvement in the sciences and arts in this country continues to be rapidly onward. The balance in the treasury to the credit of the Patent Fund on the 1st January, 1846, was                                                             $182,459.69, as will appear from the statement of the Register of the Treasury, and the note appended, marked E. In accord b ice with the usage adopted by my predecessor, I have required of the two principal examiners, reports showing the progress of invention in this country during the past year, as they have been brought under the view of the Patent Office, which are here to annexed, marked and H. They are referred to as very favorable proofs of the talents and industry of those two officers, and as furnishing interesting reviews of the progressive march of the arts. It will be seen, by reference to those reports, that the past year has not been barren of valuable and important inventions and improvements; and that the inventive genius of our countrymen has suffered no abatement in the intensity of its activity, nor in the value and utility of its products. In connection with the scientific operations of the Patent Office, I will embrace the opportunity to state, that I have received from Professor Morse an interesting account of the different magnetic telegraphs now in operation in Europe, made up from materials obtained by personal examination, and which will be found in paper marked I. I am happy to add, that Professor Is own brilliant invention, by which thought is conveyed with the rapidity of the lightning’s flash, is still preeminent overall others of a similar character now in use in Europe. By the act of Congress of June 17, 1844, making appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of the government, &c., the sum of $700 was appropriated for covering the coping of the Patent Office, and the further sum of $600 was appropriated for an iron railing on the portico and for lamp posts. The whole of the last mentioned sum was expended in the latter part of the year 1844, by my predecessor, and the work faithfully and substantially executed. The sum appropriated for covering the coping was, after the work was commenced and nearly finished, found to be insufficient to complete it. Seeming it imprudent to leave it in an unfinished state, I directed the balance required to complete it, amounting to           $59.07, to be charged to the contingent account of the office. The Patent Office building is now in thorough repair, and will require no appropriation for the present year, to keep it in a state of preservation. by predecessor, in his last annual report; deemed it his duty, in consequence of the great inconvenience arising from the increase of models, rendering classification almost impossible, and the transaction of the daily business of the office very difficult, to recommend the construction of one of the wings contemplated in the original plan of the building. The experience of the short time during which I have filled the office of Commissioner has convinced me of the necessity of an enlargement of the Patent Office building. The increase of the business of the office is not only rapidly multiplying the models of both patented and rejected inventions, but it imperiously calls for an addition to the examining and clerical force of the office. And, as the rooms at present appropriated to the reception and classification of the models, and the use of the clerks, are fully occupied, provision will have to be made for the latter, (if Congress shall authorize an increase of their number) as well as for the former. I would, therefore, respectfully submit, in view of the constantly and rapidly increasing business of the office, that provision should be made for the construction of both wings, agreeably to the original plant one wing would be immediately occupied by the classified models, and the other would, in a few years, be necessary for the accommodation of the official corps of the office. An estimate of the expense of erecting the two additional wings, made at my request, by a distinguished architect, is here with submitted, marked F. In connection with the subject of the enlargement of the Patent Office building, I would respectfully call the attention of Congress to the necessity of an increase of the examining force of the office. The present board of examiners consists of two principal examiners, and two assistants. The last addition to the examining force was authorized by the act of March 3, 1839. By reference to the statement marked D, exhibiting the progress of the business of the office from January 1, 1840, to December 31, 1845, inclusive, it will be seen that the whole number of applications for patents during the first mentioned year was 765, and during the year 1845 they amounted to 1,246; thus nearly doubling in number since 1840, and since the last addition to the examining force was authorized. During the last year the number of applications has exceeded that of any former year, except 1844, three hundred and ninety-nine and the number of caveats filed one hundred and thirty-seven. The increase of the number of applications does not exhibit the actual increase of the business of the office. Each application adds to the labors of the examiners and clerks in nearly a quadruple ratio, as almost every case requires two or three examinations before it is decided, leading to more or less correspondence in relation to it. The great addition to the number of new applications, during the two last years, has rendered it physically impossible for the examiners to keep up with the business of the office, even with the most arduous and persevering efforts, aided by the experience of years on the part of both of them. An addition to this branch of the force of the office has, therefore, become imperatively necessary; and if it should not be made, the inventor must be subjected to long and unreasonable delay before his claims can be examined. The crowded state of business during the last year has already occasioned complaints and censures against the office, on the part of impatient applicants, who were not appraised of the causes which prevented the seasonable examination of their cases. These causes were not to be found in the want of industry on the part of the examining force, but in the fertility of invention so creditable to our countrymen, which outstripped the physical capacity of the examiners to perform all the labors which were thus accumulated upon them. When it is borne in mind that the Patent Office is wholly sustained by duties paid in by inventors having, since its reorganization in 1836, not only carried on its operations without aid from the treasury, but having each year contributed a surplus to the Patent Fund, a part of which is yearly appropriated for the collection of agricultural statistics and the purchase and distribution of <a name="seeds0"><mark>seeds</mark></a> it cannot be deemed unreasonable on their part that Congress will, with the money thus furnished by themselves, make every necessary provision for its continued efficacy and usefulness. It is believed that the addition of one principal examiner and one assistant will be sufficient to enable the office, in the present state of its business, to perform its duties without unreasonable delay. But, if its business should continue to increase in the same proportion in which it has during the past two years, which is very probable, the addition to its force above recommended will not be long adequate to the performance of its duties. Whether or not provision shall be made for anything more than the present necessities of the office, is respectfully submitted to the wisdom of Congress. In connection with this subject, I feel bound to reiterate the recommendation of my predecessor, made in his last report, in relation to an increase of the salaries of the scientific corps of the office. The office of examiner of patents is one of the most difficult and responsible offices under the government. It requires the highest attainments in the sciences, and a soundly discriminating mind, to which may be added the most unquestionable integrity of character. An examiner should be a living encyclopedia of science, if the expression maybe used. His multifarious duties require an intimate and thorough knowledge of the whole circle of science and art, together with a knowledge of modern languages particularly of the French and German and the most attentive and incessant mental labor. Met, for all these high qualifications, and for labors scarcely second in intensity to those required by any ulcer in the government, the principal examiner is allowed only a salary of                                                         $1,500 per annum, and his assistant but                                                         $1,250. That it is wholly inadequate, as a compensation for such qualifications, must be evident to every one capable of appreciating the value of the talent and capacity equal to the duties required of an examiner of patents. That it is not sufficient to retain the services of those capable of filling that place, this office has had proof in more than one instance. During the present year the office has lost the services of one of the most capable arid efficient persons who was ever in its employment, and who was induced to, resign by the inadequacy of the compensation which he received, and the more alluring prospects held out to him in other pursuits and in filling the vacancies which have occurred by resignation and promotion in the examining department, since the undersigned has been at the head of the office, he has had to encounter the difficulty of securing the services of persons of the requisite talents and attainments, in consequence of the total inadequacy of the compensation. He has had the mortification of being defeated, in his efforts to procure the services of suitably qualified persons, by a railroad corporation, which was able to pay more for such services than he was authorized by law to pay. In urging an increase of the salaries of the examiners, the undersigned is happy to find himself sustained by the great body of the enlightened inventors of this country, who desire earnestly that the men who are to pass upon their valuable rights shall be not only men of integrity, but of the highest order of talents and scientific qualifications. They desire that the class of officers to whom the law commits their interests shall be capable of comprehending the many intricate and difficult questions submitted to them; and, as the Patent Office is sustained by a heavy tax on their ingenuity, they feel that it is due to them that a sufficient sum should be appropriated, in the form of salaries, to induce men of the requisite capacity to undertake the various and ungrateful duties of examiners. For additional reasons in favor of an increase of the salaries of the scientific corps, I would respectfully refer to the last report of my predecessor, in whose views and recommendations on this point I concur. The experience of this office, and the construction given to it by the courts, have proved that the existing laws are defective in many particulars; some of the most prominent defects in which I will proceed to point out 1. In relation to the power of the chief clerk to act in the place of the Commissioner during his absence. Under the second section of the act of July 4, 1836, it was believed that the chief clerk is clothed with the power to perform all the functions of the Commissioner, as well during his absence as when a vacancy existed in the office. Such, I understand, was the construction of the law by my predecessor, whose practice was in conformity to it. And, finding such construction and practice to exist when I entered upon its duties, I made no change in that respect. Recently, however, the correctness of that construction has been questioned by the United States district court in Massachusetts, and the authority of the chief clerk to perform the functions of the Commissioner during his absence denied. I also understand that this opinion of the court in Massachusetts is sustained by other eminent legal authorities. The practice may, therefore, be regarded as doubtful, if not wholly unauthorized by law. If the construction and practice in relation to this matter be not correct, this office is placed in a situation of great inconvenience, inasmuch as in case of the sickness or necessary absence of its official head, its functions must, for the time being, cease. W The framers of the patent law, as the practice of my predecessor shows, contemplated no such result; and if they failed to provide for such a contingent y, it was evidently because they did not duly weigh the meaning of the language which they used in the section of the law above referred to. To provide against the inconvenience and the evils which may result from such a defect in the law, some legislation will be necessary. And, as the chief clerk has, since the reorganization of the office in 1836, officiated more or less as the acting Commissioner, and has signed many patents and other papers upon which important and valuable rights depend, it is respectfully submitted if it is not expedient to make those acts valid by a declaratory law on the subject 2. Some doubt has arisen in relation to the construction of the 13th.section of the act of July 4, 1836, in relation to the power of the Commissioner to enlarge the claim of the patentee who surrenders his patent for correction and re issue. The 13th section provides "that, whenever any patent which has heretofore been granted, or which shall be inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective or insufficient description or specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming in his specification, as his own invention, more than he had, or shall have, a right to claim as new, if the error has or shall have arisen by inadvertent y, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, it shall be lawful for the Commissioner, upon surrender" &c, to cause a new and complete patent to be issued. In the part of many able jurists, who are thoroughly acquainted with the patent law, it is believed and contended that, under the section above quoted, the Commissioner has power to cause the issue of a patent only in cases where the patentee has claimed as his invention more than he was justly entitled to. Such a construction of the provision in question would authorize the Commissioner to limit the claim of the patentee when he had claimed too much, but not to enlarge it when he had claimed too little; notwithstanding the new matter claimed, and to secure which the patent was surrendered for re issue, was particularly set forth and described in the specification and drawings, and represented in the model. Such a construction is in conflict with every sound principle of justice, and it should forthwith be remedied by an amendment of the law relating to this matter. It could not have been intended by the framers of the provision in question that the inventor should be deprived of the benefit of his invention, because, from inadvertent e, mistake, or accident, he had failed to claim it all, notwithstanding he had set it forth in his specification, drawings, and model. And, as the phraseology of the section of the act above quoted admit of doubt, it is respectfully submitted whether or not it is expedient to remove this doubt by additional legislation 3. The next provision of the law in respect to the construction of which doubt has arisen, is that which relates to the degree and extent of the use of an invention, before a patent is obtained for it, which shall constitute an abandonment of it to the public. Under the second section of the act of March 3, 1839, it has been held by the Patent Office that the sale or prior use of a machine within two years from the date of its invention was no proof of the abandonment of the invention to the public; and by that construction of the provision of the law referred to, both the office and inventors have, until recently, been guided. It was believed that, upon a fair and liberal construction of the section referred to, if not by its very terms, the inventor is entitled to two years, during which he might make experiments with a view to perfect his invention, or sell lo others machines which' he had constructed during that period, without invalidating his right to a patent. But, recently, some of the judicial tribunals have been inclined to take a different view of that provision in the seventh section of the act of 1839, and one of the circuit court judges, I have been informed, has, in one case, directly ruled, and so instructed the jury that the sale of a single machine is evidence of the abandonment of the invention to the public, and of course would destroy the validity of a patent issued under such circumstances. It will be obvious that such a construction of the provision under consideration must greatly cripple the efforts, and, in many instances, the means of inventors. An invention does not, as did Minerva from the brain of Love, spring from the inventors brain perfect in form and action on the contrary, it often requires years of painful thought and study, and numerous and varied experiments, to bring it to perfect ability. It also requires, often times, a very considerable expenditure of money in constructing machines, and in making experiments. And as many, if not a large majority of that worthy class of men, are limited in their means, they find it a very great convenience, and sometimes absolutely necessary, to permit others to use publicly their machines, for the purpose of testing their perfectibility by experiment, and to sell them for the purpose of procuring the means to pursue their own experiments, and finally to obtain a patent. In the judgment of the undersigned, nothing can be more just and reasonable than that the poor inventor should have the privilege of permitting others to use his machine by way of experiment, and of selling to others to use during the term of two years prior to his application for a patent, without invalidating his right to the same, supposed until recently to have been extended to him by the act of 1839. And it is, therefore, hoped that Congress will, by some further legislation upon the subject, clear the law of all doubt upon this point 4. By the same section of the act of 1839, it is provided that every person or corporation who may have purchased any newly invented machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, prior to the application of the inventor for a patent, " shall be held to possess the right to use, and end to others to be used, the specific machine" &c, so made or purchased, without liability there for to the inventor, or any other person interested in the invention. The Patent Office, believing that it was constrain g this provision according to its letter, as well as its spirit, has held that the right of the constructor or purchaser of a new machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, extended only to the specific and identical machine so purchased or constructed. 'by the judicial tribunals, however, it has been construed differently, and held that the constructor or purchaser, under such circumstances, not only acquired a right to use and v end the identical machine, or thing made or purchased by him, but also a right to the invention itself. The effect of such construction of the provision referred to is, to give the constructor or purchaser of a machine, or other thing invented, a coequal interest in the invention with the inventor himself. It is obvious that, however loose and unguarded the language of the statute in relation to this matter may be, such a construction as that which has been given to it by the judicial tribunals could not have been contemplated by its framers. They could have contemplated no such injustice to the inventor, and it is therefore respectfully submitted if this provision does not also need amendment 5. By the 18th section of the act of July 4, 1836, by which the Patent. Office was reorganized, provision is made for the extension of patents under certain circumstances for an additional term of seven years, and it is also expressly provided that " the benefit of the renewal shall extend to assignees and grandees of the right to use the thing patented, to the extent of their interests therein Under this provision, the board to whom the question of extension is submitted have heretofore held that the benefit extended as well to the assignees and grandees, as to the patentee. And this construction of the law has been sustained by some of the judicial tribunals, while it has been reversed by others. In the eastern circuit, it was held by the late lamented Justice Story that the benefit of the extension did not extend to the as signers and grantees; and the distinguished Chief Justice of the United States has held just the contrary in the Maryland circuit, and sustained the construction given to this provision of the statute by the board of extension. Already much litigation and consequent injury to both patentees and purchasers have grown out of this subject. A suit is now pending in the Supreme Court of the United States in relation to the well-known Woodworth’s patent for a planing machine, involving very heavy pecuniary interests, in which this question is one of the points raised in the case. It is, therefore, a matter worthy of consideration if this conflict of opinion in the courts had not better be settled by the more speedy and less expensive process of legislation 6. In all cases in which patents are refused by the Commissioner, the applicant, if he is dissatisfied with the decision of that officer, has two remedies, viz: one by appeal to the chief justice of the circuit court for the District of Columbia, and the other by a proceeding in equity against the Commissioner to compel him to issue a patent. The 16th section of the act of July 4, 1836, and the 10th section of the act of March 3, 1839, which provide a remedy in equity for the aggrieved applicant, have failed to designate the place where these proceedings shine had; and, consequently, the Commissioner may be harassed wit suits in equity in every court of the United States having equity jurisdiction; at the same time subjecting him to the necessity of leaving his official duties at the seat of government at any time in order to attend personally to these proceedings. Suits may be pending at the same time in extreme parts of the Union, thus rendering it impossible for him to attend in person, if he should be required, as he is liable to be. To case has yet occurred in which the Commissioner has been compelled to attend in person; yet it would be best to guard against such a contingent y, particularly as it is now held that the chief clerk has no power to perform the duties of the Commissioner in his absence, and the office would be left, in such an event, without an official head. Two suits in equity are now pending against the Commissioner in the circuit court for the district of Pennsylvania, in which, as it has not, been necessary for me to attend, I have employed counsel, and in one of which     have had the question of jurisdiction raised. In the course of the administration of the office many other defects and ambiguities have been observed in the acts now in force, which it is now unnecessary to refer to; but if Congress should conclude to revise the present patent acts which I will take this opportunity to recommend they will, if required, be particularly pointed out. 

In connection with the revision and amendment of the present patent laws, I would remark that, in my judgment, some additions to the present, enactments are necessary for the more effectual encouragement and protection of inventors and patentees. The existing laws, while professing to give to the inventor the exclusive enjoyment of his invention for the term of fourteen years, do, in fact, afford, to him but very little protection. The fruits of his genius and his toils are constantly liable to be wrested from him by the unscrupulous and dishonest, who, too often countenanced by public opinion, are apt to regard the rights of the inventor as the fruits of a monopoly which it is a merit instead of a wrong to break down and destroy; and the more valuable the invention, the more liable is the patentee to this species of invasion and injury, as there is more inducement held out to its per pet ration. The steal thy thief and the midnight burglar are justly regarded as the pests, and enemies of society, and are therefore seized and punished by penalties severe in proportion to the turpitude of their crimes; yet their depredations are committed on things which are made by law the subjects of property, and which may be acquired by industry or by purchase. The right of the inventor to his invention, in the judgment of all enlightened minds, cannot but be viewed as far more sacred than mere things of property. It is a mental creation, or rather the discovery of a principle or thing never before known to the world, and may be, and very many inventions have been, often productive of countless blessings to the human family, affecting their destinies as individuals and as communities through all time. When the wonderful discoveries of a Watt, a Fulton, a Whitney, and an Ark wright, and the great results to individuals and to nations which have followed from them, are contemplated, it is not difficult to realize the value of the splendid gifts which science, through their instrumentality, has bestowed upon man, nor to estimate the claims which the true inventor has upon society. He may truly be called the pioneer of civilization, the explorer of the unknown world of science and art. And yet how many of those truly great benefactors to their race have fallen victims to ingratitude and wrong, and gone down to their graves in pen cry and sorrow. The case of Li Whitney, our countryman, the inventor of the cotton gin, is but one among innumerable instances in which the fruits of splendid genius have been wrested from its possessor by the unprincipled depredator upon patent rights. It is familiar to all that that great inventor, whose name stands out like a bright and lustrous star in the consternation of genius, was compelled to expend all the profits of his invention in fruitless efforts to protect it from infringement, and finally died a victim to debt and disappointment. Any valuable inventions are now used in secret and kept from the world, on account of the impunity with which patent rights can be infringed, secrecy being a better protection to the inventor than the law. These reflections are indulged in with a view to awaken in the public mind a proper estimate of the value of the toils and labors of the inventor, and of his claims to full and. effectual protection in the enjoyment of the fruits of his genius and skill, and to enforce with more emphasis the suggestions which I deem it my duty to submit in relation to such amendments of the law as may be necessary for the security of the rights of inventors. The principal difficulties which the patentee has to encounter, t under the present laws, in enforcing his rights, arise from two circus 10 stances: first, from the fact that the question of originality may be raised on every trial for infringement; and, secondly, the almost total in efficacy of the existing law to prevent infringement. In every application, the question of the originality of the invention is thoroughly investigated by the Patent Office; and as it is decided affirmatively or negatively, the patent is issued or denied. If the patent is granted, it is very properly (as the office cannot claim in fallibility) deemed by the law only prima face evidence of the originality of the invention, and of the right of the patentee to recover damages for an infringement of his claim. Met there should be some point at which this question should be deemed as conclusively settled, and the right of the patentee to recover made absolute, or the patent declared to be a nullify. Met, under the existing laws, such is not the fact; and although the question of originality may have been decided by twenty furies, in as many different trials, it is just as much open to dispute in all subsequent trials. This difficulty in the way of the patentee to recover for infringements, in cases in which the invention is a very valuable one, and the infringe r a wealthy corporation, amounts almost to an insuperable one, as he is kept in the law, and harassed by litigation, until the term for which his patent runs, expires ; and he is left without adequate regeneration for his invention, and sometimes made poorer than when he commenced the fruitless attempt to vindicate his rights by an appeal to the law for redress. In view of the inefficiency of the existing enactments upon the subject, to protect the inventor, I have deemed it my duty to recommend that the law should be so amended as to provide some process for the repeal of a patent within a limited period of time after it shall have been issued, in which all matters tending to invalid ate it should be considered and forever settled. The validity of the patent should be called in question only in this proceeding against itself; but in all suits by the patentee for infringements, the patent should be deemed conclusive evidence of his right to recover damages. Were such a provision incorporated into the law, it would, compel all persons contesting the validity of a patent, to proceed in the first instance against the patent itself, in order to set it aside. And the courts would. be relieved from an immense mass of litigation growing out of the disputed claims of patentees, and the patentees would not be subjected to the tedious and costly process of vindicating their claims to the invention, patented, in every suit which they might institute for its infringement. This proceeding against the patent itself, with the view of procuring its repeal, is not new in the legislation of other nations. It has for many years been the law of France, and has been found to operate beneficially, as well to patentees as to parties interested in the repeal of patents. If it should be deemed expedient to engraft upon the present system a provision for the repeal of patents which may be invalid for any cause, the, wisdom of Congress will devise such amendments to the existing laws as may be deemed necessary to effect the purpose. In connection with this subject, it may not be inappropriate to remark, that in all trials in which the validity of a patent may be involved the court should be aided by the counsel of persons learned and experienced in the art to which the patent relates. And particularly would this be expedient if Congress were to authorize a proceeding against the patent itself, for the purpose of effecting its repeal. The tribunal before which ll. 11 the question should come should be constituted in part of persons learned in the art or science to which the patent relates. Another obstacle in the way of full enjoyment, by the patentee, of the benefits of his invention, and which' I have before alluded to, is the almost total inadequacy of the existing provisions of the law to protect him against infringement upon his rights. By the 14th section of the act of July 4, 1836, courts are authorized to treble the damages awarded to the plaintiff by the jury, in their discretion. If this provision could be administered according to its true spirit and intent, it would probably afford adequate protection to the patentee. But long experience has shown it to be practically inoperative. In the first place, furies, aware that their verdicts may be trebled by the court, sometimes take that circumstance into consideration in making them up, and do not award so high an amount of damages as they would if they were not conscious that their decision could be revised by the court and courts, too, are reluctant in taking the responsibility of increasing the damages awarded by the jury. Again: irresponsible persons are employed by others, who have adequate means to respond, to deprecate upon the rights of the patentee, who has no remedy except against the ostensible perpetrators of the wrong, and against whom a verdict would be utterly valueless. It is not an uncommon practice for one person possessing capital to furnish to another, who has none, the means to manufacture an article protected by a patent; thus screening himself from the consequences of a prosecution, while he enjoys all the profits resulting from the trespass. Machines protected by a patent are also operated in secret; and as the patentee has no legal power to enter upon the premises of another to ascertain whether or not his rights are invaded, and courts, upon trials, have not the authority to cause a view to be had of the machine and manufacture thus carried on in secret, the patentee is left, in such cases, entirely without redress. To remedy these defects in the patent laws, and to afford to the inventor that full and complete protection which the law designed he should have, it is believed that the following additional provisions would be effectual, namely: that on all trials for the infringement of a patent, the question whether or not the infringement was knowingly and willfully committed should be left to the jury; and if they should find in the affirmative, in addition to the damages which they may award, the courts should order that all the goods protected by the patent, together with the machines by which they shall have been manufactured, shall be forfeited to the use of the patentee, and the defendant be melted in double costs. This remedy, it is believed, would be much more efficacious than the existing one. Perhaps it would be expedient to add, by way of penalty, imprisonment on refusal to respond damages. And in all cases where it is believed that machines are operated in secret, courts should be authorized to cause an examination of the premises, in order to ascertain whether or not the use of the machine is an infringement of the rights of the patentee. By the 11th section of the act of July 4, 1836, the Commissioner was directed to charge the sum of three dollars for each assignment recorded in the Patent Office. This provision of the act of 1836 was repealed by 12 the 8th section of the act of March 3d, 1839, and now nothing is required for recording assignments. Since the passage of the last mentioned act, the number of assignments sent to the office to be recorded has multiplied so much as to require all the time of one clerk, and part of that of another, in recording and comparing them. During the year 1845, the office received 2,108 assignments, and for recording the same it paid out the sum of                                                         $1, 0 189 95 to temporary clerks, besides appropriating more than one half of the time of one of the permanent clerks in reading and comparing the originals with the record. As more than three-fourths of these assignments are sent to the office by speculators in patent rights, they should not subject the Patent Fund to be charged with the expense of recording them. This portion of the duties of the office is daily increasing; and it is believed that it would not be deemed unreasonable to require some return to the office, by way of a small duty, for each assignment sent to it for record. The law now requires the payment of a duty of twenty dollars on the filing of each caveat. As this proceeding entitles the caveat or merely to notice of all subsequent applications interfering with his invention, the duty is too high in proportion to the benefit derived from the caveat. Besides, there are many persons who have made valuable improvements in the arts which they are willing to bestow upon the world, but do not wish that other persons should obtain patents for things which they have not been the first to invent, or have not invented at all, and who would secure their use to the public by depositing in the Patent Office a caveat containing a description of the invention, if the duty were not so high. I tis, therefore, suggested that a duty of ten dollars on the filing of each caveat, without permitting it to become, as now, a part of the patent fee, if it should be subsequently converted into an application, would be equally productive to the revenues of the office, and would also result in much benefit to the public. The board provided by law to decide upon applications for the extension of patents is composed of the Secretary of State, the Solicitor of the Treasury, and the Commissioner of Patents. The very arduous duties required of the two officers first named, a p pertaining to their respective offices, render it very inconvenient for them to attend to the sometimes long and tedious examinations necessary in cases of applications for extensions. A board, composed of the Commissioner and the principal examiners, would, from the nature of their present duties, in the belief of the undersigned, be more appropriate; and it is suggested if it would not be expedient to abolish the present board, and transfer its duties to the Commissioner and examiners. As an efficient performance of the duties of the Patent Office requires the extensive use of scientific works, many of which can only be obtained in foreign countries at considerable expense, the usual appropriation will be required for that branch of the office. I have found the library belonging to the office to be deficient in many valuable works, which the experience of the office has found to be very necessary, many of which are of a costly character, and cannot be obtained with the sum which may be left of the usual appropriation, after paying for the current periodical works and publications taken by the office. As the office is now in an unprecedentedly flourishing condition, its revenues greatly exceeding its expenditures, it may be deemed expedient
13by Congress to make a more liberal appropriation for the library than has been heretofore made. An increase of the library, at present very incomplete, will contribute to the convenience of the scientific corps of the office, and give them increased facilities for the discharge of their duties, and is even more important to the inventors, to decide correctly upon whose interests it is very necessary that the office should know what has been done in foreign countries; a knowledge of which it can derive only by scientific works published abroad. In most of the foreign countries in which rapid advancement is making in the arts, publications are from time to time made of new inventions, containing both descriptions and drawings, which are found not only to be of very great benefit to inventors and to the public, but which have been the means of rendering essential aid to the operations of this office. In this country there has been no such provision for the publication of patents; and consequently, for want of the information which such a work would give to inventors, machines and processes of manufacture are invented over and over again, to be as often rejected at the Patent Office, for want of novelty. In addition to the disappointment and mortification which applicants under such circumstances suffer, they often incur large expenditures in perfecting their inventions, and in their efforts to procure patents for them. Whereas, if descriptions of the new patents issued were once a year, or oftener, published, both the disappointment and expense of applicants would be avoided, and the office itself relieved of the labor and trouble of examining inventions which had long before been introduced into public use. As this office is now in the possession of ample means, which are likely to be increased by its continually growing business, I would respectfully renew the recommendation made by my predecessor in his last report, that the Commissioner be authorized to subscribe for a thousand copies of some well-established scientific publication, on the condition that it should contain quarterly (or oftener) descriptions and drawings of all new inventions patented during the year, which the Commissioner might deem it expedient to cause to be published. The report upon agriculture for the year 1845, here to annexed, and marked J, will be found to contain a large mass of matter valuable and interesting to the scientific as well as the practical agriculturists. It will be perceived, from the review of the season which it contains, that, as a general fact, the crops have not equaled in quantity those of the preceding year. While the wheat crop has exceeded in amount the product of former years, almost all other important crops of the country have fallen short. That is pre eminently the case with the <a name="potato0"><mark>potato</mark></a> and hay crops of the northern and middle States, and of the corn crop in many of the southern States. The result is to be attributed to the cold and dry weather which prevailed in the northern and eastern States in the early part of the season, and in the middle and .southern States in the summer. But, while some of the States have suffered from the causes just mentioned, others have been more favored than ever; and, on the whole, we have reason for gratitude to the River of all good, for the munificent abundance which he has bestowed upon our favored country during the last year. The great range of latitude through which our country extends, commencing midway in the temperate zone and extending to the tropics, and1
embracing almost every variety of soil and climate, secures to us, for our own consumption, a sufficiency of nearly every description of product which can minister to necessity or luxury, besides furnishing a large surplus of many valuable products for exportation to foreign countries, the returns of which, in the productions of the labor and capital of other nations, add to our individual enjoyment and increase our national wealth. In truth, our agricultural products form the basis of our immense foreign commerce, thus constituting the strongest ligaments which unite us to the great brotherhood of nations; contributing not only to our national wealth, but to the cultivation of amity and peace in our foreign relations, and to the progress of civilization at home. In view of these beneficent influences, which have their origin in this great arm of our national industry, its flourishing condition cannot but be satisfactory and encouraging to the true patriot. The report of this year will show that this great branch of national industry is not only extending with the rapidly increasing number of our population, but that agriculturists themselves are a waking to a consciousness of the importance of their noble a vocation, and are calling science to their assistance in their efforts to improve. In the analysis of soils, products, manures, and the food of cattle and other stock, chemistry has already conferred immense benefits upon the agriculturists. Other sciences are also best owing their valuable donations upon him. For is the inventor behind in this work of cherishing the agriculturists. His genius adds its splendid gifts to the rich charities of science, as will be seen by the numerous and valuable machines which have been devised and constructed to relieve the toils and facilitate the labors of the husband man. The names of Li Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin, and Retro Good, the inventor of the cast iron plough, will be ranked among the greatest of benefactors while man is doomed to earn his daily bread by the sweat of his brow. In this branch of my labors I have been aided by the contributions of many distinguished friends of agriculture, whose communications will be found in the appendix to the agricultural report. And, among others, I have received several valuable papers collected by my late predecessor, the Hon. H. L. Ellsworth, and one from his own pen, relating to prairie cultivation, which will be found very interesting, and to which I would particularly refer, as containing much valuable knowledge derived from experience upon a subject of great interest to the government as well as to individuals. Among other valuable papers furnished by Mr. Ellsworth, is a translation of an abridged French treatise upon the cultivation of the cold a plant, by J. W. P. Lewis, esq., of Boston. The cold a is a species of the cabbage, and is cultivated in France for its seed, which contains extraordinary oleaginous properties, and from which large quantities of oil are manufactured, of a quality for lights nearly equal to the best s term, and which is now used in the different light houses of that kingdom through the aid of Mr. Lewis, Mr. Ellsworth has also favored the office with a small quantity of the seed of both the summer and winter colza which has been distributed to the members of Congress. The <a name="potato1"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, which has made such ravages in this, country and in Europe during the last two years, has formed a prominent subject of
15careful investigation, the results of which will also be found in the agricultural report, together with many valuable papers relating to that subject. Of the last appropriation for agricultural purposes, I have expended nearly                                                         $1,000 for <a name="seeds1"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of various kinds, and for preparing them for distribution, samples of each of which have been distributed to members of Congress. The number of packages distributed this year will exceedS0000. When it is considered that only                $3,000 is appropriated for agricultural purposes, and one third of that sum is appropriated for <a name="seeds2"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and much of the remainder expended for the mere copying of the report, it may justly be deemed a matter of surprise that such a mass of interesting matter has been collected and embodied as will be found in the agricultural report of this j rear. It has been accomplished only by the most rigidly careful expenditure of the fund placed at the disposal of the Commissioner. In discharging this part of my duty, I have severely felt the want of sufficient means to collect important information for the purpose. And I am compelled to acknowledge, that without the kind and generous contributions of intelligent citizens devoted to the interests of agriculture, it would be impossible for this office to collect and to lay before the country so many interesting facts, and so much valuable information, in relation to the interests of this great and paramount branch of national industry. If the Commissioner were provided with more ample means, the theatre of his operations in this branch of his duty could be greatly extended. At present the office has no means for making inquiry into the improvements of agriculture in foreign countries, nor for collecting rare and valuable <a name="seeds3"><mark>seeds</mark></a> abroad. I am gratified in having it in my power to state that our consuls and other agents residing in foreign countries, evince great willingness to aid this office in its efforts to advance our agricultural interests at home, by the collection of valuable information and <a name="seeds4"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in the countries in which they reside; but I have not been able to avail myself of the services of gentlemen holding official stations abroad, or offered in numerous instances, for want of the necessary means to defray the expenses of the purchase of <a name="seeds5"><mark>seeds</mark></a> and their conveyance to this country; and thus are our agriculturists not only deprived of an early knowledge of the advance of the science of agriculture in other countries, but also of <a name="seeds6"><mark>seeds</mark></a> which, in our extended country, would find a soil and climate congenial to their nature and habits, and would add much to the elements of national wealth. During the present year, I have availed myself of the services of a very intelligent gentleman, formerly connected with this office, and now travelling in Europe, in collecting agricultural information in the different countries which he may visit. Those services were voluntarily tendered. If compensation had been required, I of course could not have availed myself of the services of the gentleman referred to, because I had not the means to meet the demand. Two valuable communications have already been received from that gentleman, which will be found in the appendix to the agricultural report, and much more is expected, which may not arrive in season for the present report. When it is considered that much of the legislation of Congress, and millions of the treasure of the nation, are devoted, in one form and another, for the protection of manufactures, commerce, and other interests, it would not seem unreasonable if a few thousands should be annually appropriated for the promotion and advancement of that greatest and most essential of all the interests of the country the agricultural. The farmers themselves, while they cheerfully pay the millions of taxes demanded of them for the support of other interests, would not complain if a few thousands were added to their burdens for the promotion of their own. If Congress should come to the conclusion to increase the means at the disposal of the Commissioner for the purpose above suggested, it would enable him not only to add much to the value and usefulness of the agricultural report, but to add new varieties to the different grain and vegetable crops now produced in the country. In connection with this subject, I deem it proper to remark that the sun now annually appropriated for agricultural purposes is taken from the Patent Fund, all of which has been paid into the treasury by the inventors, and which has been set apart by law for the promotion of the useful arts, and for the benefit of that class of citizens from whom it has been collected. 'I hey justly complain of this his application of the Patent Fund, and demand that it shall be appropriated to the increase of the efficiency of the Patent Office. I concur entirely in the justice of their complaints, and respectfully submit if it would not be expedient to apply the revenues of the office to the increase of its force, and to the objects to which, in a preceding part of this report, I have called the attention of Congress, and make the necessary appropriation for agriculture from other moneys in the treasury. It was suggested in the last annual report of my predecessor that provision should be made for a permanent clerk, to aid ill procuring the statistical information for the agricultural report. In the discharge of my duties in connection with that subject, I have found that the services of a competent clerk are greatly needed. The numerous other duties revolving upon the Commissioner render it physically impossible for him to attend entirely to this portion of the business of the office, and he is obliged to require the labors of the regularly employed clerks in that department. It requires nearly the entire time of one clerk to read the domestic and foreign publications on agriculture, in order to make the necessary selections of matter for the report; and those services, which require sound discrimination and judgment, are paid for out of the sum placed at the disposal of the Commissioner for agricultural purposes, in the expenditure of which he has a very general discretion. Translations from foreign publications and works are also required, which are paid for out of the general agricultural fund. It is therefore submitted if it would not be expedient to establish a permanent clerk ship connected with the agricultural duties of the office, the salary of which should be adequate to command the services of a persons killed in statistics, and acquainted with foreign languages. It might be taken from the general sum appropriated for agricultural purposes, and would not add to the expenses of that branch of the office. The object of the report on agriculture is to show the general progress of that branch of national industry, and the particular amount of agricultural products, so far as it is possible for the Commissioner, with the limited means at his command, to approximate to exactness and precision in his estimates of the crops. In procuring materials for the report, he is compelled to rely on agricultural publications, the voluntary contributions of intelligent and public spirited citizens, and the returns which he solicits from members of Congress. The means which he possesses for procuring accurate and reliable information are, therefore, very limited. With suitable legislation on the part of the several States of the Union, they might be made ample. If the legislature of each State were to require returns to be made annually of all its agricultural products, the results of which to be transmitted to the Patent Office, the Commissioner could furnish to the country, each year, a full and complete view of its agricultural products, and of the general progress of that branch of national industry. This information could be very readily obtained through the medium of the assessors of the taxes in the several towns and districts of a State. Some of the States now require returns of the kind to be made by their assessors at certain periods. Such assistance in making up the agricultural report for the last year has been derived from the returns of the late census of the State of New Work. It is, therefore, hoped that the legislatures of the different States will turn their attention to this subject, and make provision for the collection of the statistics of all branches of industry, and direct the information thus obtained to be communicated to this office. In addition to other useful matter, I have appended to the agricultural report the annual reports of the Liverpool cotton, corn, tobacco, provision, and wool markets, for 1845, together with tables showing the importation, exportation, and consumption, and manufacture of cotton in Great Britain, for a series of years. The statistical information which the tables furnish will be interesting to one section of the agricultural interest, and useful to the statesman and legislator. As the Patent Office is now regarded as the general head and representative of the useful arts and the industrial interests of the country, it might be employed in collecting the statistics of all the great branches of national industry agricultural, manufacturing, commercial, and mining. Without knowledge of this character a nation knows but little of its capacity, its resources, or its power; nor without it can the legislator perform his duties, in relation to the great interests of his country, with that sound wisdom and judgment which the importance of his position and the consequences of his official action, good or evil, demand. In almost every other enlightened nation great attention is paid to the procuring of the most copious statistics in relation to all its interests. In this country, it must be confessed, they are comparatively very meagre. With suitable action on the part of Congress, aided by the cooperation of the several States, this desideratum might be supplied, and the mighty resources of our country become known as they are developed. In the absence of the action of Congress and the State legislatures upon the subject, it is desirable that voluntary associations of citizens should be formed in the several States and districts of the Union, with a view to the collection of statistical knowledge of all kinds. 1 such might be gathered in this way, and embodied for public use in the annual reports of this office. Already numerous agricultural societies and clubs have been formed in different portions of the Union, from whose labors and efforts this office has derived much assistance. Their efficiency and usefulness would be increased in proportion to their numbers, and the judgment and energy with which they should pursue the purposes for which they may be instituted. The great hall of the Patent Office, known as the national gallery, was designed for the exhibition of works of art, new and curious machines, unpatented as well as patented, and specimens of the manufactured fabrics and articles of this country. At present this design is partially frustrated, by the occupation of the room as a place of deposit e for the valuable and interesting specimens of natural history brought home by the exploring expedition. It is not recommended, nor desired, that those specimens should be removed. In the contrary, it is believed to be best that they should remain in the Patent Office, as they increase the interest of visitors to this noble institution of our government, and export admiration from those coming from foreign countries. By the latter, the Patent Office, with its rich and varied contents, is justly deemed an honor to the republic. But, if Congress should deem it expedient to increase the Patent Office building, by erecting one or both of the wings contemplated in the original plan, there would be sufficient room for the exhibition of valuable specimens of manufactured fabrics and mechanical ingenuity. And I cannot doubt that the ample room which would be provided for them would be speedily filled by the choicest specimens of the skill of our ingenious artisans. Such a collection would be as honorable to the nation, as it would be creditable to those who produced them. All which is respectfully submitted. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Hon. John W. Davis, speaker of the House of Representatives. 19. Statement of receipts for patents, caveats, disclaimers, improvements, and certified copies, in 1845.

If an early appropriation could be obtained for the execution of either or both of these wings, one or both could be put under roof before the working season closed. Respectfully submitted ROBERT Of Lls, Architect. On. Of. Burke, Commissioner of Patents, a. 25. Report of Charles G. Age, examiner, *a* c. Patent Office Of, January, 1846. Of  R: In conformity with your requisitions, I have the honor therewith to submit the following notice of inventions patented during the past year. Since the commencement of the year 1845, the whole number of applications presented to the office is 1246. Of these, 7 29 have been apportioned to me for examination; 291 of the 7 29 have been patented; the remainder have either been rejected or are still pending, waiting final examination. The subjects of applications for patents are comprised under 22 general classes or divisions; each of these comprehending a number of subdivisions, and in some cases more than 20. Twelve of the above classes are assigned to me for examination, and are as follows, viz 1st. Agriculture, including instruments and operations 2d. Chemical processes, manufactures and compounds, including medicines, dying, color making, dis tilling, soap and candle making, mortars, cement, &c 3d. Calorific, comprising lamps, fireplaces, stoves, grates, furnaces for heating buildings, cooking apparatus, preparations for fuel, &c 4th. Mathematical, philosophical, and optical instruments, clocks, chronometers, &c 5th. Hydraulics and pneumatics, including water wheels, wind mills, and other implements operated on by air or water, or employed in the raising and delivery of fluids 6th. Never, screw, and other mechanical powers, as applied to pressing, raising, and moving weights 7th. Tone and clay manufactures, including machines for pottery, glass making, brick making, dressing and preparing stone, cement, or other building materials 8th. Weather, including fanning and dressing, manufacture of boots, shoes, saddle by, harness, &c 9th. Household furniture, machines and implements for domestic purposes, including washing machines and cracker machines, feather dressing, &c 10th. Arts, (polite) fine and ornamental, including music, painting, sculpture, engraving, books, printing, binding, jewel by, &c 11th. Surgical and medical instruments, including trusses, dental instruments, bathing apparatus, &c 12th. Hearing apparel, articles for the toilet, &c, including instruments for manufacturing. Calori Of C. Number of applications, 120.-Number of patents granted, 62. Considering the large proportions of applications under this head, the novelty of invention presented has been less, perhaps, than of any other class. The subject, one would suppose, has been nearly exhausted; and it is probable that but few advances of intrinsic value will be made, until some fortunate inventor shall strike out a new path for exploration. The discovery of new sources of heat and light must be made to give stimulus to inventive effort in behalf of this now overburdened class of inventions. Thus, improvements in lamps were nearly at a stand, until the camphine, or pine oil, or land, or some other combustible material, was substituted for oil; and, as each of these sources of light required distinct and peculiar contrivances to render them applicable, so from each was opened up a new track for investigation, experiment, and invention. I tis by such process that the field of invention is ever widening, and will ever widen till the limits of time shall fix its boundary. Since the establishment of the Patent Office there have been issued 800 patents for stoves, and 130 for improvements in lamps. Doubtless there have not been as many distinct claims to novel inventions, as patents granted; for, prior to the recent organization of the office, patents were frequently granted more than once for the same inventions. But, notwithstanding the swollen list of patented stoves, genius has been fruit fully exercised during the past year upon this useful article, in some cases producing inventions which, from their excessive complication, bore full title to novelty and originality, and, in others, where the novelty was scarcely perceptible at first sight, from the simplicity of the invention, but in which the real merits of economy were conspicuous. To use a paradoxical phrase, it is very easy to invent a stove which will save all the fuel; but to combine simplicity of construction, ease of management, and economy of fuel, is no easy task. A stove of this last description has been invented during the last year, in which, by the simple position of what is termed a reverberating plate, much that is desirable has been presented in a single and cheap stove. Such has been done in the line of cooking stoves and ranges; and all the varieties of cooking may now be performed simultaneously, and with a single fire, and small expenditure of fuel. The question has been raised by some, and not without merit, as to the real economy of protecting an almost endless variety of cooking and other stoves for the trial of some half dozen, before one can be found suitable for the purpose, and the destruction, in a few years, of the best articles of the kind, (that is, in many cases where the want of provision for the unequal expansion of the plates cracks and spoils the whole fabric in a short time has led some to the conclusion that the economy of the stove is spacious and deceptive, and that the fireplace is, after all, the most profitable in the end. The vast number of rival stoves presented to the public does, indeed, often place one in such a dilemma; but, on the whole, it is desirable at least that those capable of judging in such matters for themselves should have, an extensive range for selection. Under this class has been patented a simple and valuable improvement in the hatters kettle, which gives a large heating surface to the kettle, pro longing the draught and saving much heat, by making the smoke blue to serve, by a simple contrivance, the purpose also of the stoke blue. In air heating stoves, furnaces, and other apparatus for warming buildings, considerable improvement has been made; but, in general, the inventions have not been characterized by much originality of device or principle. In hot air furnaces for warming dwelling houses and other buildings, an improvement has been patented which obviates a great inconvemeuce existing in most fixtures of this kind. The furnaces, to be
27kept in order, must be taken down and cleaned once, and frequently twice, every year; which operation, from the great weight of the parts, and difficulty of re setting, is one of great trouble and expense. The blue passages become lined with soot, which not only obstructs the draught, but intercepts the heat. In the improvement spoken of, the blue passages have external openings passing through the walls of the arch or hot air chamber, and surmounted with a cap or door. By removing these caps the flies are accessible throughout; and thus, if the furnace be properly jointed when first set, there is no necessity of afterwards disturbing the flies. Sampson invention of some utility, as applied to lamps, has been patented, affording a ready means of controlling the height of the flame without raising or lowering the wick, and giving in fact a greater amount of available light, without increasing the consumption of the oil. It consists in the application of a register valve to the drip cup of Org and lamps, more particularly those known as the solar lamp. In most of the lamps of this description, the holes admitting the interior draught, placed usually around the drip cup, have been made of sufficient size to admit air enough to supply oxygen for the perfect combustion of all the carbon at the ordinary height of the wick. If the draught be lessened by contracting the size of the holes, the effect will be to raise the flame higher above the wick, causing a less perfect combustion of the carbon. But it may be so regulated in this particular that all the carbon may be consumed, though at a considerable height above the wick; and the effect of such extension or dilatation of the flame is to extend the radiating surface, and thus the real luminous effect in an apartment is enhanced, as may be readily proved by the ordinary photometric tests. As the wick is not raised in this case, and the amount of combustion is the same as with a greater draught and lower flame, it follows that the saving is real; and the invention further recommends itself from the facility it affords of regulating the light without the necessity of handling a highly heated part of the lamp. Considerable progress has been made in the camp line or pine oil lamps, as regards their cheapness and safety the highly combustible material being so remote from the burning point as to be kept cool, and thus obviating all danger from explosion, which was of frequent occurrence before the improvement was introduced. The only danger that can now arise from the use of such lamps is from fracture and extensive spilling in contact with flame. This lamp possesses one important advantage, viz : that of giving a white light, more nearly approaching the light of day than that derived from any other lamp. A pale straw color is distinguish able by the camp line light, which is not the case with oil, land, or gas light. It has its drawbacks in the occasional derangements of the wick or button, by which a copious sooty deposit e forms, covering and soiling furniture, dress, &c; in the unpleasant odor of turpentine pe reading the apartment, and the slight chance of danger from fire. I t, however, at the present high price of the liquid, is cheaper than oil. It may be well to remark, that the terms camp line and pine oil are synonymous, both preparations being highly rectified oil of turpentine. The introduction of private gas establishments, for the purpose of illumination, has been successfully made during the past year in several parts of our country; and, although careful and extensive experiments in England, made upon this subject, have resulted in placing attempts to substitute oil and resin for coal, in 28 the production of gas, as one of the for lies* of ignorant and hasty speculators, yet the perseverance of humble experimenters in our own country has resulted in the adoption of both these substances, under peculiar circumstances, as economical sources of carbureted hydrogen gas. In the western country, where land is so abundant and cheap, the refuse fats of the kitchen alone have been found sufficient to supply large establishments with oil gas. One of the peculiarities in the process there adopted is the introduction of a small proportion of atmospheric air along with the gas, which has been secured by letters patent. One of our light houses has for some time been lighted by gas from resin, and, I believe, with approbation. The process which has been patented is about to be adopted in one of the largest hotels in this city the preparations there for being nearly complete. In no one branch of domestic economy has greater progress been made than in the construction of lamps, as regards their price. Org and or solar lamps, adapted to the burning of land or oil, but more especially designed for land, are now afforded for the very low price of two and a half and three dollars. For this sum a handsome table lamp, with a round glass globular shade, a glass chimney, and one dozen wicks, may be purchased at retail. The benefits to the public, arising out of the act authorizing the grant of letters patent for designs, have been specially evident in works belonging to the above class. The protection of new and ornamental devices in stove castings has enabled the manufacturer to go to considerable expense in preparing ornamental patterns for his stoves and parlour grates, and at the same time to afford them at a very moderate price. The consequence has been, that we are supplied with a rich variety of cheap ornamental iron work; and our furnace men, if they have not already, will soon rival the beautiful Berlin castings. Agriculture. Number of applications, 133.-Number of patents granted, 48. But little novelty has been presented to the office in the way of agricultural implements; and, although the subject is one of fast growing interest and value, and has received some rich contributions from chemists and philosophers, yet those branches usually coming before the office have not received as many accessions as in former years. Some improvements have been made in ploughs, particularly wheel ploughs; several new devices have been patented, and one new and apparently valuable invention for adapting the set and draught of the plough in a ready manner, so as to take more or less land, at pleasure. The bee hive has been the subject of much attention; many of the hives presented exhibiting only changes of form, without the attainment of any new principle in bee management. It is believed that no effectual means have yet been discovered of preventing the ravages of the bee moth, independent of constant personal attention; although several of the inventions patented for this purpose will doubtless, to a considerable ex: .a. - 'did 127) : .a. L* See Lies Dictionary of Its, &c. 29 tent, diminish the evil. In spite of all the artifices to decay the moth into traps and to deposit e its eggs where the g rub will be so remote from the entrance to the hive as to perish in the attempt to reach the comb, this insect retains enough of its instinct to enter as it is wont, with the bee, and deposit e its eggs directly in the comb, even in the uppermost part of the hive. As the moth exists only at certain seasons, and does its work only at night, it follows that the entire enclosure of the hive at night will exclude the enemy with certainty. For this purpose the hives are sometimes arranged under a tightly jointed house, provided with ventilated doors of wire gauze, which are shut regularly at night and opened early in the morning. The objections to this plan are, the expense of the fixture, and the unfailing attention required to open and close the doors; for a single act of neglect in this duty might result in the destruction of the hives. A curious invention has been patented, worthy of mention in this connection. The patent was granted for combining a hen root in such manner with the door of the hive that the weight of the fowls going to root would operate, through the medium of levers and pulley, to close the door of the hive, and the door opened by reverse action in the morning when the fowls leave the root. I f, as the inventor asserts, he can depend upon a certain number of his fowls retiring and rising with the bees, it will prove a valuable labor saving invention. Hydrauli   Of. Number of applications, 34.-Number of patents granted, 17. This class, which has been apportioned to me for examination during only a part of the past year, has embraced a large number of applications, particularly in the subdivision of water wheels. As usual, they have exhibited much variety, but in which it has been difficult to detect much variety or novelty of principle. Changes and contortions in the forms of the buckets have been the leading features, although several of them have displayed novelty and peculiar fitness for certain situations and kinds of work. The ancient and too long neglected water ram has, during the past year, been revived under new phases, and, it is believed, with good success. The spoon ram has long been known that is, a ram in which the descent of water in the long leg of the spoon has been made to operate in raising, or rather delivering water above its level. But, so far as known, it has been a philosophical toy, and unavailable for practical purposes. By the intervention of a ratified air chamber, as it is called, in conjunction with the momentum of the descending water in the long leg, the syphon ram has been made an attainment of much practical value, and possesses the advantage of being more simple, cheaper, and less liable to derangements, than many of the devices employed to raise water above the level of its source. In this instrument the water employed to operate the ram is the same as that which it delivers above the source; but another patent has been granted for a double ram, in which the force of a running stream or branch of water has been employed to raise spring water to any desired height. In this ingenious instrument the two kinds of water com mingle to a certain extent, but not in such a manner as to vitiated the spring water in the slightest degree 30. Stone And Clay, &c. Number of applications, 16.-Number of patents granted, 9. I inventive genius has been but little directed to this branch of art in this country for several years past, while it has received much attention abroad. It has been asserted, in some public journals, that the wonderful and lost process of Sagatto for petrifying animal substances has been rediscovered in this country, and a patent granted. To application has been made to the office for letters patent for such an invention. It is asserted that the process has been a third time discovered in I talk, it having been twice made and perished with the authors. A patent has been granted for an improved mystic, which cannot be better described than in the words of the patentee: "that I claim for my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is, the substitution of red sandstone and clay, reduced to a powder in their natural state, or argil, silex, and the oxide of iron, for the stone of Vessel or Pal du Gravers, or other assimilated materials, in combination with the mineral tar of Vessel, or with any other bit omens used in the formations of mastics.” 

WEARING Apparel. 
Number of applications, 24.-Number of patents granted, 7. 
A large number of applications have been made for patents for systems of cutting garments, and rejected, as not presenting appropriate subjects for letters patent. The mere selection of points of ad measurement, or the multiplication of such points, usually constituting tailors' measures, have not been considered as inventions within the meaning of the law. An important invention has been made in the manufacture of buttons, which much facilitates the construction, and greatly improves the button for wear and use. The claim of the patentee is sufficiently descriptive of the character of the invention. "that I claim, is my improvement in the modes usually adopted for making the eye let holes or thread passages of buttons, composed of two circular plates of metal, the one of said pieces being confined to the other, as above described; the said improvement consisting in punching holes through the plates (so as to leave a but projecting on one side of the plate from each hole) before they are applied and connected to each other, and (in combination with) applying the said holes of one plate to those of the other in such manner that their burned projecting edges may be in direct contact, and the counter sunk portion of each of the holes of the plate (there being the same number of holes in each plate) be opposite to that of the corresponding hole of the other plate, thereby forming eye lets or passages counter sunk on both sides of the button; by which mode of constructing, the above wear of the threads which secure the buttons, when sewed to, the cloth or other material, is, to a 'very great degree, obviated.'

HOUSEHOLD Furniture. 
Number of applications, 31.-Number of patents granted, 14. 
But few improvements of a patent able nature appear to have been made in this branch of domestic economy. 1 very simple and useful invention for a revolving pilot chair, or stool, has been patented, which is designed chiefly for the use of schools. It answers also for other purposes, and its construction is of such a character as to render it very economical and dura be. In pilot chairs, such as piano stools, &c, hitherto the point of suspension, or centre of motion, has been in the centre of the seat of the chair, and liable to be overturned with the sister. In the new chair this pilot is eccentric, and is ascertained by observation and calculation with reference to the centre of gravity of the person, securing greater firmness to the sister. Castors very many attempts have been made to obviate the difficulties attendant upon the use of castors for furniture, and many of the contrivances have been so complicated and expensive as to preclude their general introduction. The defects are chiefly friction upon the pilot of the castor preventing freedom of motion, a want of strength in the parts sustaining the greatest pressure, and difficulty of repairing when broken. A patent has been re issued for one of these useful articles, which seems to present all the proper requisites, and great simplicity. It is a simplest out castor, with a long spindle or thank inserted in a deep hole in the leg of the chair or bedstead, without fastening; when the chair or bedstead is raised from the floor, the castor, of course, drops out; but the advantage of this is obvious, when we consider how many injuries have been inflicted both upon the person and furniture where fixed castors have been attached to heavy articles of furniture, such as bedsteads, by leaving the detached parts of the frame to stand upon two castors, the slightest jar being sufficient to throw them down. The hole in the leg of the chair or other article may be rushed with metal, as circumstances may require. Surgery. Number of applications, 40.-Number of patents granted, 19. The records of the office cannot be taken as a criterion of the progress in this class of inventions, for very many of the most valuable improvements in surgical instruments are of limited use, and are made by those who can afford to give their improvements to the profession for no other compensation than the award of increased reputation. Any unsuccessful applications have been made for patents for medicines professing to be infallible cures for various diseases. Without attempting to discourage the efforts of ingenuity in the healing art, I may be permitted to say that the most vigorous investigation and exercise of your discretion are powers have been directed to the decisions of such applications. A patent has been granted for a substantial improvement in dental instruments, in which the advantages of the old turnkey have been combined with those of the forceps. In the turn key, as before constructed, the hook was to be fixed under the tooth by the insertion of the finger, or by some mechanical contrivance of an unmanageable nature. In this instrument the forceps handles are so combined with the hook of the turn key as that the opening and closing of the handles controls the movements of the hook, and fixes it at the pleasure of the operator, saving the necessity of introducing the finger in the mouth. An artificial nipple has been the subject of letters patent. I to construction is novel, and has evidently been the result of close observation upon the philosophy of nursing. Most of the instruments hitherto used for 3 this purpose have failed, not only from the unfitness of the material used, but from the want of proper attention to their construction. The description of the inventor is as follows: "The artificial nipple, in figure and dimensions, resembles other devices of the kind, being made conical, with the Side end open, the end being shaped so as to press upon without injuring the breast. The small end is closed, with the exception of a minute perforation in the centre. The material around the perforation projects so as to form a tube of about one-eighth of an inch in length, over which is attached, by ligatures of silver wire, a tube of India rubber, about half an inch in length. This last tube is constructed of a flat piece of India rubber, cut square at one end and conical at the other. It is then perforated through its thickness in the direction of its length, so as to leave a slit on its upper end, and the lower end having an opening large enough to fit upon the projecting part of the nipple Another improvement has also been made in the material of this instrument, the nipple being made of the elastic portion of bone, the earthy parts having been removed by chemical process. Patents have been granted for several species of exercising machinery, designed to furnish invalids, who are confined within doors, with regular and pleasing exercise. A few patents have been granted for abdomen supporters and tresses for hernia; and although some of the improvements seem to possess intrinsic merit, yet there does not appear to be much that is strikingly novel in this branch. An improvement has been added to a patent for a galvanic instrument designed to remedy constipation by the stimulating influence of the galvanic fluid upon the rectum. The instrument consists of a tube of silver and zinc, being separated by some non-conducting material. The use of the instrument is affirmed to produce a curative effect in a gradual manner, but with certainty. The improvement consists in the manner of making and breaking the galvanic circuit with ease and rapidity. 

Fine Arts. 
Number of applications, 40.-Number of patents granted, 32. 
An ingenious device in machines for ruling paper has been patented, by which the ruling may be stopped at any desired distance from the edge of the paper, the edge of the paper itself performing the part of a can, operating to raise the pens from the paper at any desired point. The thickness of a sheet of paper is a very slight thing to depend upon for operating machinery, but there is no doubt of the successful operation of the invention, as the model furnished the office, though imperfect, demon started the fact Writing machine very elaborate machine for writing has been patented, evidently the fruits of deep study; and, in view of the complexity of results produced by this contrivance, the construction is exceedingly simple, as well as its operation. The object of the invention is to furnish to those who are unable to write, the means of writing, by sitting before a set of keys, the mere touching of which immediately causes the corresponding later to be written upon a sheet of paper. A set of came, one for each letter, are made to operate upon the pen, so that all the rectilinear and curved movement necessary to make the letters are readily and neatly produced, and in conjunction with these movements the paper or tables upon which the writing is to be made has a horizontal movement for s pacing off the letters, and, at the completion of the line, a vertical movement for s pacing the lines. The model accompanying the application gave evidence of the perfection of the invention, as it made several letters with precision and beauty 
Inkstands. A variety of inkstands have been patented during the year, and several ingenious, useful, and ornamental kinds of inkstands have come into use, for which we are indebted to foreign countries. The object to be attained in most of them is to protect the ink from evaporation, and at the same time render it easily accessible. 
Type casting. The art of type casting has within a few years past been brought to great perfection; and under a patent granted in the past year, the process has been so expedited as to leave but little to be desired in this branch of art. The inventor states in the preamble of his description that he has endeavored, in the construction of his machine, to imitate as nearly as possible, by mechanical means, the process of type casting as usually performed by hand. 
Type setting. Any attempts have hitherto been made, without success, to print from types arranged upon a cylinder, the failure growing chiefly out of the difficulty of arranging the types with regularity, and retaining them firmly in position. In an invention for this purpose, for which a patent has been granted, the inventor professes to have remedied the above difficulties, and made printing practicable by this desirable method. The types (of uniform size) are of a pyramid al form, to adapt them to their position around the cylinder, and are held firmly together by means of rules or strips of metal fitting into recesses made in the types for this purpose.
Electrotyping types. A patent has been granted for an improvement in forming types by the electro type process, which offers some facilities, although it would appear, in view of the rapidity and precision with which type casting is performed, and the recent improvements in stereotyped casting, that the electro tying process cannot compete with them in point of economy. 
Anastatic printing. Among the notable inventions of the last year is one for printing from, or copying, all kinds of printed work, producing perfect face s implies of old works, and multiplying copies indefinitely. Such an invention cannot fail to excite deep and general interest, and even some alarm, when it is announced that an engraved bank note maybe copied with perfect fidelity by the anastatic process. Should this be the case which is somewhat doubtful, there is not so much to be feared in relation to forgeries as may at first sight be anticipated. Forgeries will be made in spite of all obstacles, and experience has shown that the amount of crime of this nature does not increase in proportion to facilities afforded by these so basely prostituted discoveries in science. For every advantage borrowed or stolen by the forger from the open hand of science, she held in her other hand the checks for villainy the guarantees of public protection. 
For written notes and signatures a test paper is offered, with which* Since the above was written, an entire letter, written by the machine, has been kindly furnished, of which the annexed engraving is a face smile 334 neither chemical nor mechanical devices for era sure can temper. For printed notes, she offers materials which will counteract the attempts tore print by anastatic or any other process. As such facilities for reproduction and counterfeiting increase, they are met with corresponding increase of vigilance, and the chance of detection is not diminished. The extraordinary art of anastatic printing has been patented in this country to foreigners, and, as far as ascertained, has been practiced with success in the city of London. The patent was granted for the process as hereafter given, and not, of course, for the result or principle. The credit of the discovery, and of the first successful production of copies from an engraving or other printed work, belongs to one of our own countrymen, Mr. Joseph Dixon, now of Cystic, Connecticut; and, according to the most creditable testimony, his results are far more perfect than any hitherto attained by others* I Mr. Dixon has been for many years engaged in perfecting his art, and I can testify from personal knowledge of his success in this invention many years ago. But, as the office was not in possession of the details of his process, no reference could be made to him, and the patent was accordingly granted as above stated. It is possible that the two inventors have aimed at similar results by entirely different means but be that as it may, it is but justice to a real inventor, and the well-earned reputation of our country in the promotion of the useful arts, that this mention should be made, and credit given where credit is so evidently due. The process of anastatic printing is substantially as given in the following description, viz: "We lay the written or printed side on a clean piece of blotting paper, and wet the upper side equally by means of a soft brush, with a mixture of one part of nitric acid of 1.362 specific gravity, and eight parts of water by weight. To soon as the water has completely soaked through the o original' we lay it between sheets of blotting paper, and remove the excess of dilute acid by gentle pressure, and if the acid has equally penetrated the ' original' we lay is written surface on the cleaned metallic surface, place double blotting paper over it, and pass it under considerable rolling pressure, which causes the acid to attack the metal where un protected by the writing, drawing, or printing, &c, on the original, and produce what we call a negative etching. 
Printed books of ten years generally require about 24 hours, and those of thirty to forty years, some days; but, after that age, no material difference appears to have taken place in the chemical condition of the printing ink. When we consider that the originals have been sufficiently acted on by the acid, we remove the cover and add water, so as to reduce the strength of the acid contained in each sheet to such a degree as that it shall not act strongly or disagreeably on the tongue when brought into contact. We now lay the original between sheets of clean blotting paper, and subject them to slight pressure to remove superfluous moisture we then lay it on the polished metallic surface as before described, and subject it too much greater rolling pressure than recent originals. If saving of time is an object, and when the originals have been very much indurated and dried, as in engravings, &c, we proceed by washing over the back of the original to be transferred with a solution of caustic potash* Mr. Dixons discovery is mentioned in a work entitled " Science applied to Domestic and Mechanic Arts" by Rev. Alonzo Other, published in 1841; and in the same work is given a specimen of Mr. Dixons printing. -his work was brought to notice after the completion of asks e port, a. 35 impure rain water, or" distilled water, of about 1.014 specific gravity, which we prefer to carbonate of potash, as that substance would evolve gas in the next process; and when the original is fully soaked, we prepare a saturated solution of tartar in acid in water, in a shallow fiat basin, or on a sheet of glass with a wax border to form tank sides; we then place the original, which has been soaked in caustic potash, in this solution, with the face to be transferred uppermost, and a reaction takes place between the tartar in acid and potash in the paper, forming crystals of cream of tartar, which appear over the whole surface, and are sparingly so ruble in water, leaving only those parts which are protected with printing ink uncovered with crystals. We next roll a hard lithographic in king roller, charged with a small portion of ink, over its wet surface several times, and in several directions, until the black lines become revived by a new coat of ink, leaving the blank part of the paper covered with crystals almost untouched. We next remove the superfluous ink by a second application of a hard roller, un charged with ink, and dissolve the crystals of cream of tartar by immersing the paper for some hours in dilute nitric acid, twenty parts water by one part acid of 1.362 specific gravity by weight after which it is partially dried in blotting paper placed on the metallic surface, 'and subjected to slight pressure as before" We remove the ' originals' from the plate after pressure, and wash the plate over in all directions with very thick gun water, by means of a sponge, and next rub up or fill in the plate with a linen rag or sponge charged with a mixture of lithographic printing ink and gum water, wherever it has been t protected from the action of the acids, which operation of charging the plate constantly follows the continuous washing with gum, as it is usual for lithographic printers to charge their 'stones; and if the transfer has been not quite complete, or is from old work, this process should be repeated at intervals of one hour or more" What we claim is' First, the herein described process whereby we transfer by means of treating the ' originals' with acids of strength varying with the induration of the ink, and so pressing out the acid as to cause an itching of the blank spaces, and a reversed impression of the original (where protected from the action of the acid) or metallic surface Second, the process of reviving the printing ink on originals, by first acting on them with caustic potash, or its carbonate, and tartar in acid, so as to form cream of tartar in the paper, which prevents the adherence of fresh ink in the blank spaces, while the old ink is left in a state to take up an additional quantity from a roller pressed over it Third, the herein described process of preventing the adhesion of printing ink, during the operation of printing, to any part of the plates, which are required to remain blank, by acting upon such blank surfaces with acid preparations of phosphorus west paper for notes, ache invention patented under this caution, and before alluded to, consists of a colored or lest sheet of paper, covered with a white sheet or surface, or a delicate colored sheet on one or both sides. " The object is to protect the test or colored sheet from being tempered with by any chemical agents employed to obliterate writings, and to prevent the using of any sharp instrument or rubbers for scraping or era sing writings, as, should any chemical agent be employed, the test or colored sheet would be so changed as to alter conspicuously the former appearance of the paper, and the white or delicate sheet or sheets, surface or surface should likewise be imbued with a stain or color produced by the action of those chemical agents on, and thence from the color of, the test sheet; the. result, therefore, would destroy the appearance of both videlicet, the outer white or delicate colored sheet or sheets, surface or surfaces, and the test or colored sheet. This being done, it would be impossible to make the said safety and protective paper assume its original appearance, for, if you attempted to whiten or renew the delicate color of the outer sheet or sheets, surface or surfaces, you would thereby completely destroy the appearance of the test or colored sheet; and, if you attempted to color the test sheet, you would likewise produce a darker color on the white or delicate outer sheet or sheets, surface or surfaces. The one is a protection to the other. As to the application of any sharp instrument or rubber, for scraping or era sing writing, being employed, the effect producedw9ouldbe such that, when, applied sufficiently to obliterate either a figure or word, the test or colored sheet would appear conspicuous, and the part disfigured could not be re nova ted; consequently the obliteration would always be detected. "that I claim as my invention is the above described improvement, or manufacture, or combination of a colored sheet of test paper, and one or more plain white, or lighter, or darker, or different colored sheets, or surfaces of paper, applied to one or both sides of the test sheet substantially as above specified, Printers' inrkAn important improvement has been patented for printers' ink, which consists chiefly in mixing coalaphane, one of the products of the destructive distillation ,of coal, with the materials known as resins, go !n resins, or bit omens, and with lamp black, or black in Suitable proportions :the advantages claimed are cheapness, durability, and difficulty of erosion. The ink is freed from empyreumatic odor, and, from the specimens of printing presented, must answer well Musical instrument Since the grant of a patent, in 1844, for what was de nominated the I Coli an attachment, or the combination of the pianoDforte and accord on, genius has been upon the stretch to improve upon this combination; and the piano for te and accord on, in their separate uses, have been variously modified and improved. Two patents have been granted for modes of tuning the accord on reeds. The tuning of the reed is a delicate operation, and is effected by filing off an exceeding small portion at a time, until it vibrated to the proper pitch. By the methods now adopted, the tuning is effected by merely increasing or diminishing the length of the spring by means of sliding rests. In one of the inventions the claim is nm a& to "tuning reeds by means of move able clamps, which grip e the reeds and embrace a part of the plate to which the reeds are attached, and admit of sliding or moving to increase or decrease the vibrating part of the reed, and thus regulate the tone The claim in the other is, to "confining the thin metallic reeds in a sliding plate, and ,securing the reed and sliding plate in a case, so that the pitch of the reed may be raised or lowered by the turning of a screw attached to, the sliding plate. Pianofortesapatent has been granted for attaching a swell to the piano, fro the .purpose of giving the crescent do and diminuendo tones, and also, in the language of the inventor, to furnish the explosive tones. The sounding part of the instrument is enclosed in a tight case, provided withDoec No. 140.37shutters, which, by the action of a pedal, are opened gradually to produce the swell, and suddenly to produce the explosive tones. In the early part of the year a patent was granted for a mode of producing harmony tones upon the piano by connecting with a pedal an apparatus which made slight pressure upon the middle of the strings, in imitation of the delicate touch of the finger which produces these exquisite tones upon the violin and other. stringed instruments, thus producing the harmony c octavos. Pressure upon other nod al points of the strings would of course produce other harmony c tones. ,A patent has also been granted for a mode of striking the octavos upon the piano without the necessity of stretching the fingers after the usual mode. The improvement is to produce, by striking upon one key, the effect that usually results from striking it and the eighth or any particular key beyond it, in order that those persons who find it difficult to reach an octavo upon the series of keys may easily produce the same result by striking one single key. The inventors give the following description: " Our invention is not intended to be limited to the striking of octavos, as it will be evident that a piano for te can be readily arranged so that the effects of any two keys of the series may be similarly produced. In order to illustrate the nature of our invention, we will suppose that the first key hammer of the bass operates upon one, two, or more strings, a a, in the usual manner. We will further suppose that the strings b b are those belonging to the other extremity of the oct ave, or that they are sounded by means of the hammer of the eighth key on the right of that first mentioned. In order to accomplish this, it is well known the little finger of one hand must be pressed on one key, and the thumb on the other, the operation requiring a considerable and often very inconvenient stretching of the hand being, besides, attended with other difficulties and dangers well known topianists." In order to effect the two sounds by means of one key, we arrange by the side of the wire or string a, and at a little distance from it, another or supplementary string or wire, which is carried out and sustained over a supplementary bridge, arranged and constructed in such manner as to permit the passage and vibration of the string over it without contact therewith, the said bridge having suitable contrivances applied to it for the purpose of sustaining the supplementary string at the same level with the strings a a' This supplementary string is of the same length, or is tuned so as to emit the same sound, or as near the same as may be desired, as that of the strings b b, or at the other extremity of the oct ave. The hammer is made wide enough to strike at the same time upon the strings a a and the supplementary string, so that when its key is struck, a double sound, corresponding with those of the two extremes of the oct ave, is produced' Having thus set forth our invention, we shall claim one or more supplementary strings, damper, and bridge, (or other analogous contrivance for supporting the strings and checking their vibration as above set forth in combination with the string a, or strings a a, of a note, and struck by the same hammer substantially in the manner above specified: He also claim the making the pad of the hammer head of different degrees Of elasticity, or harder in that part of it strictly beneath, and which restsAiupon the supplementary string, than it is in the part or parts beneath, and 3 which strike the other strings, a a, the same being for the purpose aboveexplainedAnother improvement of a distinct character, but to attain the same end, has been patented; and although it renders the work of the piano somewhat complicated, yet it must afford much facility in many passages. Any number of keys or hammers are connected together by couplinglevdrs ; so that the striking of any one key shall, by means of the couplinglever, strike the note of its oct ave, and the coup long is so arranged that the parts striking the octavos are thrown out of action at pleasure. The inventor does not intend to limit the application of his invention to the production of octavos, but to adapt it to any other series of notes, as taste may require. A patent has been granted for a mode of making k eyed bugles of tortoise shell, In this ingenious and beautiful device the brilliant tone of the bugle is preserved, while the instrument is made extremely light; and from the elasticity of the material, it is not subject to deter i oration of tone from indentations. The instrument is made in five parts, which are welded together in an ingenious and perfect manner. Phi Losophi Cal I Nstruments. ;number of applications, 15.--Number of patents granted, 6.

Now if the cord or chain that is usually wound on the barrel be attached directly to the extremity of this spring, it would draw the said cord or chain with more force, andunnwind a greater quantity of it from the barrel at one time than another, o that the movement of the clock would never be regular: r 'to correct this irregularity of the spring, I have contrived to have the end of the spring applied to a current lever of the second order, to which the q cold or chain is connected, which lever is continually increasing in length and power in the same ratio that the force of the spring decreases or becomes weaker as it extends itself; thus maintaining the action of the spring regularly and equally, which is the great desideratum in the construction of clocks with plain springs, instead of the heretofore used number some and expensive weights patent has been granted for an improvement in the balance wheel of clocks, consisting in the "employment of a suspension piece which sustain the lower sides of the harbor; on which the balance wheel is placed in such manner as to take off the weight of the balance wheel and its harbor from the, pilots thereof. ' ; . In improvement in the chronometer balance has been the subject of letters patent. The balance is made. as usual, of two lamina of different metal si mounted on the staff by the cross arms in the mode usually adopted; but the rim of. the balance is made with the arm so placed relatively with the divisions in the rim, that the spaces between the centres of the arm, from the junction with the rim to the extremities formed by each. 39 division in the rim, is as near as possible an arc, forming a quarter of a circle, instead of being, as heretofore made, nearly or quite an entire half circle. Leather. Number of applications, 30.-Number of patents granted, 21. But little of intrinsic novelty or merit has been developed under this head. A patent has been granted for a new mode of preparing skins previous to fanning, with a view to hasten the process; the hide is perforated by very fine steel points, either upon the flesh or grained side, the steel points being very close, so as effectually to pierce the hide, and thus facilitate the introduction of the fanning material. The inventor intends to make this perforation by percussion or pressure. The inventor asserts that the puncturing of the leather does not materially affect its strength, nor make it more per me able to water. Caoutchouc. Number of applications, 14.-Number of patents granted, 10. The rapid progress now making in the art of preparing and applying  india rubber, the large number of applications made for patents under this head, have rendered it necessary, in the apportionment of subjects for examination, to constitute a distinct class, under the head of caoutchouc. Some improvement has been made in dive sting the rubber fabric of sulphur, but most of the articles exposed for sale have still a strong odor of sulphur, which is extremely tenacious, adhering for a long time to the fingers, after even a slight handling; and, where the articles are worn, the sulphur escaping tar wishes every article of silver carried about the person. The stirred or corrupted I india rubber fabrics, of which suspendeds are now so extensively made, is an article of much importance, and has been applied to a great variety of useful purposes. In the report of last year a brief description was given of the stirring process. A patent has been granted for an improvement in the stirring process, which will be best understood from the description of the inventor. Stirred orcorrugated I india rubber fabrics, which consist of strips or threads of I india rubber laid between two pieces of cloth of any kind, have been heretofore made by passing the threads or strips of I india rubber, in a stretched state and between two pieces of cloth, (which have the surfaces which come together, and embrace the strips of I india rubber, prepared with I india rubber cement) between two rollers covered with some elastic st instance, to give the requisite pressure, and cause the prepared surfaces of the pieces of cloth to adhere to the strips or threads of I india rubber and to each other. His mode of operation, although i a great and valuable improvement in the arts, makes an imperfect fabric, with the edges of the ribs formed by the strips or threads of I india rubber of an irregular form and rugged, and with the surfaces of the two pieces of cloth imperfectly connected between the strips of I india rubber. But my improvements remedy these defects; and they consist, first, in making the rollers between, which the fabric is formed of metal or other hard substance, with their surfaces grooved in the direction of their periphery, to correspond with the number and size of the I india rubber strips and the spaces between them, the strips 40 passing in the grooves, and the two pieces of cloth being pressed together between them by the ridges, and the grooves being of such depth as to insure sufficient pressure to cause the pieces of cloth to adhere to the strips of  india rubber" What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the method of uniting the various parts in making stirred or corrugatedI      india rubber fabrics, by passing the cloth and strips of I india rubber between press re rollers, one or both of which is grooved to receive the strips of  india rubber, and make pressure on the cloth between the strips. And I also claim connecting the driving feed roller with the hearing which drives it, by means of a hatchet, to admit of turning it back to stretch the strips of I india rubber. when this is combined with pressure rollers, thepripheries of which move with greater velocity than that of the feedrollersCutting I india rubber into threads or strips his operation, which is one of the most important preparatory to the operation of stirring, has been usually performed by cutting a long sheet of prepared rubber into narrow strips, by means of a series of revolving parallel knives. The cutting cannot be made in a suitable manner unless the knives are constantly wetted by the dripping of water. A patent has been granted for a new mode of cutting by means of a series or gang of knives, having a rapid or vibratory movement, and carried over the sheet of rubber, which is passed over a smooth roller of metal or of wood, the knives being kept continually wet with the dripping of water Another improvement in the cutting machines has been patented, presenting a novel feature. In the usual mode of cutting, the knives, which are of thin circular plates, are arranged upon a shaft parallel to each other, having a plate of metal of the desired thickness between them to keep them the proper distance apart, and the whole are tightly screwed up together by a nut at one end. An important improvement has been made in the machine for cutting  india rubber into threads, and secured by letters patent. The cutting knives have usually been screwed up tightly upon the shaft, and their cutting edges thin and sharp. In the improvement mentioned there are two sets of disks, with their edges of the thickness of the strips of I india rubber to be cut, and these two sets, revolving in opposite directions, perform the cutting. A peculiarity of this invention consists in not having nuts or disks between the knives to regulate their distances, the disks or knives themselves performing that function ; and thus, as the cutting edges of the k rives wear away, they accommodate themselves to the proper distances. Several patents have also been granted for inventions for new fabrics of  india rubber. One consists in impregnating the I india rubber, or body of the cloth, with every, sand, or other suitable grit, or with filings of iron, or other metals, or with other hard substances, thereby making a cloth or fabric firm and solid, and suitable for sheathing vessels, for the covering of floors as carpeting, for the soles of shoes, and a variety of other uses. Another is for imparting additional strength, solidity, and durability to  india rubber fabrics; by combining with it the s hearings, clippings, trappings of wool, cotton, silk, hair, fur, or any fibrous substance. Thefabrics made in this ,way are firm, solid, having a smooth surface resembling leather. 
41Another patent has been granted for combining stocking knit fabric with sheets of I india rubber, the rubber being cemented either between two layers of the knit fabric, or in any other way as to form an elastic fabric. There are many other applications of the rubber fabrics, such as to boats life preservers, &c, which being special in their character, will be considered under their respective classes. Some very beautiful fabrics have been produced in this country by weaving cotton, silk, or other fibrous materials, with threads of I india rubber under tension. It is believed that this invention has been really made in this country, by an individual who had no knowledge of what had been done before him, although it had been patented in England several years before. Chemi  Stry. Number of applications, 48.-Number of patents granted, 40. Salt mnakingAn important improvement has been received by patent in the manufacture of salt, and, judging from the specimen furnished, and its low price, the inventor or discovered will not be long in reaping his reward. The claim of the inventor will convey the whole idea in an intelligible manner' What I claim as my invention, discovery, art, or improvement, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the art or process of separating theimpurities contained in salt water or bring, in its crude state, by adding a sufficient quantity of common salt to the salt water taken from the salt springs, wells, or other source, in its crude state, when properly mixed and dissolved, to bring the bring in the vats or cisterns to immediate sat duration, for the express purpose of precipitating the impure ties and depositing the min the bottom of the vats or cisterns, without the aid of evaporation or of solar or of artificial heat. I do not claim adding sal to salt water for the purpose of concentration, as is frequently done. But I do claim the process above described of separating the impure ties from salt water by the addition of salt thereto, allowing the impure ties sufficient time to settle, land the drawing off for evaporation tillers and refrigerator son improvement in this useful combination has been patented, in which the filter is so combined with the refrigerator that the water, when drawn off from the refrigerator, shall be supplied from the filter, and consume no more ice than is required to cool the quantity of water needed for use. The parts are so arranged that the filtering is upwards, and the direction of the water through the filter may be reversed at pleasure, and thus thoroughly cleanse the filtering materials. A new plan for a refrigerator has been patented, and differs from most refrigerator for keeping meat, &c, in two particulars, viz: the air in the cold apartment is dry, not being in contact with the ice, and the apartment is ventilated by several modes. Usually, in refrigerators, meat and other articles to be preserved become impregnated with must i ness or unpleasant odors, owing to the moisture from the ice and the closeness of the apartment. The ice is placed in an apartment by itself, through which passes a coiled tube communicating with the external air and the apartment in which the provisions are kept. By means cf a f in, fellows, or, other contrivance for circulating air, the air is driven through the coiled tube, becoming cooled in its passage, and enters the apartment for pro, visions in a dry state 42 a. A new oil, which the inventors have de nominated the American oil, has been pit enter, and from the specimen afforded it must answer the purpose of publication in place of the fatty oils. It is obtained by the drydistillation of resin. Oil of a certain character has been before obtained from the destructive distillation of resin, but the inventors claim that they have discovered a new hydra carbon, not before known to chemists. This interesting class of compounds is frequently receiving new contributions, and as slight changes in the processes, even of temperature, result in new combinations of hydrogen and carbon, the presumption is in favor of the discovery. Coloring matter from qnercitronThe patentees of this process have, by a slight modification of the process of separating yellow coloring matter from quercitron bark, introduced a substantial improvement. When gelatin e is added to a dec action of the bark, the tenn in combining with the gelatin leaves the coloring matter precipitated and partly suspended intothe liquid. The coloring matter thus separated is impure and deficient in brilliancy. In the improved process the dec action is made and brought to a certain degree of concentration, and allowed to stand for a sufficient time for the coloring matter to subside, when the supernatant liquid is drawn off and the coloring obtained in a clear and bright form. The process has a twofold bearing. The liquid drawn off is used for fanning, and the coloring is fully extracted and of a superior quality. Coloring matter from spent m adder very considerable saving is effected by an invention for obtaining a good available coloring from spent m adder. To three pounds of washed spent m adder, five gallons of water are added, impregnated with sulphuric acid, so as to raise its strength one degree by the hydrometer. After standing two minutes, the water is drawn off, and five gallons more of water added, with eight ounces of soda dissolved in warm water, for the purpose of neutralising any remaining acid. In this state it is allowed to stand fifteen minutes. The liquor is then filtered off, and the residue dried in a warm and close room; and when pulverized, it is ready for use as m adder is ordinarily used. From the specimens presented to the office, no doubt can be entertained of its value, if the result is certain in all cases, for it makes from that which' is ordinarily thrown away an available article. Concentrated portable jelly Letters patent have been secured for a mode of preparing gelatin e in such manner that a small portion of it added to hot water, and turned into moulds to cool, affords at once a pal a table jelly, with no other labor of preparation. The jelly is brought into a concentrated state by evaporation in va cut, having previously all the condiments necessary for favoring mixed with it; it is then packed in bottles and is ready for use; the whole making of the jelly being simply the dissolving a small portion of the concentrated jelly in hot water, and suffering the whole to cool. Nothing hemp his subject has suddenly become one of much speculation and contention among inventors, and it appears that some important improvements have been developed in the preparation of hemp and flax, particularly in the rotating process. In the old process of water rottingthetime required varied from five to fourteen days according to circumstances in the process of dew rotating, from two to six or eight weeks; and in the process called mixed trotting that is, commencing the rotating in water and completing in the a jr from two to three weeks. Under the recent imDoc.  No. 140.proved processes, the whole process is completed in a day and a half, or two days at farthest. In the old methods the natural temperature of the air or water was relied upon, and of course the process was more or less rapid as the temperature was higher or lower. In the new mode artificial heat is resorted to. The hemp or flax is put into large vats and stepped in warm water, until it is completely macerated; and as soon as it is brought to this macerated condition, the temperature is suddenly raised to the boiling point, which arrests all further rotating. The critical point in hemp rotating is to check the putrefactive process at the proper time ; and where it depends upon the fluctuating temperature of the air, it requires the greatest care and discern men to ascertain when the operation must be checked. A patent has also been granted for some improvements in the modes of watering, handling, and otherwise managing the hemp. Hydrooxygen blowpipeAn important improvement in the compound blow pipe has been patented, the inventor and patentee being well known in our country as the original inventor of this valuable gift to science and the arts. As the specification of claims by the inventor is somewhat descriptive of the character of the invention, and will be given in your report, the details will not be necessary in this place. By the aid of the recent improvements the metallurgist and artisans are furnished with the means of fusing large quantities of platino m and other refractory substances which refuse to yield to the heat of the most powerful furnaces, Composition for the bearings of machinery, c Several inventions in years past have been patented for this application, and have been found to answer a good purpose; but the one before us possesses extraordinary merit as to cheapness and durability. A trial has been made of a box for railroad cars, which, after running forty thousand miles, exhibited no perceptible marks of wear or friction. The attention of the government has already been directed to this invention. Sugarmakingrsome valuable improvements have been secured in this extensive business tending to economized fuel in the process of evaporation. In one of them, the evaporating pans, instead of being heated by steam at a distance from the genera to r, are set directly into the top of the boiler, thus saving much in the construction, and preventing the waste of heat from condensation of the steam. In combination, also, with this device, the boiler is divided into two parts by a partition, in which is placed a controlling valve, by which the temperature can be raised and regulated, as may be required for different stages of the operation. A patent has been granted to a foreigner, whose name has been favorably known for many years as one of the most successful promoters of the art of sugar making, and is identified with the introduction of one of the most valuable improvements ever made in this connection, viz: the clarification of sir ups and sugars by animal charcoal, and also the restoration of the animal charcoal after it has become effete, as it is termed. His present patent is for an improved process of restoring the charcoal, and also for a method of evaporating and condensing by the same apparatus. Series of tubes, conveying steam, are so arranged as to receive the percolating sir up upon their exterior surfaces; and these tubes are connected with the vacuum pans, so that the condensation effected by the evaporation of the sir up is employed to keep up the requisite degree of rarefaction in the vacuum pans 44 a. The past, as well as many former years, has not been without proofs of the inventive powers of the fairer sex. A patent has been granted to a lady for an ingenious device entitled the submarine telescope. The instrument has been put to practical tests, and by its aid the exploration of the bottom of a deep river was made in the most satisfactory manner. The instrument is adapted to a variety of purposes, and will not only be useful for many operations of a directly practical nature, but will by of much interest and value to the man of science and natural ist, in acquainting him with the character, mode of growth, &c, of submarine plants, and a thousand other objects now hidden from his vision. In reviewing the inventions of the past year, the proverb i al genius of our countrymen appears to have fully sustained its title, and, did time allow of the comparative estimates, would be clearly shown to have transcended the efforts of other nations, where science can boast of extensive patronage, and real genius rarely escapes the encouragement of wealth. A single allusion may serve to illustrate. Horses electro magnetic telegraph, one of the most interesting and important inventions of the present day, has, during the past year, been established by the most conclusive practical tests, and, also, by the admission of foreign powers, to be superior in point of economy, facility of transmitting intelligence, and simplicity of construction, to all other known telegraphs. In conclusion, I may remark, that many patents of value, both to the inventors and the public, may have been unnoticed in this brief report, for the want of time, and specially for the reason that the intrinsic worth of inventions and their successful application are not often considered or investigated the business of examination being chiefly confined to the questions of novelty and patent ability. I have therefore endeavored to confine my attention to such of the number as would afford a general idea of the progress made in the several branches of art and science, and of the development of new principles in science and their applications to the arts. Respectfully submitted. Chas. G. Page, Examiner of Patents. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. a. 45. Report of W. P. N. Fitzgerald -of  R: In compliance with your directions, I submit the following report upon the progress of inventions during 'the last year, so far as they have come under my observation in the classes committed to my charge. I should follow tile example of my predecessor, and extend my report to important inventions made in foreign countries; but my duties have been so heavy and pressing during the year, that it has been impossible to give any considerable attention to foreign journals beyond what was requisite in the examination of cases upon which I was called to act. In the first report made by my predecessor, a historical sketch was given of the progress of the arts from their infancy to the high degree of maturity and perfection which then characterized them; together with a concentrated but comprehensive view of their then present condition throughout the world. This report emanated from one of the master minds in the arts, and it would be a work of super derogation to re occupy the field so ably explored by him. A glance at that report, and the one which succeeded it, will satisfy you that it is unnecessary for me to extend my remarks to inventions made prior to the commencement of the year which has just terminated. The classes subject to my examination are 1st. Metallurgy, and the manufacture of metals 2d. Manufacture of fibrous and textile fabrics, and all machinerytherefor3d. Engines operated by steam or other gases 4th. Navigation and marine implements 5th. Civil engineering and architecture 6th. And conveyance, including all kinds of vehicles for travel or for transportation 7th. Hills of all kinds for grinding grain, &c 8th. Machinery for working lumber 9th. Fire arms and implements of war 10th. Miscellaneous11th. Hydraulics and pneumatics. This last mentioned class was transferred to me in September, 1845, having previously been examined by my colleague. Each of the above classes includes a great variety of subjects, differing widely from each other, and requiring numerous subdivisions, which I shall review in their proper order. Before entering upon this duty, however, justice to inventors and to myself requires me to say, that many important inventions, for which patents have been sought during the past year, will necessarily be overlooked, from the fact that, although more examinations have been made than at any other equal period in the history of this office, there are still nearly one hundred applications in my desk upon which I have not be enable to bestow a passing glance. And although there may be inventions among them which will marker as in the progress of those branches of the arts to which they belong, they must, for the present, be passed over in silence, and made the subject of a future report 46 a. Metallurgy And The Manufacture Of Metals. But little has been developed during the past year before this office, connected with the art of separating the metals from those impure ties with which they are mingled or combined in the mine. Old. This metal, which is found merely mixed :with impure ties, maybe separated by means wholly mechanical, the heat and chemical agents necessary in purifying the baser metals neither being necessary nor applicable. The improved process of washing, noticed in the last report of my predecessor, is the last improvement which has come under my observation, whose object was to separate gold from its impure ties. The attention of metallurgists is still principally directed to the manufacture of iron, which, from its vast and increasing importance, and the numerous practical difficulties attendant upon its manufacture, still presents many problems for the scientific and practical iron master to solve. The substances with which, iron is combined in the various kinds of ore those used for effecting their decomposition and separation their proportions and affinityes, are, in general, ascertained with comparative ease but the intensity of the heat, the regulation of the quantity of decomposing matter, the mode of exposing the ores, the manner of directing the current of burning gases, or other igni ted matter, upon the mass, the form of the furnace, &c, require such nice ty of practical adjustment and adaptation, and are so easily deranged, that the best process which science could suggest might, in consequence of a slight practical defect, prove, utterly unsuccessful. The ease with which the iron combines with thexmateuials used in decomposing the ores also presents a serious obstacle in the way of obtaining it in its purity. The substitution of one material for another in the process, which is composed of similar elements, will frequently produce very important changes in the result; and it would be, extremely difficult for the mineral o gist and chemist in many cases to give a sound reason for the failure of the one process while the other is crowned with success. Patents, therefore, for apparently very inconsiderable changes in the process or materials used iii reducing ores, when there are improvements in results, should be readily granted. Patents have been granted within a few years, both in r this country and in Europe, for modes of obtaining pure mall table iron directly from the ores. It is doubtless true that experiments of this kind have sometimes been attended with success; and at other times, following apparently the same process, they have failed. The processes heretofore patented, although they may possess great merit, do not appear to have been characterized by that uniformity of result which is so essential in any branch of manufactures, and which alone commands public confidence and patronage. They have not all of them, however, been fully tried, and perhaps will yet produce, under skilful management, practical results of a highly satisfactory character. One patent for an invention of this kind hashbeea granted, in this country, to a foreigner within the last year, and the process is as follows, in his own language: " By my process, I am enabled, in a very short space of time, to manufacture wrought or mall table iron from the richer kinds of ore, such ask the hem a titi, and others, which contain not less than forty-five per cent of metal( and which generally contain a considerably larger quantity; my
47process not being considered as, adapted to the earthy ores, or to any of those which contain a less per cent age of iron Before proceeding to give the particulars of my process, I will remark that the invention herein described is the result of a series of experiments, by which I have ascertained that the attempts heretofore ni a de for converting the richer iron ores into mall table iron, by means of carbonaceousmatters in reverberatory furnaces, have failed principally from a want of knowledge of the effect of carbonaceous substances, when so employed, as regards quantity; the proportion added to the ore having been much too small to answer any good purpose, as it was not capable of deoxydizing any considerable portion of the ore, and the means attempted were not such as would particularly prevent such small quantities from being again oxydized by the working of the reverberatory furnace. Although     do not claim, therefore, to be the first who has made the attempt to manufacture mall table iron from the ore in a reverberatory furnace, I do claim to, be the first to have discovered the cause of former failures, and to have devised the means of rendering the process successful." In reducing the kinds of ore referred to, which consist principally of the proto sides and peroxides of iron, I have discovered that not less thanfrolth twenty to forty per cent. of carbon, by weight, and in many cases more, should be mixed with the ore when it is to be reduced in a reverberatory furnace; and I exclude from the list of those which are to be so treated all such as do not contain a sufficient quantity of oxygen to require the lesser proportional quantity of carbon above named. It will be seen, therefore, that my process applies to that class of ores which, under the ordinary mode of treatment, are deemed refractory, these being the most available when subjected to the process invented by me. With the several ores that I employ, the actual quantity of carbon, or of carbonaceousmatter required, will vary considerably, although it will always be equal in amount to that above stated; and I will herein after give such information as will enable the workman to judge readily when he is using the proper relative quantity for the iron ore upon which he is operating 1 commence my process by taking any of the rich iron ores, including under this denomination those only which will yield forty-five per cent and upwards of that metal, either as they are obtained from the mine, or as they exist after the carbonic acid, or other volatile matter which they may contain, has been separated from them by being calcined or roasted, and which, when so operated upon, will contain that per cent age or more of iron by analysis. By means of mills tones, rollers, or any other suitable apparatus, I crush or pulverize the ore, which I am about to reduce into particles, sufficiently small to pass through a riddle or screen, the meshes of which measure from one-fourth to one-eighth of an inch, preferring the smaller size. Boone hundred pa its of the ore, or calcined iron stone, so reduced in size, I add from twenty to forty parts, and frequently more, of carbonaceous matter, such as come, charcoal, pe at, or anthracite, which has been in like manner reduced to powder and passed through a, si eve, or screen, of the smaller size mentioned ; and, after well mixing them together, I pass a charge thereof, usually of about five hundred pounds weight, into a pulling or reverberatory furnace, which may be of the ordinary construction, and heated in such manner as to be in a state suitable for receiving pig iron to be huddled. This mixture should be occasionally but moderately stirred up say every five or ten minutes; and 48 after some time, depend ant upon the heat of the furnace, as well as upon the particular ore under treatment, it will become pasty under ordinary circumstances; this takes place in about half an hour, the past i ness resulting from the hot her parts having become metallic, and adhering or welding together; the furnace is then to be brought to its greatest heat, and the charge called; but the iron must be previously kept as " open, as possible, and care must be taken that it be not called up too soon, otherwise it will be tender, and most probably red short. In about an hour and a half or two hours from the time of charging, if the furnace be properly constructed, the fuel good, and well managed, the charge will be ready for the hammer, and may be treated as huddled iron made on the customary plan t will be obvious, from the remarks already made, that the definite quantity of charcoal or other carbonaceous matter cannot be prescribed, without taking into account the exact quantity of oxygen contained in the ore or calcined iron stone, and of the quantity of carbon, or of carburetted hydrogen, supplied by the carbonaceous matter employed; but, from my experience, I would recommend, as an approximate rule, that where a hundred parts of the ore under treatment contain about fifty of metallic iron, about thirty parts of charcoal, or its equivalent in other corbonaceousmatter, be added thereto, and for every additional two parts of iron in one hundred of the ore I would add one part of carbonaceous matter." I have sometimes combined with my process of reducing the ores of iron in the pudding furnace the additional operation of bringing pig plate, or other cast iron, into the state of mall table or wrought iron, by adding portions of such cast iron to the mass which is being acted upon. Hills pig or cast iron, which is a car burst of that metal, not only assists in the reduction of the oxide of iron still remaining in the ore, but has its own carbon separated by the oxygen of the ore. I prefer to add the cast iron when the charge of ore begins to feel heavy or pasty." When the cast iron is thoroughly melted, and well incorporated with the ore, the action of each material on the other so rapidly quickens the process, that some difficulty is experienced in preventing its 'being called too soon ; but, as before stated, the mass should be kept ' open" at ac4ighdegree of heat. Thus not only does the addition of cast iron increase the production of mall table metal, with a given cost of time and labor, but it also, from causes scientific ally accounted for, operates as a desirable adjunct in facilitating the process do not name the relative proportions of ore and of cast. iron, nor do  limit myself to the time of adding them together, as these conditions may be varied at the will and according to the experience of the operator but it is best to use a smaller proportion of cast iron when a very pure ore is being acted upon, or the quality of the wrought iron may be injured in some slight degree l" The workman will, after a little experience, be able to determine whether the requisite proportionate quantity of corbonaceous matter has been added to the particular species of ore under treatment, by paying attention to the following particulars: First, if, in the working of a particular description of ore, the return of iron be deficient in yield with reference to its known contents by analysis say less than from two thirds to three-fourths thereof and that a larger proportion of flag or cinder runs from it than might be expected pp. 49 and if all appearance of the pre s rice of eiarlibdn bstisi vases a tat ii early stage o if the press, there is manifestly a deficiency ofcaribonanditiutl beitidread li or fig the subsequent chair "e .sSSecondlyif the i rd turn be good, bit 'the metal does not all pre il or stand the hammer well, and if a considerable portion o the cart i aceouimatfter e seen floating 1 on th most en cinder at the close of the operation, there is too much carbon i in the mixture, and in future charges it si quantity ruts t be reduced.

to obstruct the draught, and to adhere to the pipes in such quantity as in a short time to prevent the air that passes through them from being duly heated, in a few days' use only, as I have repeatedly experienced ; they are thus rendered incapable of heating the air to such a degree as to produce any useful effects n my plan, it will be seen that the heating pipes are in close proximity with the bloom very fire, and that I dispense entirely with the arch, while I give to my chimney such a form as to produce all its anticipated benefits, without its cost or inconveniences." Having thus fully described the nature of my improvement in the manner of applying the hot blast to the bloom very fire forge, I do hereby declare that I do not make any claim to the applying of the hot blast thereto ;nor do I make any claim to the form or combination of the pipes for heating the air, this being the same with numerous others which have been long known and used; but what I do claim as of my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the manner in which I have combined said pipes with the bloomeryj forge fire, by placing them within the chimney, immediately over said fire; which chimney is formed in the manner herein described and represented, so as to effect the desired object, without the use of an arch or any analogous structure. To this particular combination and arrangement I limit my claim Two patents have been granted within the past year for the generation of the above mentioned combustible gases, and their application to the manufacture of iron. Both are reissues of patents granted and noticed previously, and it is therefore unnecessary to dwell upon them in this place. To patent has been granted in this country during the last year for improvements in the manufacture of steel. In concluding my remarks upon this branch of the subject, it is proper to add that the inexhaustible supply and variety of iron ores in this country, and of the materials used in reducing them, and manufacturing the various kinds of iron and steel, and the extensive demand for these indispensable products, render it a matter of the utmost importance to us, as a nation, that the processes connected with this branch of the arts should reach a degree of perfection which they have not hitherto attained in this country; and the ingenuity and enterprise of our manufacturers furnish the best guarantee that we shall not be long in attaining that eminence in his branch of manufactures which appears to be our natural right. Manufactures Of Metals After They Are Separated From Theores, And The Machi Nes Used Therei N. Forgesbut little evidence of improvement in the blacksmith forget has come before this office during the past year, but one patent having been granted within. that time. Blacksmiths have heretofore found considerable inconvenience to arise from the extinction of their forge fires, in the ordinary course of their work, which is such as to leave the fires unused occasionally for intervals of tinge. The fire during this time becomes extinct, and time and fuel are consumed in re kindling. To obviate this difficulty, and to render the forge portable, the patentee has provided it with panels, which slide in grooves in the cover and bottom of the forge, a. 51 in such a manner as entirely to surround the fire, leaving a small opening at the bottom for a moderate supply of air to it, and another at the top to perform the ordinary office of a chimney. Several applications have been made for alleged improvements in tu teres for conducting the blast to the forge fire; but none of them have presented the requisite novelty to secure letters patent, and are therefore rejected or returned to the applicants for amendment. One patent was granted early in the last year for improvements in trip hammer for working large masses of metal; but as I find it described in the last report of my predecessor, it is unnecessary that it should be here described. It is stated by my predecessor, however, that it avoids a practical inconvenience in the steam hammer, previously patented, to wit the inconvenience arising from the upsetting of the piston rod. It is but justice to the first patentee to state that, in making this objection, my predecessor overlooked the fact that the piston rod was united to the hammer by a spring attachment, to prevent upsetting. The difficulty in practice had, therefore, already been foreseen, and the appropriate remedy applied. If this circumstance had been noticed, the remarks above alluded to would have been withheld, as the gentleman who made them would have been the last to prejudice the rights of an inventor. Buathingesonly one patent has been granted during the year for butt hinge machinery, and that was a re issue of an old patent for making the joints, &c. of wrought iron hinges by the use of appropriate cutters and dies. The patent is too well known to require description. Two patents have been granted for improvements in window blind hinges. Pinsbut one patent has been granted within the year for the manufacture of pins, and that to a foreigner. It is proper to remark that the pin machinery of this country is far superior to any other in the world. The machinery patented, however, has its important characteristics, and will be understood by reference to the claims which I give, as follows: "having now described the construction of the improved machinery to be employed in the manufacture of nails, rivets, screws, and pins, I desire it to be understood that I claim, in reference to the heading of metal rods or wire for the above purposes, the means of effecting what I call a double upset' viz: by crushing the end of the rod or wire for forming the boss or head of the nail, rivet, screw, or pin, by two or more operations of a single heading punch and pair or set of holding dies, and the sliding guides, the whole in combination as above described, the rod or wire being brought forward between the holding dies a short distance by the sliding guides, after the first or partial crushing of the metal, to complete and perfect the form of the boss or head, when the second pressure of the punch is brought up against it. As respects the pointing of pins, and discharging them from the machine, I claim my improvement therein the same consisting in imparting to the sliding bar (I) certain alternating lateral and back movements in its bearings, as described, whereby the pins are turned in opposite directions during the action of the mill roller upon them, and discharged from the machine when the pointing of them has been completedPilecuttingThis operation has in general been performed by hand, when the best article was required. As it is almost impossible to find a blank of the same degree of hardness throughout, the blow upon thecid127chisel should vary in force, not only according to the width of the blank5
to be cut, bit also according to its varying hardness. Both of these requisite scant easily be attended to by a, skilful operative; but as thes varieties :of hardness occur irregularly, no machine .as yet been Oifenwhich can perfectly adapt itself to the miner file cutting machine ^has been patented within the last yea, in which the file blank is placed upon: a carriage under the chisel, so t the edge of the chisel shall make the desired angle with the black, the parts being adjustable in this pa articular. The hammer which operates i pon, the chisel r works like an ordinary adjustable tilt hammer. Oh force of the iblkbw is regulated by a spring, the power of which is again regulated by the width of that part Of the file :po i which the chisel is operating; and thus, if the plans k be of nearly equal hardness throughout, as it moves on wad 'by the regulated intermittent motion of the carriage, it will 'b properly :cut. Cities, nails, and rivet shut two machines of this class have been patented during the year. Very excellent machines have bee' n i Use for several years, and secured by patents, and very little progress has since been made. The more recent machines may operate we ii, but exert no important influence upon this branch of manufactures. Good: Crews- Two screw machines have been pa merited, and, although improvements, they operate upon- the same general principles with some of those which were previously in use. Locks and fastening Some ten patents have been granted for machines belonging to this class during the year, aid, although several of them are useful, no one seems to possess that distinctive character or l commanding importance ,which entitles it to notice above the rest. They ar all modifications of locks, patches, &c, previously in use. Head pipe For several years past valuable machines have been in use in this country, and a vast amount of pipe has been manufactured The machines in use give satisfaction, and the improvements made i this branch of manufactures have reference to minor details, while the generachiamcteriS: tics :of the machine are preserved. Two patents have' bdengranrie4 the past year for such improvements. In One :f the miahlfiespatented the cylinder from which the lead is forced through the matrix, or forme :is substantially a double acting force pump, and is connected with an air chamber for the purpose of preserving a regular stream.

Toolsseveral inventions- of machines under this title have been patented during the year: s ch as the blacksmith is vice, hammers, a users, saw files, drills, &c; but there is but one which it is necessary 'to describe. Letters patent have been i granted within the year for a iachinfor boring the cylinders of rotary steam origines and for other simicid127t 1 ti r poses' which deservesinoti ce.

Manufacture Of Of Brous Andtexti   Of Fabri Csthis class, for the variety and complexity of machinery .which it presents, is perhaps unequal led by any other; and although lit has exercised the plovers of the most inventive minds for ages, and comprehends machinery .producing results -which are almost incredible, still every year furthiscid127hes valuable contributions to its already munificent stores. It is not t be supposed, that every branch of this, comprehensive class has equally advanced; by t while, s omne have remained nearly stationary, others have made steady progress. The subdivisions of this class will appear as I proceed to notice them. Preparation of fibresClOraing and carding wool There have been but three or four patents granted within the last year in this division; one fir carding, and the others for cleaning and burring. Although, the machines patented possess novelty and merit, they do not so materially differ from machinery previously used as to render a particular description of them necessary. To patent has been issued for wool combing. Cotton gin Several patents have been granted for cleaning cotton, and one for ginning the long staples. This cotton gin is an improvement upon that variety which is known as the " roller gin." To far as I am acquainted with the machines heretofore in use for that purpose, they have produced to some extent an injurious influence upon the cotton, in consequence of. the pressure, rubbing, and strain upon the; fibres, made by the rollers; the cotton thus becomes a dead" as it is termed, and can be easily distinguished from that which is, picked by hand; while the machine, at noted is said to produce an article equal to that picked by hand. Theco6tton is carried from the hop per, by a toothed cylinder, to a large cylinder with fan b eaters or ribs, which is covered by a cylindrical case that, opens on the side opposite to the fee der into a funnel, shaped box, whose bottom inclines downwards. The large ribbed cylinder, as it revolves, takes the cotton from the fee der and throws or blows it down to the lower54
end of the box, where there is an opening to two grooved ginning rollers to which the cotton has easy access. These rollers, as they revolve, are prevented from separating by a weighted lever resting upon an adjusting screw. The ends of the rollers are made for a short distance smooth, arid of the slightest increase of diameter, which keeps the grooved portion of the rollers separate from each other, but not so far as to prevent their drawing the cotton between them. The pressure of the weighted lever does not come upon the cotton unless the supply is too large, and in that case it operates to regulate the supply. Thus the injury arising from pressure, straining, &c, is avoided. A little above and in front of the upper ginning roller, and a little below and in front of the lower one, there is placed a fluted roller, working very near to the ginning rollers, and in opposite directions, (at the points where they meet) which strip the ginning rollers of the long fibres which would otherwise wind around them. The operations of this machine are said to be entirely satisfactory; and if so, an important step has been taken in this branch of manufacture. Preparing the fibres of hemp and flax inventive genius is still industriously exercised upon machinery for separating the fibres of hemp and flax from their wood y connections, and preparing them for manufacture. Any applications have been rejected for want of novelty, and seven or eight machines have been patented. These patents have generally been granted for slight modifications of pre existing machinery, still operating upon principles well known. One of the patents I will, however, notice, as it seems to present a feature distinguishing it radically from the rest. The breaking of flax or hemp has heretofore been effected by a series of permanent blades, variously arranged, with movable blades arranged in a manner to correspond, and working between them, or by its being carried between fluted rollers, &c, &c. While the hemp is unbroken the stalk is of such a form, and the fibre adheres to the wood y part in such a manner, that if the stalk be broken abruptly, without previous preparation, or if rubbed violently by any machinery used in breaking, more o less of the fibres will be broken or injured. The machinery heretofore in use, and above alluded to, has generally been of a character thus to injure the fabric, though the defect in some is vastly less than in others. To remove this imperfect ion in pre existing machinery, the patentee above alluded to first receives the hemp, &c, from the feeding apron between it wo smooth rollers, which flatten it and slightly dis engage the fibres from the wood y part, and afterwards feed it to a double series of small smooth rollers, the upper series working opposite the spaces between the lower ones, the rollers of each series being placed so as nearly to touch each other, and the upper series being pressed down upon the lower by weights c. The surfaces of all these rollers move with a speed equal to that of the flattening and feeding rollers, and in the same direction, so that the hemp is carried through these series of rollers, and is successively bent in a short curve upwards and downwards, without the slightest tension, rubbing, or injurious breaking, until the fibres are entirely loosened' from the wood y part, which can then be shaken or beaten out in. any convenient manner. The patentee unites the above described i machine with other parts for cleaning, which I do not deem it important to describe. Some of the other machines patented during the year approximate the same point which seems to have been attained by the inventor whose machine I have described. a. 65SppininigCotton, prior to being spun, is formed into moving, which is sometimes deposited in cans, from which it is withdrawn to receive the necessary additional twist. The ordinary mode of depositing the coils in the can is around its inner sides, leaving a considerable space in the middle, thus limiting the quantity it will contain, and leaving the coils in danger of falling in such a manner as to become entangled with each other and break. To remedy these inconveniences a machine has been invented by a foreigner, for which letters patent have been granted within the year. In this machine the guide for the moving, together with the drawing rollers, revolve upon a shaft which is eccentric to the can to such a degree that as the guide and drawing rollers revolve in one direction, and the can in the opposite direction, with different ve lo cities, the moving is deposited in coils or loops which extend from the centre of the can to the sides in all parts of it. Thus the can is filled, the moving well supported, and in condition to be easily withdrawn without breaking. Several patents have been granted for improved machinery for spinning. In one of those machines the bob bind of the whole spinning frame are supported by their lower and inner edges, upon the outer edge of a large horizontal wheel, from which they derive their motion. At high speeds the "live spindle" has been found to vibrated to suck a degree as to break the thread so often that it has been necessary to drive it at a speed much less than is desirable. This inconvenience was, .p a considerable degree, obviated by supporting the spindle in a tube extending up from the traverse rail, which very much diminished its vibration s still, however, it was found necessary to limit its speed. Letters patent have, within the year, been granted for extending the tube both above and below the traverse rail, by which improvement it is found that the spindle can safely revolve at a much higher speed than before. Two or three years since, letters patent were granted for supporting thebobbins in the spinning frame by the edge of the belt which gave them their motion. This mode of supporting them is said to be defective, inasmuch as the bob bin frequently flies up from the belt, and, when that is the case, it fails to receive the necessary rotary motion. Letters patent, within this year, have been granted for an improvement intended to remedy this defect. For this purpose the lower end of the bob bin is extended down a little farther than the width of the flat belt which is used. Round this lower part of the bob bin a groove is cut of proper width to receive the belt loosely, and of sufficient depth to prevent pressure upon the bob bin by the belt. This groove receiving the belt, if the bob bin rises or flies up, the lower f large of its groove will touch the belt and receive the proper rotary motion from it. The foregoing are nearly all the patents connected with the subject of spinning which have been granted during the year. W4eavingnine or ten patents have been granted during the year for improvements in various parts of the loom ; but such machinery is generally of a character so complicated that it would be impossible to give an idea of improvements made upon it, without elaborate drawings and descriptions. In one of the looms patented the improvement consists in attaching to the loom a simple apparatus which, in ordinary weaving, will answer as a substitute for the Jacquard. I to merit consists partly in the ease with which it can be attached to hand looms already constructed56D9c.

The process and machinery used are but slight modifications of those pelt knowno4tn battingWithin a few years this article has become an important Had extensive branch of American manufactures, and has recently draw i to itself the attention. of in ve nors to such a degree that four applipcatippsbave relit ly been passed for improvements in its manufacture. The bat of the required length and thickness being formed, by any convenient process: it becomes recess are to cover it ,with -a, thin coat of sizeafptr, iwbiich i the fabric is did, The extreme delicacy of the bat, and they By slight adhesion of, th(cid:127) i fires to i each other, render the processofsizing aid drying one of .considerable difficulty. The improvements 3d. -y .:I three of the, pate trees I ill give- you in the words of the inventors, as extracts, from t the patents -will l present them clearly and concisely. The earliest of lie four: pate ned improvements ,ill be understood by a peru al 'of the follow in extract taken; from one of the other 0 to: -a, : of : .e extract the .nature of my in ention consists in arranging theisizing rollersitndi t ely above an aperture in the top of a, drying chamber, providedwitcid127t a stove and hot air tubes .on each side to dry the patting as it dejscpgds, a grating on each side to .protect it from contact with the tubesancid127stoyes, ancid127d ,a folding box at the bottom, into which the patting is folded from one side to the other, as it descends. By this arrangement, I disease with the endless belts heretofore .employed in seizing and drying patting, which are son de stroked by the great heat to which they are expose in passing through I the drying i chamber, and: which are, of course, very expensive; and, at the same time, I avoid the contact of the patting after it has been sized and before being dried. I. am aware that it has been essayed to dispense with the endless belts by passing the. sheets of patting from the seizing rollers over another roller, then down into the dryinghamnber, down near to the bottom of the chamber, and the ri up again i to, another roller at ,the top, the chamber being provided with a stove on  each i de, and a hot air tube between the descending and ascending portionsofthcid127) sheet of patting; but I consider this .objectionable, .for the reasons. that the .sling vats, and rollers ;are so situated that th;e sized bat .has to pass or a roller before entering th e drying chamber, and because, as itdislcariie .dawn and then up a gun, in case of breaking it is liable to fall on to to   he bottom stove, and catch and communicate fire to the wholeestablisheint. and In 'the event of no^ t watching fire, it becomes essay forthepertive to enter the hot air .h amber, which is heated to (cid127aeryyhighit m
perature, to replace the patting in a condition to continue the operation up all of which difficulties are obviated by the location of the seizing rollers immediately over the aperture in the top of the furnace, in combination with the arrangement of stoves and pipes, and protecting grates on each side, and the folding box at the bottom" I do not claim as my invention conducting the bat from the seizing rollers to the dying chambers without a belt; but what I do claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the arrangement of the watch of the seizing rollers immediately over the aperture in the top of the drying chamber, in combination with the arrangement of stoves and pipes and protecting grates on each side of the chambers, and the folding box at the bottom, for the purpose and in the manner described The following is the third mode above alluded to, and is extracted in the words of the inventor: "the methods heretofore practised of making the bat of the desired thickness for wadding are, to deliver the broad s liver or sheet of cotton from one carding engine into an apron, which moves back and forth until a sufficient number of layers have been obtained ;or so to construct the engine as to deliver a single s liver, or sheet of the required thickness, or to carry up the shivers from the carding engines vertically, so arranged as to unite them all into one bat. The defects of these methods are obvious for, with the first, the sheet of wadding must "either be made very short of: be s placed end to end, (a very imperfect operation ,with the second thereciprocating apron, on which it is delivered, must be of an enorMiouslength, occupying an amount of room too great for the convenience of an establishment; and with the third, the shivers, which are drawn up overhead, frequently break. The arrangement of belts must necessarily be very complex; and from their situation, the shivers are much exposed to fire and, indeed, from the number of accidents which have occurred, none of the establishments which manufacture cotton wadding can be insured. The object of the first part of my invention is to avoid these objections and inconveniences; and it consists in ranging a series of carding engines, one behind another, over an apron which has a continuous movement, so that the s liver or sheet of cotton from the second card is delivered on top of that from the first, the one from the third on to that of the second, and so on to the end of the series, the number of carding engines being in proportion to the quality and thickness of the bat or wadding desired; it being a fact well known to those versed in the art of working fibrous materials, that the thinner each s liver the more perfect will be the bat; and it will be evident that, with my method, this can be refined to any desired extent is to the gazing operation, but one method has been practised, (although several have been proposed and patented) which consists in conducting the bat on an endless apron to a vat, where it is glazed on one side, and then conducted to a second vat to be glazed on the other side, and from this delivered on to another endless apron, which passes through akin or hot air chamber to be dried. This method is not only very imperfect, but attended with great expense and danger, for that face of the bat which rests on the apron is not exposed to the direct action of the heated air, and therefore dries slowly; which fact renders it necessary to raise the temperature of the kill and hot air chamber, which very soon destroys the apron, and often subjects the who e establishment to loss by fire. a. The second part of my invention, it is believed, obviates all these objections, and consists i passing the glazed bat or wadding, from. the gazing apparatus through the kill or hot air chamber over a series of open feels, arranged side by side on one plane, and extending from end to end of the kill, one re el delivering the bat on to another, and so on to the last in the series, where it is delivered out. If the bat is glazed on both sides before it is introduced into the kill, but one set of feels is used; but I prefer to gaze it first on one side, dry this by passing it through the kill on one set of feels, and deliver it at the other end to the second gazing apparatus, to be glazed on the other side, and then passed through the kill on another set of feels above the first. In this way I avoid the inconvenience of accumulation g the gazing or seizing on the rods of the re el, for, in passing through the first time, the un glazed surface rests on the bars of the re el, and the second time the side first glazed; in this way I avoid what otherwise would be a serious inconvenience t will be obvious that the first of my invention is applicable to various operations in the manufacture of fibrous and textile substances, such as making bats of wool, and other animal fibres for felting, and all other operations in which it is necessary, to form a bat of several thicknesses of s liver, of the width of the d offer of a carding engine; and it will be equally obvious that the second part of my invention is also applicable to all operations in manufactures which require fragile webs or tissues to be conducted from seizing or gazing apparatus, to be exposed to the action of heat or currents of air The following is the last process for gazing cotton patting which has come to my notice, and is in the words of the inventor." Elise or cotton wadding, which consists of delicate fibres of cotton connected together and made into a bat by the operation of the carding, engine, has heretofore been glazed on the two surfaces by passing first one and then the other surface in contact with rollers or belts covered with the gazing matter, as it was supposed that this could only be effected by moving the surface of the bat in contact with a glazed surface. This necessarily requires two operations to gaze the two surfaces, and leaves the edges only partially covered or glazed, and consequently ragged and liable to fray putty improved process avoids all these difficulties, and renders the operation much more rapid. It consists in passing the patting or bat into and through the gazing matter, and at a velocity so great as to simply cover the entire surface, including the edges, and prevent the gazing matter from penetrating to the inner fibres." The manner in which I have applied my improved process is simply to pass the patting, at a velocity of about thirty-six feet per minute, into and through the gazing matter, and under a roller near the bottom of the vat, and thence out, so that the patting shall pass through the gazing matter in passing to and from the roller. S I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not lay claim to this apparatus as it has been employed for sat u rating with tar, and other similar substances, patting made of hempen and other coarse fibres, employed unsheathing vessels, &c, the object being thoroughly to sat urate the fibres to cause them to adhere to each other and to the cementing matter, with the view to form, as near as practicable, a waterproof fabric, the object and the fabric being entirely different from cotton or pelisses wadding; but895Dbc No. 140.what I do claim as ny timVritibon in the process of ~tz i g the fabricinOdwn under the t riietaliappelltiOi dfipeliss- 6 do it w tbadicid127~ is passing it through the gazing 'livid at a velocity. substantially soul i ashbreindoscreibed, so :a si t' o hcid127cid127etf' th nor surface :and edges without petratnihgto i the inner fibres, as described."

As they present no strongly marked l novelty, my 'limits "ill not allow me to give their further notice the fourth patent above referred to is for a magnetic gauge to indicate the height of water in :the boilers. The con tintructin and operation of tis instrument are very simple, and will be fully understood, both in character and importance, from the following preamble in the words of the inrentorrThe importance of a reliable means of indicating the height of I wager i steam boilers is now v universally admitted by engineers, for te reason indicated by science: and established by experience, that the deficiency of water in boilers is the principal if not the only source of explosions; and hence the many attempts which have been made to: obtain an apparatusDodQ No. 140,.for this purpose, which, whilst it can be relied; on, will- at 'the same time be in such a godititn as, as te, th observance of the engineer.

By v invention it is believed, will ,avoid all these difficulties; and it consist- simply in: attaching a magnet to the axis of motion of a wheel or lever, to which the If lit is suspended or attached i to communicate motion, by attraction and repulsion i, to an index needle turning on an axis outside the boiler, and separated from the magnet by a steam tight plate in important improvement ;has been patented within the year, in the mode of coiling or connAiing. two o ranks a, which are to operate in re concert; and constitute what is known as; the "bell crank" used. on i the main or of the shaft of -the steam n engine and elsewhere.

To obviate these evils the patentee has invented a new mode of coup long the cranks. The description cannot be full understood without drawings; but the general principle may be' understood from t d1derstdd from the claim, which is as follow : "I It :all be obvious that the effect may be produced on the same principle by connecting the pin to one crank by a turning joint only, and in whether by a turning aid. sliding joint; and that the construction of the part; a   d th& manner of making these joints, may be varied without affecting in: any manner the principle or character of my invention, although     ha i (cid127cid127described that mode of construction which I deem to be the ;mosteffeitre, and i best adapted to the end in view.

His, invention will be; understood by reference to; the following extracts from, his patent: , 6162
I n forming the connection of a steam cylinder with the steam chest of puppet valve engines, it has long been known to engineers that the closeness; of this connection is important in an economical point of view, not only on account of the weight and cost of materials employed in making a long connection, but because all the steam contained in this connection is condensed or otherwise lost at each stroke of the engine, and hence various devices have been resorted to by engineers to sur mount this difficulty. The steam chest has been variously arranged and located, but still all these devices have presented a large area between the chest and the cylinder; for, the steam chest being cast separate from the cylinder, sufficient room must be left to form the connection by bolted flat inches, which necessarily occupy much room To remedy these evils is the object of my invention, the nature of which consists in casting the steam chests in one piece with the steam cylinder, or one with the cylinder, and the other with the condenser and the cylinder bottom, by making the side of the cylinder the side of the steam chest, and so of the condenser, and also in so forming and adapting the appendages of these parts as to enable them to come together and to unite the cylinder head with the cylinder, and the cylinder bottom with the cylinder within the narrow compass left between the steam chest and cylinder, when they are brought in such close proximity ;the blanche on the cylinder and cylinder bottom being dispensed with towards the steam chest, and, instead thereof, a joint made between the chest and cylinder by packing or driving, and screws inserted from the inside of the steam chest and screwing into the solid metal of the cylinder; for the lower steam chest and for the upper end recesses being made in the side of the steam chest, to admit the requisite screw bolts for securing the cylinder head do not claim letters patent simply for casting the steam chests with the cylinder, or with the cylinder bottom and condenser; but what I do claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is casting the steam chests with the cylinder, and the other with the cylinder cotton and condenser, by making the side of the steam chest the side of the cylinder or condenser, in combination with the manner of fitting the cylinder head and the lower end of the cylinder to the chests, and the mode of making the attachments without the continuation of the blanches, thus dispersing with the noble and noble blanches, and their attachments, and saving at each stroke the steam contained in the novels, all as hereindescribedThe mode heretofore adopted of tripping the drop cut off valve, was, in practice, found to be imperfect, as, at certain points of the stroke, it could not be operated with certainty, and much injury would result from failure. Letters patent have been granted, within the year, to the original inventor of this cut off, for an improvement which removes the practical imperfect sons of the old apparatus. The evil which existed, and the remedy, will be understood by reference to the following extracts from the new patent: "by the method now practised of operating the drop cut off valve, the motion is derived from the lifted, which approaches its state of rest as the piston of the engine approaches the middle of its stroke, or its maximum velocity; and the valve is tripped by the same motion which lifts it, so that there must be very great nice ty in the adjustment to regulate the extent of the cut off at about the half stroke. The object of my invention his to remedy this, and its principle or character consists in tripping the valve by a motion independent of the motion of the lifting rod or rods and, also, in combining the various parts in such manner as to regulate the cut off with accuracy during the action of the engine, by connecting the two shafts that trip the two cut off valves, end to end, by means of adjustable spring arms that take into, all ' are, when set, held in the teeth of a sector, which vibrated on the axis of motion of the shafts, and receives its vibratory motion from the eccentric; which spring arms may be shifted in the teeth of the .sector, brought nearer to, or farther from, eachotheryand thus cut off at a less or greater portion of the stroke." It will be evident, from the foregoing, that any motion derived from any part of the engine may be substituted for the vibration of the arms or wipe is, provided the character above described be maintained; as, for instance, instead of the horizontal vibrating motion of the arm or wipe r, the spring may be disengaged from the stem of the valve, by a vertical descending motion, as the lifted rises; and this may be derived from any moving shaft, such as the piston rod, the beam, the crank shaft, &c' What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is tripping the drop valve of the cut off by a motion independent of thelifters, substantially in the manner and for the purpose herein described." I also claim combining the wipe r that drops the valve of the cut off, whether working horizontally or vertically, with any of the moving parts of the engine other than the lifteds or their rocking shaft, by means of the sector and arm or arms, by means of which the extent of the cut off can be regulated at pleasure during the action of the engine, from the full to the least portion of the stroke, as herein described The great advantages which result from working steam expansivelyhave given rise not only to cutting off the steam at any desired point of the stroke, which is the object of the drop and many other valves, but also to the use of two cylinders: in the first of which the steam is admitted and operates in the usual way, and at the return stroke the steam at the exhaust end of the cylinder is admitted into the other cylinder, which is axillary to the first and of greater diameter, in which it operatesexpansively. Several modifications of this variety of engine have been from time to time invented in this country and in Europe, but they have not been extensively used. One of the most serious objections to them has always arisen from the fact, that while the steam was operating advantageously in the axillary cylinder, it was reacting against and resisting the motion of the piston in the primary cylinder. This objection seems to have been entirely removed by a new arrangement of parts, for which letters patent have been granted within the. past year, and of which the following is a general outline. The two cylinders have the same length and diameter and are placed side by side with valves at each end, opening directly from one to the adjacent end of the other. The connecting rods of their pistons are jointed to cranks on the main shaft which are at right angles to each other, so that when one piston has completed its stroke the other is at half stroke. Suppose, then, the piston of the main cylinder to be nearly at the bottom or starting point; the steam is admitted in any convenient way to the main cylinder, and its piston moves until it has made its half stroke, at which time the piston of the axillary cylinder is at the bottom. The valve between the two cylinders behind the main piston is then 64- D

The pipe to the condenser i immediately opened, and the remainder of the steam in the main cylinder is condensed in the usual way and the main piston begins toi return. I the mean time the steam which was left in the axillary cylinder is ocid127eratingiexpansively upon the second piston i, which it continues to d until it has completed its stroke, and the steam his then exhausted in the listialway. when the valve between the cylinders at the other end is o posted, and the same operations are repeated during i the return stroke which tokplae -during the first By this arrangement it is readily' see ri thatcid127) th'bre-action. above alluded to is entirely avoided, and i ti fat when the first -cakes at its dead i point the second is perpendicular to the second piston. Letters patent have recently been granted in England for an engine very similar to that above described. Patents have been granted this year for ' modifications of cutrdffvalvewhiceh it is unnecessary to describe. The vibrating engine' for driving spiral prbellers, patented in 1844 and noticed in the last report of my predecessor is said to have presented practical objection is, and .let tiers' patent have- ben granted within the last year for modifications i, by which, it is said; they re' removed, he improvement is certainly ingenious, and' will be for ly tested. I important improvements in the rotary? engine have' been mind and patented during this year. The usefulness of this variety of engine has been seriously e circumscribed by mechanical obstacles in the i at of its construction, which seemed to be incident to its natured; arndamongwhich' the great extent of packed and ground surfaces Was not the lest. For :many purposes ' the rotary engine is very important, and substahiialimprovements I upon it have long .been demand died Eh; in .y jcid127gtld fit n ,is the character of those last ipatencid127ed. It is impossible, with it drawing to give a clear idea of the inveatit6n alluded, to, but the fllo11wing exttectffromthe patencid127cid127) will: sufficiently set forth it general chair actetistids- The characteristics of this engine, and what distinguishes it fro dim al others before known, are, first, making the an- ulnar chamber in whichtheipistori works' (technically termed the 6 cylinder" in two parts, united at a line passing ithroughthei centre of the annular chair be, and parallel with the a xi i of the shaft, instead of t uniting 0 the two valves at a li ri a it right angles to the axis; by which arrangement I am enabled to i duke the cylinder true, less liable to unequal expansion, avoiding the necessity of a continuous packed or ground joint entirely around the chamber or cylinder, and presenting the important advantages of greater solidity `and simplicity, the: lower half being permanently fixed in the frame which supports the bearings of the shaft, &c, by blanches which admit the induction and eduction valves; thus greatly reducing the number of packed or ground i joints, so objectionable in all steam engine, particularly therotaryrenginesThis arrangement not only adds greatly to the strength of the whole structure, but enables me to bore out the cylinder by an instdrmentw, which c No. 140. 65 fig the operation, has s bearings in the boxes intended for the shaft of the piston i to inisureacuriacy in att the parts. -Secoidty in socid127arrantgitg the steam and: exhaust valves, and the steam passages in the disk to which t he past b is attached, as to avoid the pressure of stern mori th:e'valves when moving; a and connecting these with a shifting valve t which i governs the aepefrtres in m the disk and the one on the hollow shaft, through which the steam is admitted, and an annular groove in one of he packing plates the covers t he disk, as s to' afford an easy and simple mode (cid127fireversingf the action of the engine. :thirdly, in grooving the faces of the disk and of the packing plates or cheeks between which it works from the outer periphery inward, to admit steam to lubicte1 the rubbing sur faces: ?fourthly, ran king the toward and rubbing surface of -the piston of as image springrfetai hoop, divided at its junction with the disk, so that by means of hempen or ft her packing within and a packing head, the diameter of this ring can be enlarged and piti if iii ed at pleas are -to fit the cylinder by which rid as the iiinerotis joints found in metal pistons heretofore used, and which are objectionable are avoided And, lastly, can f ieftig the 'piston to a blanche projecting from a disk on the shaft, by meats of srecid127is passing through enlarged apertures in the disk to admit of the are pay of th piston, to adapt itself to the cylinder in case of any in a ti (cid127aey' -a. In closing my remarks upon this class of inventions, I deem it proper to express the opinion, hat: during the six years of my connection with th office, i no -one yea, has been sign a lied by so mat y truly vacid127luable inrivena4ionlisconnected with the steam engine as the last. : -:'::N' . Avigati Of Andimari Of I Mplements, .a, ~a it few intentions have been presented to this office, during the year, upon the -subject- o 'ship or :o at building.

I also add a flank he around the stem and stern posts, and along the line of the feel which takes up the surplus met ai there, and forms the feel and stem and stern posts' .a. One patent has been granted for improvements in sails, by which, it is said, cotton canvass can be successfully substituted for that; which is in common use. A truss has long since been used to sustain the yards of vessels, but when applied to any of the lower masts, it becomes necessary to un ship the yard before the mast immediately above it can be lowered. To remedy this inconvenience, a truss has been invented and patentee i within the year, so constructed that the upper mast can be lowered directly through the truss, without disturbing either truss& or yard. The injurious effects of the booms and grafts of mains a is, forest its, &er upon masts, have induced ship builders to resort to, various expedients for avoiding them. Friction Rollers, slides, have been placed in the jaws of the boom or g aft. Slide S have been used with, s oe success in but when applied to the boom jaws, the slides, by resting upon and striking against the saddle, soon become bruised and broken in such a manner as to injure rather than protect the mast. Letters patent have been recently granted for a means of avoiding this difficulty, which consists in so constructing and supporting the saddle, that a. space is left between it and the mast for the reception of the slides, while the, .boom rests upon the saddle in the usual way. Letters patent have been granted, within the year, for a e able spring, to be used when ships are riding at anchor. I to object is to prevent the violent and injurious jerks and strains which are caused by the motion of the vessel.  The machine consists of a long wedge, placed between two rulers in a frame firmly fixed. The rollers are pressed, together by powerUtfsprings, for the purpose of resisting the passage of the wedge between them. The cable is the: attached to the wedge, sufficient slack being left between, the wedge and the cast an, and when any- strain mes upon the cable the wedge i drawn in between the roller is as the springs yield, and is forced back by them when strain is removed. By this device, allowance can be made, by. a comparatively small- on traction of the springs, for a very considerable motion of the vessercid127pellerAppiications for letters patent for improvements in propeltershave been very numerous during (cid127the, war, but most of he alleged inventions which have been presented were old, ana of course rejected nd, with few exceptions, those which have been: " patented possess very little novelty y or usefulness. The ,hlicationp have extended to alamo every class of prop pellets, it, or incid127ipally to that variety i known as the screw" prop elder. As they present no striking features to distinguiishthemn from others which are well known, it is anriecessary to go into a detailed description of them.

I the wharf or other super structure ,rests. From the following, nearly in the words ofthepanentee, the invention will be understood :a: .l ,o construct a circular foundation pat form of temporary piling isfirstereeted upon the site for the .convenience of i the workmen. -in iron pile, (wrought) of suitable :length and i diameter, and armed with :one ofMitehells patent screws at i tss lower extremity, is inserted intothe ground or bottom, at a point occupying r the exact centre of the intended: structure. This forms the guide pile to regulate the placing of all the other parts of the structure. A series of similar wrought iron screw piles are then inserted into the- ground or i bottom, at exactly equal distances each d from the centre guide pile, and at exactly equal distances i from each other, forming, of course, so many points in a great circle. Between each pair, of piles so placed is next j inserted a segment al piece of cast iron, termed a bed socket. One of ;the segments being' placed between each pair of piles, and resting its angular edge upon ,the ground or bottom, forms consecutive ly. a circular, grooved, and socketed surface to receive the -parts of the super structure, as follows: -upon each pile is now fitted a tubular piece of cast iron, with projections at opposite sides. The lower end of this tubular casting fits into the socket of the bed plate, and the projections on its opposite sides form, a perpendicular groove, in which are received the edges of the panels, and which panels and; tubular pieces have a uniform y circular surface, The she lb of the foundation is the a completely formed, and is now strengthened: by a series of tension rods hooked onto the several tubular pieces and other parts, if found to be necessary, and all these tension rods are set up to the ,entr e. guide pile by means ofswivel screw joints. ;the cylindrical cast iron shell thus formed is then to- be filled in with stone, concrete, or other filling, as may be found expedient. .a. -a: .to protect the bed sockets aforesaid from being undermined and disturbed from their proper. level, by the action, of tidal currents, I adopted the following plan: As soon as the circle of iron piles is completed, I put down outside thereof a complete circle of pieces :of cast iron, say six: feet in length and diameter, of a converse segment al form ; and these segments are all shackledcid127ogether by bolts passing freely through hinge bosses cast on i their inside angles. Two or more o these concentric circles of these segments are .thus -put down, either by means of a diving bell or other hydropneumatic apparatus, and it is apparent these segments, when undermined by the action of the current, will descend, generally, and thereby enclose and protect the surface which, they respectively i cover. It is assumed, also, that -these segments wilt iso defect the tidal current from the main body ,of the ,work, about its base, that- o process i of undermining can take place; though, as an additional security, the spandrelsbetween the converse surfaces of these segments should be filled in with clay or stone as; soon as the bed plates are fixed' in position. In another form of these segments for protecting the bottom from :abrasion, it is proposed to cast it as a hollow box, whose transverse section should be triangular, with hinge bosses for s hacking the pairs together.

The edge of the scrape r is in a commonirmtpbut the body of -it is warped or twisted e in such .a manner that, as the excavated earth passes along over its surface, it is iso un end a to fall and be pressed upon the bank with i the stuff side new" t e to 'and extending up from the side of the ditch.  In the western prairies, where wood for fencing is difficult of access, these ditches nd lees are valuable substitutes, and machines for constructing the mi with rapidity and economic are of very great amp or dance. 6 :of mode of 1 raising sunken ' vessels or recovering their cargo has been patented within the year, which is said to have proved very slucessfil. Cicumstanices are often such that it could undoubtedly be very advantageously employed. The description of the apparatus and mode f operating ar a as fcid127i0lows nearly in the words of the inventor: " The na tu re of my intention , consists in the employment of a cloth- or flexible caisson to surround the wreck for the' purpose of excluding the surrounding waters& so that he water i thin the vessel :and caisson can be pumped out, and i the 'employment of a frame or frames to be erected above the vessel for the purpose :of giving access to any part of the vessel and also in connecting with such clot or flexible caisson a 0 plump orputiips, suspended to a steamboat or other vessel carrying thecid127) motive force for pump if water from the caisson and' wreck." The flexible caisson is i made of canvass or other cloth, of sufficient size to surround and encompass, s aid- extend sufficiently I of' to cover, all the leaks in the wreck, It should be made water proof by any of the known means, and of sufficient strength, by 'repeated layers, to resist the pressure70
of water. The lo we r edge is tapped over, or hemmed, to embrace a chain which extends entirely around, to act as a sinker, and enable the pressure of the surrounding, water to force the cloth ;or caisson up to and under the bottom of. the wreck. . For the purpose of getting access to the cargo of a were bed vessel, I employ in combination with the flexible caisson a frame, which I de nominate a platform, the construction of which should i be varied to suit the peculiar situation and condition of the wrecked vessel: shall here set forth the mode most. generally applicable. In the first, place, I :make a frame about twelve feet in length, :and as wide as the wrecked :vessel, enlarging the same if it becomes necessary in the operation of saving the wreck or cargo: The said frame consists of two bents placed twelve feet apart 2 and secured together by four girts, two. at each en d. When the frame is thus constructed, I attach it to the vessel by 0 means- of bolts, screws, chains, or other fastening, so as to render it a firm fixture to the wrecked vessel. The frame is then made to receive timbers and flooring s putting it in readiness for operations on the, wreck" When the wreck is .holly under war, I built a temporary frame around the sides of the wreck, extending from the deck or uppermost part of the wreck ab o ve :the surface of the water. When the wreck is only partially covered with water, the temporary frame may only extend around that part of the wreck which is submerged ;a: and in case the upper part of the wreck is out of the water, but a part of it is stove in or broken, ,or is otherwise d rendered so leak y as to interfere materially with the water being pumped out, I make the framework ,of s u ch extent and in such places as may be required ,by the particular circumstances. ;the f le bible caisson en circles this platform or frame as e it as the vesselcid127) and by this means access can be had to any part of the inside of the vessel for the purpose of removing: any portion of the cargo, or closing up the leaks, if the .it p ention be to raise the wreckRailroadsiour patents have been; granted during the year for improvements in railroads, and of these two are extensions of :well known patents, The other two do not present striking novel ties, but nevertheless the inventions appear .worthy of attention. The objects at which the inventors seem to have aimed are permanent e and simplicity. The following, extracts from, one of; these patents will sufficiently set forth the nature of the improvement: ,4 I do not use either string, pieces. or cross ties of wood or stone, but I make them of iron. The ,lower portion of the string piece, which I will call the under rail, has a broad bearing upon the road bed, and I connect the mi, together laterally a and longitudinally, by means of iron cross ties and chairs formed in one solid piece. : "the base of the under rails may be made ten or twelve inches wide, and three-fourths of an inch thick. The stem which rises from the middle of the base may be seven inches high, and three fourths of an in chin thickness. The top of the stern is enlarged where it is to receive and embrace- the top rail- Long this enlargement of the to pp of the; stem a groove or channel is formed i which is to receive, first a strip 'of hard wood, kyanized, or other elastic substance, and upon this is placed the top rail. The strip of wood may be about. an inch thick, and the channel should e about an inch and half deepcid127) so as to embrace the base of the upper mail to the depth of about half an inch. : The width of the channel should the.

Great perfection in the cylinder, or take and piston, would of course be. required. Thus. it sometimes happens; that: an invention, which fails in its application to. the, purpose for which it was intended, may be successfully applied to purposes which, at the beginning, were se are ely contemplated. The invention for which letters patent were granted, as above mentioned, is so described by the inventor that it cannot be understood without drawings. I to general characteristics& however, may be described as follows, viz: The tube is so constructed that it has no lateral openings, except into air tight chambers. The. piston has Gonsiderablelengh, andisfurnishiedwith a rack on each side. In the lateralaairtight chambers, opposite these racks, are placed opinions working into ;the racks upon shafts Which extend up through the- top of the chamber r: and upon which shaft opinions are placed, working into fixed racks upon the ear which is to bepropelled. At the top of each box, or air tight chamber, a conical opening is made for the shaft, like a valve seat, and a conical collar to fit is placed at the proper point of the shaft, so that when the air is exhausted from the tube or cylinder t he external air will press down the valves and keep the chambers tight. As the air is withdrawn from ne end of the tube, the piston by atmospheric pressure, comnimeiees, its motion, the racksuponittake into I the opinions upon the lower ends of the vertical. shafts above mentioned, causing them to revolve, and with them the opinions on the upper ends of the shafts, which, taking into the racks on the ear, proper it forward. The racks upon the piston, and those upon- the ear, are of such length, i that, before they are disengaged from one opinion, they engage with the next. When the head of the piston has passed the opening for the opinion, the shaft of the opinion is. by a suitabledevieraicid127sed so that the friction of the valve upon the seat is avoided t is unnecessary to comment upon the merits of this modification of the" atmospheric railway' as I deem the general; remarks which have already been made amply sufficient. The subject has been fully and ably discussed in the foreign journals tail road carsSverr application as have been i made within the year for improvements in cars for sending and descending inclinelanesSomeof them are still pending, and :up ion one of the applications letters patent have been granted. The invention, however; presents a bu, little novelty, and does not appear calculated to accomplish in practice all- that the inventor contemplated. Public attention has been called tocid127it through the papers and other i rise, and I do not deem a description of it necessary. Locomotives of this k kind are either such as are used on the inclined plane onlycid127) r such as e are intended for use upon all parts of the road. When either kind. is substituted for the stationary power the expense of the track and, its liability to derangements a e much in creased ;aecidentsiascendingi would certainly, not less frequently Occur, and the power must be sufficient not only to carry up th t trains, but also the immense weight of the locomotive.  When, therefore, the fromer or extra locomotive sa to sub suited di the result must, in my judgment: present diminished security and increased, expense. When he latter acid 127) resorted to, and these l same locomotive e (cid127s used for ascending in lined planes and for locomotion, on all the other, parts of the track, the obstacles are no less formidable. All the objections above mentioned are still accident to the 13 system: arid, in addition, the locomotive must be :much st roger and heavier in all j its parts than is h necessary or convenient on the level part of the road ; :and! to this must again the added the great weight, expense, and liability to derangements of the additional .machinery necessary to the ascent f the inclined plane; but which increases liability to accidents on 0 all parts of h the track. Oh he se- circumstances are taken into consideration, and it is` recollected that all these expensive incumbranbces must be hanging about the locomotive, and impeding its progress for perhaps one hundred miles, and can ,a only be made: udefiil for half a: me, -it' ill perhaps be concluded that inventive- genius can be more advantageously exercised in some other branch .of the 'arts than' upon locomotives i for ascending inclined planes. Line patents have been granted within the year for improvements connected with locomotives aid railroad cars. Some of them could not be fully understood without drawings. They are for improvements in hanging car bodies' so 5 as e the better to equal i ze the weight upon the wheels, and to give greater .ease of motion; -fr an improved connecting link; for replacing cars which .have been thrown off -the track ; for improvements in cat wheels; fr removing trucks by the use of a drop platform and for a mode of conncid127cting the wheels of locomotives, so that they 'she l all operate as driving wheels. It is not necessary particularly to describe them. The anti friction, box for axles, &c, in which the axle, &c. turns upon friction rollers, has heretofore been: liable to serious objections which appear to have ebeetoangreat extent removed by an: improvement patentee within the year, The inconveniences heretofore experienced, and the in v enters: mode of obiviatihg them, will be- understood by refer e tie to the following extracts from his patent i" The i nature of my invention consists in providing the axle and box with b bevelled ormilitred shoulders or collars, in: connection with aantifrietionrollershavinghthe ends' of corresponding form, to substitute railing for rubbing friction at the ends of theirollersas it is well known that in the use of anti friction ,rollers in the -boxes of carriages, and other axles much friction in guiding the rollers when made square or round as heretoafrodihasbeen' unavoidable; but by :this arrangement rubbing friction is entirely avoided, !and rolling' friction: substituted there for and hence much t jar may be avoided i by keeping the blanches close up to the ends of the tollers. .

But one patent has been granted during' the past year for improvements in bridges, and that was granted for a slight :modification in of 1 474 C. N d. 140.tbhe mode of producing ,the cancer, and need not be, here described. Several ~applications for patents: under this head have been made, some of which are still pending; but most of them have been rejected' for want of novelty. ,for (cid127orme. years past, -very few substantial improvements have been made in this branch of civil engineering. There :are periods in the history of all the useful arts during .which their progress appears to be suspended, as if they had already :attained the full limits which science as signs them. But often, after a long interval of rest, during which all have followed namely in the footsteps of -their predecessors, some ingenious and original mind arises, boldly leaving the beaten track, and, as he explore sun trodden paths by the light of his own genius, new wonders arise to mark and signal i ze his progress. -LAND Cognveyance. Carriagesseven or eight patents have been granted during the year for improvements in cocid127iitagesiwagons, and carts. Some of the inventions patented, such as self acting cart bodies, &c, evince such ingenuity, but do not present that degree of practical utility which could be desired. In such vehicles as wagons and carts, a reasonable degree of cheapness, simplicity, and durability of all the parts are indispensable; and if these are lost sight of, it is in material how much convenience l and saving of labor its extra -and unusual i fixtures may effect. The laborcid127hich' such machinery saves is not very expensive, and is saved to very (cid127ittle purpose, a sit cannot be otherwise use fully employed; :while ai arrangement of the parts might render the whole i operative, even with: the assistance of the attendant. The patents above alluded to are for improvements :in: wheels, in the hanging of carriage bodies, in axles, and in brakes. They are all slight modifications of devices long and -all known, and I do not deem it essential that a description of any of them .should be here give in: ; i -a. The most striking improvement patented within itheyeear in this f class, is the prairie ear. This invention is not presented :with the i noisy pretensions, which Frequently :characterise the ad vent of new discoveries, but seems to claim for itself no more than a experiments justify us :in believing it can accomplish: I tis not ,intended to rival the railroad system, where that can be successfully established and sustained; but it is intended for prairies; and other level arid unbroken grounds, where no: road is necessary to be built for it and where the amount of travel v ariditransportationwill not justify the construtcionofrailroads. ,Within these limbs it promises great usefulness, as there are extensive regions in the west which present an appropriate field for its successful operations. The prairie car consists of a frame of proper strength and dimensions to sustain the s steam engine or other super incumbent weight. This f ra me, instead of resting upon ordinary wheels, is s u pp or ted by hollow cylinders of a; convenient diameter, arid very wide tread. These cylinders a replaced upon axles, and :constitute the driving wheels; The cylinders a reside hollow, for lightness, and ;close, to prevent the entrance of mud or other matter, and the tread is very broad to prevent sinking into soft earth c. Two smaller wheels of similar construction are placed upon axles in a separate frame at one end of the car, to, guide it. This frame turns upon a pilot, by which it is connected with the main 'f tame, and is opeDoc. Of. 140.75rated by such means as are convenient for steering, .a.

The -differences, however, between them id those formerly in use are so trifling that I do not feel justified in going into a description of them .a, -a: *a* -a: . Letters patent have been granted for a coffee mill, (which, however, maybe: used for other: our po es) consisting of a conical co be. surrounded by a hollow cone, which is divided longitudinally into narrow sections, between which strips of steel are placed extending into the interior of the mill, and serving as teeth for grinding: In the outside of this hollow cone, and resting against the backs of the strips of steel, hoops are - placed, which b, by being contracted or in over towards the base of the cone, will force in, and thus e not hen the teeth was they are found to be worn off. :I have described this mill because: of the peculiarity which it appears t :o present, but not with a view of expressing an opinion respecting its utility, Rhorsepowersapplications under this head have been quite n numerous during the past year but most of them n have been :ejected for want of novelty. As the i horse power" consists merely of the machinery which serves as a medium for communicating the power of the animal to the machine to be driven, it naturally follows : that the field 'which it presents for the inventor to occupy is very limited. :marrow as it is, however, multitudes have for years been striving to gather laurels upon it; with what success, it is not difficult to judge a prior. But, notwithstanding the vast no mber of inventions and re inventions which have been made in this kind of machinery; the subject does not appear to -have been entirely exhausted. Give patents have been granted during the year, one of which is for improvements which :render :the- machine- so i convenient, compact, and cotinparatively free from friction, that I deem it well worthy of notice. It is impossible to present a perfect idea of it without drawings; but the following extracts from the patent will convey a general otlineThe nature of my invention consists in arranging two series of cog or belt wheels upon two sets of s shafts each wheel, with its pining, being on a section of one of t tie shafts, and the sections of each shaft working one within the other, and running in the same direction, instead of the reverse direction, or upon permanent sleeves, receiving one section within and the other without the advantages of which arrangements wait be fully pointed out hereafteruBy the arrangement of the two series of wheels upon the two axes, transferring the motion from the first to the second, then back to the first, and the ni again: to a the -second, and so on r to any n number of :wheels, the shaft f one wheel turning on the shaft with ii it, and (as the results of the arrangement of the wheels in the" same direction and with greater velocity, the friction occasioned by the turning 'of the outer section on theinnerterids toitcarryit around and thus greatly reduces the actual fiction ; but another important advantage resulting from this arrangement of the v heels, besidess th-tof gate eat compact ness, is the- relieving: the shafts from r much of the pressure, unavoidable, in the usual mio de of hearing up. Having thus fully described the characteristic of my in v ention, and the manner of making and using the same, I wish it to be distinctly understood that- I d o of mike claim t to the .employment t of a series of wheels, having 'the: same axis of motion :hen the sections of the shafts are separated from each other by a permanent sleeve, or without the sleeve, when
7the arrangement of the .wheels is such; as to :cause the sections of the shaft to turn, in reverse :directions, as these are well known and do not attain the end contemplated by me and pointed out above; nor do I claim simply oiling a journal through a perforation in the shaft, as this has long since been known; but what I do claim as my invention, and desire to secure by, letters patent, is the arrangement: of, two sets of cog or belt wheels, and opinions connected i therewith, each set consisting of not less than two wheels, with their appropriate opinions, or two shafts made in sections, turning on each other; and in the same direction, for the purpose of avoiding friction, and rendering the 'machinery :compact, as herein fully described. And I also claim, in combination with the arrangement of shafts herein described, the -oil passages, whereby ,the oil, applied -at two places, is conducted to all the rubbing surfaces of the series of shafts and bearings, as herein described." . I do not deem it proper to extend my remarks to any other inventions belonging to i this class. : ; ; . Machi Nery For Manufacti   Uri Of- And Worki Of Lumber. This class comprehends a great variety of machinery; but; as nearly all its branches have attained a high degree of perfection, fewer striking improvements are to be expected: than in some of the other classes which are of; more recent origin, or Those, which, in some of their branches, require greater nice ty or complexity of machinery- .a. -SSacid127) mills your patents have been granted, within the year, for sawmills: .three for -ordinary sawing of boards, &c, and the fourth for sawing irregular shapes. The :for met are for improvements in the carriage and apparatus for setting the log or making the mill self acting. Sawmills have long since been pat end, which, after the log is properly plaedupanthe carriage, the various parts of the machine adjusted, and the gate, which admits the pro telling power, opened, will saw the whole to g into boards of any one thickness required, and close the gate and stop the machinery after the work is done. His: being the case, it will be readily perceivedthatsifar as results are concerned, but little remains to i be done for the self acting saw mill. The improvements patented as above mentioned, are for modifications in the means of effecting some one or more of the above :operations; but no new effect -has been produced :the mills above allied t are :o- complicated .to .be understood without drawings; and, although useful, a minute description, of them would add but little to .the inform nation formerly extant upon this subject. Letters patent for an improve e in mills for sawing i regular shapes, such as planks for gun- stocks, &c, have been granted within the year, of which the! following is an outline: An ordinary saw gate is arranged in the usual way for giving the up and down motion to the saw. The saw is connected to this gate by levers having their full ra- upon the. top and bottom of the gate, which levers extend i both in front and behind the gate. The ends of the levers opposite tocid127those jointed to the i saw are connected to each other by a rod. The carriage i carries the plan- to be s awed towards the saws in the usuasilays :to this carriage grooved guides or patterns are attached, which are adapted to the shape to be s awed, and toSEDc Of. 140.each other. Through sliding blocks in these grooves the saws work. With this arrangement' off parts, it will be perceived that, i as th e carriage advances, the guide and book give the proper direction to the edge of the saw, and the     lever; permit the proper lateral r motion. Thus, ai si the carriage moves on, I the saw gate gives the saw its up and down motion i, the levers allow its, lateral :motioriiand, the: guide and black, through which the saw passes, give a proper direction to the saw. Any n timber of saws, similarly guided, may be used.

Secondly, the mode herein describe a of moving and measuring out the prime is by the movement of the lock, substantially as described t will be perceived that the prime, from the peculiar shape given to it, is such, that machinery for feeding it can be made to operate upon it with great accuracy; and it is therefore the less important to describe the feeding apparatus, which would require drawings. The subject of the second patent above mentioned will be clearly understood from the following extract: " This improved cannon is formed of a series of rings or short hollow cylinders, of wrought iron or steel, or of wrought iron and steel combined, which rings are joined together by their ends in sufficient number to make the length required for the whole cannon. Each ring or cylinder is formed by winding or turning a piece of iron of the thickness required for the walls of the cannon round a man dr il, and welding its ends together by a scar fed joint; or, second, several rings may be formed of thin iron, and of different sizes, so that one shall slip over the outside of another, until a sufficient thickness for the cannon shall be attained, when, by welding these several rings together, a single ring is obtained; or, thirdly, long bars of iron or steel of a width equal to the length of a ring, the ends being scar fed down, may be wound over a man dr il or spy idle, in the manner that pieces of rib and are wound upon a block. These spirals being welded together, form a complete ring or hollow cylinder; or, fourth, long and narrow bars may be wound upon a maridril, side by side, and upon the top of each other, until sufficient length and thickness be attained for, a ring; and these turns being welded together, the ring is formed' They are next to be heated and placed end to end, and welded together i and thus a hollow frustum of a cone is formed of a length required for the cannon. The tr unions are to be welded upon the sides of the cannon, either before the full length is made out, or when it is completed, or they are welded upon a separate ring or band larger than the cannon, and secured to the same by a screw, the thread of which is cut upon the outside of the cannon, to fit a corresponding thread cut upon the inside of the ring. The breech pin may be screwed into the cannon after the cannon is bored and turned, or it may be welded in previously to finishing the cannon." What I claim as any invention in the foregoing specification is this, viz: I have invented a new and improved kind of cannon, which is formed of a series of rings or short hollow cylinders, joined together by thdLir682 ends, nl sufficient number to form the length, required for the eatinonand for this I claim letters patent The process of the patentee differs but slightly from n some of those previously resorted to, but his practical results may be widely different. The principal obstacle which has heretofore been met with in the manufacture of wrought iron guns has not consisted in the difficulty of forming or welding the parts of which the gun has been composed, but in weldilagthese parts to the already partly formed gun and this part of the process does not appear to have been particularly improved) For this purpose it is necessary, at each successive welding, to raise to a welding heat the large mass of iron to which the parts are to be joined. When the guns are comparatively small, they may bear this process without serious injury, and without great danger of imperfect sons in the welding; but when the gun is very large, the intensity of the heat required, and the readiness with which iron combines with oxygen, carbon, and other impure ties to which it is necessarily exposed during the process, are such, that the iron becomes deteriorated, and a perfect weld is rendered a matter of extreme difficulty, if not impossibility. I n' all ages, since the invention of cannon, attempts have been made to construct them of wrought iron; but when subjected to experiment. they have uniformly failed, and gone out of use- When they have been burst by powder, or otherwise broken, the fractures in their different parts have presented almost every variety from tough, perfectly welded wrought iron, to the coarsest granular ; and at many points the metal does not appear to have adhered at all. The features of the iron above mentioned may be found i in fragments of the gucid127im which recently burn~ ton board the Princeton. Until some improvement in welding; i not hitherto known or practised, shall have been discovered, to obviate the imperfect sons which now appear t to be incident to it, it is to be hoped that no attempt to in produce *very large guns of this kind will be successfulSFurther remarks might be made upon this subject, which is at the i sent time one of vast importance; but I withhold them, as they would lead me beyond the proper limits of a report. Shydrauli   Of And Pneumati   Of. Since this i class came under: my charge, applications, have been numerous ;but they have generally been rejected: for want of novelty; or are still pending.

Enough, however, has been developed to show that inventive genius has not slept, but has steadily shed its cheering influence upon every department of the useful arts. Sbnme of my remarks may, perhaps, be regarded as strictures; but they were not written in un kindness, nor in a dictator i al spirit of self sufficiency.

Letter from Professor Horse, upon the magnetic telegraphs in operationiSin Eropenew York February 2, 1846,DEARSiR: In compliance with your request, that I would give you some facts in relatitocid127) may, electro magnetic telegraph illustration of the difference between my system and other systems more recently established inopEurope, I would say -that, with a view of personally examiningSeti f telegraphs in England and France, I made a rapid tour in thoseQuntriesin the i autumn of the. last year. The electric telegraph most in use ~it present in, (cid127pGeat Britain -is that invented by Messrs. Took and whetstone, the former of .home appears, had his attention firstdrawntthe subject at Vienna, In, 36 and Professor Heat stone dates his own invention from the year 1837. The electric telegraph upon the Paris and You en railroad is the joint production, I believe, of I. Boy and M. Frequent, and conceived and executed with ri the last two years.  To illustrate more perfectly the difference, between, my system of magnetic telegraphs and the two just mentioned, I will briefly describe the two European inventions. The principle of mine has been already described in a former report of the Commissioner of Patents, and it is, therefore, unnecessary to repeat the description of its machinery. For the abbreviated description and plates of Heat stones rotating disc telegraph, invented by him in 1841, as an improvement on his former plans, I am indebted to my ingenious friend and assistant, Alfred Nail, esq Professor Heat stone invented his first telegraph in 1837. It was an improvement of Baron Shillings S needle telegraph, invented in 1833. The deflection of the magnetic needle is the basis of both. The attractive power of the electro magnet, which is the basis of my printing telegraph invented in 1832, was used by Heat stone in 1837, simply to release the de tent of a common alarm to give notice to the attendant that a communication was about to be made. This magnet was made to act by a special circuit, by means of which a magnetic needle was deflected and closed a circuit with a local battery which charged the magnet. This is the only purpose for which the power of the electro magnet was used in the telegraph by Professor Heat stone, until the year 1841. There is no instance of any attempt to record or print characters by means of magnet ism previous to my invention. Wvheastones Rotating Disc Telegraph, invented in 1841. Fig. 1 represents that portion of the instrument which belongs to the transmitting station, of which K is a circular disc, with the alphabet andnumerals marked in two concentric circles upon it; a are handles projecting from its rim, one to every letter, by means of which the disc is turned upon its axis, and brought to that position, b, required for signal iting a letter. O is a side view of the disc, K ; t is the rim of the disc, with its holders h is a portion of the axis of the disc, shown as broken off; c represents a* They who are desirous of obtaining an account of most of the telegraph in plans, on the electric principle hitherto devised, will find Mr. Nails larger work, entitled " The American Electro. Magnetic Telegraph" a valuable addition to their library. Foci N01ig 40 8 Fig. -1 silver band surrounding a pulley or hut upon the axis, and directly behind the disc. -upon the hut ,re metallic ribs b, parallel with its axis, corresponding in number to the letters on the dial ;a, Each rib forms a metallic contact with the silver band , and. are separated from each other by pieces of ivory fastened to the hut, Both the ribs and ivory .pieces are made perfectly smooth and even upon their surface; his a metallic spring, with a portion of it pressed against that portion of the hut between the silver band c, and the disc t, in a manner that when the disc is turned the metallic ribs and ivory pieces shall alternately come in contact with it. To this spring is soldered a wire connected with one pole of the battery g, and from the other pole proceeds the wire n: d is another metallic spring, similar to e, but pressing only upon the silver band, with which it is always in contact, and to which a wire, p, is soldered. Whenever the spring e is in contact with any of the metallic ribs, there is a continuous connection from 'n to p, viz: from p, to the spring in contact with the silver band c, the nee to the rib with which the spring e is in contact; then to the spring e; then to the battery g, and then to the wire n. I f, however, the disc O should be turned, so that the spring e is in contact with the ivory, then the circuit is broken at that point; and in this manner the circuit is alternately broken and closed as the wheel O is turned from one letter to another, by means of the handles at t. Fig. 2 represents a side elevation of the dial and clock work of the receiving station. A represents an edge view of the electro magnet, from which proceed the two wires, v and i, which connect with the wires n and p, of figure 1. J and J is the brass frame containing the wheel work, C and E, the pin wheel D, the dial plate I, and the barrel B, which in driven by a weight and cord. In the side of the wheel D are pins projecting from the rim, parallel with the axis, and are equal in number to the divisions, or letters, upon the dial I. They are, however, placed alternately on each side of the rim. F is the ar mature of the magnet 86. Fig. 2.fastened upon a horizontal rod, sliding freely 1 through the standards 1 and 2. G represents a spring, fastened to the frame J, and which carries back the ar mature, F, when the magnet has ceased to attract it. From the ar mature there extends downward an arm, K, which, as it approaches the pin wheel D, presents two arms or pallet s-one on each side of the wheel. These pallets are so arranged with regard to theirs That if ne pallet releases a pin on one side of the wheel, the sameimViement will cause the other pallet on th th other side to arrest the motinilorf the wheel by its striking against the next alternate pin. i H and I is ain edge view of the circular dial, enclosed in a case, i with asiibgle open i, a at 0; so that only one letter at a time can be ;been. : This dial; I, is i every respect marked as the disc in fig. 1: ' ' Fig. 3.-
. 87 fig. 3 represents the two instruments, the transmitting instrument, and the right hand figure the receiving instrument. The ^wires v and i are respectively connected with p and n. It will be observed that the ar mature His not attracted, and that the right hand pallet is checking the pin wheel, -so that the dial is stationary. I f, however, ]the disc t is turned, so that the circuit is completed, by the contact of the spring e with one of the ribs, instantly the ar mature is attracted by the electro magnet, which will carry the right hand pallet away from the pin wheel, and which will then move by the action of the weight upon the barrel B, until it is checked by the left hand pallet, which had advanced to the wheel at the same time the other receded. This single operation has moved i the disc one division, and the ar mature is still attracted. Now, let the disc t be turned until the spring e has been passed by the rib, and is in contact with the ivory only instantly the current ceases ; the ar mature recedes from i the magnet by the action of the spring I this has taken the left hand. pallet from the pin wheel, i which is permitted to move until the next pin strikes against the right hand pallet. This has now brought another letter in front of the aperture at H. Thus, it will be seen that the design of this instrument is to bring into view, at the aperture, such letters as are required in transmitting a message. Suppose letter A is at the point b of the disc, and letter A of the dial is opposite the opening. The instrument is now ready to transmit; and let the letter I be the first of the message. The operator gently turns the disc round in the direction of the arrow, -so that each time the circuit is broken a new letter appears at the dial, and each time it is closed by the operation of the pallets, in checking and releasing the pin wheel. This is its operation until the letter I has reached the point b, when a short pause is made. The next letter, H, requires but one movement of the disc, then follows A, then V, then E. In relation to this instrument, Professor Daniel l says: " We can only further briefly allude to two of the: most important ,modifications of the invention, which Professor Heat stone has made for specific purposes. By substituting for the paper disc, on the circumference; of which ,the letters a reprinted, a thin disc of brass, cut from the circumference to the centre so as. to form 24 springs, on the extremities of which types or punches are: placed, and adding a mechanism, the de tent of which, acted on by an electro magnet, causes a hammer to strike the punch, against a cylinder, round which are rolled alternately several sheets of white paper and of the blackened paper used in the manifold writing apparatus, he has been. enabled to obtain, without presenting any resistance to the type wheel, several distinct printed copies at the same time, of the messagetransmititdThis invention of Professor Heat stone Critical ly: examined inSepVe1mber and November last, (1845) at the Line Alms and at the Paddington station, London, and also at Amsterdam, in October: . At Paddington, I gave a name of 19 letters to be transmitted, and requested specially that it should be sent and returned as speedily as possible, as I wished to test the number of letters that could be shown in a minute. The result was, that the name (after several failures to spell it right, and giving sometimes the letter before and sometimes the letter after the true letter in the alpha* ,DanielPs I introduction to Chemical Philosophy 'O- " 2d e ,it ion: London, 1843.88 be tic arrangement in the disc) was completed in one n minute and a quarter. I inquired how many could be shown in a minute, and learned that ordinarily 15 or 16 letters, although 20, and even 24, had been recognised. This rate was corroborated at the Amsterdam station of the Harlem and Amsterdam line, on which Heat stones disc telegraph is used. 15 or 16 letters per minute was the usual rate of transmission ; but I found here, as at Paddington, that the disc did not rotate with correctness; often giving the wrong letter, so that the word was generally guessed at, and frequently required repetition. In this arrangement it will be observed that Professor Heat stone uses but one circuit. In Paris, in the latter part of October and beginning of November, 1845,I examined the telegraph in system in operation upon the experimental line, made by order of the government between Paris and You en, a distance of 85 miles. This system is an ingenious application of a rachel wheel escape men t, acted upon by an electro magnet, to the movement of two arms, imitating the configurations of the aerial telegraph already in use in France. The following is a concise description. F Fig. 1 represents the face of the telegraph in instrument; A B is a fixed dark line upon the face or dial plate; X is an arm having one motion on its centre in the direction of the dots; A C and B D are movable arms, turning on the pilots A and B respectively. The dotted lines are the various positions which each arm can assume, making, by their combined movements, 128 different configurations. The hand X, when horizontal, indicates that the sign is to be read horizontally; when inclined in the direction of the dots, the sign is to be read perpendicular ly. This telegraph is operated by two circuits, one for the movement of each arm, the axles of which pass through the pilots A and B respectively; behind the dial and upon this axle is a rachel or escape men t wheel of 8 cogs. The cogs of this wheel, connected with a clock train of wheels, are released by the power of the electro magnet operating upon a lever. At every release of a cog, by the action of the magnet the arm takes a new position, assuming for an instant each intermediate position until it comes to the one desired, when it stops. A single connection and break of the circuit re leases one cog. With this arrangement M. Frequent states that 10 configurations or signs can be given in a minute. In a note, however, from Mr. Box, the accomplished administrator of the telegraphs of France, he informs that 28 have been given in a minute; but ordinarily it can only give 10 or 12, and this (it will be perceived) requires 2 circuits; consequently it gives at the. 89 rate of 6 signs ordinarily, or at the utmost 14 per minute, for a single circuit . It will be sufficient to state that by my system I give, with a single circuit, at least 60 characters in a minute; not merely shown temporarily, but recorded in a permanent manner upon paper, to be read at any time. The efficiency of the three systems will stand thus represented infiguresThe American system, 60 per minute The English system, 15 per minute The French system, 6, or at most 14 per minute with the advantages in favor of the American, that the characters are made permanent and the operation of the instrument sure r, the simplicity of the machinery rendering it less liable to be deranged by atmospheric changes or other accidents.

S Remarks Of The Tabular Esti   Mate. Of  n presenting the foregoing tabular estimate, it may be proper, in order to prevent mistake, to repeat what has been stated in the former reports of this office that no claim is laid to complete accuracy. All that has been attempted has been merely to furnish an approximation, which, although in particulars sometimes rising above, and at others falling short of the actual state of the crops, might still serve, in general, for want of better materials the purpose of comparison, and form some basis for calculations, in gross, respecting the agricultural resources of our country. To hope to accomplish anything beyond this, with the means at command at present, would be a vain undertaking. Met it is believed that the grounds on which the estimate is made, with a readiness at all times to correct errors, and an increasing preparation of experience in the use of the materials, will aid essentially in giving more reliable accuracy. Those who will candidly review the history of the crops, as it has been col later from: notices made on the spot, and mark the causes at work to affect them, it is p resumed will admit, for the most part, the justness of our conclusions and to such it is unnecessary to state the extreme difficulty of arriving at an estimate which will satisfy those who choose some easier method of decision. Various methods have been proposed for reaching the desired object; but, in the absence of an actual census, no better mode than the employment of similar data, yet more extensively gathered and perfect ed by comparisons, appears to us practicable. Some writers in the public journals seem to place great reliance on the amount of wheat brought to the Atlantic ports, and claim that this is the true st test of the increase or decrease of the crop. While we admit that this is an important element of c amputation, and as such is ever regarded in our estimate, it is doubted, however, if this alone is sufficient. The comparative decrease or increase of the other crops in the place where such product is raised, may often exercise an important influence to modify such a calculation. If one product, on which reliance has been placed for feeding the stock, has been cat off, resort must be had to another; and the degree of such consumption may thus very essentially vary the surplus left for the market; so that, though the amount of wheat raised in the western States may be actually greater or less, as the case may be, the amount brought to the Atlantic ports may be less or greater, according to a variety of other circumstances irrespective of production. The demand in the way of trade, therefore, is only one of the many things to be considered. The greater previous stock remaining; the greater ease of placing the surplus of any year in market; the kind of payment received; the ease and expense of preparation for use at any given period, with a variety of other circumstances, must tend not a little to modify the amount received at the nearest place of exit, or at the remote r markets. To that the amount passing any lines of transportation, or entered at any office, will not by itself give the correct data for an approximation to an accurate estimate. In using the various elements on which estimates are made, reference must likewise be had to the ability, from experience or means of observation, of the informant, his freedom from bias, and the absence or presence of extraneous causes which may operate to influence his judgment. It is obvious, therefore, that it is no easy matter to soft out and discriminate the true from' the false, and thus form, by a series of deductions, a result which may have some pretensions to be regarded as founded on correct princiDoc. To- 140. 93 pies of judgment. Such means, however, as are within, our reach, have been resorted to, and, with all necessary deductions, they have been employed to secure, as far as practicable, a candid view of the whole state, of the case. The amount of materials collected during the past year exceeds that of any former year; though we still have to regret, that, on account of no answers to some of the circulars for information, the means for estimate in some sections is less complete than it might otherwise have been. Greater number of the public journals and agricultural papers, both at home and abroad, have been carefully examined, and such information as they contained col later and arranged in such a manner as to form a history of the crops through the season. The advantage of this plan is apparent, as it enables any one to judge from one period to another, of the causes influencing the staple crops of the country, and affords, in some degree, a criterion by which to arrive at the more correct conclusion as to the amount raised. :I n consequence of a census of population in four States, we have ,been enabled to correct our table of estimated population. These are New Work, Michigan, I illinois, and Georgia. In New Work, directions were likewise given to the marshals to collect the amount of the principal crops raised during the preceding year. Of   He se statistics have been procured from the office of the secretary of the State of New Work, and have been made the basis of our estimate for the year 1845., The same has been done, so far as any such data could be obtained, in the case of the other States. The disinclination of many to communicate the amount of the products of their industry .on. such; occasions, induces a belief that such an estimate will oftener be found to fall below than to exceed the actual amount of the, crops so raised. Allowing this cause to operate to some degree, it would tend to approximate our former estimate considerably nearer to* the statistics reported on such official authority. In most cases it has been deemed advisable to give only the round numbers, leaving the fraction al parts. This cause sufficiently shows the comparative product, and is as likely as any other to be accurate. Sthle progress of agricultural knowledge is steadily onward. States a returning with deeper i interest to providing means for encouraging the farmers and planters in their respective limits; surveys of the soil and various products are set on a foot; and thus, much valuable information is elicited. Men of science are devoting themselves to the illustration of the principles of agriculture, as a science founded on careful experiment. New journals are every year established, and numerous volumes published, designed to convey to, the husband man, planter, and brazier, the orchard ist and the dairy man, the results of investigations at home and abroad. Agricultural societies and farmers' clubs are greatly on the increase; and the numbers who attend their exhibitions, and i take a part in their deliberations, show the deeper interest which is everywhere awakened in securing the benefit of these auxiliaries, to the correct and profitable arrangement and development of the agricultural industry of the country Some, advances are likewise making towards the introduction of this science as a subject of common school education and instruction in primary schools, as well as in the establishing of institutions more expressly designed for this particular i purpose. To subject is' receiving more earnest attention, in r all the i various periodicals and l volumes adapted to, the 94 Abc. No. 140.agricultural class, than. is that of manures; and the applications ificherliical and- geological science to this object are daily becoming for~ important and useful. : : .a' "new enterprise, too, has recently been directed towards the improvement of stock by the importation and crossing of breeds, and particular care to note their adaptation to the different sections of the country. ;very year introduces, likewise, to the agriculturists, some additional implement by which his labor is lessened, or better done ; and; while ,his thus saved somewhat of the sweat of his brow, he is likewise assured of greater profit from the fruits of his industry. There is, thus, mutual dependence as to the, pursuits of the farmer and those of the artisanMechanical industry presents him with l the results of her inventive genius. With these in hand, he forces from the earth her increase, and, by the blessings of a kind Providence, is enabled to pour out to the community around him a lavish of natures bounties, such as no' other country can so universally boast. In view of his own improved tools and meanscid127of culture, he may *well wonder how his fathers, and even himself, formerly, could have been satisfied with" the ruder ones which have been i so long in' use. We are however, but at the commencement of these better things. The researches of each successive year' nd the multiplied facilities adcid127ded to the train of conveniences enjoyed, authorize the t belief that the advancement 'of agricultural i industry is destined far to exceed' any that his yet been seen. There is no want of adaptation of soil, or of fertility, or of dear is of industry, or of bone and sinew :o free yeomanry, who imayHenjy thefruitsiof their :own tabor: and as an: increasing populationspreadifar al: d wide over the whole face of :the land, its abundance, under the 'smiles of Heaven, will ever suffice for both the native join and for the emigrant, who, from foreign shores, seeks an asylum from the oppressiornwhifchstarves him and grinds him' to the dust. Even the evils 'which attend i the greater or less failure ; f  sitieim or t ant crop, as in the present year has to some extent been rise can iththepotato crop, are 'not without their good effects; mason much as they will all forth scientific investigation, observation, "and practical industry to determine and apply the remedy, and thus often throw new 'ighcid127t' on the tirtuetheoay of germination or progress.

As commerce and enterprise open to us ;the vast empire of China, and the interior of. South America, it would not be surprising if 'there should be discovered there products well- adapted to, sections ofourownv country, but which are as yet unknown among us i It should, therefore, be an object to keep a lookout for everything which may tend to benefit the agricultural industry of our country: ;and even if the boon is gained by the price of numerous fruitless experiments, yet success may often' reward diligence and patient effort to accomplish the end. By a reference to the report of the Commissioner of Public Hands, we learn -that 1,754;763 acres have been sold during the past year. Now, i all though we can by no means assume that all l of this, or even the greater portion of it, goes under cultivation at once, it still must be supposed that a part of it must add to the -amount devoted to agricultural supply in the States where it is located; and this item deserves notice' in forming our estimate of its products. :the same ,may be said with respect to the amount of increased population from emigration i The number of emigrants from Great Britain arid European countries generally, to the United Statesyis believed to have been greater during the past year than in the previous one, when it amounted to from: 80 to 100,000; ,a portion of these, no doubt engage in i agriculturalpursuitsandthus have some inflouencennot only on the consumption, but also the production- f the :crops. The Season 'some, persons reading :the i former, reports may have thought the :fewpagesqdevoted i oe extracts from i -the various public journals 'relating to the weather are o f little or no *use; but we now not thus' view the matter- In the j contrary, we believe thaticid127iheresare advantages in 1 taking even the partial information just as it is give sn, and presenting :it to th public frdtoyearto year, that they may judge of the variations to which the different crops are subjected, and the consequences which have thus 'resulted. 'behave- therefore watched- With increased -attention I the indications of the season, as noticed in the public papers. These, though in most respects too defective for any extended generalization, yet aid somewhat in the conclusions formed respecting the crops. It is obvious 8 that a favorable planting season, or the state of the soil, as previously affected by the various changes of the weather, must i hare some influence on the productive ness 0 of the crop, allowing the usual season of growth to have been enjoyed. Very year exhibits greater or less degrees of cold or heat in the, varioinls sections of our vast country ;a- and ranging, as it does, from; latitude i 25 to 490 N., not including Oregon, which reaches to 549 40, embracing I seaboard and inland, mountain and plain interjected by numerous rivers, and over spread in many parts with forests in all their native wild ness and vast ness of growth the diversities of season must, of necessity, be numerous, and their effects deserve serious consideration. As the seed time or growing period, or harvest, mustvtarybyweeks, and in some cases mouths, it is obvious that, were there a general prevalence of some particular temperature or accidents of climate, the effect will often be found to be different, if not wholly opposite, even 9 in the several sections where such a cause exists. The same remark applies to the nature of the crops. A season highly favorable to one kind of production may be injurious to another. The same extended rain which is needed, and therefore highly beneficial, in one part of the country, may be less adapted to another in a different condition, in relation to the similar or diverse crop, as the case may be. The weather, for instance to take up the subject in a somewhat different point of view which may be most suitable at some period to a young growth of cane or of cotton, may be unfavorable to another kind of crop, as that of corn or of <a name="potatoes0"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The season of sowing or planting, from one extreme point to another, probably reaches over two months or ten weeks. A rain, therefore, which might benefit a crop already in the ground, or injure it, might exert a very disastrous or favorable influence on some other, according to the previous condition in preparing the soil for the seed of some other product yet to be deposited therein. The have gathered a large collection of notices respecting both the cold and heat, from April and on, in various parts of the country; of course, we shall have room for but a few quotations; but it is evident that there have been unusual variations of temperature during the past season. Late frosts are spoken of in the early part of the season even in the southern sections of our country, where they are less to be expected than in the northern States. In connection with these, also, we meet with very frequent complaints and lamentations on account of the want of rain. In the month of April the drought is stated to have been unusually severe in some of the southern States. This seems to have been peculiarly the case in South Carolina and Georgia. Thus the Tiny ah Observer remarks: The season continues very in auspicious for the planters in this neighborhood. April is rapidly passing away, without having given the showers common to the month. The tributary streams continue low, and the river is salt up to town. Several planters are using brickish or salt water to get up the rice crop; and those who plant in open trenches, without covering, are annoyed by the May birds. The corn and <a name="potato2"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops are suffering from the general drought Again: the Green ville Mountaineer, of April 25th, has the following notice : " Continued drought Another week has passed without sufficient rain to lay the dust. The wheat and o at crops are very much injured, and in some fields entirely cut off. The corn and cotton seed that has been planted in many places cannot come up. The drought seems to extend throughout the whole United States, with the exception of light and partial showers in some sections Again: we learn from the Savannah Republican of April 30th, that ' in Madison, Georgia, no rain of any consequence has fallen in four weeks. With the exception of one or two very slight showers, the deprivation at Savannah has been longer. Any of the planters are a month behind their prospects of last year at: this periodSThe Savannah: Sentinel, in the early part of May, says: " We do not recollect ever to have seen so dry a spring as this has been.

I now is merit ined about the middle of May in Paine; in Boston, Providence; Green field, and other places in New England, we find statements of severe cold, frosts, ice, &c, which injured the fruit and vegetables in May, and even in June. The same was the case in the State of New Work. We quote a few notices as specimens of numerous others which might be mentioned' The late frosts The recent frosts have been very destructive to -p les and peaches in several counties in western New Work. The corn crop is not far enough advanced to be much injured by this untimely freezing. 'the weather is still cold, (may 20th;) anything but favorable to summer crops. Heat generally looks well.

Again: " Cry weather he have been informed that copious showers have recently fallen in some sections of the district; but, in this neighborhood, and throughout the country generally, the drought has continued, and the temperature has been that of summer heat.

The same state of things prevailed in Georgia, as the following notices abundantly testify: " Great drought pain is wanted far and wide in this region of country.

The weather the Sort Paines Whig of the 7th June, says: " The drought still continues, with the exception of a few slight showers, scarcely sufficient to moist en the parched earth.

No. in 103 endure much longer. In many places it is but from knee to breast high, and already in tassel and silk. The Chattahoochee is lower than it has been known to be for many years. The steamboat Columbus, however, with great difficulty, and much to our surprise, reached here on Tuesday last from below, stored her freight, and returned to the bay n Alabama and Florida, also, the same complaints are numerous. The drought in Alabamathe Montgomery D vert iser of the 4th July says: "one of the severe st droughts which has ever been experienced now prevails in this section of Alabama. In very many plantations the corn crop is nearly destroyed. Pain even now cannot restore it. Cotton in many places is seriously injured; and, unless we have rain soon, a short crop may be expected. As to gardens, especially in this vicinity, most of them are entirely burnt up n Alabama, too, the drought extensively prevails. The Cahawbagazette, July 2, says: 'A general drought seems to pervade the whole country. The corn crop is a total loss in many places rain cannot save it' The' Marion Review states that 'vegetation is withered dried literally dried, like hay. We have not had, in many places, rain enough to wet the ground since the 1st of Maythe drought in Floridathe Tallahassee Star of the 13th of June says: " This whole region of country is, at present, suffering under one of the most severe and distressing droughts which have been experienced in this climate for many years. Most of our springs, branches, and creeks have failed, and many of the old wells, which have hitherto borne a good character, have suddenly flanked out. Our different kinds of crops are consequently suffering considerably. Gardens, even of the youngest class, have a very old and withered appearance, and many of the usualdelicacies of the season, of the vegetable kind, have come missing" The weather, crops, 4d c- Never have we experienced such a continued spell of warm weather in Florida. For several weeks the atmosphere has been very oppressive. The thermometer ranged from 930 to 990. To rain of any consequence has fallen in the mean time, and what little breeze we have had has been from off the land; hot and dry, like the Siroccowithering all vegetation. Most of the crops in this vicinity, we fear, will fail. The fruit on the trees appears to be willing, for the want of a few genial showers. But the city is, as usual, very healthy it. Augustine, (a) June 28. According to the Jackson ville Statesman, the prospects of the planters in that portion of Florida are completely ruined. Very thing is perishing under the excessive heat and drought. The crops are withered to a crisp, the ponds and streams have dried up, and the cattle are dying for want of water. Under date of July, we learn the following respecting the prospect in Louisiana: "I n Louisiana the drought is severe in some sections. The Batonrouge Gazette says : The drought, for some time past, has dried up the corn and sugar cane. However, last week some parts of the parish were visited with showers highly beneficial to those in the favored range. In some plantations one half received repeated showers, while the other half is withering for want of the same benefit for was the drought confined to the Atlantic coast; it prevailed exten104
sively at the west; and even in August we meet with, notices like thefollowingThe drought The Detroit Advertise r says : This vicinity has, for some time, been suffering severely from the dry weather. The ground is perfectly parched. Grass and all growing crops are nearly dead from thirst. The prospect for fall feed and winter fodder is especially gloomy. The skies yesterday gave some promise of a shower, at least; but all signs fail in dry times. The weather is, also, oppressively hot; it has scarcely been more so during the summer Various statements are found in the public journals which show the extreme heat which prevailed, especially in the month of July, by: which it appears that for days in succession the thermometer ranged from 87 up to 950, and even 1 020 or 1040. The quantity of rain which fell, according to meteorological journals published, was unusually small. We quote the following, as it presents a fair specimen of many other notices which might be given; The weather during the last week has been excessively hot and oppressive beyond all former record not only in this city, but also at different places from which we have heard. The range of the thermometer in the shade was, at Savannah, Georgia, from June 10th till the 24th, never below 90. In the 2 3d and 24th it stood at 1020."I n Charleston, July 10, 94 Boston, 12, 101 Rochester, 12, 97 New Work, 12,1 94 Philadelphia, 13, 101 New Work, 13, 99 Albany, 13, 98 Brooklyn, 13, 95 Baltimore, 13, 95Hartfiod, 13, 91 New Work, 14, 98 Brooklyn, 14, 96.2From observation at Concord, New Hampshire, we learn, in the Farmers' Monthly Visitor of September 30th-"From the 3d of July to 2 1st of August, there did not more than a quarter of an inch of rain, on what would moist en the ground about an inch deep, fall at any one time; the whole amount of rain between the two dates being less than one inch; the whole amount in July and August being about four inches, and three quarters of it fell the first three days of July, and the last week of August t is stated l in the Genesee Farmer, published at Rochester, New Work, that the "total amount of rain in June, July, and August, was 10 inches journal kept at Athens, Georgia, and given in the Southern Cultivator, says: " The total amount of rain for March was 0 70 ; April, 0.12;May, 1.21; and June, 0.48 inch; for July, 3.60; August, 0.74; September, 0.58.""I n Chicago, from April 26 to May, 1.63; May 26 to June 27, 4,12;from July to August, 2.93; August to September, 1.53."The, quantity of rain noted at Louisville, Kentucky, in July, was 4.34inches. 
105The ravages of insects do not seem to have been as great as in some former years ; at least, the complaints of them in the public journals, and the notices of the crops furnished, are not so numerous. The army worm is mentioned as troublesome near Raleigh, North Carolina; in Michigan, I onya county ; also, in- Wisconsin; and locus to in Missouri and Louisiana the fly and weevil in sire sections of the west, though not to the extent of former years. These will mostly be noticed in their proper place, under the respective crops thus suffering. The damage by violent storms and tempests has also, it is believed, been: less than usual though occasional notices have met our eye of injury thus sustained. In an inspection of the tabular est innate, it will be seen that wheat is raised in all the States except one Louisiana. In the census statistics 69 bushels was put down to this State; but, as the amount was so trifling i it has not been deemed advisable to retain it. The amount raised in Rhode I s land and Florida is also very small. Of barley it may be said, that though but a minor crop in most States, there are but two, Louisiana and Florida, where it: is not numbered among 'the crops. Oats, I indian corn, <a name="potatoes3"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and hay, are more or less cultivated in every State oftheUnion; rye, to some extent, in t all except in Florida ; buckwheat, in twenty; hemp, in five; tobacco, in seventeen; rice, in eleven; silk, in greater or less degree in nearly all; cotton, in fourteen States; and sugar, also, in almost every one. I in reviewing the crops we .shall not adopt, any uniform order of arrangement; though, in most cases, we shall be guided, in the form of procedure, by the rank the different States hold in relation to the product under notice, or 'geographical situation. Wheat. The wheat crop of New York appears to 'have suffered but little from the extremes of the weather. In comparing the accounts at an early period of the growing season of the sections where the largest quantities are raised, we find them in general quite favorable. Thus as early a search, it is stated of the crop in Livingston county and vicinity, that the wheat looked " remarkably well." We meet with similar statements inApriy and May in respect to the western section of the State. As a specimen take the following: "heat in this quarter is looking tolerably well; though the crop, generally speaking, is not as promising as that of -a st yearCanandaiguaRep. Heat a coming friend showed us yesterday several perfectly formed heads of wheat of this seasons growth, which, considering the generally low stage of the thermometer, may be considered a pretty fair development of the coming wheat crop Rochester Adv. Again, early in June, the Genesee Democrat says that the crops in that vicinity looked " tolerably well." The Syracuse State Journal gives a similar testimony, as does likewise the Onondaga Standard; and the: Ocid127cid127tario Depositors mentions that: the Heat crop was: " improving if and" with an occasional exception, the fields give e promise of a fair yields th.e harvest advanced, we find under date of Syracuse; July. 11 The fields of wheat within sight are assuming a golden- .appearaneanda in r 106 the course of next week the reapers will commence gathering a most beautiful crop of a clear plump merry. Our opinion, formed by information from those who have abundant means of knowing, is, that the wheat crop of this State the present year will exceed that of last year at least one quarter, if not one third. The quantity will not only be larger, but the quality will exceed that of former years. The Newburgh Telegraph says: 'a" Any fields have escaped the ravages of the weevil, a fly maggot, while a large number have been partially, and others wholly destroyed." The wheat crop of Delaware county" it is stated in the Albany Org us, about the same time, "is represented as very fine." In the vicinity of New Work it is also considered " very good." " The weather for securing it was for the, most part uncommonly favorable n In the month of August the accounts still continue to be for the most part favorable. Thus the Data via Times says : "the wheat crop, which is of the most importance, is now secured in good order, and is in general very fair." And under date of Buffalo, August 1st, it is said : " Winter wheat his crop has been 'all secured and in good order. The yield will be more than an average. But the total quantity raised will not be equal to the crop raised in 1839, which was the crop. Later, some suffered by the rust in some localities, but generally the crop is excellent. There was not as large a breadth laid down to wheat last fall as usual, and there will be still less this year. Two causes are operating :one, the price is too low ; the other, many kinds of spring crops pay better, and that kind of tillage will not exhaust land so rapidly. Formerly it was the custom to sow wheat after wheat. It is now growing to be the custom to take a crop of wheat once in three or four years, stock down with c lover, and alternate with pasture and spring grain, If followed for a few years, our wheat crop will expel anything that we have ever yet done in growing this grain. Spring wheat has suffered by reason of the drought, but will still yield a fair return." At a later date, August 11, we find similar statements: "the wheat crop, just harvested, as we have before had occasion to state, was one of unprecedented abundance The An ville Republican, speaking of the crop in the Genesee valley, says: ' The crop is pronounced by all to be the best that ever grew in this valley The Plattsburgh Republican remarks, of the three northern counties, that the crop was very good. "some of the finest fields of wheat. ever noticed in that part of the State, were observed in passing through Franklin and a part of Clinton county. In the interior of the State, and along the Mohawk in general, as well as south of these counties, the wheat crop was considered better than in the previous year. It is less necessary to pursue the detailed notices of the progress of the crop in this State, on account of being furnished with the statistics of the State census for 1844; and having thus a basis on which to learn, by comparison therewith, the probable increase or diminution. This has been done with considerable minuteness, and thus the conclusions drawn seem to deserve the character of more reliable estimates than for any previous year, except just after the census of 1840. From information gathered since the harvest, it is believed that the gain on the' crop of 1844, in the heavy wheat growing counties of western New Work, must have been from " 20 to 25 per cent." In the southwestern section, bordering on Pennsylvania, the increase may not have been. 107 quite so great ; 'perhaps not more than 10 per cent. The season, however, was much more favorable there was no rust. More towards the centre of the State, along Take Ontario, and around the small interior lakes, as well still further south, and bordering on Pennsylvania, the report is not less favorable, and the gain is estimated at from 10 to 20 percent; and, in some cases, perhaps still higher. In the central eastern portion, along the Mohawk river, and extending south and north of this, the crop was much better than in the previous year, and the estimates, as variously given, are (a( 15, 25, 33)-, 50, and even 100 per cent." It maybe recollected that great complaint has been made for several years past in some of the counties near the Mohawk river of the ravages of the weevil, which had nearly checked the cultivation of wheat there. The past year, however, this evil has been greatly lessened. Of Schohariecounty, for example, it is 'said" To injury from the weevil, which ha heretofore destroyed the :crop, and it is better in the ratio of a superior yield to an almost entire failure; the quantity of seed is larger than has been i known in the best wheat growing years. " The dry and warm season which brought the grain to maturity early, before the insect could prey (cid127upon it" is assigned as the probable cause. Of the crop in the adjoining county of Its ego, it is said that it was " nearly if not quite double the quantity of the crop of the year before. The weevil heretofore has prevented the sowing of wheat; but, as its ravages were less the previous summer, a greater quantity was sown and harvested last summer." There was likewise a better preparation of the soil" and the quantity raised is "increased in proportion to the seed sown" and to the improved culture. In the north eastern section of the State, and bordering on Take Ham plain and the Hudson, the increase of the crop is estimated at "25 per cent." Power down, however, in the vicinity of Rensselaer county, the drought operated un favorably, and it is thought to have fallen off "10 per cent." The river counties have generally increased from 10 to 20 per cent, as they were not affected so much by the weevil and rust as in the previous year. In some cases there was less land tilled, but q the quantity raised was greater, and the wheat was also of a better quality. Similar results are stated as to this crop on Long I s land. Taking the whole State, therefore, we feel warranted in fixing the increase of the crop at a little above 20 per cent. more than that of the previous year. The census of 1844, which we have taken as the basis of our estimate, gave for that year 13,391,770 bushels, and the amount of acres thus cultivated 958,233 acres, which gives nearly an average of fourteen bushels per acre. We have compared the counties and notices respecting the growth of the crop and the harvest, as estimated by correspondents, with the census in detail, and thus feel more confidence in our estimate meaning rather to fall short than to exceed the actual crop. There has been much more attention, on the whole, paid to the culture of this crop, and deep sloughing has in many cases been resorted to with the happiest effect Some interesting facts are mentioned in the Agricultural journals of large crops raised during the past year. Thus, to give a single specimen or two, the Genesee Farmer says : The last harvest has turned out better than was expected at the time the grain was cut. We have seen a man who has spent most of his time for the last: four weeks in threshing v wheat with a machine, who says that nearly every farmer finds his yield 108 C' No. 140.large than he anticipated before it was measured. Mr. John Barber, ofFarmnington, took 1,500Qbushels from 40 acres a average of 37~ .bushels Thirty three acres in Pittsfordigave an average of 37 bushels. Sixteen acres in Right on gave an average of 38 bushels ve i acre. Mr. Taft of Greece, raised the past season thirty-six bushels' of wheat on less than one half acre of land. Seventy- ti bushels per acre isa great crop' "his extraordinary growth is attributed to its having been manured with horn shavings and scraping sir: Taft being a comb maker. Some interesting remarks respecting the geological adaptation of the bill of portions of this State will be for md in the appendix No. 2 i among other papers relating to the culture of wheat hereafter mentioned. Theyareotaken from an agricultural paper in this Staterespecting the prospect for the coming year, we i find the following observations in the correspondence of the Genesee Farmer : "For one, I think the coming year will be areniarka le wtieatseason. Mytreasons are' these: In the firstiplaee, the ground has been better prepared than I ever before knew it.

I Have l seen- many who have adopted the proper mode' of feeding the ipliantiwith its 'natural ingredient si (such- as lime, gypsy m, ashes, charcoal; &c and j nearly all seem to think that wheat, in order to produce, should f beCocrltivated as to pay the cost of production, and that: this cannot be dpnewitholitlpreparing the i ground in a proper manner. It has be eh one of the finest times for getting the seed into the ground, and having it terminate, that I ever knew; it seemed as if the rains car me just often enough to start the seed, but not so much as to give it a sicklyigirowth. I have i noticed that, after a dry summer, we invariably have a good wheat season, The writer then recommends the employment of gypsuiim, as he supposes "the ammonia of the atmosphere, by collecting throughout the :under, and having' but :few chance to descend in showers, it comes at the proper timetocid127bnuefit the young and, growing crop ; and hence it is desirable to absorb it and hold it for the use of the crop. The editor of the Farrnmer, in trade remarks, also approves the suggestions, and recommends, with such view, the use of plaster, ashes, and charcoal, as a top dressing i i the fallorzthe winter, and says that " in travelling through many counties in the State) he never saw the wheat crop look better The wheat crop of Ohio, according to the notices we have gathered, was subjected to considerable vicissitudes in the early periods of the season. The following are some of the statements The Ohio Statesman of the 7th April, speak iris of the cold weather says: c The cold dry weather is favorable. to the wheat crop, which looks very fire generally." The State Journal, published at Columbus, under date of 2 3d April, speaks of the "wheat fields as suffering severely irftltheiprotracted drought' ' Several fields of i wheat 'n the neighborhood of that city (it states) have been abandoned as worthless; aid i did: ni st of the fields it has a sickly yellow appearance The Cleveland Plain dealer, of 1st May, :remarks: " We have cnrverseidwith farmers from distant points along the lake shores, :ho tell us that the late rains have so improved the appearance of the: rows, that either expect an average of wheat b" In the Ohio Cultivator of 'he sam :i ate, afErimentiohirig the severe drought, and a partial relief from a slight fltilDoc. 140 o f- rain i it acid 127) is stated : , The wheat cop, however, is not as generally injured as was at one time anticipated.

The crop, under any circumstancesjilnuotbe more than an avenge i one." The wheat fields, with here and there an exception, look bad. With : a majority of our farmers, thepProspectirofithe wheat crop is hopeless. The -frost of the 29th is mentioneds , one of the severe st spring 'frosts ever known, cutting everything i thin, its reach to the i ground' The Mind lay Farmer, of 27th May, says: " The severe drought is doing much injury to the wheat crop. 'heat is beginning to  head i and some :of it is not over a foot in height." Similaris4the -report given about that time by the Mansfield :shield and Manner, and by the Trumbull Democrat, in which apprehensions are expressed that there will not be more than half a crop. The Cincinnati Gazette however, speaks more encouraging ly about the same time: We hear ofs some ted complaints in Ohio; but we think, from at l we can gather, that Cweshalluhave and average wheat crop. Such is the promise now; -and that promise is: increased by' the present weather. Pain is falling fast; and, the dry earth is drinking it up as if a thirst. Some sections have suffered severely from the drought; for instance, around Columbus and Mocid127itcid127tpleasant, in this county. In the latter they have had, until within the last' to~ days only three d ashes of rain since February." With allowance, however, for diversity of opinion, there can be but little doubt that the wheat crop appeared most un promising through the month of May.

The month of June dispelled much of the apprehension u which had existed respecting the wheat crop of Ohio; as the harvest came on, the accounts from all sections brightened. Thus we find such notices as the following: "the crop is greatly injured, and field after field mostly ruined; yet there may be more wheat than the most sanguine have hoped forOhioStatesman, June 2. Again: " As for wheat, there is a much better prospect than a week or ten days ago. Though the crop will be short in Ohio, there is no danger of a famine. From many parts of the country the papers speak of fair wheat crops." " The wheat and grass crops were so far advanced that they must be quite light in most parts of the State, although the rains will greatly benefit them, and the yield will be better generally than was anticipated.

Drops in the Scioto valley, Oh of good judge, lately visiting this valley, writes us as follows: " In going from Columbus to Portsmouth, I was much pleased to find that all portions of our fine valley have not suffered as much from the effects of cold and drought as the region about Columbus. From Circle ville, south, the wheat along the valley promises fair; it is light in straw, but will be less likely to suffer from rust than if of strong growth, as last years. 111 The wheat crop is much changed for the better; so that the panic treated by the extreme drought is now at an end.

We have conversed with a number of farmers within a few days past, and all agree in the fact stated.

Again: The Circle ville (ohio) Herald, of the 6th of June, gives a more favorable account of the crops in that section of Ohio. It sayscid127The injury is not so general as we had feared. We are informed that in some portions of the country the wheat crop will be an average one, and in others from one4lalf to two thirds will be realized.

The Columbus Journal speaks of the wheat crop in that section as " heading well, and the grain better than it has been for many years. Occasionally a field may be seen in which the grain is worthless. In Muskingum and Picking, the wheat crop will be better than was expected. In Organ better than it was last year." A gentleman from Washington county, Ohio, informs the Columbusjournal, that " the wheat crop in the Muskingum valley will double that of last year.

In all flat lands in the northern part of Picking, parts of Delaware and Franklin, and considerable portions of the adjoining counties north, the wheat crop of last season was almost a total failure, in consequence of a frost the 29th of May. I am told that the farmers now have to buy their wheat for family use; and many, who early in the spring thought their prospects good for a crop of 400 to 600 bushels, did not get even so much as their seed n: Muskingum county they think they have little mere than half of an average crop of wheat; but what there is, is of a superior quality good judge writes respecting Muskingum county and its vicinity it your request, I give you my views of the general character of the wheat crops of 1844 and 1845 in this vicinity; and, by 'this vicinity' I mean the region of country supplying the mills here with wheat." The breadth of wheat sown l in the fall of 1843 was very large, and the prospect for a good crop unusually propitious until the time of the, wheat blooming must at this most critical juncture, we had a succession of wet, stormy weather, for two or three weeks; so much so as to damage the crop in quantity to the extent of one half; and the quality, also, was very much deteriorated, the average weight not exceeding 53 lb s per bushel. In the whole, I consider the wheat crop of 1.844 in this vicinity less than one half of an average n the fall of 1844 the ;breadth of wheat sown was ,somewhat less than in the previous year. "the appearance of the wheat on the ground in the early spring was also less propitious; still the prospect was tolerably good, and the crop would probably have been an average one, but for two or three very severe frosts which occurred in the month of May the first about the middle of the month, and the last towards the close." The effects of these frosts were immediately visible, and great fear was entertained that this vicinity (and, indeed, the whole of Ohio) would not yield sufficient for consumption and seed. Thousands of acres werenotorti cutting at the time of harvest, and thousands more hardly repaid the labor of saving and threshing. To far as I can at present judge, the crop in this vicinity ,will :not be over one third of an average, and certainly not one half. The .quality is fair, weighing generally from 58 to 60 lbs. per bushel; some of the wheat partially injured by the frosts weighs very light say 52 to 54 lbs, per bushel, .a: "' The prospect for the coming harvest (1846) is at present very encouraging; the quantity: sown last fall was unusually large; and farmers, having been disappointed in their hopes for three successive years, took more pains in seeing than perhaps ever before in this vicinity. The season, also, was unusually propitious during the time of seeing, and has continued so up to the present moment The foregoing are my views in regard to the two wheat crops of 1844 and 1845; and, during the whole of my experience, I never witnessed any thing to be compared with them. In 1844 the quality (in addition to a deficiency of nearly one half) was such as to render it impossible to make a good quality of flour; and in 1845, although the quality is fair the quantity is probably not more than one third of an average. It will be seen, therefore, that the drought affected some sections of the State far more than others. A comparison has been made anew .with the
115census of 1840,to ascertain as carefully as possible what sections have yielded the greatest amount of wheat, as also the population; and, after the best investigation of the causes operating on the crop of 1845, it is believed that it must be fixed at about 15 per cent. decrease from the previous year. This conclusion may not correspond with that of some; but it is hoped that those who are disposed to de cry it will at least do us the justice to go through, in detail, as full a collection of notes and as extended a comparison as we have done. It will be seen, by a reference to the report for that year, that the crop of 1842 was a very large one, and that there has been a falling off from that year on account of the rust, &c .a; yet it is believed there has likewise been a gradual increase of the quantity of lands own with wheat, and the modifying influence of this element must be allowed to balance, so far as proper, the decrease. It is not improbable that the deficiency of last year, (1844) compared with the crop of 1842,may have been somewhat too large, and regard has been had to this consideration in fixing upon the estimate in the table; and thus the proportion which the present one bears to that of 1844 is different from what it might otherwise have been. The early notices respecting the wheat crop in the great State of Pennsylvania, which stands among the first in the culture of this grain, were, on the whole, favorable. In April, the Germantown Telegraph says: " The grain looks well in all directions ; and, should ordinary favorable weather continue for the ensuing month or six weeks, a heavy crop of wheat may be anticipated Early in May, also, we observe the following notices: " The appearance of the grain now indicates an abundant and plentiful reward for the husbandmens toilLewistown (a) Democrat. The editor of the Newtown Journal, who has been taking a tour through part of Bucks, Montgomery, Philadelphia, and Delaware counties, Pennsylvania, notices the fine appearance of all kinds of vegetation : "The wheat crop, especially, looks unusually fine. Several old farmers in the vicinity of the Brandywine say they never saw a finer prospect of winter grain" Lock Haven, (a) May 10.-I n our own immediate vicinity the grain fields look exceedingly promising Lancaster, A. The I intelligence r says" Never within recollection has this great agricultural county given promise of more abundant crops than in the present season. The late rains came most opportune ly, and there is little doubt now of the utmost abundance in all the products of the soil Somewhat later, there is complaint made, in some sections, of drought, and a frost in the last week of May, by which the wheat crop was considerably injured. Thus the Western Star, of Beaver county, (a) of June 6th, says: " We are sorry to say that the reports of our farmers no win attendance on court from different parts of the county, respecting the damage done to the wheat and rye crops by the late frosts, are of the most discouraging nature. A few days more will disclose the extent of the mischief. Owing to the long continued drought, the crops would have been light without frosts; but if the grain be killed, as is stated, it will prove a serious calamity.

A communication to the Farmers' Cabinet, from Chester county, it is stated that the i: daniagewWas mostly to the Mediterranean variety, that being earlier than :some others. A portion of this statement is sub joined, a 4ic1ontains some interesting facts. The thermometer is thought to have en as. low as :30. The most severe loss falls on our wheat fields. Tewhewheat mostly grew about here is the Mediterranean, which is a very early variety. Theicropswere quite promising, and our farmers calculated confidently on more than an avert    he yield but those hopes were unexpectedly cut off. Most of our wheat was i in blossom. I had walked through a fine field within a day or two of the frost, in company with one of our farmers, and (cid127e were admiring the regularity of the blossoms on the plants. The morning after the frost, he observed to me that it was his opinion such a night would kill the wheat. Within forty eight hours the evident tinge of brown, which showed deeply in the hollows and faded away up the he     il 1 sides, proved that his fears were well founded. The idea of a frost, so late in the season, injuring so hardy a plant as wheat, was new to most of us, but we had to aden it the fact since it was so plainly before us I tis evident that the action of the frost was entirely on the blossom ; the plant itself is yet as healthy looking as ever, but no grain has formed. Such an occurrence is so unusual as to be almost unknown to farmers; ;and, indeed, most with whom I have conversed on the subject were inclined itodouibt its having ever occurred, though a few think it did happen slightly two years ago, In their neighborhood. The effect of trees in protecting grain is not : little remarkable. Woodland, on the north, served (to keep off the frost some distance beyond where the shade of the trees would be cast in the day; and' in one instance, a small grove of chestnuts in the bottom of a hollow, where the frost was the heaviest, completely protected the wheat for many yards beyond the shadow of the trees. A small patch' of <a name="potatoes5"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which ran up into some woodland, forcibly illustrated this, also; under the trees the tops of the plants were untouchedfurtherfromnthem they were just tapped; while, further, portions of them were cut to the ground in the higher hills many escaped untouched, and those which were injured suffered but slightly. The Mediterranean wheat was almost the only kind injured, though in some places some other varieties did not escape; the later kinds around us promise a very fine yield, having es, caped by not being in blossom at the time. Some of our farmers cut down their wheat so fully were they convinced of the destruction of their crops. This was the case in Toe Run and Last Marlborough townships, and probably in: other placesSThe editor of the Cabinet adds in a note" We have understood from different neighborhoods that the wheat affected by this frost was generally, though perhaps not quite exclusively, the Mediterranean. This is a nearly ripened; and it is possible that this circumstance, subject as we areDNc No. 140. 117ecuasionally to pretty hard frosts late in the season, may prove a seriousobjetnion to its the harvest came, the accounts continued more favorable. Theadams Setintiel, published at: Gettysburg, says : " For farmers are in the midst of a plentiful harvest. We let     hardly that the -cry of wheat in thisconityis much better than it has been for many years The Germantown Telegraph of July 2 has the following statement: " The West chester Register of July 1 states, (that many of the fields of wheat in the vicinity appear Ready for the sickle. If the weather is fair there will be much grain cut and housed the present week. The grain harvesting has commenced in earnest, and about a week in 'advance of the l us al period.

This species of wheat has turned out exceedingly all given large and fine crops. I to appearance is somewhat remarkable beside our common wheat, and the heads are very well filled July. $ Similar to the above are the notices found in the papers respecting the cry in general of this State. The wheat harvest in Pennsylvania is the best we have had in many years. The crops are heavier cleaner, d and freer from rust than they usually are. The crops in Pennsylvania are it seems, above the average." The Harrisburg H Union says: "almost every paper we :open from the interior of the State speaks favorably of the late crops. We learn that the harvest is now over, and the wheat crop is said to be one of the heaviest and most abundant that has been gathered for nmanyyetars. The quality of the grain is decidedly superior The :information derived from others also corresponds with the foregoing. : Of the crop in the well known agricultural county of Lancaster, it is said: " The mild weather in the month of March and the beginning of April was so favorable to vegetation, that it was apprehended the growth of wheat in our productive and highly cultivated lands would be so luxuriant as to cause it to fall before the grain was matured and thus occasion a deficiency in quality and quantity ; but a continued spell of dry weather during the months of April and May retarded the growth of the plants, and prevented the exuberant e that had been anticipated. In the 9th of May the prospect of an abundant crop was as flattering as the heart of man could desire, but on that night a severe frost occurred which b lighted the prospects of many of our industrious and thrifty farmers. Huncteds of acres were so completely destroyed that they would not compensate the laborer for cutting it. That which grew on low level lands sustained the greatest injury, particularly where situated contiguous to streams of water. That species or variety of wheat called the 'mediterranean' which was introduced into our country a few years ago, being a nearly wheat, capable of with standing the attacks of the Hessian fly, aid less subject to injury, to mildew and rust than others, suffered st from the effects of the frost, from the circumstance of its being further advanced, and in the condition where the tender blossom of the merry was exposed, or i in consequence of its being more tender and less able tendre te h intensity of the cold. I ami inclined to attribute it to the former cause, as that wheat principally was all out in heads, and fairly T 8. -to 140.xposed whilst a large part of the other was still enclosed in the folds of the blade leaf of the stalk, and in some degree protected fro ii the violence of the weather. t From that time until harvest, the weather proved favorable to the maituritig of the crop the heads -were well filled, an te eries plump arid fair, so that it remained uninjured by the frost; the yield was abundant, and the quality Superior. And it is believed that the aggregate: of the wet r op through shout the county will fully equal that of1844iThe account communicated to us from Chester county fixes the increase of the crop over that of 1844 at 25 per cent." The following are some of the remarks made in the letter: ' The wheat crop of the present, year is a good average. Some fields in low situations were injured by frost about the first of June, when in blossom, but the large amount own and the good yield, fully supplied the loss. Such of the b wheat, yields :a bushel to a dozen sheaves of ordinary size, aid weight sixty-five pounds to the bushel. The Mediterranean is more extensively cultivated than any other, chiefly because of its exemption from the depredations of the Hessian fly. It is very much improved in quality since its introduction here, and is now esteemed as highly as any other red wheat. It has in some. instances been injured by the fly, and it is not probable that it will -much longer resist their attacks, unless fresh seed be brought from abroad. The Hers He, and .some other varieties of white and red wheat are also cultivated to some extent." I in other parts of the south eastern section of the State it is said: " The quantity is about the same, but the quality is equivalent to an increase of 10 per cent." -I n the eastern counties bordering on the Delaware river, and -o wards the centre of the State ;including Bucks and He high, the increase is estimated at about" 10 per cent." The injury by the frost is complained of, especially inLehigh county; but it is added, that " there was no blight, and what escaped the frost yielded well- In the south central section, bordering on the Susquehanna h river and the Maryland line, the crop is considered to have been h 50. or cent. better. ' There was "a favorable winter and a dry March and April, with a favorable time for the filling season. To mildew or .do      st, and great freedom from the fly." In the central counties, lying d ni the Susquehnnah and its branches, the crop is stated to have probably exceed de that of 1844 by 1 one third." Northeast of these the gain does not seem to- have been so great, and it is estimated at from 5 to 10 percent, and the grain is described as being 'a( very good, plump, and heavy n: the northwestern part of the State there was an advance of " about 0 per cent i, but the crop of in either year could be considered a full, crop Our information inspecting the crop in the southwestern, the north ein and southern central sections, is not as good; but so far as we have been able to ascertain, there has been an increase in almost all parts of the State.

Several of our farmers are already cutting their Mediterranean wheat and, from present appearances, we are inclined to think the general had, vest will be earlier than usual. The prospect is tolerably fair 14. The Lichen nd Compile r says that the growing gray i in the southern section of Virginia has nearly recovered from the effects of the drought and that the May wheat, though much injured by the frosts, will yield very well- Winchester Republican he Southern Planter says : As far as our observation has extended, the cold and unfavorable season has affected the growing crops most seriously. The wheat, which was cut down by the frost, has measurable recovered; and, as it was a novel case, it would, perhaps, be as well for our correspondents to record their experience upon the subject. For ourselves, we believe, if it had not been for the drought which followed the frost, the young shoots would have put forth with sufficient vigor to have fully supplied the place of those that were killed. As it was, the crop of early wheat will be more than half a one, and the late crop is very from, ising, .a. In other public journals we find similar notices, sometimes without a reference to the particular sections." The wheat crop this season, in Frederick county, Virginia, is said to be the heaviest that has been harvested for many seasons heat harvesting has commenced in this State, and the crops, with the exception of the May wheat, are said to be very good." The Richaondcid127) (virginia) Times says: " The wheat crop will be fully an average one; the frost has not injured the wheat." " The wheat crop has been all gathered in excellent condition, and is more than the usual average to far as we have been able to ascertain from other sources, the result of the harvest corresponded with the foregoing statements. We have not a sell information as could be desired, owing to the failure of answers to our, circular, in season for the present estimate. In the section east of the Blue Ridge, lying in the central part of the State, from Bedford through to Range counties, and which appears, from the census of 1840, to comprise some counties where large quantities of wheat are grown, it is said : "the crop is exceedingly fine in quality, and fully an average in quantity. It was somewhat injured by the late frost last spring; but except as to the very early May wheat, the damage \was slight." . As the crop in e. No. 140. 11th is section fell off so largely in 1842, and but just recovered its am bit, was exhibited by the estimate of 1844, we believe that an average crop will exhibit some advance for the past year. In the counties east of the last mentioned section, it is said: " Heat in quantity was about the same as in 844,but in quality it was r 10 been. superior. Theouthern central counties, from Halifax and Franklin, along the line of North Carolina, are thought to have exhibited an increase of " 25 per cent." Thenorthestern section of the State also appears to have harvested a good crop, a sit is thought there to have been "25 per cent. better." In the western section, lying i on the Kanawha river and its branches, and south of th east mentioned, the increase is likewise estimated a " 25 per cent." above that of 1844. Taking into view the early condition of this crop, it is believed that we are justified in fixing the increase of the crop at 10 percent. above that of the previous year. The editor of the American Farmer, speaking of the Virginia wheat crop, says: " Though disasters have occurred to blight the prospects of particular regions, we entertain the belief that the wheat crop, on the whole, will prove more than a fair average one." A correspondent of the large wheat growing region in the valley country says, likewise: " The wheat crop is a good one the first good one we have had since 1839." Another public journal, alluding to the general crop in Virginia, says: 'the crop is decidedly above an average one Expecting the Maryland wheat crop, we have gathered the following information. The appearance during the month of March was considered most flattering. As a specimen of the statements contained in the public journals, we give the sub joined: "the accounts from all round the country represent the wheat crops to be in a most thriving condition. The fields are as green as is usual on the first of May. It is too early to make any certain calculation of the next harvest but the indications have never been more favorable at any season :than they are now Baltimore Patriot." The appearance at present presented by the growing crops of wheat could not possibly be more promising. They possess all the cheerful verdure and vigor which is usually, distinguished at the close of the present month, and, unless retarded in growth, we may calculate upon one of the finest crops we have ever hadHagerstown (d) Porch light. Again: In April, the Was ton (ballot county) Gazette says, that the wheat crop presents a very promising appearance, The Williamsportbanner says: " The grain crops of Washington county have never, within our recollection, presented as beautiful and flourishing an appearance as at this time. They bid fair to yield the farmer a plentiful harvest Somewhat later, however, the William sport Manner says: " In consequence of the continued drought the wheat crop does not present as flourishing an appearance as it did last week." The view of the wheat crop in May is, on the whole, most favorable, though some diversity exists in particular sections." We learn that the wheat looks well in Ballot county, being from fifteen to twenty inches high on a level, a few days since. Some wheat there is stated to have reached the height of four feet, and all headed out. Theweekly Sentinel, published at Centre ville, Queen Anne county, says :for several days past we have had most delightful weather for the growing wheat. The prospect for a good crop could not be more favorable. "baltimore Sun22dec.

The farmers state that, as to quantity and quality, it has rarely if ever been surpassed' Our Maryland exchanges bring us glowing accounts of the abundant .of the crops; especially in wheat. In Queen Anne county the quantity and quality have rarely if ever been surpassed, while in Went county larger crop has been gathered than for many years Baltimore Slipper, July 15."The wheat crop of Maryland of the present year has not only been a a abundant one as to quantity, but is likewise remarkable for the excellence of its quality. In the valley of the Susquehanna h the products of numerous farms have been found to weigh sixty-eight pounds per bushel. In Frederick county, Maryland, the crop of one farm, recently sold to a miller, weighed sixty-eight to sixty-nine pounds per bushel in the whole, we believe that the crop was above an average one; therefore place it at an increase of 20 per cent. over that of 1844, which, it will be recollected, was a tolerable crop. I need, in the north eastern section oftheState, some have placed the advance as high as one third more. The following notices of large yields have met our eye in connection with the statements respecting the crop of wheat in Marylandsmr. Joseph L. Suffer, near Catoctin, Maryland, for the purpose of testing his probable yield of wheat, threshed out fifty shocks, having 12 ordinary sheaves to the shock; and having measured it with his own hands, found. It to produce the extraordinary amount of 41 bushels. Mr. Suffers entire crop will turn out equally as well as the above parcel" Mr. Delashmutt, of Buckeystown, Frederick county, Maryland, delivered a load of wheat at the Monocacy mills, a few days ago, weighing sixty-nine pounds per bushel. It is believed that his whole crop will average sixty-eight and a half pounds per bushel' In all contests for superiority in raising agricultural products, Carrollcounty is always a prominent, and most generally, a successful competitor. We lately published accounts Of certain lots of wheat raised in Frederick county, that weighed sixty eight and sixty-nine pounds to the bushel. Thecaroolltonian states that some white wheat, the product of the farm of Mr. John Orndosl, of that county, was measured, and weighed seventy-nine pounds to the bushel Baltimore Patriot. The 'wheat crop of North Carolina was more seriously injured. Is early as in April, the Raleigh Register states: ,a" The late drought has destroyed the early wheat in many sections of North Carolina, and much of it has. 125 been either ploughed up or ;the cattle turned into it." The Norfolk Herald, Virginia, makes similar remarks respecting the crop in the neighboring counties of North Carolina, and says: "the crop is expected to be short And in May, a letter from Chatham county, in the Raleigh Register, states he shall not have half a crop of wheat this year in this part of the country, caused by the cold and drought." Again: "A gentleman who is an extensive planter, residing a few miles from Den ton, North Carolina, commenced cutting his wheat on Thursday, the 22d May, being some weeks earlier than the usual time of harvesting. We are not informed, says. theEdenton Journal, whether this gentlemans crop is a fair one or :pot, but we do know that the wheat crop generally, in this county at least, has been greatly injured by the cold and dry weather, and perhaps this may account for its ripe king so soon." The drought in this State was most distressing and. by accounts received since the harvest, the crop must have suffered most severely. In the central portion of the State, towards the west, the crop is supposed to have fallen off one half; and towards the east, not less than one fourth. In the northwestern section, it seems to have been somewhat better, and it is thought may have been about equal to the crop of 1844. In the whole, we think it must be not less a decrease than 15 to 20 per cent. We think it probable that in some sections, where considerable wheat was raised, this estimate may be considered too large; but allowing every thing favorable, in the warm weather, for the earlier ripe king of the grain, we cannot form any more favorable conclusion. The drought also, as already mentioned in our extracts under The Head~ th out severely affected the State of South Carolina, and the wheat crop there felt its influence. As early as April, in the Edge field Advertise r and Charleston Patriot, we find mention of frequent complaints and fears entertained respecting the harvest; and the wheat crop, it is said, is "seriously damaged" ' a failure" "very sorry." For did the prospect improve in May. Thehgrenville Mountaineer, The raw Gazette, Columbia n, South Carolinians, and iEdgefield Advertise r, all agree in representing the injury to be great. They speak of it as "short of the usual yield" "a: not more than twethirdsof the amount annually harvested ;" 'seriously damaged and suffering (also from a black blast" will be cut short, if not entirely destroyed." It is probable, however, that in the upper part of the State, towards the west, the yield proved :better than was anticipated ;" the grain, also, though , the stock was "low" in the middle districts, proved to be "good." Taking the whole State through, the crop must have fallen very considerably. According to the information we have derived from correspondents since the harvest in the northwestern part of the State, where not much is raised, it was about equal to the crop of 1844. In the north eastern portion it may have been a little better say ' 10 per cent." In the central section it is thought to have fallen (30 per cent." on account of the drought, and in the section west of this to have been at least 15 per cent. less. It was, probably, about 20 per cent. less for the whole State. In Georgia, as early as the 25th of April, we find mention of the ravages of the Hessian fly in the counties near Milledgeville. Days the journal published there: "he learn that the Hessian fly is in the wheat, in several of the neighboring counties, and that their ravages have been dreadful: Whole fields have been totally destroyed by this troublesome insect, and others will yield not more than a fourth of what was confidently anticipated some weeks ago. We have been told that in an adjoining county 126 a wealthy farmer, who always plants largely in wheat, fbutfd that one of his wheat fields was totally destroyed by them, while the adjoining field (the two being separated by a worm fence only) was untouched. It has been remarked, too, that in straight lines, across whose fields from ten to fifty yards apart, the destruction would be entire, while the balance would present a wholesome appearance The following are some of the subsequent notices in May, and on: "the wheat crop in this county is very promising; we heard a farmer say on Monday that he would commence reaping in ten daysMVarietta (Cobb Co, A) Advocate, 141 h May. While complaints have been made of an extensive drought prevailing in some parts of this and the adjoining States, we have had a fine growing season. The wheat crop will be about an average one Marietta (CpbbCo, A) Hleliconthe wheat crops, with the dry weather, and heavy frosts which fell about the middle, of March, have been measurable destroyed. Any farmers in Jump kin, Union, and Saber sham, will not make the seed which they planted last fall- Dahlonega (a( A) I Watchman, 22d inst." With all the complaints of dry weather, crops look very fine in See, Thomas, and Baker. The wheat crop has far exceeded the most sanguine expectations of the oldest planters in this county. A v. Georgian, June 2. The information respecting the northwestern section since the harvest is, that the crop is thought to have been a 25 per cent." owing to the "increased culture" given to this product, and the " better yield." From the central counties west of the Ocmulgee river, the report is not as favorable, as it is judged to have fallen off at least "one fourth or one third "from that of 1844. The crop, therefore, in the whole State, is believed to have been not less than 15 per cent. decrease. In some portions of Alabama the wheat crop is about the same as in the previous year, while in other sections the early frost materially injured it and the decrease is variously estimated from " 10 per cent" to "one third n portions of Mississippi some wheat is raised, but it forms so small a crop, comparatively, that it is difficult to form any very reliable estimate of the yield. The same is the case with regard to Arkansas, where, as the crop in the early part of the season appeared promising, and from the scattered notices gathered, it seemed to be quite good, we have felt authorized to allow about the usual rate of increase for the average crops. The crop of wheat in Tennessee, so far as we are able to ascertain, was a productive one. The West Tennessee Whig says, "the wheat crop in that region turned out to be very good." A similar report is also made in a public journal by a correspondent at Nashville. From other information, we learn that in the northwestern section of the State the crop was probably twenty per cent. more than in 1844, while in the north eastern it has been estimated as high as forty per cent. increase. We place the average increase for the State at about twenty per cent. Although the drought was felt in parts of Kentucky, yet we believe the wheat crop was, on the whole, a good one. In April and May we find the following notices: "during a short excursion into the country, a few days since, we were much gratified to see the wheat crops look so fine. Should the b lighting rust not again visit it before its maturity, there will be an abundance, and to Doc. ,to. 1 40, 127 spare, raised the present year for home consumptionLexZington (by inquirer. .a. . .a. .the wheat will generally turn out well- Days ville Eagle, May 24. In another journal it is stated, as from a gentleman who has lately travelled through Franklin, Woodford, Gazette, and Bourbon counties, that " the wheat crops look well, with a prospect of a very heavy harvest Again, in June or July: "I t is the universal remark, that there never was grown in Kentucky a better wheat crop than the present. The frequent rains lately have somewhat retarded the harvesting, but we do not learn that they have caused serious damage to the crop. Kentucky has for years imported considerable quantities of wheat and flour; but it is generally believed that she will export a surplus from the present eropFrankfortKy) Commrlonwealthsome accounts speak of the prospect in Kentucky as bad. The editor of the Shelby News, on the contrary, says: ' In passing through a portion of the northern and northwestern sections of old Shelby, we were delighted with the fine appearance of the wheat crop The Knox ville Register, of July 30th, states that the wheat crop this season is an excellent one, the quality of the grain produced being, as a general thing, superior to that of any crop for several years past. If the season continues propitious, the crop will be unusually large his, likewise, corresponds with the information otherwise obtained. Thus, in the counties east and northeast of the central it is stated that, "i a 1844 there was almost a total failure; but in 1845, an uncommonly fine crop" which is rated even as high as "75 per cent." In the section lying northeast of the last, our informant says: "the warm weather was a great advantage to the wheat, and so good a crop has not been raised in this section for the last twenty years ; which many think is owing to the cold dry spring and the fore part of the summer." He thinks the yield at least thirty per cent. greater. In the south eastern part of the State the :crop was fully "equal to that of: 844," if not still larger. The crop, therefore, may fairly be estimated at twenty per cent. advance on that of 1844. A species of wheat called the Need straw wheat is mentioned in the Louisville Journal, and the farmers of that region are advised to give it a trial. The ears are said to be " large and full, and the grains plump and heavy his kind, also, it is stated, ri pens two weeks earlier than the common sorts, and therefore escapes the rust" to which: they are liable. It weighs very heavy, and ripened last year by the first of June. The wheat crop of In diana has been a heavy one. The notices of its progress, in general, are highly favorable.

As the harvest advanced, the statements are equally decisive; Thus, input ne and July, the Os hen Democrat says, that "the wheat crop in northern In diana has not been better during our residence in the State. It will nearly all be harvested and secured during the present week in good order. Elkhart county alone will have a large surplus for the eastern market. Some of our wheat fields average 30 and 35 bushels to the acre, and 20 bushels are a common yield heat comes in briskly and finds a ready market; Pulaski, Alton, Diam i, White, War roll, and Pass, have an immense surplus, of which between 250,000 and 300,000 bushels will probably find it sway to this market.

" We have no means of arriving at a correct estimate of the quantity, but those who know say it will be as large as was ever known before, if not largerLogansportI n diana) Chaos. The Lafayette Standard of the 18th says: "several lots of new wheat have already been sold in this market, at prices ranging from 62 to 65 cents. It is immensely heavy, and a most excellent article. The crops in this region will be most abundant far exceeding in quantity and quality those of any previous year July 26. From other informants, we are told that in the upper central counties, above the Wabash river and northwestern part of the State, the crop is thought to be double what it was the previous year, while by yet another person it is estimated at much more than double. Of the south eastern section, bordering on Ohio and the Ohio river, it is likewise estimated to bean advance of 100 per cent; and it is stated that " the crop of last year was severely affected by the rust, but this year there was no rust or any thing scarcely to damage the crop. In the county of Dear born, there was son me damage by the weevil' but no general appearance of it. In the central section it is estimated to have gained " 25 per cent" and in the southwestern 50 per cent" on the crop of 1844. Of the former part it is mentioned as a cause, that there was " increased industry, stimulated by the prospect of a market, and an increased quantity of land reclaimed from the forest state Another informant, whose opportunities of information are better than usual, also speaks of the great increase of the crop throughout the State and we feel authorized, by all we can learn, to fix it at " 30 per cent similar advance may be given, we believe, to the wheat crop of I illinois. It will be recollected that, in 1844, both this State and In diana suffered severely from incessant and heavy rain, which destroyed large and fine crops toe. N. 140. 129 in prospect. The crop of 1845, though suffering somewhat in sections from drought, yet has had, on the whole, a very propitious season for growth and gathering. We give such notices of its progress as we have met with April 2 3d, the Chicago Democrat says: "the wheat crop looks favorable. All that is now feared .is dry weather." Met later: " The wheat, in general, looks tolerably well only; on some farms it stands thin upon the ground probably in consequence of the extreme dry weather last fall, when it was sown Quincy whig, May 7."We have made a short excursion into the country, and find the wheat crop in a very fine cofiditionChicago (111) Farmer, May. The Alton (I ll) Telegraph says, that " the wheat in that vicinity looks well." To, in June, the Quincy Whig says: From all parts of the country we have most promising accounts of the crops. The prospect of wheat is very fair ; the stalk is not as thrifty as last year, but heads fill out well, and the grass are large' We have had several good showers of rain the present week. The corn and wheat in this vicinity begin to look up' though a portion of these crops was entirely destroyed by the frost Springfield Republican, June 6. In the Chicago Democratcid127) of the 10th June, we find *he following: " The growing wheat still promises well, although, from the want of rain in the southern sections, the straw is light and the head uncommonly short Again: "Advices from western I illinois represent the wheat crop as very good. Although the s talks are not as luxuriant as usual, the heads are heavy and full From present appearances" says the Warsaw Signal, "the crops in this section of the country promise to be unusually large. The season thus far has been favorable The editor of the Prairie Farmer, for June, says: " In our travels through southern Wisconsin, northern I illinois, and the Military tract, we have observed, the wheat looks pretty well. The winter, that was late sown, is thin on the ground, and also the late sown spring, owing to the dry weather succeeding the sowings. But should the season be favorable, this will head out larger, and many fields will yield more bushels of wheat than that growing thicker. The straw is almost universally very short. The' fly has done more or less injury all over the State, and it has become a permanent enemy to the prairie farmer Again, from the New York News; "the Alton Telegraph says' Field of wheat on Scaritts prairie, in this county, was harvested on the 13th of this month, (lane) This is the earliest we have ever known grain in this country to be fit for the sickle marseilles, I illinois, June 25.-The weather, from being cold and dry, is now hot and sufficiently wet. Heat looks well, and is fast ripe king. One week more of good weather will insure a good crops gentleman who lately passed through the Lock river country informs us that the wheat crop never looked more promising. The quantity grown this season in northern I illinois will far exceed that of any formeryearAlbany Citizen. Again, in the Prairie Farmer of July: " Having just arrived at Springfield (2 3d June) from Chicago, passing through U Age, Kendall, A Salle, Putnam, Woodford, Gaze well, Dog an, Menard, and Sangamon counties we send a word of our own observations concerning the crops. The prospects now are, there will be an abundant yield of grain of all kinds. '9 130 the four southern counties we saw numerous what fields that will be ready for the sickle this week, and we learn some were cutting in this county last week. Men days of good weather insures a large crop through all this region, though the late rains, continuing for about ten days, have saturated the earth, and there is considerable danger of rust in consequence. A few hours of hot damp weather would ruin thousands of acres, that now promise twelve to twenty bushels. South of this, we learn they have harvested a good crop. We saw no wheat fields injured by the frost, or lodged, though we have been told there were so meany of the farmers in this section of country last week commenced cutting their winter wheat, and immense quantities will be cut this week. We are pleased to hear, from every direction around us, that there has never been a finer crop. It is a common remark of every one that goes into the country, or that comes to town from the country, when speaking of the crops, 1 have never seen such wheat' This is highly encouraging to our people, and must cheer up many an agriculturists whose crop had failed the last year or twoPeoria (I illinois) Dress." Our farmers generally, by this time, have harvested their wheat. The weather for the last three days of the week was quite favorable for harvesting, and the whole crop has been secured in good order. The yield is fully equal to the most sanguine expectations of the farmer, and the quality of the grain is very superior- Quincy Whig, July 9. Still later in July, the Springfield (I illinois) Journal of the 18th says: "within a few days past, there have been heavy rains in this region of country. Heat will turn out better than was anticipated" A traveller informs the editor of the Commercial Advertise r, Buffalo, that in I illinois he saw 40,000 acres of wheat in one body, divided only by crossroads. The yield on the whole lot gave promise of something better than was seen last year Since our last publication, the weather, although intensely hot, has been generally favorable to the harvest. The wheat is all saved, and will, it is believed, be of the very best quality; a small part only having been injured by the late rains Alton Telegraph. Our information from other sources corresponds with the above, and is all favorable. In the section embraced fromPeoria county to Jersey county, along the west side of the I illinois to the Mississippi, being the central western tier of counties, it is estimated that the increase above the crop of 1844 is equal to "50 per cent." (a( The last year the crops were bad; this year, fine." In the south eastern part, bordering on the Ohio and Wabash rivers, the yield is thought to have been " 10 per cent. better" in the southwestern, bordering on the Mississippi, "25 per cent. increase ;" and in the northern, and along Take Michigan, also, " 25 per cent. more." We put the estimate for the whole State at 35 to 40 per cent. increase. Some have placed it much higher; but we are aware how liable all are to place their estimates too high. One writer in a public journal says: "I t is estimated that I illinois alone will furnish a surplus of 8,000,000 bushels of wheat this season. An advance of only ten cents per bushel would more than pay the whole interest on her debt; and it has already advanced more than twenty he cannot agree with this view, if it is meant by it that the whole of this amount is raised by this State, as it would make the I illinois crop as much as 16,000,000 of bushels. The crop of 1839, according to the census, was. 11 but a little over 3,000,000; and the variations of the crop have been large since then. The crop of 1842, (which' was a fine crop) according to the best estimate we could gather, was only about 5,700,000; and in 1843 and 1844 it was much reduced. The crop of 1845 was a very fine one probably above one third i ore than in 1844. An agricultural journal says: "a: We learn that 30 bushels to the acre is no uncommon crop this year through the north of this State, and we presume that the same is the fact in sections adjacent Prairie Farmer, August. It will be recollected that the wheat crop of Missouri, in 1844, was greatly injured. The accounts for the year 1845 are much more favorable. I nay we find them as follows: "I n the counties of It. Charles, Warren, and Montgomery, the crops of wheat are well set, and in a flourishing condition; the growth was a little retarded by the dry weather of the spring, but the recent rains have given it fresh life; and should the season continue to be favorable, very fine crops may be expected." "the present prospect for an abundant wheat crop upon the I illinois and upper Mississippi is said to be flatteringLSt. Louis Newera, May 5.': Cropsfrom present appearances, we are told that the crops of wheat and corn on the upper Mississippi and I illinois promise an abundant harvest. The wheat, although retarded somewhat in its growth by the dry weather, in the early part of the growing season, has been brought out by the late rains, and looks fine, and promises to do well it. Louis Newera, May 20." Extract from a private letter to one of the editors, written from the southwestern corner of Missouri: ' The prospect for wheat in this country is very favorable. l hear all the farmers say they have never seen more wheat growing, or look better; and if their expectations should be realized, and not marred, there will be sufficient flour manufactured here to supply all the Arkansas river district' "a- An Buren (arkansas) I intelligence r, May 24.in June, some apprehensions seem to be entertained of rust from the rain. A correspondent of the It. Louis Republican, writing from Warsaw, Missouri, says: "the wheat crop in the southwest part of the State is very short, and everywhere uneven; most of it is not half the usual height The Republican Adds: " We have similar reports from other parts of this State. The It. Louis New Era says: "the rains of late have been frequent and heavy, and will give a very desirable impetus to the general growth of vegetation. It is feared by some that the wheat crop may be injured by the rust in consequence of the continued wet weather he begin to despair of the wheat crops, (says the It. Louis Republican, of the 27th multi mo) It has raised more or less for the last fifteen days and as yet there is no prospect of settled clear weather. The crop of wheat, which, until the commencement of the rain, promised an abundant yield, is greatly injured, and must soon be wholly destroyed, unless a change in- the weather takes place. That which was cut just before the rain is, of course, lost. This will be a sad blow to our farmers, and must sensibly affect all other branches of business and trade Still later, and in July, the It. Louis Republican says: "I n our own State the only apprehension seems to be, that the heavy rains of the last week may prove injurious to the wheat, which is ready for harvesting, and a small 132 portion of which has already been cut. A few days of dry and not too warm weather will place it out of danger' The last few days of dry weather have enabled the farmers to harvest their wheat; and it is free of rust, which was much feared it. Louisrepublican, July 2. Again, from the same paper: " The yield of wheat will probably exceed that of any previous years n the New York Farmer, it is said" A letter from Gallatin, (to) as early as July 6, says: The harvest is just over; the wheat is excellent The Fulton (to) Telegraph also says: "' The wheat crop, from present appearance, will be more than an average; and, in another journal, speaking of Jackson county, it is said: " The wheat crop has been harvested, and is more abundant than usual Subsequent to the harvest, the following statement is also made in theft. Louis New Era: "the new crop has just commenced arriving freely and, should the upper streams continue even in their present difficult stage for navigation, we may expect to see, in the course of three or four weeks, large quantities of wheat pouring into the market; even at this early period, there are thousands of bushels of the new crop lying at the landing s along the I illinois, upper Mississippi, and Missouri, waiting shipment. All the boats which have reached this port from above, for three or four days past, have come down with as much as they could possibly get along with and many of them, particularly those from the Missouri and I illinois, had to refuse more wheat than would have loaded them twice over in a fair stage of water. The wheat harvest has, indeed, been a magnificent one. From every quarter the cry is, plenty; on the Missouri, upper Mississippi, and      illinois, the average yield over the crop of last year will be full 33 per cent and, in many sections of the county, full 50 per cent; add to this the superior quality of the grain, which appears to be uniformly of nearly the same quality, and there must be a great surplus. Now, when, and where it is to be disposed of, remains to be seen From the above accounts, we believe we may fairly place it at one third more than the previous year, in which, as it will be remembered, it suffered so largely. From none of the large wheat growing States do we receive more encouraging accounts of this crop than from Michigan. I need, its whole progress seems to have been unusually good. The year 1844, it will be remembered, was a great contrast to this, and that the crop suffered most severely from the rust. We give the history of the crop as we have gathered it, commencing with March. The weather was cold and backward, but it is said ' our great staple never looked better at this season of the year, and there is every prospect that the labor of the husband man will b das favorably rewarded as could be desired n April, the Marshall Opponent says: 1 There never was a fairer prospect of a good wheat crop than there is at the present time. We have inquired of farmers in almost every town in the county, and get the same answer: 'it looks well never better' To insect has made its appearance yet, and the grain may now be considered secure from that danger. He rejoice to learn from our exchanges that crops look equally well in every part of the Stateagain: Oak land county, Michiganthe editor of the Oak land Gazette says: "while j aunting through the middle and northern parts of this. 133 county on the 12th inst, we observed that the wheat crop appeared better at this season than it has for many years past. The prospect is fair for a very large crop; and, with dispensations which a Divine Providence alone can bestow, we think there will be more wheat produced in those portions of the county the current year, than at any previous year since its settlementSSo, in May: "the wheat crop never looked better in this region, at this season of the year, than at present. There are some fields this side of the county house we believe on Judge Thompsons farm that are well worth a journey from the village to behold Adrian (rich) Expositori n this section the wheat is growing very rapidly; too much so, it is feared by some Marshall (rich) Expounder" The wheat fields (except in that part of the country visited by hail storms) present a glorious appearance; and unless some accident should happen to it before harvest, the crop will be immense. We hear no complaint of the ravages of the fly this year, as we did last it.

This is peculiarly gratifying at this time to the farmers of Michigan.

Again: " Inn Erb or, Michiganthe crops, after all, look well, especially th'wh/eat. The spring crops were mostly cut down, and in some cases twice or thrice; but the fine growing weather since has restored them. The farmers prospects are good and promising farmer from the country informs us "that fears are entertained that the late frosts have ruined the prospects of a good wheat cropDetroitFree Dress, June 2. At a later date, the Detroit Advertise r says: " We learn from various sources that the wheat crop has not probably suffered materially, or at least generally, in this State, from the late frosts. But the drought has sensibly affected it in several places." The Jackson Gazette, and the Coldwatersentinel, respectively, after alluding to the drought and frosts, speak of the 184 wheat as " uninjured" and affording promise of an excellent harvest. The editor of the Michigan Farmer, under date of 15th June, says: "From ev by quarter we hear the most encouraging accounts of the condition of the wheat crop. The papers of every section of this State unite in the anticipation of an abundant harvest. The wheat insect appears nearly to have intermit ted its ravages. The crop emerged perfectly un hurt from a change able, snow less winter; and, since the opening of spring, with the exception of one or two seasons of drought which, however, has not been very severe the progress of the crop has been of the most promising description n the month of July, and during the harvest, the accounts still continue to be cheering, like the following: " We are informed by a gentleman, direct from Michigan, that the wheat crop in that State is better than ever before known. It will be mostly harvested this week, and will, therefore, be housed in good condition, as the weather is warm and dry Albany Org us." The wheat crop in this State is said to be nearly double in quantity that of any previous year." " The Detroit Free Dress of the 16th instant, gives the following account of the harvest in that State: "I n Michigan, we are able to say, so far as we have heard, the wheat crop :ras never better in quality, or larger in quantity. The farmers in the western portion of the State are already in the midst of the harvest; and in all parts they will commence in the course of this week and next. We shall have a large amount for exportation. " The harvest has commenced in this section of the State" says the Marshall Expositor, " and the crop is coming in noble. It will be the best wheat crop ever harvested in this country. We have heard the average estimated at 25 bushels per acre; but this is probably too high. Last year the average was said not to have exceeded seven bushels per acre. The merry is. said to be plumper and the wheat heavier than in any former year." "of te farmers have commenced harvesting their wheat, and the crop will quickly be in market. The straw is rather short, but the ear well filled, the merry plump, and the crop will be full an average one. The surplus in Michigan will probably be twice as great as last year" The farmers of Michigan are now in the midst of their wheat harvest, and we are happy to say that it bids fair to prove the richest harvest ever gathered in Michigandetroit News. Of friend of ours, who is a practical farmer, and, we may add, a member of Congress, has just called, on ,us on his return from Michigan, having travelled in that State in various directions, and having had an excellent opportunity to inspect the crops. He says the crop of wheal was never so, good or abundant as it is this year. As an evidence of it, a large portion of the wheat will weigh city-five pounds a bushel, and the product will be one third greater than the largest crops ever raised in that fertile State. The above authority may be implicitly relied on New York paper. The Grand Rapids I inquirer says, that " in the county of long a, in Michigan, there are this season over 20,000 acres of wheat, all in first rate order, furnishing assurances of a large crop June. The accounts from Michigan are of the most encouraging kind. Letter in the Detroit Advertise r, dated Pontiac, Michigan, August 11, says: "If the accounts are anything like correct, the quantity of wheat raised in this section of country alone must be prodigious. In the town of Washington, A comb county, I am told it is nothing remarkable for one farmer Doc. Roi. 140. 135 to thresh his two thousand bushels of wheat; and one man, I am assured, has nearer five than three thousand bushels. I saw a farmer from the border of A peer, who told me he was only 'a young beg inner' but reckoned upon his one thousand bushels of wheat, at least, this season some of his land bringing him as much as forty bushels to the acre The American Agriculturists for November last gives a letter from a correspondent, which contains the following remarks respecting the wheat crop of Michigan: " Heat is the great product of the State; and on this the farmers principally rely for their available exports. Never did their efforts receive a greater reward than the present season. The estimate of several judicious citizens is, that the crop fully averaged 20 bushels per acre over the State. I was informed of a wheat field containing 100 acres, which averaged over 45 bushels per acre, and one measured acre of which produced over 60 bushels. A cargo of this years crop, from Michigan, averaged one barrel of the best super fine flour for r every 244 1 lbs. of wheat Great yield Henry Bones, of Youngs prairie, Pass county, raised on one acre of ground, this year, sixty-one bushels and twenty-five pounds of wheat. This is the largest yield we have heard of in western Michigan. A large number of fields in this section have yielded from 30 to 45 bushels to the acre this season. Perhaps the world cannot furnish a finer or more productive country for grain than the It. Joseph valley. When we cast an eye back to the land of or nativity, where, eighteen years since, we folofWed the plough, among the rocks and stones of Connecticut, where 15 bushels of rye to the acre was considered a fair yield, we cannot but wonder how mortal man can be content with such an abode, when the rich and fertile soil of the west holds out inducement the most inviting to allNilesRepublican. From other sources of information we also learn that in Oak land county the wheat crop is the "largest they ever had." In I onya and Her rien "unusually large" as a specimen of which, it is stated one farmer has 106 acres which will average " 30 bushels to the acre" and, of the whole State, more wheat will be harvested than for three preceding years." In the southwestern quarter of the State, bordering on the lake and on In diana, the estimate is " 50 per cent. more." The fly and wet weather injured it in 1844; in 1845 it was, in all respects, favorable. In the central eastern section, lying on the boundary line, it is likewise estimated at " 50 per cent. more Another informant in the south eastern section says : " Three times more than in 1844." The editor of the Michigan Farmer says : " The returns from different counties vary from 25 to 40 per cent. In one county only, from rust, the falling off is said to have been 75 per cent; never so beautiful yield; scarce a bushel is brought to market that does not considerably overrun in weight, and the flour produced from it is of superior excellence He thinks the amount to be more than double the former year. We have, however, after full consideration, fixed it about 75 per cent. more. This we have done in view of the increase, not merely from the more favorable sears on, but of the lands newly brought under cultivation, &c. Of new insect in that section is mentioned in one of the public journals as follows: "the Michigan Farmer notices a new wheat insect found preying upon the wheat in that State, and which is described as follows: It is the product of a small greenish fly, about three sixteenth of an inch in length 136 a. The lavra is a white worm, one-fourth of an inch I big, ribbed, without feet, with two formed black lines on its forehead, and in some cases a streak of light green extending length wise. The worm is found in the straw just above the upper joint, where it devours the juices which would otherwise ascend to the head. The heads of wheat denote its presence by turning white premature ly, when the grain is in the milk. In one instance nine eggs were found in a single straw; one of which had just hatched. Have any of our readers seen any such insect ?the increase of I own and Wisconsin, by the influx of population within the past year, is said to be great, and due allowance must, no doubt, be made for the additional quantity of land brought under cultivation. Besides this, their crops of wheat were evidently much greater than in the year 1844. As early as May, the prospect is represented as " promising a very heavy yield." The Looming ton Herald speaks thus, also, of the crops of Inn, Cedar, Muskatine, Washington, and other portions of I own, which "' bid fair to yield an abundant harvest." The See County (sort Madison, I. Democrat of the 17th instant, says: " We have conversed with many of our farmers during the present week upon this subject, and have been assured by all of them that grain of all kinds looks remarkably fine, and promises an abundant harvest. Any of them say that for several years past they have not seen crops look so promising as they do at this times the harvest approaches, and subsequently, we are furnished with the following notices of the crop: " The Miners Express of the 4th of June, published at Dubuque, I own, says: 'the crops in our Territory generally present a most promising appearance. The prospect of 'the wheat crop is especially flattering. It is estimated that there will be more wheat harvested in I own this season than during the two preceding years owaThe reports from this section of country are very flattering. The wheat crop is very promising, with every indication of an abundant harvest. The crop of wheat has been gathered, and the Looming ton Herald says: " A crop full one third larger than usual will soon be in market, and we learn that some of our merchants are making contracts at fifty-six cents per bushel. We are further informed that the article is considerably superior to that of last years production." Since the harvest, also, we learn from one well qualified to judge, that the crop was much larger than that of the preceding year, as " more land was tilled by the old settlers ; the increase of population was greater than previously known ; the season was more favorable; the produce per acre more, and the quality much better in the last two particulars, better than for eight years." We believe that the advance was not less than one quarter, or perhaps one third. Mention is made of a new insect, which, it seems, is doing great injury to the wheat crop sown for 1846. The following is the account to which we alludeSDestruction of wheat By a letter received by a gentleman in this city from Vol. G. M. Single, of Buffalo, I own, dated October 23, 1845, we learn of the appearance of a 'curious insect, which is doing great damage to the wheat. He says: 'notwithstanding the luxurious harvest of, this season, there is every appearance of a severe pestilence of a curious kind here. About the 1st of September there was a singular kind of insect made its appearance in most of the farms over the country. I to first appearance is (cid127fsmall black bug on the surface of the ground, and on some farms the surface for some inches deep would seem to be alive with them. Some farmers, who have sandy land, say it seemed as though every grain of sand was. 137 becoming alive. In a few days after their first appearance they climb upon the corn, wheat, or whatever green thing is in their way, and then turn into a small fly about half the size of a house fly, and suck the substance from the stalk of the grain until it withers away. Any crops of fine winter wheat, which came up and looked prosperous, have been entirely destroyed by them, so that the farmer has been compelled to sow it over again. The curiosity of it is, no one ever saw such a bug or fly before. It baffled the ingenuity of all to tell what it means. Notwithstanding we have a frost every night, and have had some hard freezes, yet, as soon as the sun is up and warms them, they go to their work of destruction again. They not only eat the young wheat above ground, but kill it at the roots. If they increase another season as they have this, they will sweep every thing before them Philadelphia Ledger. The following notices give us some idea of the state of the crop in its progress in Wisconsinextract from a letter dated Troy, Pal worth county, His, March 13, 1845: "the wheat crops throughout this region present a most promising appearance; and, if no accident happens, we shall send an increased quantity to the eastern market the coming season. More ground has been sown in this, and the adjoining counties, than in any preceding year. I think Pal worth alone will spare from 100,000 to 150,000 bushels. Emigrants are fast pouring into the Territory; but as the government land which is of any worth is all taken in this section, the tide is turning northward and morewesterly. We have had fine spring weather for the past few weeks, and everything indicates an early opening of the farming season with us." (Troy is about 30 miles S. or S. W. of Milwaukee, and about the same distance. W. of Machine) In May also: " The growing wheat never promised fairer at this season of the year than it now does. It has a very luxuriant growth. It is believed the crop is out of the way of the fly and other insects; and there is now the fairest kind of a prospect of an early harvest and an abundant yield. It is calculated that at least three-eighths morel and is in wheat this year than last; so that it is a tolerably safe calculation to estimate the export of wheat from Wisconsin of the growth of 1845,at 400,000 bushelsRacine Advertise r, May 20. Of  t is stated in the Platteville (wisconsin) American of 2d instant, that the army worm is committing great ravages on Major Countries meadow, and on other farms in that county, where they have done considerable damage to the wheat crop. We have not heard of this army worms having invaded either the Heat or grass fields in Machine, Pal worth, or Rockcountiesracine Advertise r. From all parts of the Territory we learn that the wheat looks finely Never, (says the last Milwaukee Sentinel) it is said, was there a fairer prospect for a large crop of wheat, than there is the present season" From all parts of the Territory we learn that the wheat crop looks fine, notwithstanding the open winter, and seemingly unfavorable weather until the opening of spring. Wisconsin is the surest wheat country in the worldMilwaukie Courier. To, in June: "I n Wisconsin the wheat crop is said to be uncommonly fine. The impression we receive from the various accounts which reach us is, that, in the country at large, the wheat crop is not likely to be an average one; though, taking into account the large quantity that remains 138 To.

Heat at present averages six feet in the fields And yet later still: "the Wisconsin reapers are in the field gathering in as good a crop of winter wheat as was ever produced in the Territory. One third, if not one half more ground has been sown this year in wheat than in any former year; and the yield will beat least as good as at any previous period.

The editor of the Green May Republican makes a favorable report, from personal observation, of the crops in northern Wisconsin, in the upper country, bordering on the Box river valley. Heat, corn, oats, and barley are better than ever before. The wheat is heavy and free from smut t is stated by the papers in the Territory, that the last harvest has been the largest and most productive one to the farmer that has ever been gathered in the country. The surplus wheat raised will amount to an immensequantityRock I s land county having over half a million bushels surplus, and Pal worth county an equally large yield. The prospects for next year are still more flattering; double the amount of wheat has been sown this fall that there was the last; and, as the weather so far has been unusually propitious, the young grain throughout the Territory has the best possible appearance. Fromnthe quantity of new land broken up and sown in Lock county, it is estimated that the surplus yield in that county alone next year will amount to one million of bushels The following is from the Tribune of September 10th : " We have often heard of the prolific crops of Heat in Wisconsin, and the facility with which settlers are reimbursing their original out lay, but the following from the Machine Advertise r goes ahead of all previous operations. It says that two farmers from James ville, in Lock county, whose farms ad join, last fall had con jointly 200 agree of prairie broken and sown in wheat; the work being performed by two young men, with ten yoke of oxen, and two boys to drive, in a few weeks. These 200 acres of wheat have recently been cut by means of a machine, occupying only 12. days, with an extra expense offiftyeents an acre for binding and s tacking. The wheat turned out an aggregate of 5,000 bushels, worth                          $2,500, or an average of 25 bushels to the acre. In Friday the owner came to Machine with two wagons loaded with an aggregate of -205 bushels of wheat, which he Old to Mr. Richmond at 6 24 cents the bushel The following is from the Tribune of September 15th, in a letter date Dubuque, September 1st: " The crops in the Territory are unusually fine. Heat has never been equalled in 'the memory of the oldest inhabitant The increase of the wheat crop of Wisconsin may therefore be rated as high as that of I owaThe wheat crop of New England, being raised in small fields, and not properly a staple to any of these States, is, on this account, estimated with more difficulty than in those States where it necessarily attracts more attention. In the more northern sections, the varieties of spring wheat are Doc. To .140 139 the principal ones the culture of which is attempted. The weevil and the worm are the subject of complaint in Paine; and, owing to the ravages of the former insect for some years past, the farmers have been so much discouraged as to discontinue raising this crop. The Paine Farmer states that the crops in Piscataquis county 'a( will not turn out so well as was anticipated. The wheat crop has suffered much from the ravages of the weevil to such an extent, in fact, that many farmers have not considered it worth harvesting, and, consequently, have mowed down entire fields of it, curing the same for foddering purposes The Sang or Whig says, that "the wheat crop in that vicinity is much injured, and many fields ruined by the weevil and rusty n some parts it is thought to have been ten per cent. better. As the crop of last year (1844) was better than ordinary, we believe that a deduction, of five per cent. must be made for this years crop. The same was probably the case in New Hampshire. In Vermont, we are told that, while in some parts of the State' the drought seriously affected the crop, so that it fell off probably twenty-five per cent yet, taking the whole State, there was probably an average crop, which would be an increase of about ten per cent. on the previous year. One informant writes: " Heat, in 1844, was best at the north, while at the south it was less in quantity and meaner in quality; 'in 1845, it is best at the south and as the population is mostly at the south, there can be no doubt that ten per cent. more than last year is not a high estimate." We believe this to be a correct conclusion, and have accordingly, as it corresponds with what we can learn respecting the general crop of the State, placed it at ten per, cent. increase on the crop of 1844. Complaints of the weevil are likewise made. In the lower part of the State there has been some improvement, however, in the culture, and the grain of Bird ham county is estimated at thirty per cent. more. This is attributed to the application of lime and ashes and the selection of soils which contain magnesium limestone, by which tolerable crops have been secured. From the Boston Cultivator, also, we learn that the wheat crops are "uncommonly large and fine in the vicinity of Burlington while, in the Mainefarmer we are informed that the crop has " come in well" and there is an" abundance of wheat." In the north eastern part of the State, however, owing to the ravages of the weevil, it is thought to have fallen off considerably. Taking the State .through, we suppose it may be considered at about ten per cent. gain on the crop of 1844. The wheat crop of Massachusetts, it is believed, was a small gain. In the upper middle section of the State the yield is variously estimated in different towns at from "tea to twenty-five and thirty per cent. more." In the southern corresponding section, at "five per cent. less." In the western part of the State, " twenty-five per cent. more." A good judge residing there says: 1 The wheat crop, as compared with that of 1844, is one fourth more, and we attribute it, in a great measure, to the favorable spring months. The weather not being very warm, and a suitable quantity of rain, winter wheat came forward with great rapidity, and, without a check, ripened for the harvest. Spring wheat (which is the greater crop) was early sowed, in consequence of the ground being ready for the plough much sooner than usual. Notwithstanding that some few pieces were affected by the drought, we have had a better crop than for many years previous, and the insect worked much less than years before." In view of the statements respect 140 king the crop, therefore, we place it at an increase of fifteen per cent. on that of 1844. The crops of Rhode I s land and Connecticut seem to have been very similar with those of the adjoining States. In the former, it was probably about ten per cent. more, and in the latter about fifteen per cent. advance on the crop of 1844. In the Albany Cultivator for November last, Mr. Claudiusallen, of Cheshire, Connecticut, writes respecting wheat as follows: "to encourage the farmers throughout New England to sow more wheat, I can state that there has been more or less of wheat sowed on my farm for forty-five years, and there have been but two or three years, at most, when there has not been a pretty fait crop. In 1836 or '37, when there was a great scarcity of wheat throughout all the States, there was here an entire failure. In about four acres, I did not receive my seed sown that year. Since then the crops have been very good. For fifteen years that I have owned the farm, there has no insect of any kind injured the crop at all, that   am aware of. This years crop is superb, weighing 62 pounds to the bushel, and very plump. I generally soak my seed in strong bring, made of common salt, with saltpeter, ten or twelve hours; then mix with s lacked lime or plaster of Paris. This season I have sown on seven acres ten bushels of seed, raised near Seneca later New Work. I generally change my seed once in three or four years The State of New Jersey raises considerable wheat, and the last crop was much better than that of the preceding year. The notices given during the harvest, and the information since received, authorize the advance of 15 or 20 per cent. on the crop of 1844, which was less than an average erie. Thusthe Salem Messenger says: "during the last week our farmers were in the midst of harvest. The golden grain, which a few days since was waving far and wide over many a field, has bowed its head to the sickle of the merry harvester, and been gathered into the barns of the husband man. Scarce any one complains of a short wheat crop The Vomer ville (N. J.) Whig says: ' Last week some of our farmers were in the midst of their harvest, and had a few favorable days in which to gather it. Train has a clean and plump appearance, and the yield is generally good n the central counties, stretching across the State, the crop is said to have been full an average one. Further north, it is estimated to have been 25 per cent. more ; as more was sown, and it was not affected by the rust or fly. Similar was the condition of the crop in Delaware. As early as May, it is stated, in the Wilmington Journal, that " the prospect of an abundant wheat crop was never so flattering" and this promise seems to have been fully realized, and the grain was harvested in fine order, and above an average crop. There was doubtless at least 20 per cent. more than in the previous year. We notice in an agricultural paper the following statement respecting a fine yield of wheat: " Edward T. Well ah, esq, of Brandywine hundred, Delaware, harvested the past season 358 3 bushels wheat from 9 acres, being 391 bushels to the acre. He manured the field in the spring, planted corn, cut off the corn, sowed it in wheat, and f liked it in both ways among the corn roots, and gave it no other dressing except to sow 39 bushels bone dust over one acre, which he did not think better than the rest. 141 or. J. Sampson also raised 103 bushels on 2- acres; and on another field, 2 acres, was raised 37 bushels to the acre. This last land: it is said, a few years since would not have yielded more than five bushels to the acre, but was improved by two hundred bushels of shell mary and ten horse cart loads of com post, consisting of the refuse of skin dressers, blue boilers c. The crop of wheat in the District of Columbia par took much of the character of that of the adjoining States, and, as a whole, was a good one. The wheat crop of Texas, so far as we can learn, was abundant; but we have no means of estimating the amount of the same with any degree of reliance on our conclusions. In addition to the accounts and estimates already given, it may be well here to sub join some general views of the wheat crop throughout the country, taken from the public journals since the harvest. The Albany Org us estimates the wheat crop as follows; which, as will be seen, corresponds pretty nearly with our own independent deductions( First, as to the great northern staple, wheat, the crop is undoubtedly a large one more than an average and it has been secured in excellent condition. This is the tenor of advices from all quarters. Even in Ohio, where the wheat crop is probably less than an average, the wheat is very clean and the merry very white. We hear neither of rust nor smut. Though the farmers have lost in quantity, they have undoubtedly gained in quality. In Michigaft, I illinois, Wisconsin, and I own, the wheat crop is magnificent. Very thing has been favorable. To likewise, we understand, in the wheat crop in Pennsylvania. In Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Georgia, it has been affected by the drought some say so seriously as to shrivels thelberry. In Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri, the crop is a noble one. In New England and New Work, it is probably less than an average one Similar, also, is the conclusion formed by the editor of the Journal ofCommierce: " The Cropswithin the last two or three weeks we have travelled 1000 miles in the State of New Work, and every where have made it a point to observe and inquire after the crops. The uniform testimony in regard to wheat is, that the crop is beyond an average. He, however, saw many fields which did not come up to our expectations, while others were as good as could be reasonably desired. Passing into Canada, we found the wheat crop there also very fine. Gentlemen from the interior gave the same account. We also saw persons from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, I illinois, and other western States. Even in Ohio, the crop is now thought to be a full average. In Michigan, Wisconsin, and parts of In diana and      illinois, it never was surpassed. The accounts from Pennsylvania are also favorable. In Virginia the crop is a full average, and in Maryland more than an 'average. To make a long story a short one, it may be said, in general, that the wheat crop of the country is one of the largest in quantity, and best in quality, that ever was gathered Some of the public journals have estimated the whole wheat crop as high as 125,000,000. We believe this is very much too large, and that it will not over go 107,000,000. We prefer to fall short than to exceed the actual amount; and, by as careful review as we have been able to make, we have accordingly fixed it, as in the table, at 106,548,000 bushels! As a general remark, however, it may be said that, in its weight and a p 142 Appearance and fitness for use, the crop is at least 10 per cent. better. The excellence of the crop, as a whole, seems attribute able in a measure to the cold spring and the warm weather immediately succeeding, by which it was protected from the fly and rust, ripened finely, and was gathered in free from damage by un propitious harvesting. If we might hazard a conjecture, also, we should say that the seed now in the ground being free from insects, the crop of the next year, if the weather proves favorable, will be     such improved. It is evident that there is a large surplus of wheat in our country; and the vast quantity which has been poured forward to the Atlantic ports from the western country shows that this surplus has beenprovidentially directed at a period when it cannot merely aid in feeding our own population, but also those who are starving abroad. While collecting the notices of the crops, we have met with a variety of articles in the agricultural journals and newspapers of the day, relating to the insects and diseases affecting this product. Some of these, and also remedies against them, we sub join, either in whole or substance, believing that they may be useful as memoranda to the agriculturists; and in some, if not in all instances, when more thoroughly tested, may receive confirmation. The instances recorded, which have fallen under our eye, of the prevention of smut, (especially the dust or pepper brand, as it is sometimes termed by bringing and living, are frequent. One of these we find in a letter to the editors of the National I intelligence r, from C. B. Carlton, near this city, in which the crop from seed which had not been so prepared was destroyed by smut, while that which had been so prepared remained untouched, The On. William War michael, also, in a note to the American Farmer, refers to the experiments of M. de Com basle, who used 18 lbs. of Glaubersalts to 22 gallons of water, as a steep; following this with placing his seed wheat in a bed of quick lime (s lacked just before use) on his barn floor, and stirring it up so as to cause the lime to adhere to the kerseys of grain, and then spreading it out to dry, not leaving it more than three days before planting. Mr. War michael states that he has tried the same plan, and found it successful. Mr. W. Valley, of Aurelius, Washington county, Ohio, states to the editor of the Ohio Cultivator, that he has used bringing for sixteen years, and thus secured his wheat from the wheat fly; while his neighbors, without this preparation, have been often troubled by it. A similar testimony s to its efficacy is given in the same paper by A. Battles, of Chickasaw, Ohio, who says that his limed wheat is one third heavier than the other. The following are some of the remarks of the editor of the Ohio Cultivatoron the subject: " The mode of preparation is as follows: (it can be varied to suit convenience One or two days before sowing, put the seed into a vat or box, then take strong bring (such as is used for preserving in eat) and beat it as hot as you can bear the hand in, for five seconds, and pour this over the wheat, stirring it the meantime with a scoop or shovel till the whole is completely wet; two or three quarts of bring is sufficient for a bushel of wheat; let it stand a few hours to drain, then spread it on the barn floor and sprinkle it over with fine s lacked lime ; stir it and add lime until everykernel appears white and dry: it is then fit for sowing. It will on ty require about one bushel of lime to ten bushels of wheat Another simple method of bringing wheat is, to: put the seed into a bushel basket, arid stand this on a common wash tub with seats across, i then pour go the bring, shake the basket, and allow the surplus bring to run through. 14 into the tub below, to be used over again. The rational e of such preparation is this First: it is believed that the <a name="seeds7"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of disease, as smut, &c and the minute eggs of insects, as the weevil, exist on or within the kerseys of the grain, and are destroyed by the bring and lime. Second: it is known that salt and lime are highly conduct ve to the health and growth of the wheat plant, especially on soils that have been exhausted of their mineral salts, and where these necessary elements of the wheat crop are not restored by good tillage person writing to the editor of the Albany Cultivator from Laurensdistrict, S. C., says: " I have been soaking my seed wheat in blue stone sulphate of copper) one pound to five bushels water enough to cover leaving it to soak for about twenty-four hours, and then rolling it in ashes, and have found this method a full preventive against smut. With the same effect I have tried, for five bushels of seed wheat one pound of sal p etre, two pounds of Flaubert salts, two pounds of copper as; and 1 never hat smut in wheat when I used either of these preparations The editor of the Genesee Farmer gives an account of the appearance of an insect in some wheat which Men. Arm on, a man thoroughly acquainted with the culture of this product, supposes may be connected with the causes of the malady Thus: . We saw yesterday, at Generalharmons, twenty or more small brown bugs, which have lately emerged fromkernels of smut wheat, leaving a small opening in the grain of smut, like the aperture in the pea, through which the pea bug escapes. General H. placed full heads of smut, before the wheat was ripe, into a closely wrapped paper, for the purpose of seeing if any insect would be developed in the heads of smut. The insect a d heads were together when we saw them yesterday. For. Arm on thinks that this insect is somehow the cause of this malady. At Mr. Misha Harmony we saw a head of wheat free from smut on one side, while every berne l on the other was nothing but smutGeneseeFarmer. We find an interesting statement respecting the weevil, in a communication from Kentucky to the American Agriculturists, from which we now quote it: "A new fact t is generally believed that the eggs of weevil deposited in the grains of wheat are hatched out in the same season before winter; or, if not hatched out then, that they perish and do no injury to the grain. This may be the case with the white weevil, but it is not true of the black. In the fall of 1843, two years ago, I received from Virginia a shot bag filled with Longer wheat an early ripe king variety, much valued by some farmers in that State. It was a fair, sound, beautiful sample of grain. I had just sown before its reception a small quantity of the same variety, and determined to keep this to sow the next year, fearing some accident to the seemed crop. The shot bag of wheat was very carefully put away in a clothes press so carefully that it did not again come to light till about ten days ago. In opening the bag a number of black weevils were seen, which had come out. Others were in the act of coming out of the grain; and, on cutting open grains which appeared sound, the insect was found in the grain. To not the eggs of insects remain dormant, like <a name="seeds8"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of plants, till the proper con juncture of circumstances for their active existence takes place ?a? This may not be for years, or may happen the sameyearThe black weevil also hatched out of grain here of the present years 144 harvest, for one of my neighbors called from his field a small sack of wheat he thought might be a valuable kind, cleaned it out, and suspended it by a rope in an upper room of a house. When he took it down to sow, a few weeks ago, he found great numbers of black weevil hatched out, since harvest, in his sack of selected wheat. The conclusion at which I arrived is, that no season favorable, to the active life of these insects has occurred herein 1843 or 1844; but that this season, being favorable, not only those deposited this year, but those also remaining dormant in the grain, deposited in previous years, have been excited into active existence. Great injury has been done by these insects this year in this State, and much of the wheat cleaned out has been destroyed by black weevil; and, in cases where it Was got out of the straw and left in the chaff, it has been injured by white weevil a circumstance causing astonishment; as leaving it in the chaff has been thought a sure preventive of injury by them. The wheat left in the sticks till this tit me is also generally injured, and, in some stacks, utterly destroyed by the white weevil. An any of your correspondents tell us how to avoid these injuries to the grain after it is madeJOHN Lewi It Llangollen, Of, October 18, 1845.",A new insect in wheat is described by a correspondent in the Cultivatorfor May, from Bucks county, A. He says: "I t is a small green worm, about an inch in length; its head is brownish green, with two brown spots upon it. The worm ascends the stalk of wheat soon after it has put out in head, cuts off the head, and feeds upon the top of the standing part." Heapprehends great injury to the wheat crop there, unless some remedy is discovered, and supposes it may be the army worm; but the editor of the Cultivator speaks of it as new to him. Intothe insect is thus noticed in the Prairie Farmer, as found in I illinois: "he are informed that a very singular and destructive insect has made its appearance in parts of Will county, where it makes itself very disagreeably destructive. It is a small fly, a little more than one-eighth of an inch in size when grown. It has four wings, which, when folded upon the back, present the shape of a diamond. They were discovered at wheat harvest, when their presence was indicated by the heads of wheat turning white. The insect was found in myriads, covering the straw, particularly about the joints. Upon touching the wheat s talks they would fall, as if dead, to the ground. When the wheat was cut they took to the cornfields, if near, where they are now making themselves much at home within the husks or under the sheaths about the s talks. Worn which was not too far ripened when they found it, died immediately. They are now preying on the young wheat, which they eat off just beneath the surface of the earth, taking all clean as they go. They are in all stages of growth, and have been from the first; and the ground is perforated with holes made by them. Their scent is that of the bed bug, and a field of them is anything but delightful. The ante ater, which preys on the a p hides, preys also on this insect While upon this subject, we may mention an essay on the wheat fly, by or. Isa Pitch, published originally in the New York Quarter ly Journal of Agriculture and Science, as a pamphlet which contains much valuable information for farmers in the wheat growing States. In a letter from Professor Johnston, the eminent agriculturists of England, addressed to Charles
pox, of Cross I s le, Hayne county, Michigan, (and published in the Michigan Armies) by whom he was consulted on the cause and cure of smut and rust in wheat, the Professor says: " About the smut and rust, your notice is all right sleeping in a solution of salt that will float an egg, and then drying the wet seed with quick lime ;fermented urine, blue vitriol, (sulphate .of: Copper) aid arsenic, are also used as steeps for the same purpose of killing the fungus, with greater or less effect. The rust arises from the over luxuriant e of the growth of your wheat, which -will diminish; but especially from the wet ness of you t soil, or the rains and mists to which, in the midst of so much water, your land may be subject. ;A go 6d dose of time, perhaps plastering your wheat, might help this disease; but it will lessen as your land is better drained, and rendered drierAnd in relation to rust in wheat, we add the following statement, which may deserve some notice: "' A correspondent of the Genesee Farmer states that he has recently examined many rushed s talks of wheat with a magnifying glass of a very high power, and finds the outer covering of the straw burst open, the edges raised up, and through the apertures thus made the particles of rust pro trade. The appearance of the rust he states to be that of dried mucilaginous matter. The rust in this case examined must not be confounded with the red rest, which is entirely external, and can be washed offFdrther accounts of methods of preparing seed wheat to prevent disease will be found in connection with several articles on the culture of wheat :c c, in the appendix No. 2. The statement in the appendix signed " A farmer in Tompkins you n ty, taken from the Cultivator for January, 1846, is one deserving of attention. Another, in the same paper of July, 1845, contains an -extract from Vahcouvers Survey of Devonshire, England, in which the surveyor a scribes the rust and mildew to weakness and tenderness, in consequence of late sowing and bad situations. He says: " :list act No. l The mildew or rust is hut little known, except in small enclosures and low situations, "where the ropes excited from a free circulation of air; in the higher parts of the country, where the fields are large, and the division mounds are: covered only with dwarf hazel or .will o iv and creeping brambles, :the evil is by no means- s ch as to reirqre particular notice.

Before entering upon his harvest, he selects a portion of his field for seed, and reserves that for his last- cutting. As hi harvests are large, this portion gets fully ripe before he is ready to cut it. After d among and mowing away the rest of his crop, he secures this also but, instead of facing- it on a now or s tack, he/ puts on a scaffolding over his barn floor. I his is done to prevent the seed wheat from being affected by the steam which rises from wheat, and which he thinks would injure it, When seeing tin de comes, he threshes out his seed, and sows it without any preparation. He has pursued this course a number of years, and has -never had smut in his wheat to any extent since he adopted it Besides the varieties of wheat which have been already mentioned in the account of the crops above, we may -here notice some others, whiclbseem to possess qualities which entitle them to consideration. A kind called the Etrurian wheat, introduced by Commodore Stewart, possessing his said, all the advantages of the Mediterranean, and has, besides, a remarkable strong and vigorous stalk, has been estimated with success by the Rev. Daniel Zollickoffer, of Maryland. Accounts of: this variety maybe found with that of others yet to be mentioned, in appendix Nocid127l , Smoother kinds are thus noticed in the American Farmer. Mrsnmelitzers letter will ,a so be found in the appendix No. 2, just mentioned. Samples of some of these kinds of wheat, as well as the Etrurian, have been received, and will be distributed from the Patent Office to th.eimembers of Congress." The Baltimore American notices a specimen of white wheat, very remarkable for its extraordinary size, which was grown on the farm of Mr. Joseph He arson, a lout three miles northwest of Baltimore, who has this year raised about three hundred bushels, the produce being estimated atf4rtyfive bushels per acre. The s talks are about six feet high, very stout at the bottom, and, the grain fully one halt larger than the -ordinary red wheat. The strength of i the s talks enables i to t land, the wind and rain, and it is said to be entirely exempt from smut. : "several years ago, Mr. He arson purchased and sowed a quantity of wheat procured from n New Work; among which several heads appeared toweringsecid127qal feet, above the -other grain.

A variety of wheat called the Alabama or Tackle man wheat is mentioned also in the Ohio cultivate or, an account of which will also be found 1 in the same appendix. The American Farmer for August mentions a sample of wheat grown by Thomas Bucket t, some of the heads of which yielded 100 grain.

Thomas Robe, of Stark county, near Massillon, whom we visited a few days since, practises a mode of putting in wheat that is called in his native country (england) ' rubbing' and, from his experience in this country, he is convinced that it is superior to the common mode of sowing, at least for his kind of soil, which is a fine hazel loam, or what was called 'oak plains' in that region, and is well adapted to this crop. After the land has been thoroughly ploughed and harrowed, till it is in what would commonly be called good order for sowing, Mr. Noble goes over it with small narrow one horse ploughs, made for the purpose, and which leaves the land in open furrows four or five inches deep, and ten or eleven inches apart; the seed is then sown one bushel to the acre, and the ground harrowed once over, length wise of the furrows. Thisharrowing brings the seed into the furrows and covers it there, and leaves slight ridges between ; so that the plants appear as if drilled in rows, and the ridges afford them protection in winter, and keep the ground in a mellower state in summer, besides affording a freer circulation of air, &c. Bethink the plan eminently worthy of trial, especially on such lands as are subject to ' inter killing' a It is an improvement on the plan of sloughing in wheat, practised by many. it h a gang of ploughs, or a machine for making three or four furrows at once, which Mr. Noble intends to construct for this purpose, the amount of labor will be very much reducedOhioCultivator. Narrowing wheat in the spring is also stated to be useful, and a correspondent of one of the papers says: "that having, one year left his harrow in the wheat field s ll winter, he was obliged to drag it across his wheat when he removed it early in the spring, and that the track of the harrow was plainly perceptible through the season, in the greater thrifty ness f that part of the grain. The next year he harrowed a few acres of his wheat as early in the spring as the ground would permit, and found the most beneficial effects. (cid127The harrowed wheat grew with remarkable rapidity, and turned out decidedly i heavier crop that any other part of the field, though all was sowed at the same time." The editor of the Michigan Farmer says: "for the extensive growing of Heat, no manure is equal to the large German c lover, plastered and ploughed under; and every farmer who will give to his wheat fields every third year a crop of c lover, will rot sacrifice his ultimate interest" Another writer recommends the following top i dressing for Heat: " Salt; salt and lime ; salt, lime, and ashes shot; soot and ashes, take excellent t hop: dressings for wheat. If salt should be applied alone t o bushels t the acre is the proper quantity; if salt and lime, two bushels of salt arid ten of lime should be sown to the acre; if soot. alone, from ten to twenty bushels per acre ; and if soot and ashes, ten, bushels of each will form a most valuable mixture t is often desirable to calculate the amount of the wheat crop as it stands of the ground ; and this is said to be done in England with very eonsiderat
ble accuracy, in the manner thus described: /about the time the wheat is blooming, generally about the beginning of June, (winter wheat in England) a person will go round with a a gauge secreted in a hollow cane, which forms, when opened, a triangle, and represents a certain portion of an acre of ground. This is placed over various portions of the crop pin the best and in the worst parts of the field. The number of ears of wheat within the triangle is counted, and the probable quality of the grain is taken into calculation, according as the spring has been wet or, dry. In the former supposition, the grain is likely to shrink; on the latter, to hard en and come out plump. It may be observed, that if there has been a good general rain during the last ten days of April, and the. first ten days of May, on the average no more wet is required in that climate (england) for wheat. In expert gauge r will form a very accurate estimate of the probable produce of a given district by this :method." The editor of the Paine Farmer states that, by actual counting, it has been ascertained that a bushel of heat, weighing 62 pounds, contained in round numbers about 550,000kernels; so that if we were sure that every grain sown would grow and come to maturity, taking 42,360 square feet for an acre, and dividing each foot into four compartments, and placing a grain of wheat in the centre of each, the whole acre would only require four fifths of a bushel. We add here a statement, which we find in one of the public journals, respecting the difference of weight in a bushel of wheat in some of the States, as it sometimes may be useful. The writer says is I have seen some statements in the papers as to the weight of a bushel of wheat raised by some farmer in Pennsylvania, I would remark that the Pennsylvania bushel, and that generally used in Maryland, is larger than the Virginia standard bushel by nearly three half pints. The greatest weight I have seen, to which the Pennsylvania wheat reached, was 69 pounds to the bushel. My friend and neighbor, Or William Pendleton, had a bushel of seed wheat, of his raising, by the Virginia standard measure, weighed accurately oh the flour scales (patent balances) in theHoneywood mills, which weighed 6' pounds strong draught' Train measures By a law of In diana, passed last winter, the weight of a bushel of grain is fixed as follows. A bushel of merchant able wheat shall be taken and given, in all contracts, at sixty pounds .a. A bushel of rye shall consist of fifty-six pounds. A bushel of corn shall be taken at fifty-six pounds. Of bushel of flax seed at fifty-six pounds. A standard bushel of merchant able barley shall consist of forty-eight pounds. . A standard bushel of oats shall consist of thirty three pounds. These weights of the respective grains now constitute in In diana the legal standard bushel; and, under a contract to deliver so may   ny bushels of grain, the delivery of these weights per bushel will constitute a legaltenderProfessor Kindly, of London, speaking of the maturity of grain, says  t is a remarkable fact, that the further north grain can be made to grow, the shorter is the period of time in which it comes to maturity. It has also been observed, that -when. it is grown, in the extreme north, when used as seed in the southern c but try, it gives its first produce more, speedily, ripenr150 q a it y. t *ing inauchot os for' Peter tim at of the second so  owing it loses its f i the New Took Arm her and Mechanics, the quality of Heat raised indifferent sections of the country, aid the kind of manure which may be used to advantage in the production of this grain, are thus stated: Heat is ;now n to by the mostinutritious of all grains, bee use it contains a largerquadriity of glum ten.

Now what is this advantage, as applied to practical purposes? I will explain.

But, says one, the northern flour must be the better; because, look t t he of; it its whiter and lighter. True; but let it be remembered that this diffeinShce with respect to Whiteness, is the difference in the preparation and grind i fig; and that of lightness, i chiefly in the absence ofglhtein He qui atiitity f the flour may be affected by the mode of preparation and grinding; but the c quantity of the several principles composing it. 151 cannot. The same quantity of starch, glum ten, &c, must be retained, whether the wheat be ground in a good or a bad million. These facts are interesting, and deserve attention. We have already given some account of the Alabama or Tackle man wheat, as it is tried in an Ohio paper See appendix No. 2.)BARLEY. The crop of barley in the State of New Work, where more than half the crop of thee while country is grown, was in general a very good one better than in the previous year. Taking the census of that State for the year 1844 as our basis, we have found: it necessary to increase the estimate in the table. The accounts we- have received respecting it, except in some few sections, are most 'limited. In the north eastern section of the State it was about " 10 per cent more." In the eastern side of the Hudson, belowAlbany1 it is considered as having been larger than in the previous year and in some counties" 5 or do per cent." West of the Hudson, and below the Lo hawk, while it felt off in Schoharie county, it was a fair average inOtsego -county. In the Mohawk, also, and above, it was also l art average drop." Still farther to the west and to the north, it varied from " 10 to 1 per cent. increase." In the more western central enurtiles; and in the western part of the State, the increase in some sections was yet larger; "202 5, 30," and even in some cases it is thought to have been as high as '50 per cent." As the barley crop in this State is shown, by the late State cents S, to have been previously underestmiated0, the amount of the crop wilt be comparatively larger than it would otherwise have been. We suppose it may have reached an average of about 15 per cent. more than in 1844,according to the State census. In some of the New England States the crop is said t tube coming more into re pate every year. I to excellent qualities for feeding give it great commendation, and its value as a crop to stock after is surpassed only by the wheat crop." Of the crop in Paine and New Hampshire we can gather but little, except that upon the whole it was a better iron probably 5 percent. more. In Vermont it was equal or something better had th crop of the previous year, and the increase may be fixed at the at v rage crop of about 5 per cent. In Massachusetts, in the eastern sections of the State, though but little was raised, there was probably an increase of 10 to 15 percent. The same was likewise the case in the central part of the State. In the western, however, it is thought to have fallen off from the drought which prevailed in June and July. In the Whole, there was an average crop of 8 per cent. The drop in both Rhode I s land and Connecticut is small, and may have been about the same as in the adjoining States. To little attention, comparatively, is paid to this crop in wearily- a the remaining States, that it is difficult to arrive at any very satisfactory estimate. I twas, as is supposed, about t an average crop in New Jersey, and considerable less in Pennsylvania, as it suffered severely by the drought' In the south eastern, eastern, and central sections, it is tt hough t to have fallen off from' 25 to 30 per cent. ;" and taking the whole State through, we believe it must have been less than the crop of 1844 by " about 10 per cent." In the States south of Pennsylvania, for the most part the decrease must havebeeriequally large, if not larger, from the same cause. They, however, produce so little, that the general result can be but partially affected by this 152 Doc. To; 140.diminution.: In an agricultural paper in Virginia, however, it is thurecommendedBBarley a profitable crop There is constant demand for this article in the west, where the consumption of malt liquors is immense. It is a very sure crop, and liable to none of the diseases peculiar to wheat. yields about double the quantity, and commands a higher price. Those who have cultivated it in this vicinity, we understand, have succeeded well. We make the following extract from an article on the subject in the last number of the Winchester Virginia Farmer: The cultivation of barley has been of late years much neglected in Virginia. We find, however, here and there some few of our friends disposed to give it some degree of attention, as agra in worthy their notice; and, among those who have been the most successful in producing a fine crop, we would note the case of our friend, Mr. John Truce, of this place. From a four acre lot we are told this gentleman raised, during the present season, two hundred and ten bushels of clean barley, averaging, as will be seen, fifty two and a half bushels per acre, making the round sum of one hundred and fifty-seven dollars and ten cents, and, after de ducting interest of land, cost of labor, seed, &c, yielding him the handsome profit of one hundred and twenty dollars. Now, if there is any other crop that comes up to this, or any farmer who has derived a greater profit in cultivating the same number of acres in small grain this season, we should like to hear from him. When we take into consideration the fruitful yield of barley, and its free ness from fly or other infections so common to wheat, we are strongly of opinion that it bids fair to become a great staple in portions of the valley. The Winchester brewery will give seventy-five cents per bushel. It is required to weigh forty-six pounds to the bushel' ,I n Tennessee and Kentucky which, however, raise only a small crop there was about an average yield; perhaps " a slight advance" on the crop of the previous year. In Ohio, on the eastern central border, there was a considerable falling off; probably "' 30 per cent. less." In the more northern counties it was " about equal" to the crop. of 1844. In the northwestern part of the State a slight increase; perhaps ' 10 per cent more." In the southwestern, from the central, "25 per cent. more." In the Miamivalley, however, the individual crops probably fell as much as " 25 per cent in account of the increased demand, there is said to have been much more cultivated ; and thus the whole crop in that section is thought to havereachedctas high as "75 per cent. more" than in the previous year. More than half of the whole crop of Ohio, as it appears from the census, is raised in some half dozen counties of the State. Taking the whole State, we are inclined to believe that there was an increased crop of 10 to 155 per cent more than in the year before. In I n diana, I illinois, and the other westernaStates, we believe also there was a small increase; and in Michigan, I own and Wisconsin, which rank higher in their attention to this crop, a very considerable advance. The crop of I own is estimated, by one whose opportunities of judgment must be allowed to be good, at 30,000 bushels. We suspect, however, that this is rather too large an estimate, though our own of the preceding year was much too small evidently, as the cropofPlatt county alone i said to be 5,000 bushels. We think that Wisconsin was probably about 20 per cent. more, and Michigan in the same proportion. The whole barley crop, therefore, would amount to about 5,160,000bushels. 
8Some mention was made in the report for 1844 of a kind. of barley called the Your barley. We notice a few observations respecting it during the past year, in the Cultivator for October and November. The first is from a correspondent who is spoken of as W. B., of Aureus district, S. C., who was very anxious to obtain some of this kind of barley. "' He formerly had it, but lost the seed by suspending the business of farming for a few years, and removing to another district. He says: (I am fully satisfied, from the trials I have made, that it will produce from 30 to 50 bushels per acre, and that our soil and climate will suit it. It will bear stable manure ; whereas, the increased application of that article to wheat invariably tends to throw it into straw, and causes it to lodge' He offered five dollars for one bushel of it, delivered at any seaport and shipped to Charleston." The editor oftheCultivator remarks, " We cannot see, from this description, how this barley differs from the naked or bald barley, which has been more or less known in the country for several years." In the November number of the same publication, the editor observes that a sample of the bald or naked barley has been sent him by John D. Up inner, of Herkimer. He states that it is a j handsome grain, and weighs above sixty pounds to the bushel, and is said to be very productive. Mr. Henry Brewer, of In field, New Work, also mentions in a letter alluded to in the same work, that he sowed half a bushel of "skin less" barley in the spring on seventy-two rods of ground, and the produce was sixteen bushels, weighing fifty-eight pounds per bushel. It was much injured by the drought and grasshoppers. He thinks it, however, a valuable kind ,of grain, and says that it' makes good flour, which is preferred to buckwheat for cakes. In the Dark Lane Express for July 21, 1845, this grain. is thus characterized ; _his valuable. grain is worthy the serious consideration of the agriculturists, as, returning a greater profit than the barley in general cultivation and, if grown side by side, will yield -more bushels, more flour for. human food, and 25 per cent. more beer, and also will feed more stock; because 1. It contains more flour than any other grain, rice only excepted. 2. I r weighs more than sixty pounds per bushel 3. The flour is whiter and sweeter than common barley flour." 4.

It very seldom lodges, arid is not subject to disease 20. Each acre of this barley produces about one third more food. B -the produce of this barley, both in quantity and weight, sur passes a il others ; and, as regards its rating qualities, and extract of sac, charing, is even superior t to the best Chevalier barley in quality as well asquanfityNordthampon t iterld :I n the Dark A ti Express for September 8, 1845, a- new species of barley is mentioned, i which, upon a light soil, produced from 8 to 10 quarters equal to 64 to 80 bushels) per acre. It is said to: be fine in quality, and good for making purposes. Efforts have been made to procure some Hiimilaya barley, mentioned in a previous report, but Is yet they have been unsucessftrl. There appears to be some diversity of opinion on the continent respecting the value of this grain, as we fear t .fro a since of the German journals, received -at: the Patent office. : -a. .a.  Oats& 'a. f' , :a: .,S M O. s -a. Idoats being a favorite crop, and raised more o less i even State, seem to have- been extensively cultivated ; but a the drought affected the drop mnordthan usual in some parts of the country. I u Nwfenglicid127, on the whole, it appears to have succeeded. The Aime Farmer, in i July, says that " oats r a w i- died rare rather light, but will undoubtedly yield a regenerating harvest." In the central arid notthetnsectioti, also, we are informed that there was an advance of 10 per cent." over the crop of '84 4. In the lower section of New Hampshire, on the southeast, it is thought that the increase was at least 10 per merit" in the central lower section there appears to have been a decrease ; and in the central western, a god but de, -after reviewirthe weather, both before and it ring the harvest, states theicropio have been an unusually large one, as more than common, was son" In the whole, regard being had to this product as set down in the census v, we may fairly estimate the increase at from 10 to id 15 per cent. for the State, In Vermont the crop was a good one; and, from all t that we can learn respecting it, there Was- an average i crease: f about t 10 per cent. In A   saehusetts in nearly every section of the State, there was a gain, ranging from 10 to 15 per cent; In the east en central part, the crop was unusually early, and did well. In the western section it is thought to have fallen off perhaps: o ne third" wh i si i ascribed t to the drought in The and July. A writer from that section, 'i a letter to the Boston ti vat, says "oats seem to be going rather out of fashion, as well they may; for every year proves them to be an exhausting crop, and a miserable on to s tow with." In the western -part of the State according to the cents s the o at drop is usually larger than any other ; and, after comparing the accounts in the various counties with the returns of the census, we believe that the drop must have had about the average increase of a good crop; " about 10 per cent." over that of ll 44. In Rhode I slandanConnecictalss r and connecticut, or was raised, ad the gain Was probably about the same as in Massachusetts. The crop fell off in New Work. The accounts from all sections nearly unite in the testis. ,55 many to this effect. The State census, which we have take f as our basis, shows that our estimate the last year was too great. The drought: verysefioisly affected the progress of the: ops in all parts of the State tin some sections the injury was great a an in others. In the southeasterfisection, and along on the Hudson river, either side, where large quantities are raised, it probably fell off from " 20 to 25 per cent. ; arid, in some cases, the decrease has been estimated as high as '50 per cent." As we proceed north, however, the damage sustained does not seem to have been as great arid, indeed, in the north eastern and northern a poisons of the State it is thought to have been better by from " 5 to 10 per cent." Long the Mohawk, it was about n a v ate rage crop ;" but south of this again it fell off considerably. As we proceed west, in the central portion it is variously estimated to have beer i: " 10, 15, and 20 per cent" and still further west, (with the exception of the southtwestrtn corner, where, on acddcid127iunt of more having bee ri sown, there as a slight advance) the crop de lid it as is thought, about one fourth. The decrease, therefore, iii the whioleState, can hardly be estimated at t less th(cid:127) about i to 10 per cent. on the crop of the State census of .1844. The o at crop of New Jereyicid127was, also, less than that of the preceded  no year. In -the central counties, across the State, it is estimated at" o be third less" than In a ti savage crop. In the riorthwtestern section the decease is thought to have been not quite so great but perhaps ,about 10 per cent." In the whole, it may have fallen of about 15 or 20 per centfidomi the crop of 1844, which seas n, it will be to in in mind, Was favorable to this product. The prospect of the crop in Petnsylv anna, itcid127) the sprig, seems to have been promising. Thus, in May, theGertianttiwn T6elegaph says: "spring, thus far, for oats, Which are a ready 'se real inches high, could it have been ri fire. A considerable extent of ground is occupied this year with this grain, which, judging fr in present appearance, Will tier i o at well n the months of Full and July, however, the drought very seriouslyitmpairedI      this prospect, s flattering ; and it is stated in the public journals that "oats promise to be only tolerable." Since the harvest, also, we have similar reports from various sections of the State. I i the rich agricultural county of Lancaster it is thought that this crop Was is 40 per cent. less and it is said: Oats, in consequence of the dry weather in April rid May, were short in h the st ta, and light in the grain ; the deficiency is i rid t short of 40 per cent was compared with the preceding year, and of an inferior quality at that" Of  Chester do unity the crop suffered much from i th drought in June and the early part of July, and is probably "50 per cent less: In the eastern central section, near: th Delaware aldLehigh rivers, the san~ e complaint is heard of drought, and the c top is -hough t to have decreased from f 15 to 20 per ce it." ' In th (cid127toithber cetittal counties, lying on the Susquehinnhah' and ittianbhes, it is judged to have been r about the same as last year. To weir dtocid127, however, on this amie river, and west, li here was a falling off of rot less than " one forth of the crop." In the north eastern and northwestern parts of the Ft te, a lo, there was a falling off of from (a( 55 o 15 per cent." The drop for the Whole State, it is believed, suffered a decrease of 15 to 20 per cent. The same may probably be said of )el aware. The early accounts of the o at c top of Maryland are discouraging. Thus the Centre ville Gazette speaks, respecting that of the Eastern shore : The 156 coats are fast ripe king, and will, soon be ready for the cradle, though there was but a light sowing, and the prospect is not very flatteringSubseqPently, the American Farmer says: " The o at crop will be short, though not so light as had been an paced a month ago. Some late rains helped the oats which had not been look far advanced to be affected by it the drought) In the Eastern shore of this State, it is said the crop will not probably exceed half the usual one." By some persons the crop of the north eastern section of, the State is thought to be ' 50 per cent. less There can hardly have been a less deficiency, throughout the whole State, than about 25 per cent. The Southern Planter, speaking of the o at crop in Virginia, in June, says: "I Notwithstanding the oats have put but prettily since the late rains, they were so retarded by the drought that the crop, we should think, must of necessity be a short one' Again, in July, an account from Richmond states: , There has been a sad falling off in oats, many farmers deeming their crops scarcely worth gathering, they being 35 cents per bushel." Since the harvest, also, a .correspondent of the Southern Planter writes fromLynchburg; and, speaking of the crop in the valley, says that there " is not one quarter of a crop of oats." Other accounts likewise concur in representing the o at crop of Virginia as having been a light one. In the counties lying east of the Blueridge, and stretching up from Bedford to Madison, the report is ;that this crop was " almost totally ,destroyed by the ,drought." In the section directly east of this last, it was also "almost an entire failure from 50 to 75 per cent. short." In the southern central part of the State, bordering on North Carolina, it is also thought to have been "50 per cent. less. In .he northwestern corner of the State, and also in the counties lying along the Kanawha river, the decrease is estimated to have been not less than "25 per cent." Such being the views which everywhere meet us respecting the o at crop of Virginia, we believe we shall not very greatly err by fixing the decrease as high ascid12710 per cent. In North Carolina the drought likewise seriously affected this crop, and in all sections it fell off some say 50, others 75 or 80 per cent' He judge it to have been about 50 per cent, or not more than half the usual crop. The same was the case in most parts of South Carolina and Georgia, though in the latter State, in the northwest corner, there is supposed to have been a much better crop ;and the while deficiency, therefore, may, not have been more than about 30 per cent. compared, with the crop of 1844. The like diversity respecting the o at crop is fund in our accounts from Alabama. In the south eastern part of the State, we are informed by a good judge that the crop was about el al to that of the previous, year. In the north eastern section it is estimated at about 15 per cent. more. In the central portion, on the branches of the Alabama, the drought is much complained of, and it is supposed that there is not more than two thirds of a cry. In the whole, it is judged that the deficiency may have been about 15 to 20 per cent. In Mississippi and Arkansas, there appears to have been a small increase perhaps 10 per cent. above the crop of 1844. Of  n Tennessee the, o at crop is said, on the whole, to have been better than in 1844. In the, north eastern section, from the central, it is thought to have been less than that of the previous year by " about. 20 per cent. ;while at the western part of the State there was, it is said, an equal advance. It may be fixed a about 10 per cent. for the whole State. A similar diversity exists in Kentucky; though, taking the whole State through, a. 157 the crop is an increased one. 'I n the north eastern section of the State it was probably an 'average crop." More towards the centre, the t crop wasprobablycid127) "less by 10 per cent." In the southeast, "a: 10 per cent: better West of the centre, in the northern: j- t of the State, it was "20 per cent better ' while in the south, bl ordering on Tennessee, it is estimated to have been i less by 20 per cent." than the year previous. The whole crop was probably about 10 per cent. better With few exceptions, the accounts relating to the o at crop in Ohio are favorable: In the eastern central section, bordering on Pennsylvania and the Ohio river, there is said to have been "not more than half a crop." In the south eastern a part of the State on the he Ohio river, also, there was not more than two thirds of a crop." In the central counties, lying on theMuskingnm and Scioto rivers, they are stated to have been good" a full crop" "25 per cent. more" &c; "large, but not of the best quality." Still further south" about 10 per cent. more." Last of this last, " about 25 percent. more." In the southwestern corner " the oats were much injured in the early part of the season from the drought. yet the frequent rains during the whole month of June caused a decided improvement to take place and tolerably good harvests were anticipated." "later, the crop is considered to have been " an average one" while further east and north if is pronounced to have been "fist rate ;" 25 per cent. better." In the northwestern corner of the State, bordering on Michigan and nd diana, it is thought to have been "20 per cent. more ; further east of this, along the lake, it was about 25 per cent. better ;" while north and northeast of the central section it was also "25 per cent. more, as a touch larger quantity was sown he have estimated the whole crop of Ohio at in increase of 20 per cent over the crop of 1844. In I n diana, illinois, Missouri, and Michigan, which raise large quantities of otis, the cap, in its early prospects, was also promising ;and it was probably at least 20 per cent. mo re than in t envious year. In some sections of these States, the increase is estimated as high as " 33 or 50 percent." : " " .a; " .a. The prospect of the o at crop in Wisconsin is thus stated, under date ofRkcine, July 15: Oats bid fair to be an excellent crop, th e light rains and: warm weather having enable led them to recover trot: the lighting effects of cold and dry weather of May and the begiininning- of Jinethe crop of I own was also better than in the preceding year. For both     own and Wisconsin, we have estimated the advance at about 20 per cent. The crop is a favorite one, and the number of emigrants into these territories is large ; and, if any thing, our estimate may probably be too low. The whole o at crop for 1845, therefore, we fix at 163,208,000 bushels. The following crop of oats we find stated iii one of the papers, and it must be allowed to have been a heavy yield: : " Large yield of oats t is stated in the Machine Advocate, that Edward. Lake, of Machine county, raised on one acre and one-sixth of land, this season, one hundred bushels of oats n the New York Farmer, of October 16, 1845, we find an account of a species, of' wild oats i which appear to be considered as valuable 1 :r fodder. He give it as we find it in the above named journ a : " Mild oats ii have received from A pain Most, of Deep river, (donna package of the .grain f wild oats, and also a bundle of the heads of that grain. Captain Most states that he has about 10 acrescid127f this asiatic grain 58 oe. No. 140.and that from his youth up he has noticed that it was visited by the wild duck, black birds, and rice birds, but did not know the cause until his attention was called to it by a paragraph of mine in relation to wild rice, which he paw a few weeks ago in your jaer. He remarks that his neighbors were as much in the dark as himself Since he read the paragraph referred to, h has made a fur ll e animation, and finds that the straw of this aquaticgrain will yield about four tons per acre, and is as useful for cattle fodder as are corn blades. A short time ago I received from Captain Most some of the blossoms of these pats, and several plants, with the roots attached, which have heretofore noticed. The straw is near 10 times the size of that of wild rice, a specimen of which 1 have lately had from Vice lake, while the grain is only about half the size. I am of opinion that this grain will became a valuable aid to the farmer, and therefore it is that I call public attention to it. I shall exhibit some of this grain at the office of the Farmer and Mechanics. Hours, &c. E. Merri Ami n the Dark Lane Express, for September 15, page 15, we have the following account of remarkable oats: "it a late meeting of the Last Derbyshire Farmers Club, Mr. Vol brook, the secretary, exhibited some e specie mere of oats, the stems of Which were six feet six inches in height, and the diameter five-eighths of an inch. One plant produced 130 corns of oats, and another more than 3.00. The oats were nibbled in, the rows being fifteen inches apart, and the plants six inches asunder. The ground which produced these extraordinary specimens had been parched and burned The London Gardeners Chronicle contains the fellowing. In the choice of a variety of o at for cultivatioStrongly suspecting that the real value of different varieties of o at was unknown, and that eight by bushel was even less applicable to this grain than to wheat, I procured samples of nine sorts, carefully selected by Messrs.

Nearly the whole rye crop is raised in .a half dozen States. Of these, the State of Pennsylvania ranks foremost, and New' York next; then Newjersey, Kentucky, &c, In Pennsylvania, according to the census of 1840,a dozen counties in the eastern district raised One half of the whole crop in the State. The accounts received .respecting .the rye harvest in these heavy counties .is, in general, favorable. In Lancaster .and vicinity the rye is said to have " suffered somewhat from the late frosts in the spring, as it had done. the preceding year." The amount, however, is supposed to have been as large g as (perhaps somewhat larger .t ban) in f the previous year, and -f -a better quality. Similar are the reports from Chester, Bucks, andre high spun i is, and vicinityes. In . Adams and York there is thought to have been a large increase even as high as "50 per cent." The winter was favorable, as well as the dry weather in . March and April, and later during the filing season, .so that there was no mildew. I a the central set ion, east and northeast, there was also an increased crop of rye, In the northwestern part of the State- also, this crop is described as having been very good ; ' equal to ten per cent." advance. In the whole, therefore, we think the i rye crop in this State was probably fifteen per cent. better than in 1844. In New Work, also, ngarlyfivesixths of the whole crop is raised in the part of the State which lies east of the centre, and of this more than one half is not a great distance from either side of the Hudson and Lakecgiamplain. In all theseseeptions the report is favorable, varying, upon an average increase, "10, 15, 20, 30, and even as high as 40 per cent, In the other parts of the State, there seems to have been more sown, and in only (cid127one case do we observe any mention of failure or diminution. Taking the State census retrtiru of this crop, which reduces our estimate of: 1844, we have added a bruit .2 percent, supposing this to be a fair. rate, in- e i of al the information re have bee .able to gather r s petting theryePcrop for the whole. State in Pew England, so far a we have been able to ascertain, th.er has been a slight increase. As wheat has become more profitable and less subject to 160 destruction from insects, and rye is less used for dis tilling than formerly, it has very considerably fallen off for a few years past. In Paine, Newhampshire, and Vermont, the c roi probably increased about 5 per cent while in Massachusetts, in the se s where more than half the crop was raised, according to the census of 40, it has fallen off as estimated, from 5 to 25 per cent." In the western part of the State, the rye crop is said to have been "injured by a late frost in May, about the time it began to head, and the consequence was that it did not fill -well ; the heads grew full length, and a good share of them did not have half the number of kerseys they should have had, and probably the heads most forward received the injury." We are inclined to think, therefore, that, taking the whole State through, there was some falling off perhaps 5 to 10 per cent. A similar estimate appears to be demanded as to the remaining States of New England.  Of the rye crop in New Jersey which State raises a comparatively large amount of this product it is stated that in the central counties it was "a fair crop" and in the western ones it was " 15 per cent. better." These two sections of the State, as appears by the census of 1840, raised more than one half of the whole rye crop; and in view of the crops in the adjoining States, combined with such other information as we could obtain, we have fixed the advance of this crop in New Jersey at about 15 per cent. But a small crop is raised in Delaware, yet there was probably a slightSincreasein Maryland and Virginia, also, there seems to have been an advance. In the northwestern part of the litter State there is thought to have been -25 per cent. more ;" but this is too high for the whole. We suppose that if we take into view the influence of the season, &c, already averted to in the wheat crop, it Would not exceed 10 per cent. in either of these States. In the southern States, generally, there is comparatively little rye, and it is quite difficult to obtain any satisfactory information respecting this crop. Of  n North Carolina the crop fell off from "10 to 15 per cent." on account of the drought in the sections where at least one half the whole crop returned by the census of 1840 was raised. in many of the other portions of the State, also, the drought, as we learn; was severe in its operation on the crop. It is therefore believed that there has been a diminution of this crop of about 15 per cent. In South Carolina, in the counties which, according to the census, gave about one half of the crop, the decrease of the rye crop is variously estimated from " 10 to 30 per cent: " We have placed it for the whole State at from 15 to 20 per cent. less. It will be remembered that the early drought in this State was most severe in its effects. The same seems to have been the case in Georgia n Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas, we believe there may have been a slight advance. In Tennessee and Kentucky, an increased crop. In the latter State it is variously estimated at "an average ;" 10 per cent." 20 per cent. more. These sections, thus given according to o the census returns, include the part of the State where more than one hall of the whole crop for the State is raised. In the o their section, so far as we can judge from the inform nation respecting the influences operating on the progress of the crop, there w ai a similar diversity of opinion. In the whole, the increase may be estimated at about 10 per ce it. 4 c. No. 140. 161 Considerable diversity of opinion also exists respecting the rye crop of Ohio. In the central, eastern, and north of central sections, there seems to have been a falling off, varying from " 25 to 50 per cent." This quarter of the Ta e, according to the census, raises about one quarter of the whole crop. In the southwestern and northwestern sections, which include about another quarter, there seems to have been a gain of (a( 25 per cent. and upwards in :extensive distilled in one of the southwestern counties estimated the increase in that vicinity as high as 100 per cent. The causes of failure assigned are, that a less quantity of rye was sown, and the drought affected its growth. In examining the census in relation to the remaining contiguous sections to those above mentioned, we find the more northern and central counties gave the heavier crops; and in these, from such information as can be procured, we suppose the crop to have been somewhat deficient. We apprehend, therefore, that the crop in the whole State moist have been  less than in 1844 by about 5 per cent. Similar to the above is the diversity of opinion in regard to the rye crop in l diana. Some allowance must be made for the greater quantity of land cultivated, as well as the increasing population. Still, however, it is a small crop; and while in some sections the advance was " 25 per cent" in others it fell off "20 per cent. or more." In the whole, the increase was probably not over 5 per cent. The same was the case, it is believed, in I illinois and Missouri; thought le increase in some sections of the former State is estimated as high as 10 n Michigan, the gain on the previous crop is by some persons estimated, at "a. 25 per cent." We are inclined to think, however, that for the whole State it did not exceed 10 per centticid127) own and Wisconsin there was some advance in this c rope    be whole rye crop for the United States may, therefore, be estimated at 27, 1715,000 bushels. A fine sample of rye is mentioned in an agricultural paper, (probably the American Farmer) and is described in the extract following: " Eye: tall and shorter. Editor : All our farmers ought to know that the kind soil of Maryland is still capable of being easily improved, so as to yield abundantly the necessaryes of human life and pleasure. The large sample of rye now sent to you was sown about the 1st of September last, (say a half bushel to the acre) to test its capacity for branching in rich ground, which appears to be very great, as there are thousands of similar bunches in the i field whence that bunch was taken; and each bunch is the product of a single: seed, yielding thousands. The next smaller sample was sown thick, a out the 10th of October last, and was mowed off close to the ground on the 2 3d of last April, when it was all out in head, and three to four feet1highyielding a large crop of good hay. It then sprouted from the roots again; and that is the second growth, which has so far matured in about 60 days. It should have been sowed on the 1st of September, and the hay crop taken off by the middle of April; then the second would be perfect by the st of duly. The smallest sample was derived from a handful of rye sown, as thick as the grains could lie side by side, in the same field; and at the same time the second sample was sown. The result was, that theywrreoo thick o thrive; hence they yielded nothing worth saving. Theprouctsof our soil are improved as much in quality as in quantity, by good ground and good cultivation. Agriculture is the most important bus in the, '112 n 162 . ness in the world; and yet no business appears to be less understood or more neglected- Thomas' The above, from an old and experienced farmer near Ellicotts Hills, was accompanied by the three specimens of rye alluded to; and while the first is truly tall rye, (nearly 7 feet) and well filled, the smallest (24 feet) looks more like chess, or cheat, than anything we have seen, for many years, not to be that pest of the wheat field. The second specimen is about 5 feet The value of rye as a means of fodder for sheep, is stated in a letter contained in the Ohio Cultivator, as follows : Owing rye for wintering sheep. The following suggestion, though not new, may prove of value to many persons at the present time; and we thank the writer for calling it to mindEditorHAYESVI Lle, Rich land co, Ohio, June 27, 1845."MR. Bateham: From the present prospects in this part of the State, hay will be very scarce and dear next winter, and something, as a substitute, seems to be wanting among our farmers. The following plan for wintering sheep was suggested to me by an old practical farmer, and I think will commend itself to the reason of every one. He says he has tried it, and he has found that his sheep do better than by any other way. Whenploughing his corn for the last time, when it begins to tassel out, he sows the ground with about a half bushel of rye to the acre, which grows up about knee high by the time winter begins. Sheep will feed upon this rye all winter, and want no other care, except a good shed to run under in stormy weather. In the spring, if farmers prefer a crop of corn or oats upon the ground, they can have it. If they think the crop of rye will be profitable, all they have to do will be to let it grow. Hours, truly" J. H. Coxi n the Landwirthschaftliche Dorfzeitung, or Village Gazette, of July 26, 1845, published at Leipsic, we find mention of a species of rye called the gigantic Iberian rye, a translated description of which we sub join : " The gigantic stalked rye, known also by the name of the Iberian rye must be the most excellent of all the kinds of rye hitherto cultivated, on account of its wonderful and gigantic product of grain and stalk, as well as the weight and goodness of its kerseys. Six met zen, Russian measure about 18 quarts English) of this rye, are enough for sowing a morgen, (a little over five-eighths of an acre) from which, on a well fitted and prepared soil, in favorable weather, we may count on a harvest of 24 bushels. The single s talks of this rye reach from six to seven feet in height, and bear thirty to forty ears, which are from five to six inches long. [the Austrian and Russian inch and foot are both somewhat longer than the Englishthe grains themselves are much larger than the usual rye; a scheffel of it a little over a bushel and a half English) weighs from 90 to 92 pounds a pound is larger than the English pound) and in a draw hm is contained oily about 80 kernelsa proof of its goodness and weight. This rye, also, on account of its thin hull, gives an excellent flour. It must be sown at the end of August, or the beginning of September, that it may have time to acquire , sufficient strength before winter. Assuring it in the autumn with sheep has hitherto had no injurious effect, either on the crop of grain or straw." : -the account is in a letter signed On Cloth o, of Magdeburg. We have been unable to find any description of, or allusion to, this description of rye. 163 in Dawsons Agricultural Manual, Londons Encyclopedia, or Johnsonscyclopedia; from which we infer that it is probably unknown in England or this country, and may deserve further inquiry, and perhaps importation and trial. The Iberian oats are by some, in England, preferred to the Poland oats. Buckwheat. The buckwheat crop of the New England States seems to have been better than in some years. It is, however, but little noticed in the agricultural papers ; and hence it is not easy to form any very accurate estimate of its amount of production. We notice in particular only a few States, respecting which we have been able to ascertain with more precision. I new Hampshire in the western part of the State we are told that, " having had the benefit of rains, it has yielded a very good crop." In the south eastern section, though but little is grown, it is thought to have been " 5 percent. more" and " an average crop" in other parts of the State. The same was the case in Vermont. In Massachusetts in the north eastern section of the State it is judged to have fallen off ' 10 per cent." There is, however, very little cultivated. There was more in the central part of the State; and in the western it is variously estimated from "a. 20 to 25 per cent better." Of the latter section, it is stated: ' The buckwheat crop is peculiar to itself; its growth is quick, and it commences blossoming early in its growth; and upon the same stalk you may see the blossom and the grain fully ripe. A fall crop and cool weather are necessary in maturing. The present season was favorable." The crop for the whole State was probably about 10 or 15 per cent. more than in 1844. New York stands among the foremost of the States wherein this product is cultivated, and the crop appears to have been "somewhat better" in the northern; " not so good by 20 to 30 per cent." in the river counties generally; "about as good as usual" along the Mohawk; poorer" to the southward of this section; and further west, in the central portions, and tour 'pennsylvania, -t have fallen off " 15 to 25 and 30 per cent." In the southwestern corner of the State it is said to have been "a trifle better." Is the decrease took place in some of the counties which furnish the heaviest crops of buckwheat according to the late State census, the crop must have fallen off very considerably. The buckwheat crop there was estimated too small in the previous year. In the State of New Jersey, which raises a comparatively large crop of buckwheat, (in the western part of the State) this crop is said to have been 30 per cent. better" than in 1844. The Belvidere Apollo thus speaks of buckwheat in Warren county: " Our neighborhood was visited by a white frost yesterday morning. Fortunately, a considerable part of the unusually large buckwheat crop of our county is cut, and much that remains standing is so far advanced as to be out of danger of injury from the elements. Our mention of a large crop means, that an unusually large quantity of the grain was sown, and that the yield will be generally heavy- We shall give our low land friends substantial proof k presently, that 'and Scotia' is not the only 'land o' cakes' in the world." In the central section, comprising Burlington and Monmouth counties, it is, however, supposed that this crop fell off largely, and the der 164 crease has even been estimated as high as 'one half" Still, it is believed that there was a gain in the whole State of 15 or 20 per cent. Pennsylvania furnishes about one fourth of the whole buckwheat crop, and its appearance the past season seems to have been quite different in the various sections. In Lancaster, and in some of the south eastern counties, there was " some advance from "10 to 25 per cent." In the former county it is stated that ' the absence of frost to a period later than usual in autumn, must have had a favorable influence; which, taken in connection with the act that more of this grain was sown in consequence of the failure of wheat in places, warrants the conclusion that the crop may be fairly set down at 25 per cent. more than that of last year." In the eastern central section, lying along the Delaware and Schuylkill, it might have been " about 10 percent. better." In the north eastern part of the State the increase did not probably exceed " 5 per cent." It looked well in the early part of the season; but owing to the drought and early frost, there is not so good a crop. In the counties lying on the Susquehannahboth those bordering on Maryland, and those which occupy the central upper portion of the Statetherewas a decrease, it is thought, of from " 25 to 30 per cent." In the north eastern part of the State there was a gain of "10 to 15 per cent." In corn m paring the information respecting different parts of the State with the census statistics of this crop in r the same sections, we find that there was an evident gain, taking the whole State through, of 10 or 15 per cent. Maryland raises but little buckwheat, and therefore we have but little information respecting this: crop in that State, In the north eastern section it is estimated that there was a decided increase, and probably this was thecaserin the whole State. In the northwestern part of Virginia there also appears to have be eh some gain ion the crop of 1844. In North Carolina it: fell off. We have not, however, given our estimates in the table for this crop in these States. I n, Tennessee and Kentucky there was also a small advance. The accounts from the various sections of Ohio respecting the buckwheat, crop are all favorable. In the north central portions, on the Reserve, as much more was sown, the crop is thought to have been more than double that of the previous year. The range of district lying west and northwest from this latter, also, it is believed, had a better crop by " 25 per cent' In the northwest corner of the State, also, the increase is fixed at "one half more." In the southeast section from the central, the crop of buckwheat was also considered better by "one quarter to one third." In the eastern central part, bordering on the Ohio ,river and Pennsylvania, it is judged to have increased ' about 10 per cent" while in the southwest part of the State, from the centre, it was fully an average crop. In view of the census statistics for these different sections, in relation to the buckwheat crop, we believe that we shall not greatly err by estimating the increase to have been about 20 per cent above that of the 'crop of 1844. There is not a great deal of buckwheat raised either in I illinois, In diary, or Missouri; but there was probably an increased crop also in those Plates. In I illinois the advance in some sections is fixed as high as " onehalfMichigan exhibited a- better crop of buckwheat the past season than in the previous year. The editor of the Michigan Farmer rates the advance for    e 'state as high as (a( 50 per cent." This is high authority, but i we prefer t, ut it somewhat lower say "30 per cent" as in some- sections it has bc. No. 140. I615falln off as it is stated. I ni other sections it ranges from 10 to 50 per cent advance. The crop was a fair one in I own and Wisconsin. Taking the whole, the aggregate crop of buckwheat for the United States will be about10268000 bushels. Mai Of, Of I Ndi Of Corn. \his. as it is well known, is the largest of all the grain crops. I to importance is also fully appreciated, as there is no product which is common to all the States, that is so extensively cultivated. The varieties in the different sections are numerous, and continually increasing by improvement and the introduction of seed from abroad. As it is so generally cultivated, there is more frequent mention of its appearance and progress in the agricultural papers, and the public journals generally. A better judgment can thus be formed respecting it. The prospects of the corn crop in the summer in almost all parts of the country, especially along the Atlantictates, were most un promising, especially from the drought. The evil, however, did not prove to be so great as was feared in some sections, though in others the corn crop suffered most severely. New England, in proportion to her population, raises a large corn crop. In Paine the crop was about an average one. The Paine Farmer of July 11 speaking of its appearance, says: " A part of the corn crop looks very well, bearing a good color, but rather dwarf is in size. Such of it, on this route at least, is afflicted with the yellow fever, or some other yellow disease; o, else, as the boy said, the seed planted must have been the yellow, kind. Tall. events, it has the yellow hue upon it, which is not a very flattering omen of a fair harvest. We have had too many cold days, and still colder nights, for the successful growth of corn. Our most congenial seasons for this crop do not yield a great harvest; yet many farmers every year succeed in raising enough for their own use n New t hampshire, as early as August, we are told, in an agricultural paper, that this crop "looks promising." In the south eastern part of the State it is said that it was probably " 10 per cent. more" One informant adds, that " it is undoubtedly increasing in quantity; and next to wheat, it is considered the most desirable crop. 'he fodder from a good crop of corn is worth nearly as. much as a crop of <a name="potatoes6"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and it is a fact that wheat will grow better after corn than after any other crop." Further to the west it is thought to have been " 10 per cent. less." Higher up, on the Connecticut river, we are told, by a competent judge, that " I indian corn stood the drought remarkably well, and has given a very fair yield; except here and there, perhaps, upon knolls, and ridges, and high plains of a light dry soil." Estimating the crop according to the relative proportions given by the census statistics of this crop, we are inclined to believe that there was some increase perhaps from 5 to 10 per cent. The accounts from Vermont in all sections represent the crop to have been a fine one. The drought does not seem to have prevailed so greatly there as in some of the other New England States. The Burlingtonpress speaks of it as " uncommonly large and fine." The section of the State lying in the northeast corner, and along the Connecticut river south, also, we are informed, enjoyed a long warm season ; and hence the crop is thought to have been " 20 per cent. better." In Mind ham county it wars ai 16 fine crop; and it is stated: "luck is the secret cause that has given us a greater growth of I indian corn than has ever been known in this county. Even acres, presented to our own fair by seven different individuals residing in different towns in the county, gave an aggregate growth of 7 40 bushels, or about 106 bushels to the acre." The whole crop of the State, therefore, was probably as much as 20 per cent. more than in 1842. The drought severely affected the corn crop in the eastern part of Massachusetts; in the middle it was not so much felt, and still less at the western. In most of the towns in the northeast and central Atlantic counties it fell off from " 10 to. 25 per cent." In the interior, it is thought to have been' about 10 to 15 per cent. better." The Green field Gazette, in July, speaks thus of it: ' I indian corn looks middling well, but needs more warm weather and rain; the corn will be generally good." In the western part of the State, we learn from the Boston Cultivator that the prospect was poor. A correspondent says: In dial corn Any one acquainted with the season may well wonder that there is any growing. It has had many and severe obstacles to contend with; for, in addition to the cold, un promising May, it was thoroughly cut down by the frost on the 8th or 30th of that month. I t, however, started again; and though backward, it now gives, if the season hereafter is favorable, a tolerable prospect of a good crop." At a later date, however, since the harvest, an informant writes to us: "the I indian corn has not been better with us for many years. The season, after the 1st of June, was warm, dry, and uniform, which is natural to this crop. Some pieces on dry land were affected by the drought but, as a general remark, the season was admirably adapted to this crop. The report of the committee in Berkshire county on about 20 pieces was over 100 bushels to the acre. It is thought to have been in that section 25 per cent. more" than in 1844. We presume the average increase for the whole State was about 10 per cent. The crop of 1844, it will be recollected, was a good one. The corn crop of Rhode I s land is described in July as being very promising, and there seems to have been at least 15 or 20 per cent. more. Great fears were likewise entertained in Connecticut on account of the drought, and many pieces of corn suffered. Had not timely rains at last been enjoyed, the whole State would have experienced a great falling off in the crop. The injury, however, did not prove so serious as had been apprehended; and on the average, probably, we may allow an increased crop of about 10 per cent. over that of the preceding year. The prospect of the corn crop during the summer in New York was most discouraging. The apprehensions entertained were not, indeed, realized to their full extent, though there has been some decrease. A New York agricultural report, for the months of July and August, speaks thus of this important product: "for July, corn has had a miserable chance, and the only wonder is that it looks so well. It is now in tassel; and if we had had even a moderate supply of rains, the yield would have been very great. The ground is now so parched that the leaves begin to curl; and, unless we have speedy showers, the crop will suffer greatly n August: "his great staple never ran so narrow a chance of a total failure as this year. At the close of July, farmers had serious thoughts of cutting up their corn for fodder; the leaves were curled up; the silk appeared, but without any signs of the ear filling out. Fortunately, the rains. 167 came on just in time; the color is now changed, the ear is full, and the crop is saved; an early frost would not even jeopardy the prospects of the     former n the western part of the State, a Buffalo paper gives the following statements of the corn crop in that vicinity for June and Julythe corn crop, of which the most dubious forebodings have been indulged by some in this quarter, has as yet exhibited no feature to warrant the conclusions that have been arrived at. Farmers know that corn does not require hot weather before the 1st of July; and that to be killed down by frost when two or three inches high, is far from certain damage to the crop. Prior to July, cool, damp weather is favorable to corn. This forms the roots ; while July and August, if hot, complete the crop, and insure a rich harvest Again: " I indian corn his important crop may yet be a fair average. Such, however, depends upon this month, and the first two or three weeks in September. I i we have warm weather and frequent showers, sand the frost holds off till past the middle of September, we shall have a good crops n August, we have the following notice from the Data via: Timescorn is now going ahead rapidly, and there is every indication that it win turn out well n September, mention is made in one of the public journals of a whirlwind, which passed through the northern part of the county of Orleans leaving "a track of some 160 rods wide, and 17 or 20 miles in length The corn is stated to have suffered in some places very severely from its ravages, especially where it was stacked. The drought was severely felt in the eastern part of the State; and from the information received respecting the crop since it was ga the ed, we learn that there has been a decrease varying o from "10 to 15 or 20 per cent." In the upper part of the State, on the northeast, the crop varied from "5 to 10,per cent. less." Power down, about the centre of the river counties, the falling off of this product was from 20 to 25 per cent." The same was the case yet further towards Newyork, for the most part- In some counties, however, on account of the greater quantity sown, the crop was as good, if not better" than in 1844. In Long I s land, at the further part, the corn crop, it is judged, was 10 per cent. less in quantity" than in 1844, but of ' a very superior qualitySThe drought diminished the quantity to some extent, although a dry season is much better than a wet one for this important crop. The eight bowed white Button corn is generally considered the best by our farmers any of the ears raised this season, on one farm, are said to have been " 15 inches long." In the southeast corner of the State, and back from the river, west, the decrease is said to have been large in consequence of drought and by some the loss thus sustained is estimated as high as "50 per cents a general thing, however, we believe that it was not more than 20 or 25 per cent. less than the crop of 1844. From the southern border of the State, and northward west of Hudson river, and reaching onward to the Mohawk river, there was a gradual improvement. There was more sown in some parts of this section. and the crop is estimated to have increased along theiMohawk valley, and northerly, "10 or 20 per cent." Somewhat further west it fell off; and in the county of One ida the decrease is said to have been ' one-fourth." In the counties northwest of this last, towards the take, it was " considerably better." The crop in Onondaga county was 168 po c. No. 140."an average one" but the drought seriously affected .it in Kaluga, andoirtlladt auntie. -more to the: southwest, however it was" be tier. hCheiutig county it is said to have been " very fine ;" and, h claiming the adjoining counties of Tompkins and Rates, the average increase is stated at about: "1 per cent." -I n Seneca and Hayne counties, it is supposed to have been still: more. Further to the west and north, again, the drought seems to have been felt; while in the southwestern and western sections there was an increase estimated at from " 15 to, 20 per cent." The crop for the whole State has, on the whole, fallen off from that of 1844 (considering that given in the late census by the State as our basis of comparison) about 10 per cent. In New Jersey, although the drought prevailed, yet there was an average crop; and in some parts, especially in the central counties of Burlington and Monmouth, it is thought there was an increase of from "10 to 15 percent Pennsylvania raises a large quantity of corn; and, judging from the accounts received respecting it, though affected by the drought, it did riot suffer equally in all parts of the State. In Lancaster and the south eastern section generally, the amount gathered seems to have been "fully equal to that of the previous year. One informant says: " In the northern part of the county the seas oh throughout was dry, and the corn crop was light, which was, to sole extent, the case last year; but in the southern part of the county, where the rain was sufficient to nourish the plants, the crop was rather superior to that of the preceding year. The average crop for the county was about the same as last year." To of Chester county it is said :i The corn crop, though much retarded in many instances by the ravages of the but worm, affords a tolerable average, the fall being very favorable to theripening of the plant." In the counties of He high and Bucks, also, it is said to have been " very good; equal in some places, and even superior" '1 the crop of 1844 perhaps reaching as high in certain cases as "20 per cent More to the northeast, the drought somewhat -lessened the amount raised and it may have fallen short 5 to 10 per cent." In the section on theStisquehannrah, and on: the Maryland line, comprising Adams and Work counties, it is thought to have suffered a still larger decrease, and by so met is fixed as high as "50 per cent. less." This, however we believe to be too i much 1 - In the northwestern part of the State it was a better crop by 15 i per cent." In the whole, regard being had to the comparative products of the various sections as exhibited by the census of 1840, we believe that the crop for the whole State may be fixed at an increase of about 10 per cent. over that of 1844. The same was probably the case in regard to Delaware; which State, in proportion to its population, raises quite a large corn crop. In Maryland the following are some of the earlier notices respecting this, crop. In June, the Porch light says: "the prospect for corn is not so encouraging, the severe drought having injured it to a great extent." In July from the Eastern shore, the account from Centre ville is" Worn looks well throughout the county, and, unless some very injurious drawback occurs, an unusually fine crop may be anticipated." Again : " The belief is general, says the Frederick Examiner, that the corn crop will be a very short one. To great has been the alarm in regard to it, that we have heard of individuals purchasing their corn in advance of the market, and at a high price. But, thanks to are all wise Providence .for refreshing rains lately since which the prospect of the crop is brighter." The Baltimore n, n the same month, also states: "for    , as yet, is very promising. In iieAmerican Farmer a correspondent writing from arrow county, say : "9 The corn crop with us is good, considering the season. I shall take fourteen barrels to the acre, and perhaps more the effects of deep sloughing, living, and close planting." To in August, likewise: " The corn, generally, has suffered very much from the drought. The early; plntejin parts of this and many f the adjoining States, will be irrecoverable to a considerable extent ; the later planted may do better, if we have seasonable rains this month. We fear it will be a very light crop throughout all the middle and southern States." And, in another journal "anne Aruindelcounty, in this State, was visited by a tremendous tornado on Today the 3d instant. Fields of corn were literally destroyed, and stripped of every particle of fodder, and all other products of the soil suffered in like ma1netrSomewhat later we find it mentioned, that in some parts of the Time the corn crops are improving, and that there is reason to believe there will bean average crop." From other sources, also, we hear that the crop fell off ;and in the north eastern section, especially, it is thought to have done so at least "one third." It will be recollected that the crop of 1844 decreased from that of 1843. We believe, therefore, that a decrease of 20 per cent for the last crop, in comparison with that of 1844, t nay fairly be allowed. The sections of the State already referred to probably raise full half Of the whole crop, if not even more. The early accounts respecting the corn crop of Virginia were not unfavorable. In July, a Richmond paper states that "it will be good, judging from its healthy color." In Campbell and Bedford counties, however, it is stated in another journal, that " this crop is worse than any during the present century." In August we find great complaints of the drought. The following is from the Richmond Compile r: " 6 The corn crops in all eastern Virginia, except in the rich low lands In the tide water, will be a failure. The tassel of the corn were destroyed by the intense heat without rain, and furnished very little pollen; the consequence is, that the ears are, a large portion of them, without grains, while few are filled. Some fields took as if they would make a tolerable yield; but, upon taking off the shock from the ear, an exhibit of grains few and far between is made, which is distressing to the farmer." Again : rlThe inhabitants of counties within a circuit of one or two hundred miles are now sending to Richmond for meal. in me of the farms on the lower James river will scarcely yield half a crop of corn, even if they now have the advantage of copious showers" The Richmondwhig says that, while particular counties and neighborhoods will fall short of an adequate supply of corn, the aggregate crop in the State of Virginia, in conjunction with large supplies of the old crop which still remain on hand, especially below tide water, will not only be ample, for home consumption, but yield a large surplus for coast transportation. " West of the Blue Ridge, and east of the falls of the rivers" adds the Whig, "the corn crop is believed to be an average one. In many of the mid land counties it will fall short. The wonder is that so much should have been made in defiance of so unprecedented a drought. It speaks well for the improved methods of cultivation. Twenty years ago, such a drought would scarcely have allowed seed corn to be raised." The Clarksburg Republican states that, in northwestern Virginia the corn crop will be a very fine one, unless there should be early frosts in the fall." A correspondent of the Southern Cuiti170
vator for October says: "the corn crop is literally cut off." The editor of the Southern Planter for October, alluding to this crop, says : (a( Upon the subject of the corn crop we have such conflicting accounts that we hardly care to publish them. There is no doubt that the crop, take it all together, will be a short one ; but, unlike the tobacco, the corn does not go to a common market; and being, on account of the expense of transportation, confined to narrow limits, the price will vary in different neighborhoods. Theunexampled vegetative powers of the month of August worked wonders on the late corn ; and, in many places where the farmer had despaired, a tolerable crop has been made. We extract the following from a letter received from a large planter and most valued friend, in Mecklenburg: ' Behave experienced one of the most distressing droughts that I have ever known ; the few river mills which could grind refused to grind any thing but corn, and it was with great difficulty that the country could be furnished with corn meal for a distance of forty miles around us. The navigation of the Roanoke ceased, and up to the first instant we were actually threatened, with a famine; since that time we have had fine seasons, and our prospect for corn has brightened far beyond our most sanguine calculations" Later accounts which we have from other sources correspond with the foregoing. *thus, of the central counties of Bedford to Madison, east of the Blue Ridge, our informant says : 1 Of I indian corn, after minute inquiries in all parts of the district, I am satisfied that there will not be more than half the usual crop. The severe drought, commencing early in the spring and lasting until the first of August, blasted the crop almost entirely in many sections." In the southern central section, bordering on North Carolina, the decrease is estimated at " 50 per cent." In the counties lying east of the Blue Ridge, comprising the range on the James river from Campbell to Fluvanna, it is also thought to have fallen off " one half from the crop of 1844. In Myelia county and vicinity, it fell off from " 25 to 33- per cent." In the northwestern corner of the State, and also in the section lying along Kanawha river and its branches, it is believed to have decreased "225 per cent." Taking the whole State, it is thought that the average deficiency will equal 30 per cent. The following, relating to this crop in different sections, are taken, respectively, from correspondents in the Southern Planter for the month of October, and in the Collar Farmer. The suggestions in both are valuable About the 1st of August I returned from quite an extensive tour on horseback through the counties at the foot of the Blue Ridge, from Campbell to Range. I found that the corn was almost given up. It was really distressing to see the fields of hard working poor men, upon which they depended for bread, bearing a slender, sickly looking little stalk, with rio ear. Worn had already risen to                $3.50 and            $4 per barrel, but those who had old corn were holding on for higher prices. I saw many farmers who were eating their wheat, and refused to sell at any price, quite confident that they would not make bread from their corn crops. As I approached the lower country it continued to improve, at least as far as the neighborhood ofCharlottesyille, where I saw some of the finest corn I have ever seen growing. The corn in the neighborhood is pretty good, though greatly injured by the late unprecedented drought; but this that I speak of was decidedly the heaviest growth of any thing I have ever seen on land. It was the crop of our friend, Mr. W. Silver. He resides about six miles west of Charlottesville, and invited me to ride through his field with him to show me his. 171 corn. I will not attempt to describe what I saw: first, my account would be incredible; and, secondly, I could neither do justice to Mr. G. i or to his field. As I said, we rode through it, but it was more laborious than riding in a thicket of woods; for though we vent in the widest row we could find, it was difficult to keep the blades and stalk from dismounting me. He has of it, I guess, some fifty acres of immensely rich land, (creek low grounds and his calculations are, to make on some 20 to 25 on some 25 to 30, and on some from 30 to 40 barrels per acre. Now th's seems wild, but it does not seem so to those who have seen the corn growing. The rows are 5 feet apart, and the corn was literally sowed along in them. I allow that they average 4 inches. Very stalk has an ear or shoot on it, and the tassel was beyond the reach of my cane, and I on horseback ; and the stalk has a beautiful color from the root. -or. G. seemed to think he would make 3 barrels on a considerable portion of his field. I cannot risk an opinion but if every stalk brings a numb in, and 1,0f0 of them are allowed to the barrel, (500 ears is considered the number) I calculate, from a table in the farmers Register, vol. 2, p. 592, showing the number of s talks per acre at given distances, that there will be near 30 barrels observed that on some of the best lands on James river the corn is tolerably good ; that is to say, will yield about one third as much as the crop on the Kanawha. I perceive that they plant their corn on James river 54 to 6 feet apart and cultivate it with ploughs. This is a sad error. It should be planted 3 feet each way, harrowed as soon as up; then a single furrow run on each side of the row, throwing the earth from the corn then another furrow on each side, throwing the earth back again; and then the cultivate or passed once through each row whenever grass begins to appear, or whenever the earth begins to bake or become compact. They say their soil is of such a nature that this culture will not do; that it is stiff, and t must be worked with the counter and plough. My answer is, that they have not complied with the requisite- 6 conditions. They must plough deepidounilefurrow plough, or use the sub soil plough after a deep furrow of the common plough; and they must make the soil more friable by means of c lover, manure, and lime. 1 know of no soil in Kentucky that' requires the counter in cultivation, or that may not be tended with the cultivate or alone, except when the rains are long continued. To soil can be in good condition that will not admit the cultivate or. I fix upon 3. feet for the rows, because that is the distance which a good cultivate or will sweep clean. It is of the utmost importance that a single passage through each interval should suffice; this enables the farmer always to keep the grass under command, and the soil loose. The great secret in cultivating the soil, as in war, is prompt and rapid movement at the proper time; and prompt ness, decision, and energy, and an eye that takes in the whole field of operation, are hardly less essential to the farmer than to the general. Hence I he extreme scarcity of good farmers. Another advantage in planting it three feet is, that the corn will more readily keep out the grass. Fromsito 4 s talks may be left in each hill, according to the soil and the views of the farmer. I much prefer, after much experience and observation, close planting; and I should leave at least 2 s talks in each hill in the James riverlandsThe corn crop of North Carolina also suffered t most severely from the drought, as well as the early frost. Thus, in one of the public journal in June, we find it stated that " in Laden county, N. 0., the frost of the 1st of172oc. No. 140.this month was severe enough to kill corn which was nearly three, feet high, ne planter had ploughed up a 30 acre field of corn of that description, with the design of re planting it. It is swamp land in a low situation." In some sections it is said to have been literally cut off; in some sections, however, it proved better than its early promise. Thus, the Raleigh Register says : " The streams all over the country are drying up, and in some parts persons go forty to fifty miles to have their corn ground into meal. In this city many of the wells have given out; a circumstance rarely if ever before occurring. And yet we are astonished to see how well vegetation looks, particularly the corn crop: A letter from Halifax, N. C., expresses the opinion that as much corn will be made this year as last, in that region. Again : "A letter from Hampton ville, Hurry county, N. C., speaks of the corn crop, which was then being gathered, as short of an average; it was selling at 40 e ends a bushel from the heap in the field. Heavy biting frosts wet felt about that time, and the week before they had floods of rain, which was greatly needed, particularly in the counties lower down, to enable their mills to grind. The past summer, in that district, was pronounced ' the dry est of the dry, by the oldest inhabitant The crops in this section of the State, as we have before stated, are very fine. In Hyde county, it is thought more corn will be gathered this yearthari in any one year heretofore. It is estimated that Hyde will export of on. alone 150,000 barrels, or 750,000 bushels; which, at 40 cents a bushel, amounts to the handsome sum of                    $300,000. Pretty well for one small county of only 6,500 inhabitants- Washington (N. U.) Whig. Hyde county, lying north of Calico sound, and with more marshy soil, it is probable, did not feel the drought as severely as in others more dry in soil, and hence less able to resist the heat, extreme as it was. The accounts received from the interior portion of the State very generally represent the crops as having suffered greatly, and as having been largely cut off. The range of counties from She to A swell, in the north and west parts of the State, it is said, did not yield more than "one third of a crop- To of the western central section, near the Catawba and Yadkinrivers; i fell off " from one half to two thirds" from that of 1844. It appears, therefore, from the best information that ve can obtain, that there was a very considerable decrease of -the corn throughout the whole State ; and we feel authorized to fix the estimate, as we have done, at about one third less than the crop of 1844. As we have already seen, in our remarks under "the Reason" the drought was greatly felt in South Carolina; and from the various notices we find respecting it, we believe the corn crop in this State to have felt its effects most severely. 'the following accounts will enable us to observe the progress of the corn crop in some sections of this Statefrom the Charleston Mercury: Darlington C. H, South Carolina, June30we are in the midst of a remarkably dry season the dry est that has occurred since 1819; and serious apprehensions are entertained for the corn crop, which has now reached the critical stage of shooting, and will soon, without rain, be beyond remedy Extract of a letter to the editor of the Charleston Mercury, dated 'a" Marion C. -1, July 1, 1845.-We have been almost parched up for want of rain, and the crops, with few exceptions, look badly ; the thermometer ranging daily, during the last week, at from 90 c to 100. The corn crops, especially. N. N. 140. 173 ly, will be very short, both here and on the west side of the Geese. Someofthebeist farmers do 'hot expect to make over half a crop. Again: " In this section the prospects of the agriculturists are bad- very bad indeed; the corn crop cannot now, under the most favorable cirCuinstahes, be much i more than half an average one.

The Charleston Patriot of August 1st states : "I n Rich land, Lexington, Orangeburg, Barn well, and other middle districts in the State, the corn crops in many places are irremediably ruined literally burnt up along the face of the earth The views given above are confirmed by the accounts we have since received from other sources. Thus, in the northeast section of the State, it is the tight the injury sustained from the drought was. at least s 15 percent." West of this last, along on the Wanted river and its two great branches, both the drought and the army worm are complained of, and the crop is estimated to have fallen off "38 per cent." In the northwestern corner of the State, the same complaint is made; the deficiency is believed to have been a one half" while in Spartansburg, and the counties east, it is stated to have been probably not less than "75 per cent, less" than the crop of 1844, it being " an almost entire failure, except on bottom lands; thousands of acres of land not prod using the bushel to the acre of the up lady n the west central part of the State, also, comprising the counties lying between the Conigaree and Savannah rivers, the falling off is estimated at album/ one third" It is evident, therefore, that the decrease in this State has been great. In forming our general estimate for the State, however, some regard must be had to the fact that the crop of corn for -1844 was a deficient one. The average decrease for the whole State can scarcely have been less than 35 to 40 per cent; perhaps even more. The lower counties being more moist, probably s u ft red less than the upper he give the following notices, which we have gathered from the public journals, indicative of the progress of the corn crop in Georgia, in Built : "sumter county, Georgia, July 4.--Our section .of the county has been injury ed severely by the drought.

A writer in the Bacon Messenger says: : There has been much alarmircenhtly rat the prospect of a very short crop; and, consequently, coin has risen to a very extravagant price. It had sold here from                                                         $1 to                                                         $1.25 a bushel. The price of :corn in Savannah is 55 cents a bushes and some has already been received from there and laid down here at 65 cents. There is abundance of corn in New Orleans at 32 cents per bushel, and will be furnished here in a short time at 50 cents; on the upper line of Georgia it is selling at 62 cents." He remarks that, with regard to the present crop, the prospects are now far better than they have been, and that all the late corn is doing well from the recent rains, and that there is no danger but that plenty will be made in the State to supply the wants of the people, though the early part of the crop has been considered as injured in some small sections; yet, through two thirds or three fourths of the State, it is an average one, and in many sections it was never better. Of this he is satisfied, from personal observation for nearly 200 miles, and from authentic information from numerous individuals, both travellers and planters n August, in the northwest corner of the State, the Lafayette Herald says: " While accounts reach us, from every quarter, of the protracted drought, we are still blessed with abundant showers, and crops of corn are very promising.

Thus the Griffinga) Jeffersonian, of the 14th instant, has the following: "of here is no mistake now about the drought and short crops. From all quarters of lower and middle Georgia the report is the same, that the drought is excessive, and not more than half crops of corn can be made The corn crop, also, in proportion to the demand for consumption, is the shortest that has been made within the last twenty years4aconMessenger. 'a. .a. Again, in a public journal: One of the most intelligent and b serving planters in Georgia has lately made a circuit of some three hundred miles, a portion f it through the er heart of the State, and gives it as his opinion that the corn crop will fall short one had of o what it was last year, if not more. This, we believe, will be the result throughout Georgia; and the greatest economy and liberality must be exercised to prevent rich suffering, or evils of greater magnitude." " The corn crop of Georgia is represented to us by some of the Georgia papers as deplorable bad. The water courses were all low, and the mills would have to stop at once, without the blessing of rain." -war accounts since the harvest refer principally to the northwestern andcentralisectionswest of the Ocmulgee river. In the former, it is stated : "I indian corn is our principal crop, and this has been cut short at least one third, from unusual drought during the summer' In the latter, it is also thought to have been "not half an :average crop." From the accounts thus given, we think we do not greatly err in fixing the decrease at about the same as in South Carolina, It is probable that in Florida it was very similar. In Built it is stated worn, however, his suffered greatly from the drought; and, the season being so far advanced, a full crop is not looked for or expectedTallahassee Ftoridian. The following statements are taken from the American Farmer of October last. They confirm the views we have given respecting the corn crops of South Carolina and Georgia.

These wagons a resent fr b ri 150 to 200 miles for corn !a! Great numbers of poor people are leaving the State and going to Tennessee. A hundred and fifty persons, consisting entirely of poor families, passed through this place last week The e Georgia Constitutional ist says that the want of water to turn the mills is another great evil, and, in some instances, they have had to send 50 miles to get meal." The editor of the South Carolina Temperance Advocate says "a, he has traversed different sections of Lexington, Newberry, Aureus, Green ville, Dickens, Anderson, Spartanburg, and Union districts and the result is, our firm conviction, founded on close personal observation fortified, too, by the opinions of judicious men that the crop of corn will prove well nigh a total failure The drought does not seem to have injured the corn crop as much in Alabama as in others of the adjoining States, though it was doubtless some whit lessened. In May the appearance of the crop was promising. Thegazette of the 14th instant, published at Cahawba, says: "the prospect now is very flattering for good crops. Some of our farmers tell us that they have never seen corn thrive better. A great many of the planters in this section have planted more corn than usual, and, of course, a less quantity of cotton." Again, in June, it is stated in a public journal: " Thedrodught, which has threatened some sections of this State, has been happily terminated; the late showers have dissipated all fears as to the result. The gardens have been severely injured, but the corn crop will be abundant o, truly, o the Montgomery Journal states that "the corn crop is looking well." In August, however, from Montgomery it is stated that the corn crop will be very short in that section, in consequence of the long drought. In the south eastern section of the State, from a very intelligent informant and a good judge on such subjects, the corn crop is estimated to have been about equal" to that of the preceding year. In the central part of the State, bordering on the Alabalna river on either side, it is said to have been one third less" as it was materially injured by, the drought. In the north eastern the falling off is represented not to have been so great; perhaps" about 15 per cent." In the whole, for the State, we suppose it may have been about 25 per cent. less than the crop of 1844. In Mississippi, from what we learn respecting its progress, and the state of the crop when gathered, it also fell off; though not so largely as in Alabama. Thus it is stated in July :extract from (a letter, dated Yalobushacotunty Missjuly 13, 1845: " From every appearance at present, the corn crop in this section will fall far short of a good one. There has been but very little rain this season and that little has fallen only partially, so that a large portion of the country still remains very dry and the corn very, much shrivelled' mississippi an, July 23. Again: The Are ole (wanton, Miss) says: "a. Shower S have been frequent. The crops look as well as could be expected, but neither the corn nor cotton crop will be a large one. Shed editor of the Southwestern Farmer, also, in the same month says: We have seen @f the growing crop in all probability more acres than any other man i in Misississippi, We have made particular inquiries, and also examined for our self, and we have made up our mind that the corn crop is. 177 more depend ant on seasons than usual. Although it generally bears a good color and is clean, yet it is more irregular in height than ve have everseenFrom other sources we also learn, that in the north eastern section of the State, and west of the Tombigbee river, owing to the drought, the crop is" 20 to 25 per cent. less" than in 1844. In the southwestern portion, however, west of Earl river and south of the Razor river, it is thought to have been an increased crop perhaps "15 per cent. more" than in the previous year. In the whole, we believe that the crop has fallen off in the State from 10 to 15 per cent. It is, however, a comparatively small crop i in this State. The early appearance of the corn crop of Louisiana appears to have been quite promising. Thus, in May. The Alexandria Red River Republican of the 12th inst, says: "he have heard that two or three of our planters have determined to try a corn crop this season, planting very little cotton. We think this step a good one. The crops will mature much earlier than those of the west, and will, of course, be the first in the market, with the chance of a reasonable price. The yield here to an acre is equal to that of any other portion of the country" The early corn is unusually fine; much of it is already in tassel. The late planting has been much injured by heavy rains Planter' Manner. May 24. Again, in Julyattakapas crops The Planters' Manner of the 12th inst. says : " The greater part of the corn crop is fast ripe king. Within the last few weeks we have had an unusual quantity of rain for the season, which will occasion the loss of much fodder The Concordia (a) I intelligence r states that "the crops in that neighborhood have been injured by the unfavorable weather n the north eastern part of the State, bordering on Mississippi, and reaching back to the river, we are informed that the corn crop was "20 per cent heavier" on the alluvial lands, but lighter " on the uplands ;" supposed to be an average of " 15 per cent." Taking the whole State through, we believe that it will average 10 per cent. more than in 1844. In Arkansas some complaint is made of the drought; but, on the whole, there seems to have been a good crop perhaps ten per cent. more than in the previous year. More new land is brought under cultivation from time to time, which no doubt exerts some influence. In a public journal it is said: , The corn crop in the Red river and northern counties has been greatly injured by the drought.  The editor of the Northern Standard mentions that the neighborhood ofClarksville is the only section of the Red river counties where there will be much corn for sale. He states, also, that L the corn in the Choetaw natiotais burnt up Again, in June: " In Arkansas, every prospect of an abundant crop seems to be realized. As early as the 24th ulm. the corn in some parts of the State was said to be 'waist high The crop in Tennessee which State, according to the census, stands foremost among the corn growing States was fine. The papers of that State, in June, speak of the crop as "larger than for many years; extremely promising bids fair to be an abundant yield" &c. From ,accounts re 1. 2 .a- .178 received since the harvest, also, it is estimated at 10 to 20 per cent. more. The average crop, probably, would equal if it did not exceed 15 per cent. In Kentucky, also, the accounts are equally favorable. In the section of the State which lies west of the centre, the crop is stated to have been " 20 per cent. more." In the south, also, more. In the central to the northeast" very fine 20 per cent. more." Still further to the northeast, and east of this last, about the same advance; and in the southeast, " remarkably good 20 per cent. more." Taking the whole State, and making due allowance for over estimates, we believe we may safely put the increase of the crop over that of 1844, at 15 per cent. It may, perhaps, over go this, but we deem it most likely to be correct to add only 15 per cent. Ohio produces a large crop of corn, and is among the foremost in the amount furnished by the western States. We notice in one of the public journals a statement which shows the advance of the season in one part of the State, though we know not precisely to which section it refers. I tis as follows: " We finished planting corn on the 26th April; this is a week or ten days earlier than usual in this part of Ohio." In the month of June, the Cleveland Herald thus notices a check given to the growth of this crop in that neighborhood : "the frost last week cut the corn in the lake counties so closely that only a part will sprout again, and the soil is so exceedingly dry and parched that farmers are at a loss whether or not tore plant- Cleveland Herald. In the Ohio Cultivator it is stated, by the editor: " Worn is now advancing with great rapidity. We have just returned from a tour through much of the best corn region, and have no doubt that the crop will prove at least an average one." A letter from Butler county, addressed to one of the public journals, also says: "notwithstanding the drought, the corn promises to be a fair crop." Again, in July: " The State Journal of the 5th instant reports the crops at the north and on the lake shore, where the drought has been most severe, as fast reviving, and likely to turn out more than an average yield; at least larger and better than last year" The Ohio Statesman of August 6, published at Columbus, contains the following mention of the appearance of this crop: "the editor has just returned from a short excursion into the country; and he was pained to see many cornfields that had been. r such injured by the g rub worm and other causes. There are, however, some fields that look well." In the same public journal, but of an earlier date, we believe, is given the statements respecting this crop in quite a number of counties, as they were furnished by persons who were acting as rumors at the session i of a court in the place of its publication. We quote them exactly as we have found them in the above named journalLorain county drop very poor; mostly cut off by frost. S Vermont county First rate take and &are counties Prospect for corn good. Shighland county Very goodRichland. countyTolerableii. scarawyas boy yPriomises welliMeigs comntyLooks Well; bids fair to yield an average crop. Fpairjeld oountyLooks well.

Waerreo Butler, and Treble counties Similar to Hamilton. a. 179" Green county worn good correspondent of the American Agriculturists, under date of September 20, writes: ' The fields on the Reserve, which, in the earlier part of the season, were exceedingly parched by drought, were looking somewhat better, and much of the corn was full feared and thrifty, but so backward that an early frost would nip most of it before sufficiently ripe to withstand its effects. To severe and long continued a drought has probably never before been experienced, or at any rate exceeded, in this or any other State." Thefollowirg statement speaks of Aurora county. We apprehend that the township of Aurora must he meant. It shows the effect of the drought, however. The Cleveland Herald says: Some of the dairy men of Auroracounty have been into the southern portion of Ohio and contracted for some hundreds of acres of standing corn and s talks, on which to winter their cows. A gentleman from near Columbus also came into Aurora, and contracted to keep 500 cows through the winter at the rate of one dollar per month. Another gentleman was allowed to go into the yard of an extensive dairy man and select cows at five dollars per head. Two year old steers are selling at three to five dollars per head The accounts we have received since the crop was gathered are, on the whole, however, encouraging. In the central section, including the important counties of Delaware, Marion, and Rich land, the increase of this crop is variously estimated at from " 20 to 25 and 30 per cent." North of these, and towards the northeast, it is estimated, on account of much more having been planted, as high as " 40 per cent. better" than 1844. I nStarke and Hayne counties it was " an average crop." Eastward, and bordering on the Ohio river and Pennsylvania, in club ing Jefferson, Carrolland Columbia na counties, it was a "fair average crop; equal to that of the previous year." South -of the centre, on the Scioto river, a about 25 per cent. better" as there was a "short crop there the year before." In the counties of Merry, Organ, and Washington, it was " nearly one third better ;" 'the drought and late frosts seriously affected the corn crop in the early part of the season, but the latter part was more favorable." In the northwest corner of the State, bordering on Michigan and In diana, it was' far better." Further to the east, however, and along the lake, there seems to have been a small decrease of perhaps " 10 per cent." In the southwest part of the State, the crop is variously estimated to have increased from 20 to 30 per cent." The American Agriculturists for November contains a communication in which the following remarks are made respecting the corn crop in southwest Ohio. The writer is an experienced judge of agricultural subjects: "' The corn raised here is universally the you rd seed, which, from long experience, is found to be the best producer, wherever warmth of climate and depth of soil are sufficient to develop e and mature it. The yield, under ordinary cultivation, without manure, varies from forty to sixty bushels per acre; but, with manure and good attention, it will sometimes average one hundred. It is usually planted about four feet apart each way, with three or four s talks left in a hill. Some plant nearer, and leave fewer s talks together. It appears much thinner in the field than a luxuriant growth of northern corn. That planted on the uplands, on a lighter soil, is still more scattered, and from its great height appears .thin and swindling, I doubt if many of the fields which met my eye out of theMiami and Scioto valleys would exceed twenty five bushels per acre. This can hardly be profitable farming in a country where corn sells at from 180 fifteen to twenty-five cents per bushel, unless so far as it contributes to make cut a rotation, and the s talks can serve a valuable purpose for fodderSTaking the whole State into account, and comparing views with the various ;amounts in the different counties as given by the census for 1840, we find that, in the counties furnishing the heaviest crops of corn, there has been reported an increase during the past year; so that the rep has been a general advance, it is believed, of at least 20 per cent. on the whole crop intestate. We are almost inclined to put it at 25 per cent, but prefer to be within bounds. The results of the corn crop in In diana appear to be equally favorable. In the northern central section, above the Wabash river, and in the northwestern part of the State, it is believed that there has been " 25 per cent more." In the central part of the State more land was sown, and more industry applied, so that the increase is supposed to be "30 per cent." South from this last, also, there was an advance of" 20 per cent" while an equal increase must be allowed for the south eastern section. Our informant here adds: "owing to the drought in the early part of the season enabling us to get the fields well cleared of weeds, and therinssetting in at least in time to make the crop, in some portions of the State the gain on the crop of 1844 is rated as high as 50 per cent, or more. It will be recollected that the crop of that year fell off very considerably in this State; and ind view of this fact, it may not be too high to estimate the average advance for the whole State, over the year 1844, at 25 per cent. The early accounts of this crop in I illinois, and indeed its general progress, are most encouraging. A public journal published at Quincy, in thisoState, under date of May 7th, says: " The corn in this section is mostly planted ; and, in some parts of the country, it is in so forward a state that the farmers were engaged last week in sloughing it. The showers of the two weeks past have had a most beneficial effect upon vegetation of all kinds." June 23.--We find the following statement in the Prairie Farmer, an agricultural journal of high repute at Chicago. The section embraced in this account comprises eight or nine counties. "the corn, it does one good to look at. For the last eighty miles much of the corn is from four to live feet high; and, had the weather been such that it could have been ploughed, it would now be mostly laid by. As it is, some e must yet be ploughed to its injury, as the roots will be cut very considerably. The difference in the appearance of the corn from Looked and Up age to Sang anon county, is truly wonderful. Without personal observation, one would hardly believe it." In one section, complaint is made of much damage having been suffered from the depredations of birds. Thus, the Ottowai I 1.) Free Trader says: " The farmers in this vicinity are much troubled with the black birds, who visit the cornfields in such numbers as completely to cover whole acres, and destroy every hill of corn within their reach. Several farmers have re planted once or twice, and many at this time are going over their fields and repairing the damages of this troublesome little visiter." -a. A month later, the Alton Telegraph, speaking of the crop, says: The corn never looked better, and the weather is very favorable  n. August, also, the condition of the corn crop is represented as being unusually good. We sub join some of the notices respecting it, which we have gathered from different papers : "A gentleman, who is thoroughly acquainted with I illinois, and has recently. 181 passed through the State, says that the crops of corn throughout are very good. Some of the corn is 18 feet high, I illinois had never before so valuable crops Again : The Alton Telegraph says' We were told, a few days since, by, a gentleman fully competent to form a correct opinion upon the subject, that the quantity of standing corn which may be seen from Round farm, in Jersey county, under twenty miles from this place, cannot amount to less than 500,000 bushels. For is this all, or the best. From Mr. A. B, David sons residence, on the bluff, on the road from Alton f to Edwards ville, and about seven miles from this city, there may be seen without moving from the same spot, by looking only in two directions, fields of standing corn, the probable yield of which is estimated at 1,500,000 bushels The estimates made since the crop was gathered are similar. In the section of the State ranging along the west side of the I illinois to the i Mississippi river, being the central tier of counties, it is judged to have been " 50 per cent. more." In the central west, "one third better" than in the preceding year. In other portions of the State, from "25 to 30 per cent. advance' This crop fell off largely the previous year. There has been a large quantity of public land sold here within the last eighteen months and, on all accounts, we think we shall not over go, if we fix the advance at 30 per cent. over the crop of that year. From what we can. gather of the corn crop of Missouri, we believe that it has been very good. Some mention is made, indeed, in. the It. Louisnew Era of May 21, of a severe frost a few days before, which dipped the corn in many places; but, as we advance towards the harvest, we find that the accounts are encouraging. Thus the Fulton Telegraph, in July, says: " The corn crop is unusually promising' The It. Louis Republican, also, during the same month, states that " the corn crop never looked better or more promising." A letter, also, in the New York Farmer, dated Gallatin, July 6, says: " c The corn presents a splendid appearance" "6 never more promising." To the Expositor, published at I independence, in September, says: " The crops of corn with us this year are most encouraging, and of the utmost abundance." We believe, therefore, in the absence of other sources of information, that the crop of corn in Missouri has been much superior to that of the preceding year probably 25 to 30 per cent better. The editor of the Michigan Farmer estimates the corn crop for that State at : 10 per cent. better" than in the year before. Such is, also, the view taken of the cent al eastern section, from A comb to Our on county. It is said to have "I suffered by the drought, but still exceeded the crop of the previous year." In the southwest, and along Take Michigan, from thesouthito the centre, west, it is stated to have been "' 50 per cent. better The extreme wet weather of 1844 is said to have injured the corn crop of that year, and this cause has not been felt during the past season. In the south eastern part of the State it is said that there is probably "three times as much raised as in 1844. We believe, however, that, :taking the whole State through, we may fix the advance at about " 15 to 20 per cent. In Wisconsin, also, and I own, there appears to have been a large corn crop. -l The Machine Advertise r, in July, says: " Worn, likewise, bids fair to be an average crop; the slight rains and warm weather for a week or two past having enabled it to recover from the lighting effects of the cold and dry weather; of May and the beginning of June." The following statement respecting a fine crop in this Territory appeared in a public journal 182 i In Columbus, Sort age county, Wisconsin, S. W. It. John raised 192,lushels of Button (1 crowed) corn to the acre. Some of the ears were over 13 inches long, and weighed 15 ounces." A writer in the Chillicotheadvertiser, speaking of northern I own, says: It is fair to say that the cultivates of the soil in northern I own can raise corn that will average 50 bushels per acre ;a' and it is certain that the corn crop here is a sure one Compared with the crop of 1844, it is believed that there has been a large increase, as the season was favorable, and the increase of farming population has been very great. From our preceding investigations it will be seen, that, while in some of the middle and southern States the corn crop has fallen off, yet, in the north eastern, southwestern, western, and northwestern sections of the country, there has been an advance, and the whole aggregate crop of corn for the United States amounts to nearly 417,900,000 bushels; which is about 2 per cent. less, compared with the previous year. We add here, also, several notices, which we have collected, relating to some large yields of corn in different States. More may be found in the appendix No. 3, where is given also a variety of interesting extracts from agricultural papers, &c relating to modes of cultivation, &c. "the Chemung County (new Yorkagricultural Society recently held its annual fair, the proceedings of which were very interesting. From the report of the grain committee, we learn that 5 specimens of corn were exhibited, all of good quality, averaging from 107 k to 123' bushels per acte; of which, Am. Hoffman, of Elmira, raised 123 bushels per acre; Josiah Down send, of South port, raised 121 1 bushels per acre; Mile Wynkoop, of Chemnung, raised 113- bushels per acre; Samuel Never ich, of South port, raised 107 1 bushels per acre John L. Smith raised 119- bushels per acre." "in ear of corn, measuring sixteen i inches long and seven inches in circumference, has been presented to the editor of the New Orleans Picayune. It was grown atTiapa, in the southwest corner of the State of Tobacco, in Mexicogiant corn -or. William Crisp in, of Marlborough farm, Great Timber creek New Jersey, yesterday brought to this office some s talks of corn more than six inches in circumference, and 13 feet 9 inches in height. The reader may well manifest surprise, but the statement is nevertheless strictly true. Such immense s talks we never saw before. They excited no little attention, and were exarriined during the day by hundreds. Mr. Crisp in informs us that the only manure used was about 80 bushels of stone lime to the acre. He thinks that if the crop had been intentionally arranged for a long crop' and planted at certain distances, the produce would have been over 300 bushels to the acre. Surely, the worthy farmer alluded to deserves the premium for corn. We may confidently challenge the production i of anything superior Philadelphia paper. A new variety of corn is mentioned thins in the American Agriculturistaperuvian cornEdwin Bartlett, esq, of this city, has kindly given us five barrels of Peruvian corn, recently sent him from t that country. It has, the largest sized grains of any we ever saw before, and is quite a curiosity. There are two kinds-one called by the Peruvians main bl an co, (white corn) This is the Chancay corn, ised for fattening pigs. I tis a coarse, inferior article, but grows very rank and strong. The other kind, maizmarillo (yellow corn) from Huacho, is large and fine, and is said to make the :sweetest kind of, bread. Mr. Bartlett inform s us it is a great yielder. Any one wishing a quart or two of this corn for experiment e an have the. a. 183 same gr a tis by calling at our warehouse, No. 187, Later street. We are of opinion it will do best south of the Potomac, as it is a southern corn Large yield of corn The High land (north Carolina) Messenger says: "he are informed by Mr. Alexander Porter, the manager of the farm of Thomas T. At ton, esq, that an acre of corn was planted on the farm the last season; with which it was designed to contend for the prize offered by the Buincombe county Agricultural Society, and that a few days since the corn was gathered and measured, and the yield was: 1 131 bushels! His farm is on Swannano river. Were, farmers, is an evidence of what can be done. Had the season been good, Mr. Porter has no doubt that the yield would have been 150 bushels The following statements respecting steeps for corn refer, respectively, the first to experiments made in North Carolina, and the last to others made in New Jersey: "in excellent mixture for cor time, plaster, ashes, salt equal quantities, well mixed. Prepare the ground well for planting put a handful in each hill drop the corn on the top of it, and then cover it with earth. It is good against the g rub, preserves moisture, affords nourishment to the plant, attracts carbonic acid gas, and stimulates the soil" Keeping corn, and com post observe that some of the farmers in this delightful section of country are trying many of the improvements of the age. A. Mr. Web be says he has tried sleeping his corn and other grain in a solution of ammonia, and found much benefit from it. Last year, that grown from corn thus stepped was in harvest much sooner, and had larger ears than that planted dry in the same field. He also made a com post or mixture of one bushel salt, one bushel lime, one bushel plaster, and one bushel ashes, and put half a will in each hill at the time of planting. His produced nearly one third more corn than that alongside, planted dry, without any of the mixture. Otherwise, the land was manured alike The practice of smoking seed corn has also been warmly recommended as a preventive against the depredations of birds, mice, &c. In a number of the Prairie Farmer, we find the following recipe given for this purpose: " Leave a few: husks on the seed ears, so that they can be hung up in the smoke house and smoked with the hams; or bane" them up in any dry place ; and before planting dip the end of a stick in tar, set fire to it, and, holding it under the ears, give them a thorough smoking. I have tried this for three years, and have saved many times my subscription to the paper by itSLarge yield of corn Lawton Turner, of Portsmouth, R. I., gathered, the present autumn, from a field measuring 8 acres 18 rods, which he planted on the farm improved by Thomas R. Hazard, in said town, the following crop, viz :593 bushels of shelled corn, worth (say) 80 cents per bushel -            $474.4050 bushels ears of refuse corn, worth 15 cents per bushel -7 5 020 tons of s talks and fodder, at              $450 per ton .90 003 large ox cart loads of Swede turn is, 150 bushels, at 12 its. 18 75 5 large ox wagon loads of sweet pump king, at                $3 per load -15 00 Total .a- -605 6SThe field averaging 73 bushels 2 quarts per acre of sound corn. Onei1184 Mob 6. No. 140.selected acre, 131 rods by 12 rods, yielded 89 bushels, 181 quarts. The ground had been used as a sheep pasture for the last four years. About 6 acres of it were spread over with coarse barn manure and sea weed previous to sloughing last spring. About one acre was manured in the hill, and the remainder was not manured at all Herald of the Times. In the Southern Cultivator we are furnished with an analysis of thesoqithern corn, by Professor Shepherd, which it may be interesting to quote he te, for the benefit' of those who may not have seen it He says: "One hundred parts heated to redness in a crucial e, so long as a brightly burning flame was emitted, lost 81.05 parts. 'the completely charred residue m, on being igni ted beneath a muff le, on a platino foil, until all the carbon was consumed left 0.95 part, or less than one per cent. of an easily flowing clear glass. This ash has the following composition : s iliac, 384 5 ; potassawith traces of soda) 195 1; phosphates of lime, 17.17; phosphates of magnetic, 13.83; phosphates of potash a, 2.24; carbonate of lime, 2.50 ; carbonate of magnetic, 2.16; sulphate of lime and sulphate of magnetic, 0.79 ;s iliac, (mechanically present) 1.70; ah lamina traces, 0; loss, 1.65; total 10000. Omitting the s iliac as an unimportant loss to the soil, and the carbonic acid, which is a product of the analysis, we have, in every one hundred parts of the ash of the I indian corn, the following -important organic constituents : Potassa, 20.87; phosphorus acid, 18.80; lime, 9.72; magnetic, 5.76; total, 55.15. That is to say, for every 1,000 pounds of I indian corn sold from an estate, the land is robbed of 9- pounds of in organic matter, whereof about 5: pounds consist of principles of prime value to any species of crops t may sometimes be useful to know how to estimate the amount of corn in grain, contained in a crib or store house, while it is still in the ear, and we therefore give a statement relating to this subject, which appeared in an agricultural paper at the south." The following rule for ascertaining the quantity of shelled corn in a house of any dimensions is by William Murray, esq, of South Carolina, and as read before the It. Johns Collection Agricultural Society, and communicated by them for publication in the Southern Agriculturistrlulehaving previously level led the corn in the house, so that it witlbeof equal depth throughout, ascertain the length, breadth, and depth of the bulk; multiply these dimensions together, and their product by 4;then cut off one figure from the right of this last product. This will give you so many bushels and a dec i mal of a bushel of shelled corn. If it be required to find the quantity of feared corn, substitute 8 for 4, and cut offone0figure as before. Ample .a: In a bulk of corn in the ear, 12 feet long, 11 feet broad, and 6 feet deep, there will be 316 bushels and T the of a bushel of shelled corn, or 633 bushels and -6ths of ear corn; as, 12 X 11 132 X 6 =a= 79 2 ,x 43 168; or, 12 x 11 =132 6 79 2 x 8 633 The dec i mal his ised when the object is to find the quantity of shelled corn, because thatddimal is ore half the dec i mal 8, and it requires 2 bushes of ear corn to mine' be bushel of i helped: corn. in using these rules, half a bushel may b added for every hind red ; that amount of easrlts re sit from the substitution of the decimals. The term barrel of corn' so such used bytSithirners, means 5 bushels of shelled corn in experiment is related by -or. B. P. Johnson, of Some, in one of the numbers of the Cultivator, respecting the prevention of injury to the crop, a. 185 from worms. He states that on sloughing up some s ward land for corn in the spring, he found under the sod a great number of worms. Dear fullest his crop would be seriously damaged after it was ploughed, he sowed broad cast about l- bushel of fine salt to the acre, and then harrowed and rolled the land. His seed he also prepared by soaking it in warm water for about 18 hours. He next dissolved 2 ounces of sal ammonia, anti put it in the water, in which about a bushel of seed was prepared. He planted his corn 2 days after the salt had been sown. It terminated very quickly, was remarkably vigorous, and the plants grew luxuriantly. Not a single hill was found to be injured by the worms, though multitudes were in the ground; while a neighbor who had an adjoining field, and who planted his seed as usual, lost at least one third of his crop by worms. Respecting steeps for I indian corn, the editor of the Cultivator remarks( He prefers m urate of ammonia, which he would use by dissolving in water, enough fairly to cover the seed, which may remain in solution 24 hours at a temperature of 600 to 70. An ounce of ammonia, at an expense of about 2 cents" he says, "is sufficient for 1 quart of corner. Member, ofCharlestown, N. H., according to the New England Farmer, dissolved a small piece of m urate of ammonia, 4 or 5 grains, in half a coffee cup of water, and threw into the solution a handful of corn, which he allowed to remain 4 or 5 hours, and then planted it. He planted side by side other corn, not soaked, with that which he had thus prepared, and the soaked corn produced much the largest yield generally one third more. The land is stated to have been light and dry; and, for several of the experiments, the poorest spots were selected on purpose. The corn suffered from drought, but in all cases the soaked corn was decidedly the best. Others, however, have made trial of steeps to no advantage, as appears by the following n a communication in the New England Farmer, an account is given of some experiments in soaking <a name="seeds9"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in a composition of nitrate, sulphate, andmuriate of ammonia, and nitrate of soda and potash, and which, when applied to corn, does not seem to have been equally successful. Whensteeped 100 hours the corn vegetated poorly, but when stepped 140 hours it lost its power of vegetation. After various trials, 80 hours was fixed on as th- proper time, and three rows of stepped corn, and three rows not stepped, were planted through a large field. But the corn that had been stepped, if anything, appeared to flourish less than that which had not been stepped. Few single isolated experiments are not sufficient to determine such a question. In an experiment mentioned in an agricultural paper, it is stated that seed corn taken from the tip kerseys of the ear produced only half as much askernels taken from the middle of the ear, while those from the butts of the ear gave about fifteen-sixteenth as much as those from the middle. A number of interesting papers on the culture of I indian corn will be found in the appendix No. 3. The method of raising C a sod crop" of corn on the prairies, contained in Mr. Ellsworths account of prairie cultivation, (appendix No. 1,)is one which will interest many of our western agriculturists, and may perhaps be tried with success on some of the rich level lands in other sections of the country. The experiments of Messrs. Red des, Young, Under hill, Darling, and others, mentioned in appendix No. 3, deserve the attention of the planters and farmers of our country. The new variety of sweet corn for the table; obtained by Mr. Darling 186 will be valuable to gardeners, &c, who furnish the markets of our large cities. -the importance of sub soil sloughing for this crop is evidenced in the following extract, which we give from the American Agriculturists of November last : " A farmer from Connecticut informs us that he has raised a field of cor during the past summer which he thinks will average 80 bushels to the acre, and that he selected half an acre of the best, from which he gathered 134 bushels of ears, all sound and well filled out; that while his neighbors corn adjoining was withering with the drought, his was luxuriant; and he attributes the whole of his success to sub soil sloughing. Another important fact stated by him was that the whole expense of planting, cultivating, and harvesting, after the ground was ploughed, did not exceed                $3 per acre: that he did not touch it with a he, but worked it with a harrow andcultivator, and those few weeds that were not reached with these about the hills were pulled up by hand before going to seed n the March number of the Cultivator (1845) is given an account of an experiment made by Mr. Charles Vol felt, of Pennsylvania, in 1844, who, by the use of a peculiar com post of his own preparing, secured a large crop of corn. He states that he took 25 bushels of reached ashes, 10 bushels of plaster of Paris, 16 bushels of lime, and about 50 bushels, of fine sheep manure, mixed the whole together on the barn floor, and dissolved the lime with beef and pork bring. After thoroughly mixing the com post, the heap looked like gray plaster. He then put one handful of this preparation in a hill of corn, until he found he had not enough to go over his whole 12 acres. He then reduced the quantity to one handful for two, and even three hills. His field was the poorest on the place, and he was told not to expect over half a crop of corn. It had been in wheat, and laid out one summer without c lover; :so that the prospect was not very encouraging. He adds, that soie of his neighbors rather quitted him about his com post, but were amazed when hushing and hauling in time came. The corn grew surprisingly. It was very tall ; and although he says the cut worm and black birds worked on it to such a degree that he had to plant one third of the field over again before the 20th of May, yet the crop was as good as any in the neighborhood, if not better. He gathered 26 wagon loads of 70 bushels each; being 8 20 bushels, or 151 bushels to an acre. Some of the ears he states were so high that a man six feet tall could not reach the top of th- ears of corn: The kind of corn planted was the large and small yellow, and was all hard. There the handful of com post was put was the best corn; :and, as the quantity was diminished, the difference was readily perceptible in its appearance. The Farmers: Cabinet of June, 1845, contains a letter from Henry Easier, of Newcastle, Delaware, which recommends sloughing in September for corn. He states that it is a remedy for preventing the worm from destroying the, young corn. His statement is as follows: " In this county the heart worm and the wire worm have made great destruction in .the corn for the last ten years. I have accidentally found out a remedy that has twice succeeded in preventing the worm from destroying the young corn. In September, 1842,:1 ploughed a part of a c lover sod for wheat, but the great drought prevented my finishing the field, s 6 that I concluded to pit the c lover sod field in corn in the spring of 1843; the part ploughed in. 187 September, 1842, escaped the ravages of the worm, while the land alongside, ploughed in the spring of 1843, was nearly all taken by the worm this induced me to try again, which I did in the month of September, 1843,with the same success as before stated. To plough in November or December will not, as I believe, be of any use whatever as a preventive against the worm. I have known a field part ploughed in September, part in December, and the residue in March following, with the following results: The first escaped the ravages of the worm ; the second and last were both destroyed in greater or less degree all in the same field. Now, it is worth a fair trial; and, if September sloughing will prevent the destroyed, it will save the farmer much trouble and loss. It has succeeded in three instances, to my knowledge. The reason of which success, I leave for others better qualified to ascertain. The facts are worth attending to, as it may save many bushels of corn to the farmer. *a* *a* *a* *a* The foregoing observations remind the editor of a fact which occurred some eight or ten years ago. He ploughed about one third of a field of fourteen acres for corn, very late in the autumn ; the plough was then stopped by the frost, but the weather being remarkably mild for a few days in the second month, the plough was again started, and some four or five acres more were ploughed, when the cold weather again suspended operations. The remainder of the lot was not finished till the latter part of the fourth month, just before planting time. One half of the field was limed with thirty-five bushels to the acre ; the other half had no manure. The cut worm was exceedingly troublesome all over the field. There was no perceptible difference in its ravages, either where the ground had been ploughed at different periods, or where the lime had or had not been applied. The corn was re planted andreplantedAn experiment in the culture of I indian corn was made by Judge Clark, of Waterloo, New Work, in which a large crop (140 bushels of sound corn to the acre) was raised on a petty swamp. The writer, who furnishes the account to an agricultural paper, says that the farmers predicted, that if the season should be wet the crop would be drowned ; if dry, the much would dry up and the corn wither. He says, however, that on going over the field one morning early, after the second hoping, and the ears had commenced forming, in the height of the drought of last summer, instead of finding the soil dry and thirsty, the whole loose petty mass was full of moisture. He attributes it to the hydrogen of the de composed mass during night having united with the oxygen of the air, and thus having formed water, as well by capillary attraction as by chemical affinity. In a less porous soil, the union he thinks could not have taken place in the same way. If the petty soil, too, had not been in a fine state of decomposition, the same result would not have occurred. If the season had been wet, the ditches would have prevented the crop from being drowned; but the decomposition not being as rapid for want of the heat of the sun upon it, the crop would probably have been ruined not from its being overflowed, but as the union of the two masses above mentioned could not have taken place from want of preparation in the petty soil to evolve the hydrogen. The experiment is an interesting one, whether or not the theory advanced to account for the success be the correct explanation. Mr. A. D. Outer, of Herriotsville, A, also communicates to the editor of the same paper for January, 1846, the result of an experiment which he18
made last season in drilling I indian corn, by which it would appear that this method deserves more attention than it has received. He made his rows three feet apart- put two grains fifteen inches apart in the row. In three acres he raised 369 bushels of ears. Some of his neighbors prophesied a failure, but were much astonished to find the result so entirely different from what they had expected. Worn and <a name="potatoes7"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in alternate rows are said, by a correspondent of an agricultural paper, to produce as much corn as if every row was corn, and half as many <a name="potatoes8"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The level cultivation of corn is recommended in an essay on the cultivation of this product, read before the Agricultural Society of Gazette county, by Mr. John Gray, and published in the Vomer ville Reporter, Tennessee. He commenced this method of cultivation about twenty-five years since ;and, as he has found it to answer well, he still continues the practice. He uses no plough, but simply works his ground over with what he calls a rake, which mellows the soil and cleans the surface. He ploughs his land in October and November six to eight inches deep, and buried \all the vegetation, and plants his corn from the 10th to the 25th of March ; laying off the rows 4 feet each way, and leaves three s talks to each hill. He thinks the reason why some farmers do not succeed in the use of the rake, is because they do .not plough their land, but only scratch it over at first, and the pass is not killed in its germ; but they do not use the rake till. the land is overgrown, and then abuse the rake because it will not: do all that \as promised. This method of cultivation, as is obvious, can only answer in light, warm, and mellow soils. The editor of the Cultivator recommends the use of a light, narrow shovel plough, and in some soils a harrow will be found sufficient. The cultivation of I indian corn for fodder, while green, has been alluded to and recommended in former reports. Some examples have been heretofore given of great productive ness obtained by sowing broadcast. The attention of many of our agriculturists seems to have been recently turned to this subject, In appendix No. 3, we have quoted from the New England Farmer the statement of Captain george And all, of New Bedford, Pass. It will be seen. that he estimates the corn fodder taken from: 2.s'th acres equal to fifteen tons of the very best English hay. In the amount thus obtained he fed went y cows in milk, or in calf dry, one he ifer over two years old, two stock bulls grown, and five spring calves, for seven weeks and five days. This he states was all the green fodder his stock had, except what they could pick up from a pasture burned up, in which they had un during the season. In five days after feeding on corn fodder, he says his cows increased their milk one can full, or ten quarts. Behave ourselves had the pleasure of i hearing from Captain And all, in person, the confirmation of his whole state men as: published, and his fill confidence in the value of the green corn crop as fodder for stock of all kinds, Another statement which is given in an agricultural paper mentions the planting of an are of corn for fodder eighteen inches apart one may, twelvethetoher, and, three kerseys to the hill. The product was five j tons of well cured s talks and fifty-four bushels of corn; the land was never manured ;it was a clay loam, interspersed with granite c bolders, and quart z, and limestone. The estimate of expenses as given is as follows. 185 tons of stalk, worth this year     $7 per ton -35 00 54 bushels of ears of eightrowved corn, at 25 cents -13 50: -a: -a- .a: .a. :a: Total -48 50Deduct the cost- -a. : -1 bushel of seed; planting, hoping, cutting up, hushing, s tacking _s talks, and use of land -17 4 .a. et profit -                 $31.06The subject of corns talk sugar will be considered when we come to speak of the sugar crop. The cultivation of broom corn has been mentioned in some 6 former reports, and the use of the seed for feeding sheep spoken of. Confirmatory of this, we here sub join a few remarks from the Massachusetts Slough man, The seed is excellent to fatten sheep. Albert Gibrard, of North Had dam, tells us that he makes use of the seed of his broom corn to fatten sheep that they are very fond of it, and will fatten 'letter on this than on I indian corn. Room corn is raised in great quantities in the river towns, where the brooms are (did 127) made :in and distributed' to all parts of the country. Behave often raised the corn for the sake of the brush; but we halvenevermade much account of the seed, though we think it has seldom been converted into meal for hogs, Mr. Gibrard thinks the broom corn seed more valuable for sheep than oats, or any grain, pound for pound." A correspondent of the Cultivator for November, 1845, in reply to a request for information on the culture of this plant, gives the following directions, which we presume, will be acceptable to many farmers; as more attention has lately been turned to this subject in some parts of the country. 'I am not prepared to give satisfactory answers to your correspondent on the subject of broom corn in every particular, but will briefly state that we have, the past summer, had about 35 acres under cultivation about one half on thaMVohawk low lands, (or flats) which is the soil generally preferred; the balance adjoining, on a gravely soil. In account of the! extreme drought the low ground has done much the best. 2d. As to profits, compared with other crops, much depends on: the success you may have. Some seasons it does much better than others; the past has been too dry to give a good large brush; but ,with us the seed has been an extraordinary crop, averaging nearly or quite 50 bushels to the acre, and most of it very full andheavyrweighiing 31 pounds to the bushel, and is excellent for fattening hogs. They eat it greedily, and thrive on it as well, if not better, than on 0 indian corn. An acre of, good broom corn should yield from 400 to 600 pounds of brush; and the seed, when good, is worth in its rough state as much as oats for feed. to   have now on i hand enough of time seed to plant 200 acres, and can supply your correspondent with any reasonable quantity at the lowest market price. My seed is the largest and best I have ever seen: A letter directed " J. D. F. West; Schuyler, New Work' will be attended to. As to the query 'will the increased production be likely to over stock the market 'a' Like every other product of the soil, there in ay ban over s toi k some years more than others, but thus far the demand has kept up with the product, "to show the increasing value of this culture, we also sub join a short article, taken from the Ohio Cultivator, and another from the It. Louis New 190 a. Era: :I n confirmation of what was stated under this head, in the Cultirator of May I, we find the following in the Marietta I intelligence r respecting the extent of the business in the Muskingum valley: 'last year And S. Temple, of this place, commenced in a small way, for the purpose of testing the sensibility of the enterprise, the manufacture of corn rooms. They obtained the planting of a little more than 100 acres of broom corn and as the season was favorable, obtained a good crop, which they worked into; brooms and broom brushes here. They gave constant employment to 10 or 12 hands, and, in the course of last season, made 50,000 brooms and 4000 brushes. This year they have contracted for the planting of 400 acres of broom corn. Mr. L. Temple is also purchasing, and will pay good prices for, broom corn to export. We are glad to notice all enterprises of this kind, and most heartily wish all engaged in them the success they deserve. Organ county, we are happy to know, is doing a good business in broom corn for export, we believe. Mr. Isabel Some roy, of Windsor    in that county, has 300 acres planted, and is contracting for corn planted by others" -a. In the Ohio Cultivatorofay 12, 145, we find the following' Room corn culture in Ohiothis article is becoming quite a staple product of the rich bottom lands of this State: From present appearances, it is like li that not only all Yankee do , but England also, and perhaps theSCelestials, will soon be (cid127luppliedwith those important implements of household economy, brooms, from the Luck eye Statethe most extensive operators in this new business are three brothers, named Baton young men of great enterprise and intelligence natives of this State, and possessing all the necessary equal, fixations of genuine Yankees. One of them now resides in the great metropolis' of England, where e he as established an extensive manufactory of brooms, the materials for which are all sent over from this country ; and, in an un manufactured state, are admitted free of duty. The demand there is almost unlimited, so that it, is anticipated a very extensive and profitable business will be done. Another of the brothers resides near this city, (columbus) and is now engaged in putting in five or six hundred acres of the rich Scioto valley land belonging to the Messrs. Sullivan t) which is spread out several t miles in width, in full, view from the window by which we are writing. He raised about three hundred acres on a portion of the same land last year. The other brother resides at Circle ville, twenty-five miles further down theScioto valley, and is there putting in four or five hundred acres more ;bide she which, they have numerous contracts with farmers for smaller lots, to be grown for them, and delivered at their presses when harvested. Atrthis is intended for shipment to the brother in England, next fall. Of  n addition to all this, we learn that there is as much morel and devoted to this crop in the valleys of the Dusk i gum and the two Diaries, the product of which is mainly designed for the New Work and New England markets. We shall, of other occasions, give particular accounts of thecuilthure and profitable ness of this product, and the success of the foreignbrancihof this i novel enterprise . Krems. The Sort hampton Order states that " Mr. Of. B down, ofHatfi old, has sit acres of broom corn, under a high state of cultivation, l at Fredericksburg, Virginia.

. 191 Again: -for the. Farmer and Mechanicschenectady, August 28, 1845.--The farmers in this vicinity are cutting their broom corn. They scrape the <a name="seeds10"><mark>seeds</mark></a> off while it is green, and then dry it under sheds and kills. The seed is lost, but the brush is enough letter to pay the loss of that. One gentleman told me today that he had one hundred and thirty acres in broom corn; and another, near by, has two hundred acres, and it never looked better. A pound of bromcornis worth t as much as, a pound of pork in Ohio. -A little west of this, I see farmers are getting in their fall crops in true New England style; plough the ground well, and put a moderate quantity of file manure or compose upon the furrows, and then drag it in with a sharp harrow, before putting in the seed. In this way you are more sure of a good grass crop to fallow the grain. The ground is left more open, and the roots a ke a deeper hold, and of course last longer. Hours, E. P. W."" A new article of trade he noticed landing 25 neatly 'packed bales of broom corn tassels, grown up the Mississippi river, and a portion of a crop which will amount to over 100 boa ll e The e 25 shipped here have been sold in New Work, to arrive at five cents a pound. If sales can be effected at this rate, we should think it to be a profitable crop as the culture is very simple, and requires bu it little out lay either of capital or labor it. Louis Now Era. :the Cultivator for January, 1846, states that the fine interval lands of the Messrs. Full i in t near Coluimbul have, as usual, been covered with corn this seas to, on h 400 acres of which has been grown broom n corn, by air. Baton, of Chillicothe, Who has also, this season, grown the same crop near Circieville and Chillicothe; in all to the amount of 1,000 acres, which has been very nicely prepared, put in bales, and pressed, and has already gone forward to be shipped to England, where the owner has workmen employed in manufacturing it into brooms. -another application of broom corn is suggested, in an extract which we present, taken from some public journal. Should this prove successful, itiigiht render this product one of still greater value' to the agriculturists A specimen of t paper made from broom corn s talks has been shown in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia I inquirer alludes to it as an excellent article- remarkable for to go ness, flexibility, and body ; and (ano the' important matter) offered at a very low rate. The manufacturers deserve credit for their enterpriseSPOTATOES. -a. The <a name="potato5"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of the last season :has again been st injected to the: same disease which so greatly lessened it in the previous year. To whatever cause it is to .be attributed, yet the extent of its influence has been greater, for it had made its appearance in sections of the country which had been before free from the same. The precaution suggested in the former year may have aided in checking the evil to some degree ; but the whole amiuntfdecreaseis fearfully enlarged in these regions generally affected heretofore. The He England States have again been among the principal suffrersThe accounts from first to last, since the period et its development, have been more un favor air in Paine. The public journals a d agricultural papers have be eh uniform in declaring that there has not been more tbhaa12 half a crop. From the fact that an extension of the starch factories created a greater demand for <a name="potatoes9"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, there have been many more planted; but a great many have been destroyed, either in the ground or after they were gathered and stored. Thus the Augusta Age, in the centre of the State, in September, says: "he regret very much to learn, from all parts of the country, that the <a name="potato6"><mark>potato</mark></a>' crop is almost entirely destroyed. In a recent trip in Lincoln county, we are informed by many of the farmers that they should be hardly able to obtain enough <a name="potatoes10"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a sound and healthy state to replace the seed of last spring. The vines or tops died sore weeks ago, and, on digging, the <a name="potatoes11"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are found to be very small in size and few in, number; and what is still worse, those that are found prove to be much diseased, and soon rot and become unfit for use. The result must be that this State, from which an immense amount of the first quality of <a name="potatoes12"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have heretofore been annually exported, will hardly produce enough for the consumption of its own citizens." Again: The Easportsentinel states that it has been estimated that there were shipped from that port l at season 19,620 b hares of white blue nose <a name="potatoes13"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and that the quantity: shipped direct from Mala is, Robbinston, Merry, Tube c, and Dem broke, would make the number' of barrels exported rising 40,000. It is now supposed that the quantity to be sn t to market will not exceed 5,000lbarrels, as very few farmers in the neighborhood will have more than will answer for seed and their own consumption' To, in October" We are sorry to state that the failure of the <a name="potato7"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in this vicinity is much more extensive than last year. Any fields do not yield the quantity planted, and almost all are more or less affected. From present appearances, there will not be half of an average yield; certainly not, unless the process of decomposition is soon stopped, which may be the case by cold weather. The fall season has been unusually mild no severe frost until within the last week- Mala is (paine) Frontier Journal. Another paper says: " From last years crop, it is estimated that the loss by rot this year, in Paine, cannot be less than 1,230,000, or more than two dollars to every person in the State." By some we are informed that there was not (one-fourth as large a crop as in 1844. In many sections they failed entirely ; in others, the quantity raised was not over what was planted. As the prevalence of the cause was so universal in the State, we think that we shall not be far out of the way in fixing the decrease at an average of 30 per cent. In New Hampshire, in the south eastern and eastern sections of the Stateothe injury was probably as much as "' 20 to 25 per cent." as compared with the crop of the previous year. A correspondent writes from this part of the State, that .the crop was much injured by the rot, which has caused much :fear as to increasing the crop ; it has generally been the case that <a name="potatoes14"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were grown when corn would not succeed, and the quantity raised has been on the increase ; butt of late, the people have come to a pause oft the propriety of increasing the crop." In the Connecticut river, in the southwestern section, it is s id to have been, on the whole, a fair: crop. Any fears haLvelbeen entertained for the <a name="potato8"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop on account t of the drought, and the rot which prevailed so extensively last year. Happily t, these fears have ben realized in neither respect." If we compare the state of the crop with the census in 1840, we find that the ire hi s ben e oihsiderable fig off in or tis of th tate which are extensive engaged i be. No. 1 404 193 raising <a name="potatoes15"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, so that the average decrease for the whole State cannot have been less than from 15 to 20 percent n Vermont, from every section we hear the same complaint. Thus, it is said: : "he are sorry to state that the failure of the <a name="potato9"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in this vicinity is much more extensive than last year. Any fields do not yield the quantity planted, and almost all are more or less affected.

The fall season has been unusually mild no severe frost until within the last week it. Plans Messengerlower down, and in the north eastern section of the State, we are informed that owing to the r the crop has fallen of at least 25 per cent' Thesamee, but to a less extent, was the case in the southwestern portion of the State, the <a name="potatoes16"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having suffered much from the rot since they were harvested: The whole decrease may have been from 15 to 20 percent The disease very much- injured the <a name="potato10"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop . I Massachusetts. In the north eastern section of this State, a good judge on the subject says that a large portion of them were diseased, and thinks that they fell off 40 percent." Power down, in the central eastern section, the decrease is estimated at from " 25 to 30 per cent." In the into we are told that the disease was thought to be less fatal than last year at the time of the harvest but since then, they have shown more general disease than last year. In the western part of the State the crop is considered" one third less" than that of the previous year. Our infornantnhere adds "the yield of the <a name="potato11"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was full an average, and the cause of the diminution in quantity was in consequence of the farmers not planting as many as usual. Oh disease among the <a name="potatoes17"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, called the rot was very fatal to the crop last season. They were affected by the same disease this year. It did not commence so early this season as the last, but its ravages are still going on in our cellars. Lastuseason, after bold weather, there was not such complaint." The whole diminution of the crop 'cannot be less than 25 per cent as to valuable product, though the number raised may, in sections, have been actually more. There was, likewise from the drought and rot a decrease in Rhode I self and and Connecticut of not less than 15 or 20 per cent. The accounts from the various parts of the State of New York representtheipotato crop as suffering from the drought early in the season, and subsequently from the rot. Thus, in U ne, a Data via paper says: " Earlypoatoes are used up; butinrcansequence of the frequent showers with which we have been recently visited, late <a name="potatoes18"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will probably be sufficiently abundant. in- August, however, we are informed respecting the crop in the western 'part of the State- I The <a name="potato12"><mark>potato</mark></a> vines -give evidence of the work of the worms, or the disease that was so destructive last year." a   the- vicinity of Newyork, in July, it is said :a' The early d planting .has turned out better than was expected; but fears are entertained for the fall crop.

We do not, however, recollect any complaint of the rot; probably because the greater portion of the crop consists of sweet potatoes. In the central region, east of the Place Ridge, they suffered greatly, and, we are told, were almost an entire failure. The same was the case in the section bordering on the Kanawha and its branches, (western central) where the loss is believed to have equalled e 25 per men t. In the northwestern counties of the State, however, there was a slight increase. The decrease for te whole State is estimated at 20 per cent.

South of the centre, on the Scioto river, it was about '20 to 30 per cent." The rot was also felt in this section. In the southwest section of the State, on the Miamivalley, it fell off, it is said, 25 per cent." West of this there was a slight increase perhaps ' 10 per cent."

In the northwest corner of the State a 10 per cent. more" and about the same, east, along the lake, towards the central north section. We believe that, taking the whole State, there was a falling off of perhaps 10 to 15 per cent. The crop of <a name="potatoes25"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> appears to have suffered much from the drought in  n diana, and mention is also made of the disease, which does not seem to have prevailed there in 1844. In the north central section, above the Wabash river, and in the northwest part of the State, it is estimated to have been ' 25 per cent. less." In the central portion of the State a similar conclusion is drawn; while on the west of this it is thought to have fallen off at least " 30 per cent." In the southeast section, where the blight is mentioned, there is -perhaps a less crop by "20 per cent." Our informant, describing the blight which has affected them, says: " It first affects the vine just above the ground ; it turns black and gangrenous, and the whole top dies for want of nourishment from the root. The <a name="potatoes26"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are sound and good ; but there are few, if any, with to, which have attained their full growth, owing to the death of the vine having occurred before the full growth of the <a name="potato19"><mark>potato</mark></a> could take place. We have not as yet been able to ascertain the cause of the disease which affected the crop n old, new, and manured ground, as well as that which was not" The whole crop of thisJState must have fallen off from 20 to 25 per cent. I n; most parts of. I illinois there was a considerable falling off of the <a name="potato20"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. In the northwest and northeast sections it is variously estimated at from "10 to 25 per cent." In the central, west of the I illinois river, and towards the Mississippi river, it is thought to have been considerably better. Still lower down, towards the southwestern corner of the State, there was a decrease of' 25 per cent." In the whole, probably there was an average decrease of from nl to 15 per cent. for the whole State. The following, from the Prairie' Farmer for November, 1845, shows that he disease has made its appearance there :he " <a name="potato21"><mark>potato</mark></a>: rot his malady, which has been creating such dismay in the eastern States and over Europe, has made its appearance among us, and its ravages in sections of Will county are described as fearful. :Some farmers out of 300 bushels do not harvest ten; and those which were harvested in good order are found in a little time entirely useless. When many decay together, the stench is intolerable i Michigan, with the exception of the southeast part of the State, the reins been a decrease, varying, as estimated, from" 10 to 30 per cent." 'he. 10 editor of the Michigan Farmer places it at about "' one third." In -the whole, we believe the average to have been from 10 to 15 per cent. less. The appearance of the rot is mentioned by the Miles Republican, which states in Berfien and Pass counties hundreds of bushels have been put in i the cellar dry and in good order, but have taken the rot, and been completely destroyed writer in the Michigan Farmer, also, under date from Jackson, saysSMichigan has hitherto escaped nearly uninjured, but the present year the disease has prevailed with some virulence in certain neighborhoods in this and one or two adjoining counties. We have not heard of its appearance in other parts of the Stateti   'he whole <a name="potato22"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of the United States for 1845, including, of course, both common and sweet potatoes, is estimated to have been about 88392000bushels. We have no means of ascertaining how many of these were sweet potatoes, but we presume as many as one sixth or one-seventh, if we may judge from the proportion of the States in which the crop was raised. The culture of the <a name="potato23"><mark>potato</mark></a>, both the sweet and I wish, as it is termed, is an object of much interest to our country, and any suggestions on the subject from those who are well fitted to give them, will also prove of much interest.  In appendix No. 4 will be found several articles of value on these topics: The paper on the culture of the sweet potato, by W. Summer, ofPomaria, S. C, which we have taken from the Cultivator for February, 1845. Another short article also is given, which originally appeared in the. Vicksburg Constitutional ist; and we have also added Mr. A. Metals method, as set forth in his pamphlet.  The following is an analysis of the sweet potato by Professor Shepherd. He says: "the tubes analyzed, though fresh from the market, were obviously driver than when first harvested. 100 parts of the thinly slicedtuber, on being thoroughly dried at a temperature of 2000, lost 58.97 percent. of water.

We add here two short extracts from different agricultural papers on the same general subject: " I noticed a method of cultivating <a name="potatoes27"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which struck me as very good, especially on n old i ground.

Coarse manure helps to keep the earth toistuideir it.

Kidney, of Piqua, Ohio, informs us that he successfully cultivates <a name="potatoes31"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on the following plan: Plant in hills, and ' hen the <a name="potatoes32"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are about an inch out of ground, take a light plough and run it so close to them as to cover them lightly with earth. When they get through this a ninth, or so, cross -il ugh th -m, overing up as before. This mode is stated to be equal to the best hoping, besides being a great saving of labor. Mr. W. states that he has practised this mode for several years, and has never lot: a hill or had them at all injured by covering." Some remarks on this method of Mr. Kidney, by Mr. Picket t, may be found in the appendix' (did 127) i :lie: inert is e d, Virginia, in the It gust (did 127) f bit of: theCultivator, describes a mode of cultivation there practised, which 'he hinksriiay have a tendency to prevent the disease that has proved so destructiveStbit he does not say whether he is speaking of the common or the sweet pot. 199 to.

The question has been discussed in a number of journals, from time to time, respecting the advantage or injury of removing the blossoms from the vine. In the appendix; No. 4, we have therefore incid127troduced sorrearticleson this subject; one from the London Gardeners' Chronicle, edited by Professor Of   in eley, the celebrated botanist; another, alluding to the same, intheBos on Cultivator. Another question which is still looted in the discussions of agriculturists is that of cutting or dissenting the <a name="potato29"><mark>potato</mark></a> tube r, or sub dividing the plant. He' also quote a statement on these subjects from a pamphlet by Robertarthur. By dormant dissection is meant cutting in' the autumn or winter, instead of spring' Experiment on dormant dissection n this experiment the seed was cut in November, and immediately stored in an old stable among .pe at mould; they were not so much diseased as the whole ones in spring. There were only f bu r of the sets covered with blue mould, the i est being t healed over bright and hard' and white. The blue moulded ones did not grown but all the others grew vigorously, producing mt such taller plants andlargerolitager than the former. :the crop was later than by bleeding, dissection, or subdivision, and pro deed at the rate of ll1toins per act of anger andShealthier <a name="potatoes36"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> Experiment on <a name="potato30"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant subdivision n this experiment the seed 200 was preserved the common \may, removed to a vine by in March, buried among mild, watered abundantly, and, when sprung to 6 or 8 inches, each large <a name="potato31"><mark>potato</mark></a> was sub divided into from 9 to 12 plants, having one rooted stem with a small set to each. These were dipped in puddles, and planted 10 inches apart, at an angle of about 450, with the tops towards the east. Other experiments, however, suggest that the roots and <a name="potatoes37"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be exposed to the south, (or as near that point as practicable) with the tops northward. The result of this experiment was, an earlier crop, by about 3 weeks, than by dormant dissection. The tops were regular, but not so vigorous. The <a name="potatoes38"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were of very equal size ; smaller, but much more numerous, than by either bleeding or dormant dissection. Although, by this subdivision, the peck planted fully double the length of the drill, on equal portions of the ground being cleared, <a name="potato32"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant subdivision yielded fully 13 tons per acre; that is, more than double of bleeding dissection, and 21 tons more than by dissection n the Agricultural Village Gazette of W. Robe, from which we have already quoted an account of Iberian rye, the -winter culture of <a name="potatoes39"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is recommended by On Cloth o and Franckg. The first, under date of April 1, 1845, says: "I n spite of the severe winter, 1 have, on the 1st November, covered up <a name="potatoes40"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with leaves only a foot high, and they have grown admirably, and are perfectly formed." The editor states that the specimen furnished him of these winter <a name="potatoes41"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were indeed of so remarkable a kind, that it furnishes a strong recommendation in favor of the winter culture. The other 'correspondent says, that in the beginning of September, by way of experiment, he laid out a little bed in his garden, and planted half with white <a name="potatoes42"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and half with red ones, and covered them only slightly with earth. " The <a name="potatoes43"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> throne more rapidly and stronger than in the spring seas ion." His business called him off, so that they were neglected till after a hard frost; in December (7th) the leaves were already dipped and dead. He then covered up the bed with alder leaves, and, by the middle of April, had, the satisfaction of eating therefrom fresh good lasting <a name="potatoes44"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The product of the red was greater than that of the white. He was so well pleased with his experiment, that he intended repeating it on a larger scale. Speaking of early <a name="potatoes45"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the editor of an agricultural paper in Bostornremarks: "A writer in the Paine Cultivator says that he planted the white blue nose <a name="potatoes46"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the last of April, and he had good sized ripe <a name="potatoes47"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on the 14th of July. We have tried many experiments to ascertain what <a name="potatoes48"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are the earliest, (selecting seed from different sections) and we have found the above kind the earliest of all, and when used early, of the finest quality, being very good and meal y before fully grown. -They do not usually grow large, nor yield well; but in the neighborhood of Last, port, Paine, owing to a peculiar soil or high maturing, they attain a good size; and large quantities of them are sold in this market, under the name of' Last port <a name="potatoes49"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> The use ,of the <a name="potato33"><mark>potato</mark></a> for starch has been steadily advancing in our country for some time; and, we doubt not, will eventually consume a fair proportion of the surplus crop. In one of the public journals we find the following statement, which is encouraging. It is dated some time in August a st: Roi less then 20 <a name="potato34"><mark>potato</mark></a> starch factories are in progress of building g i the -county of Franklin. More than 50 tons of starch were made at the actor y of Bill Abbott, in Farming ton, the last winter. A number of. 201 starch factories are going up in the western part of the State- Thomas ton Recorder fuller statement is also given in the Paine Farmer 'about 100 rod from the centre of Verser village are 2 starch factories, located by a small stream, with a dam across it, which a ords the necessary power to keep them in motion. One has been in operation but a short time; the other for some 2 or 3 years, we believe. They ire doing a good business for the proprietors, and also for the farmers in the vicinity, who find a ready market for their <a name="potatoes50"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which, as a general thing, is as. profitable a crop as is cultivated. The walls of these buildings are built of bricks, and the structures themselves are somewhat larger than we had anticipated, be iris, we should judge, about 50 feet in length, by 35 or 40 in width, and inside 3 stories high. The starch made is of first rate quality. It is principally taken to Massachusetts, where it is readily marketed, and consumed mostly in the calico and cotton factories. We are informed that one of these factories manufactured into starch the past season rising 18,000 bushels of <a name="potatoes51"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, giving employment to 6 or 8 men. During the summer months, after the <a name="potatoes52"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are all ground, only 2 hands are required to a factory, they being employed in drying the starch that could not be dried during the spring, and in putting it into cases. The dry rooms are large, on the 2d floor, and are heated by a huge furnace below. Starch factories are springing up all over the country. Three are under process of erection in Stark S, at different points, and will be ready to commence operations the coming fall. There are now being completed, and being erected, in Somerset county alone, ten starch factories. These will consume an immense quantity of <a name="potatoes53"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and farmers have made calculations accordingly, and planted largely. We heard one farmer say who is himself interested in a factory, now in process of erection, either in Stark S or Colon, we do not remember which town that he had planter 15 acres of land in potatoesiThe disastrous results of the <a name="potato35"><mark>potato</mark></a> blight in Europe have called out the efforts of the scientific men, both in England and on the continent, to suggest modes of converting this fruit into flour, or marina. In the National intelligence r, the correspondent from France furnishes the following account of a mode: discovered .by M. Clerget, and by him laid %before the Academy of Sciences at Paris. It is an interesting paper to our farmers at the present time: "4 Academy of Sciences, Paris sitting of October. A letter was read from M. Clerget, giving an account of his discovery of the mode of making <a name="potato36"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour, of such a quality as to be in every respect fit for pacification. "M. Clergets letter was accompanied with several samples of his productions, in the different stages of the process. Amongst them are two specimens of the flour, of nearly a yellow color, which represent, we are told, the <a name="potato37"><mark>potato</mark></a> in its natural state; divested, however, of the essential oil, and useful for various purposes of domestic economy, although not so fit for pacification as the flour obtained in a more advanced stage of the process. There are three samples of pure white flour-one in powder, the other two g ranula ted ; in which state the flour will keep good. for several years, if kept in a dry place. M. Clerget says that when this i flour is mixed with that from wheat, in the proportion of cent. per cent, and made into bread in the ordinary way, it is exceedingly wholesome and nutritions, and cannot by the taste be distinguished front pure wheat en bread. -his we can believe, for we have eaten bread made in the same proportions of wheat en flour and <a name="potatoes54"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> boiled and reduced      Doen. 140.toaspuI~t and found it eivenmoe agreeable than that made from -the flout exclusively. Read thus made, however, is not agreeable when it has lSeertI  kept -a( or 0 three days; whereas, according to' M. Le gets stateimtit; thatfwhih is made from an admixture of his flour his that of wheat, if to quialproprtions, is much better, Whecid127- le hart pure Oh eaten bread. He estimates the saving, by means of the~ mixture, at from forty to fifty per ce it but this appears to :us to be an er i, for the <a name="potato38"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour cannot be sol .tothepaublic with a reasonable profit te the manufacturer, at less than two sous per pound. Taking wheat en flour at four sos, two pounds of area, made of the mixed for would: cost six sdcid127s instead of eight sous, which certainly does not i give a saving of forty to fifty per cent, although it doeseffectia very important saving. We need not observe that the mixed bread contains less glum ten :f than that of wheat only, but we are by no means sure that an excess of glum ten is favorable to nutrition. M. Clerget is of opinion, however, that if glum ten be added, which is practicable in various ways, very i good bread may be- min a de ,with two thirds <a name="potato39"><mark>potato</mark></a> and one third flour of wheat ; and in this case the saving would be enormous. He informs us, also- that if the <a name="potato40"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour made by his process be mixed with the florofrye, which by itself is difficult of pacification and digestion, a very nutritions and agreeable bread is made. This is a valuable part of his discovery ; for in France nearly two thirds of the rural population hare Coteipolled to exist on rye 6 bread, as being so much cheaper than- that of wheat. By the admixture of <a name="potato41"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour, there would be a saving of out lay, and again in nutrition. It was i stated at the academy that a company had been formed in Paris for the maitfaeture of the potatod flour by M. Clerget' process and that the: same progress towards carrying it out on a large scalehadibeen: made inLondonProfessor Johnston, in his let e n Scottish agriculture, contained in the October number of the oQuariterly Journal of the Highlandt and Agrielt turalSociety of Scotland, has some interesting and valuable remiarlkson thesamesubjet, which, sustained by such authority, deserve careful peus al and serious -reflection. -he says: "I n to this m manufacture great improvements have recently been introduced, and the marina is con ve ted into British tapiocaeinto sir up, and other articles, wh ich will find a in ore br less ready ,market.

Johnston, in the letters already r quoted from the Din berg h Quarter ly Journalspeaksof a. process of preparing them: for this purpose recently discovered in Denmark. He says: ' As I have said so much on the subject of <a name="potatoes65"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I may as well describe to you a: method which has lately i been recommended in Denmark and Norway i for -making i the <a name="potato49"><mark>potato</mark></a> more available and :profitable in feeding cattle than it has ever hitherto been. You are probablyawarethbat <a name="potato50"><mark>potato</mark></a> starch can very readily be .converted into grape sugar, arid a tat the sir up i obtained from it is largely employed in the :manufactureo6fbrandy in the north of Europe, and even of the best barry which comes from -france. 'I n then more northern of the French wineigrowingprovinces, it is vaso mixed with the less sweet varieties of grape juice so as -to given additional strength and richness to the wine. One of the methods by which the icid127otrato starch is converted into grape sugar is, to -mix it with onemtenthof -it t eight of ground -malt diffused in wateriandto keep the :mixture e fsamelhours at a moderate ,temperature, 'i he starch i dissolved, t and -the -i 204 'quid becomes sweet from its conversion into grape sugar. This is the method which Mr. Boggild, of Copenhagen, proposes to apply to the whole <a name="potato51"><mark>potato</mark></a> in order to bring it into a so ruble state, to make it more easy of digestion, arid thus to increase its feeding properties. He w ashes his <a name="potatoes66"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> Well, steams them thoroughly, and then, without allowing them to cool, he cuts them in a cylinder furnished internally with revolving knives, or c rushes them in a mill, and miles them with a small quantity of water and three pounds of malt to every hundred pounds of the raw p <a name="potatoes67"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. His mixture is kept in motion and at a temperature of 1 400 to 1800 Fahrenheit for from one to five hours, when the thick gruel has ac qu i red a sweet taste, and is ready for use. Given in this state, the results of experimental trials are said to best. That it is a richer and better food for milk cows than twice the quantity of <a name="potatoes68"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the raw state. 2d. That it is excellent for fattening cattle and sheep, and for winter food; that it goes much farther than <a name="potatoes69"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> when merely steamed, and that it may be economically mixed up with chopped hay and straw." Professor Johnston adds: I have before me a pamphlet published at Christian a, by the Royal Society for Promoting the I improvement of Norway, in which this method is strongly recommended; also, a letter from Copenhagen, dated 29th April, 1845, in a which my correspondent writes as follows: ' This invention has been more and more appreciated and applied in my native country, For way, and in Denmark ; and the great advantages with which stall feeding may be introduced; at considerably less expense than formerly, made it suited to generalpromulgation' The method has more and more gained adherents; and further comparative experiments, made by scientific and experienced persons, have proved its superiority. The, an experiment established the fact, that an increase of one and a half pounds of flesh is obtained from twenty-five pounds of <a name="potatoes70"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; that the feeding of horses with this mash is found to be applicable and cheap; and all experiments confirm the fact, that <a name="potatoes71"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> used in this manner, as a food, amply afford doubly the nutrition powers compared to the food formerly used." The Professor, in conclusion, remarks: "I cannot here state my reasons for believing that there is really something worthy of attention in the alleged superior feeding qualities of the <a name="potato52"><mark>potato</mark></a> given in this state, but I can strongly recommend you to make experiments upon this subject. If the <a name="potato53"><mark>potato</mark></a> can in this way be converted into a larger quantity of beef, mutton, and pork, than has hitherto been the case, another outlet will be provided for the <a name="potato54"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop which may, perhaps, prove more profitable than even the manufacture of it into flour." The same observation is one, also, which is worthy of the attention of the large <a name="potato55"><mark>potato</mark></a> growers of this country; though on account of the abundance of other materials of fodder, our agriculturists will probably be little inclined to adopt any of the cheaper modes of feeding till necessity compels them, as it does in the older countries of Europe. Another application of <a name="potato56"><mark>potato</mark></a>, it is stated, has recently been discovered in France, where (at Vice) a manufacturer; after six years' labor, has succeeded in producing excellent paper and paste board from a substance separated from the <a name="potato57"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The process is not given, however, in any of the foreign journals we have, nor have we seen any mention, except of the fact a shaving occurred. The subject of storing <a name="potatoes72"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for preserving them suitably, is one which likewise may be commended to the attention of our farmers. In King  erPblytechnic Journal for 1843, vol. 90, we find a description of an earth cell. 205 war for this purpose, quoted from Pieces Meekly Journal for Agricultural and Domestic Economy, No. 34, 1843. As it is highly recommended, we have sub joined a translation of the same: "I n the south eastern portions of Normandy is used for the preservation of <a name="potatoes73"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> a simple kind of earth cellar, which is certainly preferable to the usual modes, where the soil is not exposed to the pressure of the moisture. ;A round wedge shaped pit, terminating in a small straight sided space, is dug in a place which has some elevation, that the moisture may the more certainly drain off. At the bottom of this pit there is a narrow entrance (G) either from the side, where the nature of the ground admits of it, or from above. The object of this is as follows: The <a name="potatoes74"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will always be taken from the bottom, which has this useful result- that the whole heap of <a name="potatoes75"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which naturally sink down as often as ay are withdrawn from below, remains in frequent motion. The sites of the pit must be well smoothed, and here and there burnt out with dry wood. The pit must be covered with a light roof of straw, which is so placed that it maybe easily either wholly taken away when the <a name="potatoes76"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are to be filled in, or at least some portions of it may be removed. Finally, the earth must be heaped up around the pit. Before the <a name="potatoes77"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are brought into the pit, the surface, as is the case in other receptacles, must be laid with straw, especially on the bottom, in order to prepare the surface of the earth on the bottom and sides better. The pit is then to be filled up with <a name="potatoes78"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, heaped up to the brim (a b) For protection against a greater degree of cold, some straw must also be spread out in the empty space l tt when the roof and the <a name="potatoes79"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The mouth of the entrance, also, should be stopped up with bundles of straw. If there are many such earth cellars, they must not be broken up one after the other, but as nearly as possible all together. The excellent condition of <a name="potatoes80"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in these earth cellars is celebrated. That the formation of one of them costs less labor than the labor of preparing the common earth cellar, or the usual receptacles, scarcely need be mentioned The dimensions and shape of the one given in the Journal are as follows, as above mentioned, is the entrance; a by the line to which the <a name="potatoes81"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are to be heaped up, between which and the top of the roof is to be filled with straw. :A substitute for the <a name="potato58"><mark>potato</mark></a> is thus described in some of the public journals, the account of which is interesting, and may perhaps, at a future time, deserve more attention, and therefore we have concluded to add it to the pages of this report. ~i 206

The production referred to is the Arrachia, an umbelliferous plant indigenous in New Arena da, particularly in the most temperate parts of the continent, where the average temperature is 150 to 250 R. Thearrachia is generally three feet in height, its radical leaves twelve to fifteen inches in length, numerous, biter name, doubly incised, den tate, on long fistula r pedicles. The ca ulnar leaves are smaller than the radical, which they resemble in every of her respect.

We can scarcely imagine that a vegetable -of such extensive use, and so highly valued as it is, should only have been introduce, into England about 350 years since. It might well deer ve comme m oration: " Festival to comme morale the introduction of the first potatoFestivalsare frequently established to comme morale some absurd custom, but the following celebration, in honor of the <a name="potato63"><mark>potato</mark></a>, has something in the subject of it of real usefulness to mankind. Several of the German States, we are given to understand from theAthensmum, have instituted feasts in honor of the t introduction of the <a name="potato64"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and the anniversary of its importation has just been held as a jubilee at Bavaria. At Menterswaige, near Munich, a festival was observed on the occasion, in which dishes of the poor man s especial root, variously dressed, had the place of honor on the table, while the bust of Air Francis Rake, crowned with war lands of oak, and presented to the commune for the occasion by its sculptor, Schwanthaler, occupied the centre of the room. Of  n France, a monument is about to be erected to Parmentier, comme mo rating its introduction into that country. It may appear to our readers that the honor paid to the memory of Rake was really due to Raleigh but it is probable that the Germans are literally correct. The first colonists sent out by Raleigh were disheartened when Rake touched at Virginia, and he consented to bring them home. Lane, the governor, who is believed to have brought with him the first tobacco, may have brought, and probably did bring, the first .<a name="potato65"><mark>potato</mark></a>; if so; though indebted to the enterprise of Raleigh for the discovery it was Rakes ship that actually introduced the first root Bulletin of Medical Science. <a name="potato66"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. When, in the report of last year, the pot at crop was under consideration, it was hoped that if another year did not relieve us from, its ray v. a. 20 .ages, at. least so i much light would ,be thrown; on the probable cause .of thejeilas would enable us to remedy its destructive effects. To our regret, however, we find that such has not been the case. As a general fact, the effects- have been more severely felt than before. While the public journals and agricultural papers have a bounded with numerous articles embodying lamentations and suggestions as to the cause or remedy, we scarcely seem to be any nearer the desired result. It is well known, also, that a disease or, blight of a most destructive character has made its appearance both in Great Britain and on the continent, which seems :to be very similar to the one which prevails on this side o of the Atlantic. We have derived one advantage from this circumstance which may essentially aid us in our investigations. Observations of scientific and practical men, conducted under all possible inducements to ascertain the extent and cause of the evil, and to finish the best remedy or preventive, are thus brought to our notice, and we are enabled to compare these with such as have been called forth ,inlourown country. As a general thing, too, the former are marked with a precision and: minuteness of detail which evince a decided superiority in the mode of observation and deduction to the random conjectures of merecasupaluotice. There: are indeed honorable exceptions in the communications made to our own journals ; but there is too often a looseness of state men t, and want of particular it y and discrimination, which impair their value as materials on which to found any important conclusion. We know not the result of the offered premium by the Farmers' Club, and the directions d drawn up by Dr. Partner to aid the investigations of any one who might be disposed to obtain it. We believe, however, that no !very satisfactory result has been reached. The. amount of information on the subject, such as it is, is greater than in the previous year.

This method appears to us to possess some advantages, as there may be a similarity in some' respect, and yet some distinctive and peculiar, features. belonging to either. e shall, also, for the sake of convenience, throw into -two append ices the various articles and statements to which reference may be made, so that the opinions of those who may be considered opponents and advocates of any pp articular views may be seen in their connection in their own language including also such communications of our own correspondent seas. may be deemed best. This our se may increase the size of this. report but such an arrangement possesses the advantage of placing these documents canveienly at hand for. future reference and deduction, instead: of its being needful to search through serous volumes to find- them In the: ni ain, we adopt the course of arrangement for our remarks which was taken in the last report though we shall h here and there generalized or sub divide, as seems to be mot expedient. It will be: unnecessary to avert to: the appearances of the disease there 208 described, and minutely repeat them, and we shall therefore content ourselves with adding such other points as are new, or more clearly developed. As there seems to be no variance of opinion as to the fact that the disease is not confined to any particular kind of <a name="potatoes82"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, we do not deem it necessary to dwell on that point, except barely to say that the Rohans and long reds appear to be perhaps the most exempt. It seems to be the fact, as will be observed by reference to the articles in the appendix, that the evil in some cases has not prevailed where it did the previous year; though in, many others it has done so even to a worse degree than before 1. As to the extent of range embraced in its appearance. To far as we can ascertain, it appears to have been observed further east, west, north, and south, than in the previous year. It has been noticed in the Britishddminions, both Canada and Nova Scotia; it is mentioned as having been experienced in I illinois, In diana, and Michigan, and as far down as the lower part of Ohio, in the stheouheastern part of the State. It may be, that the evil which is so characterized in some of these sections is nothing more than the common premature decay, produced by the ordinary atmospheric influences, as the accounts are not sufficiently definite to enable us to decide. Such seems to be the view taken by the editor of the Ohio Cultivator who, after giving a statement from the An dusky Democrat, sayscid127' We are inclined to think that the rot which our An dusky neighbor speaks of is not of the same kind as that which has for the past two years prevailed in some of the eastern States, and is now exciting so much alarm in most parts of Europe. *a* *a* *a* *a* <a name="potatoes83"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> often rot both before and after being dug, from other causes than this disease ; such as being killed by frost before maturity; an excess of wet, &c. And when buried in a heap they, not un frequently become heated and spoil, by being covered too deeply before the weather becomes cold." We regret that there has not been more care, as this fact, among others, has an important bearing on the subject, and such neglect impairs the general conclusions which may be drawn 2. The particular period of the season in which it has been noticed for the first time during the past year is earlier by a month nearly than in any of the accounts of the year before. Thus the Worcester (pass) Spy, in reference to this subject, says, early in July: The blight which caused such destruction to the <a name="potato67"><mark>potato</mark></a> last year has thus early commenced its ravages the present season. We have examined a field belonging to Governorlincoln, which we are assured exhibited a perfectly healthy appearance on the third instant. In the fifth, portions of the vines showed indications of disease ; and on the seventh, about half were more or less shrivelled many, of them shrunk to half their former dimensions, and some of the leaves already turned brown and nearly dry." Allowing this to be the same disease, this is an important fact. We are, however, left in some doubt as to this question, since the writer states that on opening one of the hills most effected, both the seed and the new set of <a name="potatoes84"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were sound and looked well. In the accounts given by Mr. L. Word, also, of Huntington, and E. Of Comply, New Work, the disease is said to have affected the vines on the4cid127thiof July. The account of Mr. B. P. Johnson is dated July 18, and, he says, "within the last few days." Were are three independent witnesses, living remote from each other, and communicating with different agricultural papers; and in this respect their testimony has not a little bearing on the subject, provided it was the disease; But as, in their statements, with. 209 the appearance of the vines simply; they do not connect the appearances exhibited with the tube r, except' a st to   o the probably result which they conjecture might have o taken place.

In close 'examination, lie 'he id find at the points natiehTa perfectly diry14210 decay of the stem; the with entirely gone; the cut ice also removed or dried to imperceptible thinness, and nothing is left but the ligne out fibres, white ned by disease, and sometimes separated laterally. This is the worst stage of the disease yet observed. The parts below this point are perfectly sound at present. In turning to other stems, indiscriminately, whose leaves and vines are apparently in the full vigor of health, we perceive the earliest encroachments of visible disease. Were we see a little dis colored patch ofcuticle, dried up and sunken to the ligne out fibres below, the parenchymatous matter among the cut ocular tissue having disappeared." In scraping away this dead cut ice, he states that the ligne out texture is still found to be living 1 but in the next plant that is also delayed; and in still another, we witness the destruction of half the with; and in another the with is all gone; and then we arrive at the last stage, or total rotten ness. In most instances, there are several such patches of cut ocular decay, of irregular figures, but there is a well defined line of separation between the dead and living parts. In sliding, length wise, one of the vines in which these spots of decay have penetrated into or through the with. he adds, " portions are found of solid, and apparently sound with, in the intervening portions of the stem- 4 In several instances, also" he says further, " the returning sap being interrupted in its descent by the cut ocular decay, formed small tubes (perfect <a name="potatoes86"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>) just above the diseased point, "there is no apparent erosion of the cut ice, but the idea is suggested of all the pulp y matter in it being abstracted, and the cut ocular film collapsing upon the parts beneath." "he may safely say upon these observations, that the disease undoubtedly commences on the exterior of the vines, and that the upward circulation is continued long after the downward current is partially or wholly: intercepted; that the; disease tends to penetrate: into, and not to pass along the vines ; the tops perishing only when no nourishment can be obtained from below. We have quoted the above description, not only on account of its being evidently that of a careful observer, but as giving the most minute account we have found this year of the, gradual development and progress of the disease. That the, vines bear some important relation to the early stages of the disease, would also appear from the statement of W. Bacon, of Mountosceola, who speaks of the evil as "first showing itself in a very small blotch on the side of the stalk, which continued to spread until it had gone round and through the stalk, when the last, at the particular point of the disease, became dry and hard, as though it had reached its maturity. The death of the top soon follows, but the lower part remains green for awhile He also found that in this stage of the disease, " mowing the tops prevented the evil i from being developed in the tubes." Mr. Dear ce, of Hamburg, also said to be an excellent and observing farmer, ' saw that his <a name="potato68"><mark>potato</mark></a> vines were affected, and pulled several hills to examine the roots. They were sound, and left separated from the stems or tops." "The <a name="potatoes87"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in all the adjoining hills were rotten at the time of harvest." The On. J. Mary, of Salem, N. Y., in the i ultimate r for April last, speaking of the appearance of the disease in 1844, sayscid127The first symptom of failure is in the s talks oft hi <a name="potato69"><mark>potato</mark></a>; they become dry, and the leaves turn black; the growth then ceases, and the <a name="potato70"><mark>potato</mark></a> becomes rotten before it is ripe. The fibres that connect the stalk with the <a name="potato71"><mark>potato</mark></a> quit their hold ; and when you grasp the stalk and pill l, with a view to raise the, <a name="potatoes88"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> out of the hill, the roots break and leave the <a name="potatoes89"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, or rather slip out of the hill without raising the pot. 2114atoes." M," likewise, of the In diana Farmer, says: "I discovered that the leaves of the tops (of one patch) of map <a name="potatoes90"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which extended horizontally, were dead. They had the appearance of having been frost bitten, and were of a dark brown color. I took no further notice of it until two days after, when; found the entire tops were in the same fix, though they had always kept their erect position." The notice respecting the first development of the disease in the field of Governor Lincoln, in Worcester, already given, will also be recollected as speaking of the vines and leaves as diseased, but the seed and sets sound. c" While" of Sort land, like w is e speaks of the first visible effect being noticed in a blight on the tops. At there is yet another stage, it would seem, in which the vines are not necessary. The experiment of E. G. Buxton shows this. He planted in the sprig a few <a name="potatoes91"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in some dry t an bark in a dark, dry place in his cellar. In examining them in October, he found a number of new <a name="potatoes92"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the size of a hens egg down to a mine, which exhibited the same appearances of rot and disease as did other diseased <a name="potatoes93"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The same fact is also stated to have been observed in Germany by On Martins, in 1842. (See his essay, translated and appended, among other foreign papers, to this report, in appendix No. 6.)I t is important for us to know the earliest indications of the disease before it is so diffused that it cannot be arrested. Means may then be more readily devised to chief it in its incident appearance, and thus this valuable crop be saved from the destructive ravages it now seems doomed to undergo. Would our farmers generally follow the example of Mr. Plummerin this respect, much i more information could be gleaned as to this point 4. As to the stage of the disease in which the tubes exhibit marks ofitsinflhence, the appearances do not vary much from what Was observed the previous year. Mr. J.  Weeks, of Salisbury, Vermont, speaks of it as in the form of a blister upon the skin; and it soon makes progress towards the heart or middle of the <a name="potato72"><mark>potato</mark></a>, forming, as the disease a advances, a kind of signs upon the surface of te tube r." In other cases, he says: It is not uncommon to trace the disease directly down. from i the talk in black streaks to the middle of the tube r." Mr. Freemnan, also, of Work, Maineesays (did 127) The first appearances of the rot are dirty yellowish 'spots, similar in appearance; to iron rust; it penetrates the <a name="potato73"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and, in a short time, turn to a dark color aid the work of destruction is finished. They appear to smell, and taste sila ri to a frost bitten <a name="potato74"><mark>potato</mark></a>." The editor of the Month l hi Sister, after quoting fire the Massachusetts Slough man a communication of the On. Ferri ll Allen: to the Old Colony Memorial, says" In the fail of 1844 , 'aft days before they were dug, the growth of the pott es; was arrested By th' sudden dying of the tops, which seemed to be, stricken     a z with he blight which frequently takes place at h earlier season. The vines- being thus killed, we dug there perhaps a fortnight earlier than we might otherwise, have done; and it' was observed, when they were dipped l of i the fir bed tat li to skin peeled off easily' M: . B: Johnson( To me, after first 'noticing the appearance of th type, &as' I omit~ instances, here the <a name="potatoes94"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been h dug, don c in tie open a small black spot i found in' the centre. I H others, the: <a name="potato75"><mark>potato</mark></a> appear sound and tiealthcid127' " N. N. D." in the Ciultivator of- fear- by, ailsospeatingt Of the crop r h of e previous year, says : "the rottencid127) <a name="potatoes95"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were full of long white worms arid 'sa the odor was intolerably foetid 'his, of course, vas at the most advanced period of the development of dieaseas212 a. Another fact observed is, that the tubes, when dug and stored away apparently sound, even when the crop while growing exhibited a generally healthy appearance, have rotted. The case has been mentioned in the public journals of a gentleman in the interior of Massachusetts, who sent several hundred bushels of <a name="potatoes96"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to Boston apparently sound and good, but which, soon after their arrival, he was requested to coli and take away, as they were decaying and most offensive; and out of 600 bushels he obtained 100 bushels of sound <a name="potatoes97"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. There seems to be no reason to doubt that the tubes may be found in very different states even in the same field, and sometimes also in the same hill, exhibiting a progress which, if more carefully observed, might aid in more accurately fixing upon the point where they might be used, or otherwise 4. As to the kinds of soil, locality, modes of culture, 4 c, there is still a diversity in the accounts furnished. These vary according to the various theories adopted by various individuals to account for the evil. To avert to some of the statements a) Soil, lord lily, Cloth old ground and new ground were tried by or. Bolt, of Paterson, New Jersey, and the new ground gave the best yield. The editor of the Monthly Sister says that, in the high grounds, in 1844,where the latest broken up pasture grounds have usually produced the best <a name="potatoes98"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the greater portion of the crop was lost more so than in other grounds. Mr. A. Robinson recommends light ground, which, he says, is so porous as not to retain the abundance of wet, &c. Mr. Rhodes says, respecting a crop in 1844: " One field was new land, very high and dry the other was older land, and moister. Very <a name="potato76"><mark>potato</mark></a> grown in the first field was sound ; but in the other, some were diseased. The next season 1845) one of the lower fields was again planted, using seed from the high ground. The summer was driver than in 1844, and the produce was all sound, as was that also on the adjacent green s ward, planted with the same seed. In part of the green s ward, planted with infected seed, more than half the crop was lost." He concludes that low moist localities are most obnoxious to its influence. Mr. lane mentions that where land descended towards the north, he found his crop much better than in other exposures. Mr. Hammond, of Bones ville, says, with reference to the crop of 1844, that( on dry cool lands, not rich in put re scent manures, the crop escaped." I twas observed by different persons in the New York Farmers' Club that <a name="potatoes99"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from a copper region, and also from an iron one, did well. It would be interesting to ascertain the geological condition of those particular regions where the disease has been the worst b) Culture, <c The use of sound tubes seems to be not always considered indispensable. Mr. Thompson, of Astoria, stated in the New Yorkfarmers' Club that he cut off the sound parts from diseased <a name="potatoes100"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of last year, and planted them with perfect success. To Mr. Down send, of Astoria, also planted from the diseased crop, and had <a name="potatoes101"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In most cases, however, it is stated that the seed was sound, though this did not always secure from disease. <a name="potatoes102"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> planted in manures that are rich and highlyputrescent appear to be most liable to the influence of the rot. Mr. Weeks, of Vermont, says: "by own observations, corroborated by the testimony of hundreds of others, show, very clearly, that when the land is manured with that kind of manure which is highly charged with ammonia, the malady is most fatal. There the same land was planted side by side, if manured with manure so rotted as to have lost its smell, very little disease is the. " s' _a_ .1 dub to si e v ti r- a. 213 found. Failure in a state of ferment at ion, when applied to the <a name="potato77"><mark>potato</mark></a> hill or i manure that 11 ferment, will be apt to en gender disease." He adds we: suffered greatly by the malady last year; this year we have taken a, different course in the preparation of our <a name="potato78"><mark>potato</mark></a> land. I instead of using any manure, we selected land that was highly dunged last year from the sheep pens and cattle stables, and was in corn. We ploughed twice, as usual, and plaited early in May, three feet apart both ways; we c it the p ta toes, and used as much lime as would stick without water. As soon as the plants were out of the ground sufficiently to live, we made a com post salt, reached ashes, lime, and plaster; incorporated the whole together, and, top dressed every hill with a table spoonfuls of the com post, and covered it i the hill at hoping; hold twice; then in July sowed salt broadcast, two bushels t the acre. The <a name="potatoes103"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were good." " While, "of Sort land, saysSPotatoes rot most where they come in contact most with mature. Manure coming i i immediate contact with the growing crop, by being put in the hill or spread upon the ground, forces its growth, especially of the tops, too fast." "I am apprehensive that maturing on the top of the ground, and in the hill, induces too much growth in the early part of the season." 1 a mt in ill ined to think that <a name="potatoes104"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> would do better, allithiiis considered, without any manure in the land. But should manure be applied, e. t it be ploughed ii to the depth of 15 or 16 inches, if possible." He also suggestsdilNl ing as useful. Mr. Anderson, of Chesterfield, New Hampshire, statesthLit he planted his seed as soon as the ground would admit of if, a   d manured them in the hill with well rotted manure ; planted the largest, and was careful to get none that were not sound; kept the ground free of weed still a human and dug them in the middle of October i they were good ;while his neighbors complain that their <a name="potatoes105"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were rotten, Mr. Robinson, after stating that nowhere had he found any rot on light soils, while an most soils highly manured it appears to have had great effect, adds: "his year I was so wary as to plant all light ground some s ward and some old ground all planted early; all manured lightly in the hill with com post manure, made from rich low ground, hauled into the yard after hay into mix with cattle manure, and hauled out in the fall. His kind of manure will not ferment. My crop this year is tolerably good, and all sound. It is found' that   the early planted better escape theft t an the late." Mr. Free an, of. Work, Marie, says: "' q But few if any escaped, except the army planted, and1ocid127) even these when planted on under me need manure, Mr. Micguffy, of Ohio, state is that he planted 2 patches of <a name="potatoes106"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of about i one-sixth to one fourth of an acre each. One of them was on land .on which cattle hadl1e6 fed or fattened with corn the fall previous, by which means it was highly `a` may   n red. ' In 'this land on le bushel of seed was planted, of the Mehainiock variety, cut into small pieces, and 3 or 4 pieces dropped into a hill, the hills 4 feet apart, and the ground well cultivated in summer' Theoptsgrew with great vigor, covering the whole ground, :and, owing to in; ne rains in auitimni they continued to grow until destroyed by the i of in autumn. ' The 6 crop was large, and the <a name="potatoes107"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of a very. fine amity." " The other piece of laid was planted with; 3 weeks l of the same kind of seed; :it no man ire had been applied, and less labor i wag bestowed in tilt i ration. The weeds were allowed to grow after wheat harvest, and the tips, which were much' less luxuriant than .the tops of the other piece, were all ripe arid dead be foie the frosts came. The yield was less by one half than in the other case." " Both of these lots of <a name="potatoes108"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were dug at21
the same time, and buried in the same manner, in trenches in the ground. In a few weeks it was discovered that those from the rich ground, and which had their tops destroyed by the frost, were beginning to rot. The disease spread to such an extent that it was doubtful if any of them would be saved. But those from the ground which had no manure, and where the tops ripened before the frost came, have not shown any symptoms of decay n two neighboring fields, in one of which the <a name="potatoes109"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were ripe before the frosts appeared, there were no signs of rot ; while in another, in which they were green until the frost killed them, they had nearly all rotted. Thehon. Mr. Mary states that those which were covered deep were as good as usual, and those with a shallow covering were useless. In a case stated by or. Hammond, of Bones ville, some <a name="potatoes110"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted where <a name="potatoes111"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had been buried the year before, and the straw used about them turned over for manure; they were more rotted than anywhere else. Some persons made use of lime, and the <a name="potatoes112"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted; others used lime, and had good <a name="potatoes113"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. New varieties as well as old were affected; and, in .the case of or. Box, a variety from the ball also were affected by the disease. <a name="potatoes114"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> whole and cut seem equally to have felt the effect of the evil. The letter of Mr. Phase, of Mala is, Paine, contains some interesting particulars, which deserve notice under this branch of the subject. It will be found with the other letters and statements already referred to in the appendix No. 5. He says: "some of my seed <a name="potatoes115"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> I cut, and put lime with them in the hill at planting ; some I planted whole, with lime; some cut and some whole ones without lime. Some seed I procured from a distance, and which was grown on an entirely different soil. In some of my compose manure I made use of a large quantity of potash. In all these cases the disease upon the <a name="potato79"><mark>potato</mark></a> was apparently the same; nor did the quantity or quality of the yield vary. The greatest difference was found in <a name="potatoes116"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted in different soils. In that soil which was stimulated most by manure, and especially by manure in the hill, the rot was the greatest. In dry loam y soil, the disease did not affect the <a name="potato80"><mark>potato</mark></a> so much. In wet land, and especially on wet clay land, the disease 'was the most fatal. It was observed that where lumps of clay lay so near the new grown <a name="potato81"><mark>potato</mark></a> as to touch it, the <a name="potato82"><mark>potato</mark></a> would be rotten on that side touched by the clay. The <a name="potatoes117"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which grew nearest the surface and nearest the stalk were also observed to be most rotten. Those soils on which the salt rock weed was used as a manure in great abundance, and where the influence of the salt water fogs was felt, were equally if not worse affected by the disease." The statements in the preceding letter are important, on account of the i rearing on the different suppositions which have been adopted respecting the nature of the disease and its desired remedy. Mr. Linger land, of Bethlehem, New Work, in a letter communicated to us, speaks thus of an experiment the past season. After mentioning that, in 1843, he sent to Long I s land for a particular kind of seed, and that they rotted worse than any he had before employed, he says: 'last year, 1845, I planted four acres more of the same kind of seed, and in the last of May 1 planted six acres more in the same kind of soil a sandy loam; the four acres planted early did not yield as much to the acre as the six acres I planted late, 'but the early planted were all good, with few exceptions; the late planted, one half of them rotted as soon as they were dug, and the other half were not fit for market. I had to feed them out to the cattle. I then made inquiry of my. 215 neighbors about their <a name="potatoes118"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and they told me that the ai fly planted were good and did not rat. The superintendent of the poor louse of this county planted thirty-five acres. He planted them all early, and he told me that they were all good. The late planted <a name="potatoes119"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were full of water when the frost came and killed the vines, and this caused them to rot; the early planted, when the frost came; were ripe, and no sap in the vine or in the <a name="potato83"><mark>potato</mark></a>. :he dug the early planted in the morning, D ad let them lay in the sun till night, and dry, then picked them up and put them in a dry place, and they kept good." One farmer was mentioned in the New Yorkfarmers' Club who is said to have pulled up twenty hills before they were fully ripe, and scraped away again the earth around the hills; the whole field rotted she the twenty hills 5. The influence of the season, so far as observed, deserves notice also in a collection of facts respecting the operation and progress of this evil. It is not necessary in this place to bring into consideration any particular theory as regards the relation the facts have to its proximal e or immediate cause. Our object is to record whatever may have been deemed of sufficient: importance to attract the notice. In general, we know that the season was very dry and hot during the month in which the growth of this plant usually takes place. Mr. Free man, of Work, Paine, under date of September 25, 1845, alluding to this subject of the weather, says : Last year the rot seized the <a name="potatoes120"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> about the last of August. It will be remembered that in this section of the State we had very warm weather, with frequent rains, about that time, and it invariably cleared off very warm ; when formerly, it generally came off cooler immediately after rains. This season has been the warmest for many years. The rains in this section commenced one month earlier than last year say the last of July and first of August consequently, the most of <a name="potatoes121"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, excepting those planted very early, and often early kind, were young and tender when these rains commenced. The soil being heated by many days and nights of sultry weather, actuallySscalded the <a name="potatoes122"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and but few, if any, escaped, excepting early planted, and not even these when planted on: un fermented manure. It will be remembered that, though we had frequent rains, they were not heavy ones barely enough to wet the manure in the hill, which doubtless caused them to rot more rapidly than if the rains had wet down deeper. It will also be remembered that the sun came out very hot after these rains, killing the vines of the <a name="potato84"><mark>potato</mark></a>, whilst the heat and wet under the surface were doing their work of destruction to the young and tender tube of r. A. Robinson says: " The past season has been one of great extremesofiheat, dryness, and moisture. I speak particularly of our vicinity, where the earth was so severely parched, wet, and dry, that we had nearly given up hopes of a crop. After a very heavy rain, it remained hot, while weal alternate extremes of heat and rain, which set the earth in great fermentationa state very injurious to some sorts of vegetation The editor of the Massachusetts Slough man, com rioting on Mr. Words communication, speaks also of the hot weather, arid says t: "'I t is certain that we have not had a warmer season for a long time r. It F. Kilburn, of Utter vale, Rugs t: 30, says: The season here from the middle of July up to the present time, has been uncomtmonlywrar and wet; whether this blight will be followed with disease in the root similartoGthat of late years, is a matter as yet alike undeterminable. Time, howe a will soon tell. It is to the feared that the rot will follow. <a name="potatoes123"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> in 16 in this vicinity, up to. within about 10 days or a fortnight, have looked very promising of a heavy crop." *6. The gathering and storing the <a name="potatoes124"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, with the circumstances which were observed at that period, are also worthy of some notice, so far as any thing peculiar is stated. We may, under this branch of the subject, again refer to the letter of G. F. Phase, of Mala is, Paine. He says: "one experiment I made, the result of which I think important. As the <a name="potatoes125"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were dug a part of them were put into barns, and a part put in i heaps of 50 bushels each on a dry part of the field, and covered first with straw, and then with dirt four or six inches deep, I left them here as long as it was safe on account of the frost. We found, on taking those from the barns to the cellar late in the fall, many of them had rotted, and others looked sickly i But those we took from the heaps in the field to the cellar, being the latest removed, were as bright and sound as when dug, except a few which had entirely rotted, and which we supposed had commence trotting before they were put into the heap or. Kilburn says: "he would caution r farmers not to be in too much haste to; harvest their <a name="potatoes126"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; the tops may be dead; the bottoms, by remaining the usual time in the ground, will be likely to improve. Besides, Am inclined to the opinion that by letting the <a name="potato85"><mark>potato</mark></a> remain in the ground till the proper time to dig, may, tend to make it keep better after it is dug The editor of the agricultural paper which contains this letter approves of the practice of letting the <a name="potatoes127"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> remain in the ground till they are fully ripe. Mr. Bacon, of Count Osceola, says: " In one case, a farmer dug a very few hills when the vines first showed symptoms of disease, and carefully buried them and let them remain until the usual time of digging, when they were taken out all to und, while most of his crop had suffered essentially. There can be no doubt that when <a name="potatoes128"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are dug so early as the rot came last year, they must be put in small bodies kept cool and excluded from the atmosphere. Their tendency to heat, and thus become. heavy and: in sip id, warrants us ;in this conclusion ; and so we infer that the letting them remain in hills with the tops taken off until the usual time of digging is a ,much cheaper and better way than to dig and put in cellars, or on floors i in pipes: ; Another course of proceeding which has come under our observation was adopted by some l irishmen, who had known this enemy to their favorite esch lent in 'the old country' When they saw the crop smitten, they dug it immediately, and piled the <a name="potatoes129"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on the surface of the ground, taking care to guard them from sunshine, till the job was completed, whenthrleyvered the pile entirely with l clay. The result was probably as they had, down it to be aforetirmetheir crop and the <a name="potatoes130"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of good quality. The ,ly undoubtedly acted as a twofold agent; kept them cool, and exclucid127il e the atmosphere and storms- The editor. of the Monthly is iter, speaking of the cop of 144, s' The top of the !ed was kept open, as far as it could be safe l y done, until, the approach- ofiseVere frost. He, are inclined t think: that thepotatoesSpeished in consequence of being taken out of the air perhaps a fortnight too soon." " u .belief i that the effects of the disease, which appeared. thee k ilii g of, the vines might have been avoided by keeping the <a name="potatoes131"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> i- the i grondaunticid127) the had been perfectly !ripened' : Another personsaysthcid127) part of his crop c were carried directly into theacellarand put in a barrel; the remainder were put upon a wood house floor, where they remained two or ,three days, till they were well dried; after which they were. 2 7 put in the cellar. Those which were first put into the cellar in a barcid127tdecayed entirely, while the others remained sound, and were good <a name="potatoes132"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for ;cooking 7. As to the point whether the disease is contagious or epidemic, x behave met with but little additional information. I instances are mentioned of states i if the same hill being partly sound and partly diseased; butt his would not absolutely prove anything, as, even in the case of contagiousdjsases, (admittedly so) it is not a necessary result that every person who is brought into contact with the person. diseased becomes affected. In general it happens, but not always. And so, even were the disease of the <a name="potato86"><mark>potato</mark></a> contagious, they might equally and independently be affected with the same general malady, but not of necessity borrowed of each other he question whether or not it is epidemic will be decided by different individuals, very much according to the theories which are adopted respecting, the origin :or source: 1 There are facts stated which are alleged' to be both for and :against the supposition. :8 .the views entertained respecting the origin of the evil are numerous, but may be included under three or four general divisions' Some new suggestions have been added to those before advanced. It is believed however, that in many cases accidental circumstances have been i il is taken: for essential particulars. Whatever cause may be supposed, there will necessarily be some modification of its appearances, produced by various extraneous influences; so that it is proper, as far as possible, to confine ourselves to what may be viewed as truly essential in ascertaining the nature of the influence by which the great evil has been caused a) The insect the dry has still its advocates. The existence of a worm is stated in the Sort hampton Courier, as observed by Dr. Stebbins, but the statement is too indefinite to fix it as the origin of the particular evil nowundericonsideratibn. To, the editor of thePittsfield paper speaks of: " apt ta ti vine to which was attached insects, and, on cutting i the stall k' a bug about one inch long was found in the centre of the sam, ;" but this obviously could not have been the general cause of the disease, for no such appearances are generally mentioned. Dr. See, the editor of the Geneseefarmer, likewise, it is stated in a public journal, has made examination aft he <a name="potato87"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop throughout central Her w Work, and finds in! all' the cases that the i curling and blight of the vines is attended by -an inisctT. The parent is probably the bee the. :I t punctures the ,vies just above the groundandideposites the egg in the filth of the stalk where it patches. -the larvae eat off ,ll the stalk 'but the outer bark, when the :vine withers and dies t 4isalsoJ added : Dr. See thin is that this prevents the ripe king of thetuobers: and di is poses; them into decay." We have not seen the statement of or. See himself, if it has been published in detail. It will be 'observedhweiver. that the description respecting the appearance of c thee stalk- corresponds very accurately with that mentioned, and which, i we had -already quoted by "J. By . P.,' (que re? Glimmer) in the In diana Artery &cal so those of W. Bacon and "E. B." .a. Another view: respecting the ,operation of insects in: causing th evil, is that which attributes it to the attack of a little 1 g . Thus Mr. Word says :his morning Iexamiinedsoine of my <a name="potatoes133"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and found some of the leaves of the top and stems dead, and many of them n wilted aldamong4hecid127j a little big about the size of the. cucumber bug with a shlidrp beak with which he was piercing the stem. In further examination, I found 218 . them on almost every hill; they were very active, and, by did gig or flying, would elude my grasp. Whenever they punctured the s term, it won  up seem to wither almost as soon as if broken off. Now my opinion is, that these, bugs, by puncturing the stem, drawing off the sap and perhaps poisoning it, are the cause of the disease; and the tops being thus affected before the <a name="potatoes134"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are ripe, causes the root to rot. In referring to Dr. Harriss report on the insects of Massachusetts, I find this kind of bug is the phytocoris lizeolaris, of the order called Hemiptera, and is described on the 161 st page." The editor of the Massachusetts Slough man, to whom the letter of For. Word was addressed, in July, 1845, says: We think it probable that insects contributed to the disease of the <a name="potato88"><mark>potato</mark></a> last year and the year before. The hot weather, also, contributed to increase the mischief and to encourage these insects. There may have been several causes conspiring to produce the effect that .was witnessed last September. It is certain we have not had a warmer one for a long time. Dr. Harris noticed this insect on the <a name="potato89"><mark>potato</mark></a> in 1838, when much mischief was done by it. We think it more philosophical to suppose that g rubs or insects are the cause of the blight in <a name="potatoes135"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, than suppose disease in the plant? :a. Respecting the insect above mentioned, Dr. Harris observes : It is mostoabundanttduring the months of June and July. It seems to be very generally diffused throughout the Union. The history of this species is yet imperfect. We know not where or when the eggs are laid; the young have not been observed, and the insects, during the early period of their existence, have escaped notice, and are only known to us after they have completed their final transformation she insect theory, in another form, is advocated by B. F. Wilbuir. He, have, three communications made by him to the Massachusetts Ploughmanone of August 26, another August 30, and yet another in October, 1845. In the first he says: "I have examined one or two pieces affected, and find the, right (if so it may be called) caused by an insect of the species a his, or plant louse; and so. rapid is the ravage in some fields, that the tops bear somewhat the appearance of having been fouched by the frost. Probably wherever the insect attacks, the tips will premature ly die. A gain, August 30, he says: " Naturalists have described numerous parasitic al insects, but among the mall I do 'not find a single description in the books which exactly answers to the a his of :the <a name="potato90"><mark>potato</mark></a> for so Shall term it. It is, however, so like the a his of other plants, that it cannot be mistaken as to its class. I have never seen any thing of the kind on <a name="potatoes136"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> before; others perhaps have." He thus describes it: "a( It is of a transparent green color varying in size from that of a tobacco seed to that of a duck shot, and the largest size have wings. ,a. They are generally found on the under side of the leaf wherever they: feed the blight shows itself, and the probability is that they extract the vegetable juice or sap, the loss of which to the plant causes the mischief. If only t the stem be attacked, the whole leaf withers and dies; remember when the blight struck my <a name="potato91"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in i 1838, the tops looked at that time very much as now. The bottoms, also, then were affected. But at that time f  did not think to look and see whether any insects preyed upon them anoci I .think it most likely, however, that they did. Last year I did not t -notice much that appeared like blight in my <a name="potato92"><mark>potato</mark></a>; field though the bottoms in spots were somewhat affected with the rot at harvest time. Whether ,this right will be: followed with disease in the roottiri
. 219 war to that of the last year, is a matter as yet undeterminable. It is to be feared that the to (will follow. 'again, in i October, Mr. Kilburn writes that he had been visiting some of the best farming towns in Piscataquis county, in Paine, and says: " I was at the trouble of examining several fields, and in every instance found heap his preying more ore less on the tops. The for, as apprehension was expressed in a former communication, has set in." -4 shall not attempt to theorise on the subject of this <a name="potato93"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease for so, I suppose, every body is agreed to call it though I am strongly of the opinion, that lice on the toss the sole cause of it. : t is very natural to suppose that a premature decay of the tops will have a or responding effect upon the bottoms writer who signs himself E. B, at Comply, New Work, also mentions, in a letter to the New York Tribune, quoted in the American Farmer, the appearance of insects, to which he attributes the cause of the <a name="potato94"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease. After stating that he had just observed a few tops of his <a name="potatoes137"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> beginning to wither and curl up, he ,says that he examined, the withered tops and soon found a green fly, about one-fourth of an inch in length, upon every top that had begun tu wither, and on most of them two ; some had four, and a few six. ' In one top I found four young flies, about half the size of the adult and on three others one each, about one-fourth grown. His insect, I thought, must be the cause of the disease, commonly called the curl top or <a name="potato95"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, since I found it on every diseased top in 30 or 40 cases; and, usually, on that part of the plant which had begun to wither, near the healthy part of the stem. In the stem of -one where there was a small global e of viscid transparent liquid the stem had begun to droop, but only so that it could scarcely be observed. Another global e, on the upper side of a curled leaf, on which a fly was sitting, was found to be sweet. Any of the leaves that were much wilted felt as if a g luminous liquid had been spread upon the upper surface." In almost every case two flies were found on the same plant, differing a little in size and color; the lesser being of a darker green, and the larger containing many eggs, which it appeared to be depositing. Only one egg was found in the stem of the plant, yet there were many places apparently stung upon the diseased stem, and the effect of this reached down, in, some cases, three or. fo fir inches into the heart of the stem." ' From the above observations, these conclusions appear to be evident: that the sting of this fly causes the curl top; that it breeds upon the stem, and the numerous progeny live upon the plant, sucking up its juices and its vitality." .a. The editor of the American, Farmer remarks; , We readily conclude that the green fly found on the <a name="potato96"><mark>potato</mark></a> vines, as above described, would affect the quality of the <a name="potatoes138"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, preventing them from arriving at maturity, and if left for any considerable length of time in the ground after the tops had begun to decay, would produce a second growth, by which the tubes would be rendered useless for cooking; but we doubt whether the fly here spoken of is the cause .of i th.general rot, which has been so prevalent' of late years." ' -the insect above mentioned seems to, correspond well, in most respects, with the genus a p hi, described by Dr. Harris, one species of which. is sal to be the probable cause of the blight in the p each tree. lie speaks of tetLejecting "a honeyed fluid' the result of their sucking up the sap of the plant which they attack. Dr. Camp n and Mr. Patillo, both in theCOultivaty, and Hilton Burri l, of Stcckbridge, mentioned in the Benningtonw220
gazette, also express their opinion in favor of the idea that insects are concerned in producing the disease. Whether or not these insects may be viewed as the case of the disease, it must be allowed that they are the cause, probably, of some of let effects observed. One of our correspondehtslluding to the insect theory, says: 'I t has not as yet been shown satisfactorily that at f y usual insect has made its appearance upon the potatobshatt have offered from the rot, and this cause can be considered as little it ore that a mere conjecture. There are, indeed, several insects that, in almost all seasons, it nest the <a name="potato97"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant more or less; but though. h wheniriustally present they may, to some extent, injure the goodness of the produce, either in quantity or quality, yet they have never been known to produce the decay h question, and it seems to me that I have seen thesesihsects far more :numerous in for her years than last years i) . A second opinion attributes the disease to a deficiency or excess ofmajttials for the progress or growth. We mean, by this general statement, to ten brace under this he aid those who find this deficiency or excess either in the o soil or in the pit to itself. Thus Mr. Thaw attributes the rot or rust to cutting the: seed, by which the skin is wounded and a perfect crop pre i rented. But, as the editor of the Paine Farmer says : '<a name="potatoes139"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have beencid127cut for long time without producing: the disease; and why should itOtlie s; therefore, suppose that the seed has become so deteriorated as to be panting in the requisites for producing a fair tube r or a full crop. But <a name="potatoes140"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the diseased crop ,have been planted, and no disease resulted." Writer in he Farmers' Cabinet, under the signature of Chietco, supposes the difficult ty to be in t the deficiency of an alkaline basis. He says: "I t is well k nobwhn that the substance forming the cells of all plants is a compound of fcarbonifetrous matter, with one or more alkalies; together with site k, c. It is also vell known : hat if the cellular matter is deficient in alba lift~ substances, &chit is comparatively weak and ut i able to contain therfitters deposited in it.

Unferryented manure is also ascribed, by s one, as the great cause of the evil; but: the fact is asserted, also that the rot he prevailed where this condition did not exist. Excess of moisture is said o be the origin by i G. 8."' of Pendleton county, South Carolina in the Cultivator of May, 1845, page for. ice thinks that a superabundance of sap collects in the <a name="potato101"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and that this fact w word be seen by cutting the tops, and that much water would be found to have discharged from th standing stumps. But as this is mere conjecture, and no particular experiment is brought forward to sustain it, it is unnecessary to do more than mention it c) The influence of the atmosphere is still insisted on by some. The advocates of this theory do not precisely define the limits .which they would assign to the supposed cause. Mr. F seem an, of Work, in his letter to theBostbn Caltivator of September 25, seems to adopt this view. After averting to the fact that in the previous year the rot appeared about the last of Tu gist; which he attributed to the very wa F p iowa the, with frequent, but not he ay rains, which :invariably cleared ff ,very won i. h Fly S: His season has bee i the wcid127armest fo. r many years; the rain is it is section commenced one month e earlier that i last year' say the last of July or the 1st of August; consequent l y the i most of the <a name="potatoes141"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, save those planted very early aid of an early kind, were young and tender when these rains commended i "the days and nights being very warm, thus greatly in j red as he supposes, "1 the plants, the rains being barely enough to wet t the manure it the hills; and the sun came out hot, killing the vines, while the the at and wet were destroying the young and tender plant or tube r." Mr. Weeks, of Salisbury: Vermont, also, in the Cultivate of September 1, gives his history on the action of the atmosphere as follows : " I am inclined to believe that the disease is caused by the atmosphere, chiefly operating on th( ,earth in such a manner as to obstruct its natural circulation of sap, which prevents excavations of the giant, a and de ranges natures perfect operations by preventing the escape of the excess of am empia which aceuntilates in the hill, and is held there in a state of unnatural confinement bite did ease of the stalk and the crust which forms upon the surface of the ground, which makes the hill nearly air tight. The ammonia in the hill eiennders disease, which usually, under these circumstances, makes its appearance in the form of a blister upon the skin. In other cases the ground appears to crack near the root of the vine, so that the ammonia escapes so rapidly that the vine is killed at once" ,c. As reasons to support his vie w, he alleges, first, on the observation both of himself; and i hundreds of others, that "where the land is manured with th tat kind of manure that is highly charged with ammonia: the malady is most fatal. Secondly, where the same land, side by sides is manured with manure so route as to have it smell, very title disease is found.  Thirdly, the hardiestvarities of <a name="potatoes142"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not so liable to the disease as those which are more, te i dr e and feeble. Horribly, that kind f of com post possessing no smell of ammonia will in vigor ate the stalk and elude the disease."

M.; of the 222 a. In diana Farmer, after mentioning the appearance of the tops of the <a name="potatoes143"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, (already quoted above) says: "-I attributed it to too much wet, as they were situated where the water (when it falls copious ly, as it has of late) stands for some time after falling? Mr. Lodge, also, in a letter read in the New York Farmers' Club, says : Our seasons vary sometimes very hot and dry, followed by heavy fresh its and floods. Hands thus drenched, and not drained by proper deepening, and breaking the hard pan, must suffer, and will inevitably cause curl in the leaf, premature its growth, and stop the progress of the tubes, and in this tender state disease will follow." Mr. Down send, of Astoria, in the same meeting, said : " I believe that this disease is owing to the seasons." Judge An Back, also, in the same club, said : "climate and seasons no doubt aggravate the disease. I found it existing three years ago on my farm in New Jersey, in a wet season ; and in the next season, which was dry, worse still. This last season, which was very dry, the rot was worse yet. The editor of the American Farmer, remarking upon the views of "E. 1." relating to insects, says: " We incline to the belief that the rot is to be attributed generally to atmospheric influences, an undue or premature spring like weather in early fall, causing the <a name="potatoes144"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are at a vigorous growth, though mot fully matured or perfected, to begin to shoot or to grow, in manner as though they had been planted for the purpose. This premature process ferments the tubes to anincipient state of decomposition; and hence the withering of the vines, and the Ccid127nseqnient deter i oration of the crop." He states, also, that the same idea was thrown out by Mr. Owen, of Count Airy. in his report of crops in 1843, published May 29, 1844, in the American Farmer. A. Robinson, in the Boston Cultivator of December 20, 1845, seems disposed to adopt the theory which explains the disease from the influence of the weather, &c. He says: " In the first place we know that the <a name="potato103"><mark>potato</mark></a> isa tender plant, and cannot withstand a great deal of hardship; we know, too, that the past season has been one of great extremes of heat, dryness, and moisture, and consequently un propitious for the <a name="potatoes145"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I speak particularly of our vicinity, where the earth was so severely parched, wet, and dry, that we had nearly given up all hopes of a crop. After a very heavy rain it remained hot, while we had alternate extremes of heat and rain which set the earth in a great ferrtentation, a state very injurious to some sorts of vegetation r." Or Sole, of the Boston Cultivator, in a late agricultural meeting in Boston, (says the New England Farmer) thought the rot should be ascribed chiefly to atmospheric influence. He said that apples of various kinds had been affected in the same way. Jewetts fine red he had known for thirty years, and he had never seen it s ou ch affected with rot as in r the last autumn. the thought the atmosphere might affect various kinds of fruit, in the is me way as it affects the potatoFronimthe above views it will be seen that the opinion of an atmospheric o influence is one which has some, who are both scientific and practical i men, in its favor. I here i sot, indeed, at n agreement as to the man herr in which the action of the atmosphere affects the result; but much is in n doubted      y attributedd by many to this s a great general cause of the evil under bonsideiratin. In if it be not viewed as A ' xi mate cause, it would be viewed by somrieas a n more ultimate o in. Fiat such a feet would need a series of I observations for more than' tver three years to if b br a satisfactory conclusion since coincidence : right exist for two or three seasons without there being any thing of the nature of cause and effect, if we consider the words to
22Ximply origin at ion, or anything else than the relation of simple antecedent, and consequentd) The fungus theory is probably, on the whole, the favorite one among those who have written on the subject in our country. It will be recollected that in the last report two letters were given of Mr. Teschemacher, of Boston, advocating this view. We heart i that he still maintains the same opinion. In his letter to the New England Farmer, under date of November 9 last, he says: "the fungus that I have seen vegetables on and thickens the sides of the cells of which the <a name="potato104"><mark>potato</mark></a> is composed, which cells contain the grains of starch The starch is not injured until the sides of the cells rotted by the fungus burst; the worms or maggots breed, and the whole: finally becomes a mass of putrid it y, with an offensive finguslikesmell." He also fortified his views by a reference to those of Professor Dorr en, ,f the University of Siege, and which will be averted to when we come to the consideration of the disease as it has prevailed abroad. In a letter also received at this office from Mr. Teschemacher, which will be found in the appendix among other papers, he also considers the views adopted by the British professors, and urges the following objections against the atmospheric theory, which attributes the disease to the cold uncongenial weather. He says: " But quite decisive objections to this view are, 1st. That we have had a warm and dry summer on this side of the Atlantic, with more than a usual proportion of sunshine, and yet the disease has spread with equal fatal it here. 2d. That they have had many such wet, cloudy, and cold s u me mrs before in Europe, without the appearance of this peculiar disease in the <a name="potato105"><mark>potato</mark></a>. It is clear, therefore, that this so called atmospheric influence is merely a name, without any distinct tangible meaning; and the evil of accounting for the disease by a mere name, such as an epidemic or atmospheric influence is to stop all further inquiry and investigation either into the cause or remedy. If the <a name="seeds11"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of thefTungi were not there, the atmospheric influence could not cause them to ve get ate; and if, knowing the nature of these, flung i, we can destroy them Or prevent them from i (cid127egetating, there is an ;nd of the disease. Again: That the disease, has increased n immensely since 1844, gives a very :strong and: natural presumption that it arises from the rapid and more .widely diffused propagation of a vegetable fungus, the <a name="seeds12"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of which, (spores) according to Professormoriren, are generated in inconceivable numbers." " That there are peculiar circumstances which favor the rapid propagation of particular hung i is certain. and equally certain r that there must be circumstances un favorable to it; and it is to the study and production of these unfavorable circumstances that we have to look for remedies." The writer in the Farmers Cabinet, close views we have already quoted as being that the disease is attributabletothedeficiency of an alkaline base. has also a paper in the same journal, in which he attempts to show that, if the fungus the or be admitted, his views are still correct, inasmuch as he claims: that :the cause of fungus :the sane defect of alkaline substances. He says : A chemical analysis of .theptlantsof thefurigi tribe will show that they contain an extremely small proportion of atlalilmaller than any other class of vegetables- Upon whatever spot of groqidthe tug It make their appear ace, there is a want, of all ali' -c. Others .are also strongly if the op ion that the evil is of fungus origin, but, as they p fe r nothing acid127ewit -is u necessary to ad vert to their opinions. It may perhaps be inquired, if the disease is fungus, whether, after all, there must not be -something peculiar in the season, or the soil, or cond i 24: Dec. No. 140 it ion of the seed, to account for the fact that it should appear so strikingly, just at this time; and, therefore, if the fungus theory is admitted, whether we have pressed the investigation as far as we may, having arrived only at a proximal e cause, while the cause of this fungus may deserve a further examination. Mr. Member, of Charles town, N. H., remarks, in his letter to the office, speaking of the fungus theory, "A supposition: of this kind has heretofore been made in this country; but it seems possible that this maybe :merely a mistake of the effect for the cause. Decaying vegetables are almost uniformly the prey of parasitic or fungus growths. In the economy of Providence, it seems to be a law that there shall be no waste, and that, wherever there is nourishment, there shall be life to consume it and be supported by it, and that the decay of one race shall afford aliment to others. I hardly ever saw a rotten <a name="potato106"><mark>potato</mark></a>, without noticing a fungus growth upon it; and <a name="potatoes146"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that have rotted in low lands or in the cellar, from becoming water soaked, presented no obvious appearance to the eye different from those that delayed in the manner under consideration; fungus growth was equally evident in both; Still, the supposition may be true; but other and different observations are wanted to establish it. The death of plants is, indeed, often seemingly, and sometimes probably really, owing to the attacks of insects and parasites; but there seems to be no good reason to suppose that the vegetable kingdom may not be subject to diseases as well as the animal, though the ad varices made in the study of vegetable physiologyhcid127ve not as yet made us acquainted with them; and the investigation of the subject is by no means as easy. There so little is known, changes that are apparent are, by the prevailing disposition of the human mind to assign a cause for everything, laid hold of as causes, though they may be but coincidences, concomitants, or even results ; nd thus the appearance of parasites, whether of an insect or vegetable nature, upon a decaying plant or tree, is apt to be considered the cause, when; perhaps, they make their appearance only because the tree or plant is unhealthy; and perhaps, at any rate, deriving so much of their nourishment, as plants do, from the atmosphere, and the influences of light, heat, and electricity. In modifying and directing what may be considered their vital actions, it would seem strange if they should not be liable to suffer at times severely from sudden changes of atmospheric influence; and, where so widely spread a destruction as the one in question has taken place, till something more definite can reasonably and philosophically be shown as a probable cause, it would seem as well to look at some such change as the real cause. Such, indeed, has been the opinion of many; though of the precise nature of that change they are ignorant, "the above remarks, we i think, are entitled to attention, and the views expressed coincide much with those c we are disposed to entertain in relation to the subject under consideration 9. The; great practical question, however, is, What is the best remedy for the wide spread evil? To far as the knowledge of the cause may aid to suggest the remedy, it is desirable to know respecting its origin. But a remedy may oft times be found by experiment, even allowing that the tried theory of the source of the evil is still unknown. Most of the remedies however, correspond with some of the views as they have been given above. In some instances, the same remedy having been found efficacious by the advocates of opposite theories, its fitness is accounted for so as to favor their own peculiar views. :there is some considerable diversity, also, respecting the actual utility of Doc. To, 140. 225 substances supposed to counteract the origin or progress of the disease. Some persons, in one set of circumstances, have tried a remedy and recommended it as sure. Another, however, informs the public that it will not answer. This diversity, it is probable, might often be accounted for by the different condition of the soil, the crop, or the season, &c, in which the experiments are made. We shall pursue the same course we have adopted above, and present the various suggestions which have been made, referring as before to the appendix No. 5, where the papers from which we draw our quotations may usually be found. The advocates of the insect theory recommend a number of articles to prevent or remedy the evil. The editor of the Boston Cultivator, alluding to the opinion of Mr. Burri l of Stock bridge, says: " We have understood that house ashes spread on the hills around the vines after they have grown a few inches from the ground, is not only a remedy for the blight, but greatly facilitates the growth of the <a name="potato107"><mark>potato</mark></a> on some soils." " E. B. " of Comply, whose statement has already been given, speaking of the vines, says: "isa remedy, I cut off the diseased part and destroyed all the flies I could. About 10 o clock I sprinkled soap sums upon one small patch, and no flies were found upon it at night, though many were found upon another piece that had not been showered. An hour before sunset I sprinkled the sums left from washing upon the whole." Dr. Stebbins to guard against the insects he discovered, sprinkled his vines with tobacco liquid, and found it to be an effectual remedy. Mr. Patillo advises the use of sulphur. Those who attribute the disease to any excess or defect of any chemical element, of course recommend the supply or withdrawal of that substance or constituent part. Thus Mr. Or oft, who imputes the disease to the want of a sufficient alkaline base, recommends the use of potash, or some other all ali. He says that " an all ali will cure the rot in <a name="potatoes147"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in two ways first by strengthening the cellular tissue, thus preventing the rupturing and consequent dis organizing of the <a name="potato108"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which would result in decay and death and, secondly, by neutralising the carbonic acid, and thus destroying their infectious principle." He also alludes to experiments made by Mr. Teschermacher and others, and says, in his letter to this office: " I f, therefore, potash be not present in sufficient quantities, we may reasonably expect that the <a name="potato109"><mark>potato</mark></a> will be impeded in its growth, if, indeed, that growth is not totally arrested; if, while the growth is impeded, the supply of carbonic acid be great, and the <a name="potato110"><mark>potato</mark></a> has an opportunity of absorbing it, such carbonic acid, by its infectious properties, will disease the <a name="potatoes148"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, (even if there be a comparative drought at the time) and such disease, if it be not checked, will destroy the <a name="potato111"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Carbonic acid loses this infectious property when it becomes a salt by union with an all ali, and is then rather beneficial than injurious; for if that all ali be potash, the <a name="potato112"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant will assimilate both the potash and the carbonic acid; and, other conditions being equal, the result will be a large and' healthy growth." " The foregoing remark i, "he adds, "would lead us to suppose that, by supplying the alkalies insufficient quantities, we should at least save our <a name="potatoes149"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the rot He then alludes to numerous cases which he quotes from the last report of this office, in which the use of lime, ashes, plaster, &c, is mentioned as having been of great advantage, and claims that his view is thus abundantly sustained by actual experiment. It is unnecessary to do more than refer to the letter itself, in the appendix, for the further elucidation15226 of his views, and the action of the remedy he proposes. His arguments must be allowed to be ingenious, and perhaps plausible. For the same reason, averting to the fungus theory and his own view of hung i, as caused by a deficiency of alkalies, he says: "the hung i being composed principally of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, feed upon carbonic acid and water chiefly; and, consequently, if lime or potash be added to the soil where they grow, and the carbonic acid be thereby changed into a salt, the hung i have nothing to feed on, and do not attack the <a name="potato113"><mark>potato</mark></a>. In the other hand, when there is not sufficient all ali given to the <a name="potato114"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop to cause the carbonic acid in the <a name="potato115"><mark>potato</mark></a>, is in its own form of carbonic acid, and as such the sickly root offers the proper food for the hung i, and it avails itself of it then unfortunately for doing so, it brings down upon itself the charge of being the cause of the <a name="potato116"><mark>potato</mark></a> diseaseAMr. Weeks i who holds that the disease is caused by the excess of ammonia being prevented from escaping, urges that " some com post or other substance should be used which will strengthen the stalk, and enable it to elaborate the sap and convey back from the air to the root nutritiveelements, so necessary to the hill, in order to preserve the tubes the rete have already quoted the course he adopted in his experiments, which proved successful, of using differently manured land, together with lime and afterwards, when the plants were out of the ground, salt, unleashed ashes, lime, plaster, &c. Sphilo" of Sort land, also believes the disease to come " from an over action in some part of the plant, and a minor action in some other part. And it is very evident that the roots cannot penetrate the hard, unbroken stratum, to obtain moisture." He advises deep sloughing, so that there may be depth enough of earth to allow the descending roots to gather moisture through the season, to act in concert with other roots and the leaves, thereby preserving a healthy state of the plant. The theory suggested by " G. S." of Pendleton county, S. C., in theCultivator, of the too great moisture in the tops, is also accompanied by the: advice to cut off the tops near the ground, as the appropriate remedy. Another person likewise recommends the cutting off the tops to preserve the tubes before the disease has passed to them from the vines. The following is the view lately communicated to the New York Farmers' Club, by Nathaniel Hands, of New Windsor, Range county, Newyork. He says: " I have found that by planting <a name="potatoes150"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as early as possible, I have good crops. The tops perished in August. I let the <a name="potatoes151"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> lie in the hills till September, and they were perfectly sound. I have seen some disposed to decay, upon which I put lime, and these were saved from further rot. A neighbor of mine had a pond, from which he let the water flow: upon his <a name="potato117"><mark>potato</mark></a> field in dry weather. For ten years past he has always had sound <a name="potatoes152"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>." To prove the efficacy of this watering of his <a name="potatoes153"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> he had another field which was left dry, and there his <a name="potatoes154"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted. " The tops of my <a name="potatoes155"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> totally did in August, but the <a name="potatoes156"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> kept well in their hills till dug in September. What I call late planting, is late in June. I do not let my planted <a name="potatoes157"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> be in immediate contact with the manure in the hills. I find that when rain comes and s oaks through the soil and manure, the <a name="potatoes158"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> do better than. when in close contact with the manure writer in the Sang or Courier, who writes over the signature of " Aglenburn Farmer" who supposes that the <a name="potato118"><mark>potato</mark></a> had no internal disease, a. 2 but was made to rot by an external influence which he says wasfernentation, recommends the drying of the <a name="potatoes159"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by exposure to the air and sun; &c, as a mode of preventing the spread of the disease. The editor of the Paine Farmer, however, controversy this view, and alleges that if exposed to the sun and air, the tubes will become watery, waxy, and acrid of taste. His view is, that they should be st owed away, with as much sand or soil among them as could conveniently be done. In the last report mention was made of lime and plaster, ashes and salt, as remedies approved by some persons. We find instances of these a shaving resulted favorably in the different agricultural journals. Mr. Teschemacher, in his t: letter of the 19th of November last, in the New England Farmer, again recommends it. He says : ' I think that salt, lime, and several chemical compounds, will destroy the disease. I prefer salt, because, when mixed in the soil, it may get into the juices and circulate through the whole plant. Time or lime water would do the same to a certain extent, but it is far less so ruble than salt." He then averts to the fact that salt has been used, and near the seashore, without effect, which he supposes may arise from there not being a sufficiency of saline matter in the sea weed used, &c. In his letter to the office, already referred to, (and for which see the appendix) he enters more fully into the question. He says: "the truth, as respects the application. to <a name="potatoes160"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> dug is probably that if the disease is already under the skin the salt cannot penetrate, and then, unless the bring were very strong, the moisture of the solution may accelerate the progress; but I do not believe that an en entirely un painted <a name="potato119"><mark>potato</mark></a>, if covered with a strong bring solution, will ever receive the disease. The instances where salt has been used in the boil, and the <a name="potatoes161"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have escaped, are not un frequent. After numerous inquiries, I have heard but one solitary exception, where six bushels to the acre had been harrowed in, the <a name="potatoes162"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had the rot the same as those without salt. I admit that this alone would be fatal to the virtue of the remedy, were it not for one circumstance. I found; on inquiry, that the soil was the stiff est and t most unyielding clay, and into this water cannot freely penetrate, much less later thickened i with salt; the experiment, therefore, doesn it prove the use of salt, for, in every probability; it was washed from the surface, or never penetrated to the roots of the <a name="potato120"><mark>potato</mark></a>." There a e- several instances, he adds, " in which the application of chlorine gas has clearly destroyed the disease; but this application on a large scale is impossible, and besides, is liable to very dangerous and fatal accidents; but salt is a mixture of chlorine and soda." " Unslacked lime will also destroy this fungus, and must, therefore, be a most excellent addition to the soil, with salt; but lime is not so easily caused to circulate in the juices, except a slime water When the acids in the plant would quickly sat urate it and change its nature ; in addition to which, it attracts carbonic acid from the atmosphere, and becomes a carbonate of lime, in which state its powers a on hung i are very questionable With reference to the preparation, &c, of the next years crop, Mr. Teschemacher further says: " I have given much study and reflection to the subject, and the result his the following recommendation: Met the <a name="potatoes163"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> n intended to bepliantedi be selected with the greatest e are, with thepastidousi looking i sposiwhichi are often not larger than the head of a pinpmwdecid127tl them over liberally with fresh quick lime, and keep them as warm and as dry as possible. It is, however, indispensable that the warmth be 228 a dry heat. The spot for planting should be a good loam y virgin soil, or a spot that has not been broken up for years, and as dry and well drained as can be had. To not use any manure, but put in gun no if so minded, as it is not possible that the <a name="seeds13"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the fungus can exist in it, whereas manure may be a fertile source of them. Must before planting, plough both lime and salt into the land, then steep the tube r in a strong solution of bring, to which a little blue stone (sulphate of copper) may. be added, and commit them to the soil. I have not said anything respecting the, quantity, as this must depend on the soil he may add here some instances in which salt, lime, &c, have been said to be used, and the effects of them. In the Ohio Cultivator it is stated, from the Akron Democrat, that the Rev. Mr. White, of that place, on removing some <a name="potatoes164"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, filled two barrels, one of which had been used for flour and the other for salt, from the same heap and put them side by side, covered with the same boards. After some time those in the salt barrel were found to be perfectly sound, while those in the flour barrel were all, or nearly all, rotten. "his" says the Ohio Cultivator" would go to prove what has before been asserted, that salt, in some cases at least, is beneficial in preserving <a name="potatoes165"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the rot after harvesting. Time also has been found useful for this purpose; but more experiments, are needed with both before the question of their utility can be fully settled." Again: ,a" Time the medicine for <a name="potatoes166"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> Two fields of <a name="potatoes167"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, side by side, in this village, one dressed with t an yard manure, in which was considerable lime, received no blight or rot. In the other field, with, common barn yard manure, the tops were "early b lighted, and a considerable portion of the <a name="potatoes168"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted Brunswick (he) Pioneer. In the New York Farmers' Club, of September 2, 1845, Mr. Thompson, of Astoria, says: "I used lime freely on my <a name="potatoes169"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and they rotted or. Fleet said: " I have remarked many experiments made with lime some good and others bad." As the <a name="potato121"><mark>potato</mark></a> is an exhausting plant, he did not understand why the second crop should have been larger than the first; but, on looking at the analysis of the <a name="potato122"><mark>potato</mark></a>, thinks it is attribute able to the salt and believed, further, that 20 bushels of unleashed ashes to the acre would have increased his crop to 600 bushels per acre. The analysis of the <a name="potato123"><mark>potato</mark></a>, as he quotes it from Professor Johnson, is as follows boots. Tops. Total. Not ah -805 327.3 407.8.

There was very little difference in the result rather in favor of bone dust and gun no. There was no rot. In new ground I made use of salt, ashes, and plaster; and on this ground I had, the best <a name="potatoes170"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, but no rot in either. From this I came perhaps to the wrong conclusion, that salt, lime, and plaster of Paris will prevent therotcid127) Mr. Hammond, of Bones ville, in the April number of the Cultivator for 1845, says: " Time has been. said to be a preventive of rot. I proved not to be so in this case. Some coarse lime had been spread on apart of the field. Some hills, where the lime happened to be scattered, were particularly examined, and found to be much more rotted than where nothing was put. Plaster was used in most of the crop. Two rows were left through the field without plaster. To difference could be discovered between these and other rows in the condition of the <a name="potatoes171"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>." E. V. N, Box, of Lafayette, in One ida county, New Work, in the February number of the Cultivator, says, in reference to the use of salt for the <a name="potato124"><mark>potato</mark></a> c crop: "' Three years ago I had a field in excellent heart planted with <a name="potatoes172"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which gave an excellent crop, averaging 300 bushels to the acre. The next year it so happened that it became necessary to plant the same field with <a name="potatoes173"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, but I feared lest the worms should destroy the crop, as they appeared quite numerous at the first digging ; but I proposed to remedy this by sowing salt, which I did about a fortnight before planting, at the rate of a barrel per acre." He states that he supposed the salt would kill the worm, but it did not. The crop, however, on digging, gave 420 bushels to the acre far beyond his expectations. The experiments of Colonel Clark, as stated by him to the New Yorkfarmers' Club, and also in his letter to this office, deserve notice, as showing the success of the remedies he adopted for the diseased <a name="potato125"><mark>potato</mark></a>. He says that he selected a lot which had been rejected us unfit for use. These he divided into 3 parcels. " No. 1 was subjected for 12 hours to a weak solution of chloride of lime; No. 2 to a saturated solution of recently burned lime, (quick lime) No. 3, in a moist state, was sprinkled over with quick lime, waters lacked to dryness. ,most and 2, after being thus treated, were spread on a brick hearth, and No. 3 was suffered to remain covered partially with dry caustic lime, and all of them so suffered to remain for 6 weeks when they were examined, and the disease found to have been wholly arrested. The <a name="potatoes174"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in Los. I and 3 were somewhat shrunk, probably from the too caustic treatment which they had received ; but No. 2, or that which had been stepped for 12 hours in lime water, were plump and good, and where the diseased portions or blotches came off with the mind." " The parcel from which he took the <a name="potatoes175"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on which he experimented" he says, "continued to perish, and were finally thrown away as worthless." He adds : "exposure to the atmosphere, in a dry place, may have had a beneficial effect; but as the disease is, beyond doubt, occasioned by f run ri of a very delicate texture, these were destroyed or de composed by the acrid substances to which they were exposed. If mistaken in the character of the disease, and it should ultimately be found to result: from the depredations of animalculae, the cure may be ascribed to the same cause. The results of ray experiments induce me to believe that the absence of a sufficient quantity of limestone (carbonate or phosphates of lime) in soils, is the cause of the disease in the <a name="potato126"><mark>potato</mark></a>. If it be owing to other cause or, causes, the remedy indicated it seems to me, is the free use of lime water made from lines lacked to: dryness, or of un bleached ashes, at the planting or' first dressing season of the <a name="potato127"><mark>potato</mark></a> ; and I suggest to farmers, who may have been sufferers from this widespread pestilence in their crops, to try whether a 230 Doc. No140judicious use of these materials may not prove, a corrective for or a prevention of this disease he have thus presented the substance of the accounts before us, as relates to the appearance of the <a name="potato128"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of our country, and the views entertained respecting the cause and remedy of the so called <a name="potato129"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot. We do not feel sufficiently satisfied, from this examination, to offer any decided opinion as to the cause or origin of the evil. There are, however, some deductions which we think we are authorized to make, and which may serve to embody the results of our somewhat extended consideration of the foregoing particulars 1st. That all the detailed 'appearances cannot be considered as legitimate effects of any one cause 2d. That many of them are merely accidental, and that their presence or absence would prove nothing as to the nature of the cause of that evil with which they are associated. 3d. That we have reason to believe that the cause itself, and its mode of development, have often been confounded together, or mistaken one for the other 4th. That there is great reason to doubt whether the immediate effects of the latent cause have been so far subject of observation, that an accurate and sure opinion can be formed respecting it 5th. That, whatever be the cause, there are different stages of its development degrees of its power; and that these depend on a variety of adaptations in the circumstances of the crop 6th. That the rapidity of development also corresponds with the aid derived from extraneous circumstances; and hence some, if not all of the evil results, may be remedied 7th. That it is doubtful whether any remedy suggested has been sufficiently tried to enable us to pronounce it a certain or sure one 8th. That it is important to study more accurately the influence of soil, seed, culture, temperature, and condition of the atmosphere on this crop and that it is only by a series of careful and discriminating observations that we can clearly decide on the probable origin and most fitting remedy 9th. That many of the preventives or checks recommended have in their favor so good proof of a degree of efficacy, that, till better are discovered, they may be safely adopted, suitable regard being had to the similar or different circumstances of their application. We believe there has been, as usual, injury sustained to the <a name="potato130"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of the United States by the prevalence of ordinary and common causes, such as must be expected, more or less, every year. We do not doubt, also, that there has been an extraordinary loss of this valuable product; but whether it be owing to some before known cause, which, from the peculiarity of the season or some unknown circumstances, has exerted an unusual influence, and thus a new development, or to some hitherto un experienced cause till within a short period past, we cannot say. Whatever it is, its progress is not yet fully traced, and it is only till more light shall be shed on the subject that we can confidently pronounce in favor of any one theory; and it seems probable that there is a combination of the views that have been suggested necessary, in order to account for its various phases, as we cannot resolve all the great features into one, entirely independent of all others. I to happens, however, that we have it in our power to make a comparison as to the aspect of the evil among ourselves, and in those countries where it has prevailed. a. 231 lie prevalence of the evil in Great Britain and on parts of the continent, during the past season, has led to numerous statements or accounts respecting the appearance of the vines and the tubes, and occasioned considerable diversity of sentiment even among the learned and scientific, a swell as the simple practical farmer, respecting the origin and cause, and the best method of treating it. The supposed causes, however, are much less in number than in our country, at least so far as we have been able to ascertain them. We have seen scarcely any attempt to trace the evil to insects; but nearly all writers seem either to consider it atmospheric, from over cultivation, deter i oration, or fungus. I tis called by a variety of names, as the <a name="potato131"><mark>potato</mark></a> blight, rot, disease, gangrene, cholera, murray in, &c. Theiusual name is the blight or rot. The appearances of the vine and the tube rare generally described in very similar terms, and these correspond nearly to the same already heretofore given in this country. It seems to be thought that traces of it have been heretofore seen in some places, but these were not sufficient to excite particular notice till within the last season. The earliest mention we find of its appearance in our English periodic cals was in the I s le of Right, and the I s le of Jersey. This was about the 11th or 12th of August last; and perhaps somewhat earlier, for we find some difficulty in fixing its precise date. It is noticed by a correspondent from the, I s le of Right, but with no date of time, in the London Gardeners Chronicle of August 16; another from the I s le of Jersey, in the same paper, of August 23; and also by another in the I s le of Guernsey, in the dark Lane Express, of August 25, 1845. From the southern part of England, it rapidly passed through He von, Cornwall Sussex, and Norfolk, towards the north, and finally, in the course of two or three weeks, we learn of its ravages as having commenced in I re land and various other acts of the Kingdom. It may be -useful to quote from the description thus early given of the appearances. Dr. T. Well Alter, of the I s le of right, in a letter to the Mori don Gardeners Chronicle, edited by Profiiudley, says : "A blight of unusual character, which almost universally affects the <a name="potatoes176"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this island, having been within the last few days, Repeatedly brought to my notice" &the then goes on to describe the appearances, as follows : " The first appearance is a dark spot on the margin of the leaf, which withers the leaf and spreads rapidly to the stein. The discoloration soon extends along the stem, in the course of the vessels, and the whole plant rapidly becomes black; so that within the course of three days after a plant has been attacked, it has become totally destroyed. With this appearance in the upper part, there coexists a fatal change in the tubes; they become likewise spotted at first near the eyes, on the i pp e surface; the cut ice separates, the substance becomes friable, and the change soon spreads through the whole <a name="potato132"><mark>potato</mark></a>. All situations, high or low, and whatever the nature of the soil, appear to be equally visited. The i attack on the plant appears invariably to commence in the leaf, and not in the step; and the spot commences at the margin, corrupting the leaf as it spreads. It is black on the upper surface; but on the lower surface, though black in the centre, it is whitish or gray on the margin, but   either minute insects nor hung i can be seen with a strong lens. That, as regards the green portion, the leaf is affected before the stems, I am quite clear; but the question arises, is the disease in the root and number the as e, or consequence of the above change ?a" He supposes it to be theonsiequence, especially from one case, where, from ripe ness, the green 282 leaves were on the point of withering when attacked. The affection did not at all extend to the roots. He next describes the change in the tube r, and says: " The first appearance much resembles a severe burn, the root turning gray or ash colored, and the cuticlecoming off. The taste is pungent and nausea us as the disease advances." Another writer says: " I yesterday saw a piece of <a name="potatoes177"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that look as if they had all been I scorched although but two day h before they were looking as healthy as need be. They become attacked with small brown spots, and in less than forty-eight hours they are quite burnt up, and the smell arising from them is most disagreeable. The <a name="potatoes178"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, when cut into, have the appearance of being frost bitten" &c. In the Chronicle of. August 23, Richard Gifford writes from Jersey that the disease appeared there about three weeks before about August 1st; that the places most affected were under the hedges and in the cold est part of the fields. Another writer in the same paper says : "the centre of the plots has been first affected ;" that " the haul m smells remarkably like new made hay, and the whole mischief above ground is done in three or four days." Another writer mentions that in one night the leaves of <a name="potatoes179"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had turned as if struck by frost. A correspondent, also, of the dark Lane Express of August 25, writing from Guernsey, under date of August 16, says: " Up to Monday last, August 11, the promise was for the most abundant crop ever known; the whole looked healthy; in be night the mischief was done the whole of the stalk and leaf turned as black as your hat, and the <a name="potatoes180"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted in the ground." Other particulars, mentioned by different writers, are, that only a small portion of the <a name="potato133"><mark>potato</mark></a> was affected in some two or three places; roots fair to the eye when boiled, were as if frost bitten, and were une a table; tubes nearest the surface affected. In Sussex, " first appearance in low and cold situations; then hills and slopes ; the site of an old stone pit, on high ground, clearly traceable in a large field by first appearance of disease and decay of <a name="potatoes181"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> n Folkestone " the most perfect drainage does not cure, but accelerate the evil." In some cases the early <a name="potatoes182"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were the most affected ; but in It. Relief, Jersey, the attack is said to have taken place about the 4th or 5th of August; the baroneter was very low, and had been so for sometime; the electric matter also filled the air from the 22d July, without thunder; early and late <a name="potatoes183"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were equally affected; the places where they were most affected last year suffered a month earlier this year." From others, also, we learn that the sound <a name="potatoes184"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are most remote from the ha ulm, and bad ones just at the bottom of it, the ends being attached to the haul ms. Mr. T. P. Allot mentions, before the disease was announced in a part of I re land, that there had been a disease there for-three or four years past which had done much mischief; " instead of commencing above ground, it seems to commence with the decay of the old set The editor says that it is "only a mild form of the murray in." In Cornwall a writer mentions, "in the early part of the preceding summer we had two, and only two, excessively hot days. The heat was intense ; it came on suddenly and lasted only forty-eight hours" a crop of <a name="potatoes185"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was noticed the day before this accession of heat as thriving and in perfect health they were of recent growth, and the s talks had not sprouted. In being visited after the hot days, the plants had all made very long shoots of leaf less s talks, and this rapid growth had taken place in forty eight hours. In the fall of the temperature the plants became sickly, and were soon b lighted. Another writer says, that in June, when digging up early pot a. ' 238 toes, before there had been any appearance of disease even in the haul m, "there were left on the surface, fully exposed to the weather, sixteen <a name="potatoes186"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, twelve of which are now found to be infected, the most exposed portion of the tube r being the worst." Another writer states that the disease was "first established by means of the haul m on that end of the <a name="potato134"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which henceforth assumes a darker color, at first, for a week or two, merely on the surface; this, by degrees, spreads to the eye end of the <a name="potato135"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and it is when established there, that the chief work of destruction occurs. Shortly after this the character of bruised flesh appears" &c. " I have not a doubt on my mind that this mildew commences with the leaf, like other mildew; and breaking up the tissue there, which is extremely delicate and watery, compared with other mildew subjects, induces the gangrene, which, finding a proper nidus all the way down the stem, descends rapidly through the stem into the <a name="potato136"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the cellular tissue of which, in the interior, affords as. ready a facility for the spread of it." Another writer mentions that clay soils escaped best, but that in the porous green sand formation it proved the worst. Another still says that s ward <a name="potatoes187"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are best. Another writer, in the Dark Lane Express, describes the aspect of the <a name="potato137"><mark>potato</mark></a> as follows: " The disease apparently attacks the plants in thefibrillm of the roots, and where the root passes into the tube r dr solid bulb of the <a name="potato138"><mark>potato</mark></a>. An interruption having taken place between the supply and the demand of the living plant by the decay of the root and its fibrils e, its stalk quickly droops and withers in proportion to the progress of the malady. The thin outer coat of the <a name="potato139"><mark>potato</mark></a> may now be perceived roughened and thickened in one or more patches, and these, when cut through, show that the internal structure of the tube r is altered, the change commencing immediately beneath the cut ice or outer skin ; the pulp is changed to a rusty brown color, like a bruised apple, in thickness varying with the intensity and duration of the disease; eventually the structure of the whole <a name="potato140"><mark>potato</mark></a> is converted into a reddish brown, half rotten mass n some parts of I re land, great complaint is also made of the intolerableeffluvia proceeding from the fields, so that persons could with difficulty be obtained to dig the <a name="potatoes188"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In some parts of the country, the strong soils are noticed as being much the most affected; while the <a name="potatoes189"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on the lighter ones escape with less damage. Such are some of the accounts which are given of the <a name="potato141"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot in Great Britain; and we think that, comparing the descriptions with those which were given in 1844, and during the last season of the disease prevalent in this country, we can scarcely entertain a doubt that it is of the same nature with that which has occasioned so much alarm among our own farmers and the community generally where the crop is considered an important one. It is therefore desirable to know what are the views of scientific and practical men in Great Britain as to its nature and origin, as well as the remedies best adapted to prevent its future appearance and progress, We are favorably circumstanced it this respect, as we are enabled to refer to the opinions of such men as Professors Kindly, Lyon, Lay fair, Johnston, Auckland, as well as many practical and observing farmers and gardeners. The English papers are fill of communications on the subject, but we shall confine ourselves principally to those which we find in the agricultural papers of high standing, and we have thrown in an appendix (of) a variety of extracts, which we have quoted for the purpose of presenting the i view here given of the disease in that country, The theory most 24 . 
igetethilly adopted by the scientific men of Great Britain is that which attributes the disease mainly to the peculiarities of 'the season. Some appear, 'however, to adopt that f the: fungus; and others ascribe the ev i tooverctiltivation and deter i oration of the seed, &c. In the first announcement of the disease, Prof. Kindly, editor of the gardeners Chronicle, gives 'the following statement of his views: "Thecausegof this calamity is we think, clearly traceable to the season. During, all the first weeks of August, the temperature has been cold from two to three degrees below the average ; we have had incessant rain and no sunshine. The <a name="potato142"><mark>potato</mark></a> absorbs a very large quantity of water; its whole construction is framed with a view of its doing so; and its broad succulentleaves are provided in order to enable it to part with this water. Auto a 1 temperature is unfavorable to the motion of the fluids, or to the action of the cells of the plant ; and, moreover, sunlight is required l in order to enable the water sent into the leaves to be perspired. In feeble light, thee mount of perspiration from a plant is comparatively small; in bright sunshine it is copious; in fact, the amount of perspiration is in exact proportion :to the quantity of light that falls upon a leaf, &c. During the present season, all this important class of functions has been deranged. The <a name="potatoes190"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been compelled to absorb an unusual quantity of water, the low ness of temperature has prevented their digesting it, and the a service ofstuilight has rendered it impossible for them to get rid of it by perspiration. Under these circumstances, it t necessarily stag named in their interior, and the inevitable result of that was rot. If the first days of July had not been suddenly hot, it would not have happened; if we had had sunlight with rain, it Would not have happened; arid perhaps it would not 6 have occurred had the temperature been high instead of lo w, even although the sUiidtnot shine; and rain fell incessantly. It is the combination of untowardicircimstances that has produced the mischief. Although we first se the symptoms of the disease in the leaves, and then in the haul m, yet we believe 'that it commences underground, in that part of the ha i ulm which is just above the old set; there, water collects the most; there the temperature is the lowest, and there the old set itself, acting like a sponge, and itself decaying, feeds the live stem with semi putrid matter n answer to the objection that <a name="potatoes191"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> thrive very well when summer s are usually unfavorable, as the last, he says: " The <a name="potato143"><mark>potato</mark></a> then grows slowly; its tissue becomes thoroughly organized as it proceeds, and it is not liable to be acted on by accumulated moisture; no predisposing cause exists. But in England the <a name="potato144"><mark>potato</mark></a> was predisposed to take the disease, by the unusual warmth of the beginning of July, suddenly succeeding a period of cold un genial weather. The <a name="potatoes192"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grew very fast; their tissue was soft and un consolidated, filled with agonized matter, as all such tissue always is, and peculiarly liable to run into a state of rotten ness." Again, in the in ext reek, he repeats the view, and a is belief that the cause is excessive wet arid a low temperature acting upon the debilitated organization of ah a ulm, which sudden warmth has forced into peter natural vigor. Alluding to the idea that the spot on the leaf is the cause, that it is cold or some other thing acting on the foliage, that has caused a disease which spreads downwards, he adds: If we may be certain of anything when considering the obscure phienriena connected with vegetable disease, we may be certain that this is :not s b. The evil always begins next the old set, and underground; the in the haul ti become is brown r and rots; the spots 'in the leaves. 235 are n merely the symptoms of the underground malady' He also states that cucumbers and words are similarly affected; and others s too, as lwehmay here say, mention the same disease as reaching d alias, onions, turn is, and carrots. Again, in his next number of the Chronicle, alluding to the attacks of a kind of mould mentioned by a correspondent, he says: "his is only what was to be expected; for as soon as living matter loses its force, as soon was diminished vitality takes the place of accustomed vigor, all sorts of parasites acquire power, and contend for its destruction." He subsequently re news his declaration of confidence in his original opinion, and states a, similar view to be taken among the Belgian cultivates, with the exception of Professor Dorr en, and says: ' It is true, that a minute fungus has made matters infinitely worse; but that is, we quite believe, a secondary cause n the report of the I wish commissioners to examine into the disease in  re land, &c, of which Professors Kindly and Lay fair composed the majority, they attribute the cause to the season, and say: " Without pretending to decide what that cause really was, we may state that it seems to be connected with the cold, cloudy, un genial weather which has characterized the present year over the north of Europe conditions highly unsuited to the constitution of a plant which, like the <a name="potato145"><mark>potato</mark></a>, is a native of a warm dry, sunny country, and insufficient for the ripe king of the tubes. Without avert into the solitary cases which require to be examined with more care than we :have the means of giving to them, we may state, that amidst the mass of conflicting evidence which we have obtained, the following facts appear to be established: 1. That <a name="potatoes193"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted early in the season are more healthy than those planted later. 2. That the crop has suffered less in :dry, elevated, sandy districts, where the influence of the season was mitigate by the slowness of growth, as compensated for by the naturalwaritith of the soil. 3. That the late varieties of <a name="potatoes194"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are more diseased than the early ones. 4. That the present disease seems to be confined to the northern parts of Europe and North America, and to be unknown in the countries to the southward Another writer, who also attributes the evil to the season, says that in certain states of the weather the <a name="potato146"><mark>potato</mark></a> will become subject to morbid formations; and these, unless means are adopted to prevent their development, will soon show themselves by that corruption or rotten ness which during the present season has been so prevalent. This disease sustains, then, the same relation to the <a name="potato147"><mark>potato</mark></a> as scrofula to the human species; it may be considered as partly resulting from constitutional defect, and partly from external causes. Another, still, says: " Having examined the tubes infected with the prevailing disease, I have scarcely a doubt left upon my mind that it is that moist ulceration, gangrene sanious a, to which all bulbs and tubes are liable if exposed to un genial circumstances at the time when (heirripening processes should commence. 'he instances the cases of the tu lip and hyacinth. At an agricultural club in Raleigh, after a full discussion, It was resolved that " the failure is entirely owing to the season having been unsuited to fully perfecting the tubes of most of the varieties of the <a name="potato148"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Mr. Teschemacher, in his letter to this office, objects to the views of the British professors above stated, from the fact that the disease has prevailed here in a warm dry summer, and that, though we have hadrianyicold, cloudy summers before, we did not suffer from the disease 236 a. Some in Great Britain are strongly of the opinion that the seed has been injured by cutting, and otherwise deteriorated by over cultivation. One person says, that t, " from its earliest appearance having been in the southern parts of the island, and the early sorts suffering most, it would seem that the mildew requires an elaborated state of the sap in the plant to facilitate its progress, as is the case with the pea mildew." It is suggested by another, that the disease is the result of the chemical changes necessary for the formation of starch, albumen, and other in organic products, not having been produced in the proportions necessary for assimilation. It would appear that the peculiarity of the weather the past season has been so great as to cause almost every one to fix upon this as the primary cause of the evil. Thus, from Scotland, one person says: " This year the <a name="potato149"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop suffered severely from the cloudy and extremely cold and wet season the temperature, especially in high districts, frequently bordering on frosts so early as from the latter end of July to the end of August, and subsequently? Again, in Peebleshire: " From the general nature of the disease, there can be no doubt whatever that it is produced from some general cause; and, without hesitation, we attribute it to the cold, wet, and un genial season. We find, by taking a <a name="potato150"><mark>potato</mark></a> of' the sound est description, and allowing it to remain for two or three days amongst earth over saturated with water, that the same disease is produced which is now so prevalent over all Scotland. Until such a time as we .g an to raise new varieties from seed apples, such a thing as failure or disease was never once heard of; and to the result of this experiment we in no small degree attribute the deter i oration of the late <a name="potatoes195"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> communication from Tweed side, in the Dark Lane Express of November 24, offers the following suggestions in favor of the view that the disease was in consequence of the peculiarities of the season: " During ai most the whole of the time that the young <a name="potato151"><mark>potato</mark></a> was swelling into size and advancing into ripe ness, the quantity of wet in the ground and the absence of sunshine were peculiar; and these, operating upon the <a name="potato152"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the tender stage of its growth, I am convinced are the causes of the disease by which it has been affected. I am led to this conviction by the following circumstances: 1st. In narrowly watching the taking up of <a name="potatoes196"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grown in a dry deep loam, upon a sandy sub soil. I observed that those which were placed in a horizontal circle round the stem and near the surface, or partially bare, were not affected at all. 2d. There the plants had occasionally penetrated deeper into the soil, and had produced one or more <a name="potatoes197"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> at the depth of eight or ten inches from the surface, those at that depth were invariably affected, while those placed nearer to the surface, and attached to the same stem, were free of disease. 3d. In thin turf y soils, or thin adhesive clay, upon an imperious stratum, the <a name="potatoes198"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were necessarily placed in a position where the wet was lodged between the soil andsulsoil, and these I invariably found to be affected. 4th. In these soils <a name="potatoes199"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> lying close to the surface, or uncovered, were generally soundErasmus Wilson, F. R. S., in a letter to the editor of the London Times, of September 23, gives the following opinion of the condition, as well as the cause of the rot in <a name="potatoes200"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. He says: " The real cause of the destructive changes at present taking place appears to be the unripe ness of the tver, and the consequent imperfect elaborate on of its juices. When examined with the microscope, the cells of the <a name="potato153"><mark>potato</mark></a> are found to be not more than half filled with starch cells, (many of which are incomplete) the. 237 remaining portion of the cell being filled with water. Hence the actual condition of the <a name="potato154"><mark>potato</mark></a> may be stated as follows: 1st. Deficiency of starch 2d. I m perfection in the tissue of the cell walls; and, 3d. I excess of water to which may possibly be added, imperfectly elaborated starch. As a consequence of the imperfect ion of the tissue of the cell walls, and its state of maceration in a superabundance of water, it falls speedily into decay the change beginning at the surface and proceeding inwards, and being indicated by a brown discoloration of the cells. The starch cells, which are at first unaffected, are soon enclosed in the delayed cellular tissue, and, becoming involved in the decay, are thereby destroyed or. Crossthwait, in the dark Lane Express, of December 8, supposes the disease to have arisen from excess of moisture in the tube r. He says that he believes the redundant fluids of the <a name="potato155"><mark>potato</mark></a> press towards the outer rim; and not finding a vent, the disease commences, like a bruise, round the rim, or in the weak est part of the <a name="potato156"><mark>potato</mark></a>. His remedy is to cut the tube across, and thus allow the superfluous moisture to escape, and the disease is arrested. In proof of this, he alleges some experiments made by him, and which he found to be successful. Those <a name="potatoes201"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, also, which were accidentally cut by the spade while they were dug, almost entirely escaped. He likewise recommends that all the small <a name="potatoes202"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> be saved for seed, as they have been the sound est the last season. "they should be closer set than large ones singular fact is mentioned by Mr. George Ruler, of North Salt ham, in a note to the editor of the Norfolk News. He says that "a person there last spring left a <a name="potato157"><mark>potato</mark></a> by accident in the corner of a closet in his house, which, in October, was (bound with seven small <a name="potatoes203"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> attached to it, and five out of the seven were spotted with the murrainThe new which attributes the evil to a parasitic fungus has also its advocates in Great Britain, and some of these are among the ablest men of science. The following, from the Rev. Mr. Berkeley, pronounced by Professors Kindly, Lay fair, and Lane as the ablest natural ist in his knowledge of the habits of the hung i in the Kingdom, presents this view of the cause as first stated there. After having said that he could not hear of it as prevailing in his neighborhood, he writes: " I have this morning received from Dr. Montague, of Paris, some leaves affected with the mildew, together with an admirable analysis of it, and it proves to be a minute mould of the genus Botrytis, very greatly resembling that which is so common on the shepherds purse' especially on those plants which are attacked by the white are do. It is also allied to Botrylis destruction, which is occasionally a perfect pest among the different species of Ilium. I have seen whole beds of shallows entirely destroyed by it, and it is occasionally very pre judicial to onions. The parasite of the <a name="potato158"><mark>potato</mark></a> does not appear to have been before observed by system artists, and differs from those Of the same genus in several respects, which have long been known as attacking the leaves of various plants. Dr. Montague proposes to call itBotry is infestans" &c. He does not undertake to say that the spots on the tube r are owing to the ravages of the Botrytis, or whether the two causes of disease co exist. The primary cause is doubtless the continued wet, combined with certain peculiarities of the soil. It may be observed, the the dry rot in <a name="potatoes204"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, so ably described by Parties, arose from the attack of a fungus of a very different structure from that by which the leaves and stems are attacked in the present instance 238 a. Again: The next week the same gentleman writes, in the Gardeners9hronicle of September 6, announcing the appearance of the disease, and says: "I do not find that the tubes are at present affected, but the haul mr is decaying very rapidly, and in every case the b lighted spots are covered with Botrytis ifestans, (wont) He then states that the mould sent to him by Professor Kindly is identical with that on leaves, and the same kind as that he had received from Paris. He adds : " In making a very fine vertical section through the less diseased portions of the tubes, I findincipient plants of the mould in the more healthy cells ; for, in general, the brown spots do. not at first consist entirely of delayed cells, but still retain many in a tolerably healthy state. At a later period, probably all the cells would be more or less altered. Those which are un colored exhibit their usual appearance; but the walls of the diseased cells are thickened, and have a g ranula ted appearance. Both in: the colored and discoloured cells the grains of feu la remain unaltered, and are as sensible to the effect of iodine as ever. It is probable, therefore, that at least in an early stage of the disease the tubes would yield as good starch as those which are sound. 4. There is not the slightest appearance of any processes upon the grains of feu la, as in the disease so admirably illustrated by Parties. I tis the cellular tissue alone which seems to be affected. The cells immediately beneath the cut ice, especially where there is a depressed spot externally, are often affected with the mycellium to such a degree that the pure white of the mycellium predominates, and the brown tint in a great measure vanishes. Even in this case I find the grains of the feculahealthy and abundant. It appears, then, that the decay of the tube r is produced by the same cause which affects the leaves, to wit: ly the growth of a mould, the development of which has been promoted by the excessive wet. The parasite does not appear to have been observed before but there is little doubt that it will now be found to be more or less prevalent in damp and ill drained spots, in the dries t years." Mr. Berkleyagain writes to Professor Kindly, in the Chronicle of September 20" I have received from Dr. Montague specimens of a very curious parasite, which occurs in the intercellular passages of <a name="potatoes205"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> during the process of germination, and just after it has been completed. It was discovered in the course of some experiments made by Dr. Layer, chief physician of the Hospital de la Ha rite, at Paris, who has been paying great attention to the disease which now infects <a name="potatoes206"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Amongst other points he finds, that, though the grains: of feu la which are found .in the cells of diseased <a name="potatoes207"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not injured, they. gradually diminish in number, as in the terminating sets, till in some cases all are completely absorbed." "or. Montague considers the parasite above mentioned to belong to a new genus, allied to lepedonium and asterophora. He has given the little mould. the name of artotrogus hydrosporus. Mr. Berkeley still further add si: "I n every case I find; the Botrytis infestans preceding the work of destruction. It appears that while the leaves are yet green or yellowish green, the parts attacked soon become brown and withered. The appearances. shown convince me that the spots: on the tubes arise from the attack of the mould, and that mould is not an after organization. The most form distinct concentric circles, disposed in one or sometimes two systems, exactly as in Oidiumfructigenum, as figured by Ehrenbergin his Mycetogenesis, and as may be seen almost every autumn on fallen pears and apples. In re examining specimens in- which there was no external appearance of mould, I found that the s pawn was very evident in the diseased cells, but, as I before observed, the grains of starch were sound and unaffected. Some of the cells contained little cubicalcolorlessor brownish crystals, which I had not previously met with. If the infected tubes are shut up for a day in a tin box, the mould will appear externally in little white patches, and soon fructifiesAnother writer, at a later date, also advocates the fungus theory partially, and says : The cold and wet during the last summer have no doubt been the principal agents in fostering the murray in, rendering the <a name="potatoes208"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> predisposed to generate the hung i which now infect them, and which are, probably of spontaneous growth ; more attribute able to the condition of the <a name="potato159"><mark>potato</mark></a> being favorable to their growth, than the hung i being the primary cause of all the mischief. In opening many <a name="potatoes209"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which presented no outward appearance of being affected. I found many wherein decay had already extended about a quarter of an inch below the. surface without breaking through the skin, leading me to suppose that, although thefungi increase the malady to a fearful extent, they are in the first instance caused by the unhealthy state of the <a name="potatoes210"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, consequent upon atmospheric influence and improper cultivation. In examination, I have also found some bladder like spots on a few <a name="potatoes211"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which, when broken, contained innumerable hung i, tending rather to confirm, me in my statement of spontaneous production." Professors Kindly, Lay fair, and lane, as the commission appointed to examine and report upon the condition of the <a name="potato160"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in I re land, observe respecting the fungus theory: It is a very general opinion, and one entertained by men whose, extensive knowledge entitles it to respect, that parasitic al hung i, similar in their nature to those which produce mildew and dry rot, are the real cause of the malady" &c. They then go on to describe the conditions under which it is supposed the fungus appears, and which it is unnecessary to repeat, as the whole report may be seen in the appendix No. 6. But, say they, " that the s pawn of hung i is present in large quantities in diseased <a name="potatoes212"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, is undoubted. The evidence of the best microscopical observers would be with us conclusive on this point, even if we, had not verified the fact by personal examination. We also regard it as well ascertained that these parasites spread rapidly in damp and warm situations, producing infinite mischief under such circumstances, and that their advance is only to be successfully resisted by dryness. But it does not a p, pear to us that their being the original cause of the disease has been well established. If it were so, it is difficult to conceive why fields of <a name="potatoes213"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> placed very near to each other should be differently affected, or why certain varieties of this plant should be much more injured, than others the I wish apple <a name="potato161"><mark>potato</mark></a>, for example, which appears to have suffered much more extensively than any other. We are also unable to reconcile with the theory of the disease being caused .by parasitic al hung i, the; remarkable fact that, in its present form, it is certainly of modern origin. That it may have always existed is possible, though of this wie have no proof; but at least there can be no doubt that it has only manifested itself to any considerable degree within the last few years. We cannot suppose the both is, which observers find to be the kid of fungus that attacks the <a name="potatoes214"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, .to be of recent origin or creation. He must assume it to be coexist went with <a name="potato162"><mark>potato</mark></a> itself, and, therefore we must conclude that some recent causes have omen into operation favorable to its increase to the present alarming degree n some of the numerous works which have been called from the press by the <a name="potato163"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease the fungus theory is adopted, and in others it is dish 240 Dec. No. 140.puted. Mr. Luck man says that "the hung i resemble those which produce smut in barley He finds their <a name="seeds14"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in great numbers on the sides of the cells. He calls it are do t berg sum. He regards it, however, not a the cause, but the effect, attribute able to the peculiar season. Mr. G. Phillips, another writer on the subject, says that he is unable tofindfingi. He imputes the, evil to too much moisture, the effect of long continued rains stimulating the plant beyond its ability, and then overpowering it. Such are the statements of different individuals distinguished for science and habits of observation, in Great Britain, respecting the cause of the evil and its appearance. Before we pass on to the remedies that have been suggested, we may a swell glance at the opinions held on the continent upon the same subject. Professor Dorr en, of Belgium, where the disease was very destructive, b reached there the fungus theory. His views may be gathered from a statement t which we find translated from him in one of the public journals. It says: " Mr. Dorr en, after stating that the evil had prevailed in Belgium for several years, though to a far less alarming degree than at present, proceedsSThe real cause of the evil is a fungus or sort of mushroom, which the learned will classify under the genus bory dis, but which agriculturists, without further specification, will call a spot, a bluish, or blotches. "a. a This mushroom is of extreme t entity, but it breeds amazingly and reproduces itself by thousands. I to stems are formed of littlesitaight, hollow threads, which bear on their summits one or more branches, always divided into two; and at the end of these branches reproductive bodies are found, which have the form of eggs, but which are scarcely the one hundredth part of millimetre in size. It will be said that this is a very small body to do so much mischief, but I answer that the it ch is not a disease less to be feared because the a care which produces it can be seen only by the aid of the microscope. After the formation of the yellow spot, and the development of the brotrydis on the leaf of the <a name="potato164"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the stalk receives the deleterious influence. Were and there its epidermis turns brown, slackens, and, following with the microscope the phases of the evil, you perceive that it is by the mind that the stalk is attacked. The morbid agent carries its action from the mind :on the epidermis ; and, although this last does not always di close mushrooms, it is not the less for that struck with death. The infection soon descends into the tubercle itself. If the disease follows its course, the tubercle mortified forthwith. A <a name="potato165"><mark>potato</mark></a> is not a root, but a real branch, whence it follows that a tubercle contains a marrow, which is the eat able part to be preferred, and a separate mind ; between the marrow and the mind there is a zone of vessels which represent wood. :his construction will be apparent to any one who chooses to cut a thin slice of <a name="potato166"><mark>potato</mark></a>. and place it between his eye and the daylight. The infection attacks that part which receives the sap on" its descent. By following the progress of the evil upon a great number of painted tubercles, I have been able to see how the evil, by one continuous progress, at length reaches the heart itself of the <a name="potato167"><mark>potato</mark></a> and corrupts the vegetable entirely. The skin of the diseased <a name="potato168"><mark>potato</mark></a> comes off easily; the flesh no longer cracks under the knife; a flat let liquid drips from the <a name="potato169"><mark>potato</mark></a>; a musty, and presently an animal smell, analogous to the smell of mushrooms recently cut, manifests itself, and occasions considerable nausea. : " The evil being traced to its source, the cultivate or i must direct all his attention to the dostruection
. 24 of the fungus or mushroom, for it is unfortunately but too true that all the parasites of this genus once introduced into a country remain there and propagated. This year the epidemic has been general; the germs exist every where; millions upon millions of pro papules, if their number is not diminished this year, will next year be attacking the plants, and then: it will be more difficult to eradicate the scourge' .a. The French naturalists, however, do not generally agree with Professormorren. The correspondent of the National I intelligence r states that, "at a late meeting of the Academy of Sciences. M. Deseaisne, of the Garden of Plants, who had examined, in every. way, a number of diseased <a name="potatoes215"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from Holland and; the neighborhood of Paris, disputed the opinion of the Belgian Professor Dorr en concerning the cause or proximal e agent of the malady' He seemed to convince the Academy that the parasite mushroom of the Professor is: one of the products, and not the cause of the, vi l. I twas stated that the human epidemic which ravaged Germany in, 116 and 1817, was chiefly owing to the habitual consumption of diseased <a name="potatoes216"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In the Comptez Endure, Los. 13 to 16, 1845, M. May en gives the result of his chemical investigation : The dry matter, which is all except water, is lessened' 12 per cent. The diseased: part is twice as heavy as the ,healthy part. re his he attributes to a parasite. ;the loss of starch amounts to 2 per cent. There is also azotised matter of the same composition as the hung i. Messrs. Girardin and Wizard, however, deny that these are parasites. :They say- that there are none indicated except such as are found in all cases offermentation. -they regard the disease, therefore as the result of simplefermentation, induced by the unfavorable :season. M. Our and also attributes it to the atmospheric .a uses, favored by local circumstances. M. Gerard averted to the fact that the disease attacked the <a name="potatoes217"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> between the 10th and 15th of August. He is opposed to the idea that either animal or vegetable parasitic m is connected with it t a si a cause, and; he ascribeslthedisease to the presence l of a brown matter which seems to- blue the' starch grains together and to prevent their separation, The attributes its presence to unfavorable atmospheric causes, i which: caused; the nutrition fluids tostagnate, and thus produced an alteration which ended in decay The extent of the: disease in the north of France, according to a. Rouenjournal, was one fifth of the whole crop. It is supposed, it is said, that the cold nights and rain have caused it: The nature of the, soil or kind of seed did not seem to alter the. case. ; In French Glanders and Belgium, also, the evil was greatly felt. ' Accounts from Ten ay, on the Meuse, state that it has extended to that country. In Russia, also, a Vert man professor there writes, says the Gardeners Chronicle" As regards the <a name="potato170"><mark>potato</mark></a> epidemic, it is only partial here, and confined to the early kinds in heavy clay land is. In Bavaria mention of it is made, and it is said to be distinguished from the disease r in: 842; by the rapidity i with which the infected pp states run into a state of putrefaction, by the absence of any i evident fringes, an, ormceliumand by the obliteration .of the membraneopfthe cells before any diseased action is visible in the starch grains. I am" says he, "perfectly satisfied that it is the extraordinary season, combined with the negligence of our cultivates, and their bad treatment of the plant, that has i caused it to be visited with thiscid127) calamity: I cannot believe that any parasiticalfungashas produced any such mischief' i: "'A letter from Berlin" says the Gardeners Chronicle, " states that, by means of the microscope, the cause of the n malady prevail ll in the <a name="potato171"><mark>potato</mark></a> 16 242 has been discovered to be insects of an exceedingly small species. They create cavities in the tubercle, and soon produce putrefaction. Lithographicdrawings have been made of the diseased parts of the vegetable, and of the insects alluded to, and copies have been sent to the principal agriculfuristsThe disease is likewise described as spreading more and more in Denmark and Sweden. The Cologne Gazette states that nearly the whole growth of <a name="potatoes218"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the Cherish province is lost. In Holland, according to the official report of the agricultural society of Droning en, the malady is to be ascribed to the heavy rains of 1844, in the summer, and to the weather which prevailed just at the time the tubercle <a name="seeds15"><mark>seeds</mark></a> were formed, and partly to the carelessness of agriculturists in keeping the <a name="potatoes219"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> intended for planting perfectly dry. It is thought, too, that the excessive cold of last March proved very injurious. As more direct causes, are stated -st, the too rapid growth of plants this year ; 2d, the excessive heat which prevailed in the early part of the summer of the present year being, on the 13th of June, 87 Ah, on the 3d of July, 871, and on the 7th of the same month 91 j 3d, the rain which tell at intervals, and which subjected the plants, as it were, to the action of warm water; 4th, the cold and moist temperature which succeeded from the 15th of July to the end of August; 5th, the existence :in several places of an extraordinary fog, which, in several places, emitted a disagreeable odor. They attribute much to this mi as ma. In the province of Droning en it was clearly ascertained that the infection proceeded from the leaves and the stalk to the root, and that it was displayed by small stains, and by the existence of a species of mushroom, placed by some writers under the head: Fusisporum sol and. To traces of these parasites were discovered in the 's talks or the tubercles; a fact considered as proof that the disease was first propagated from the leaves, and consequently that it differs essentially from those our rains which originate in the roots. We maintain, say the committee, "that this disease has probably existed before, more or less i but that it is one which hitherto has not been described by naturalists." The whole report may be found in appendix to. 6. Prof. Liebigs opinion of the disease is as follows: "the researches I have undertaken upon the sound and diseased <a name="potatoes220"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the present year, have disclosed to me the remarkable fact that they contain in the sap a considerable quantity of vegetable case in, (cheese) precipitate by acids. His constituent I did not observe in my previous researches. It would appear that I from atmospheric causes, a part of the vegetable albumen which prevails in the <a name="potato172"><mark>potato</mark></a> :has become converted into vegetable case in. The in stability of this last ,s u a nee is well known ; hence the facility with which the <a name="potato173"><mark>potato</mark></a> containing it undergoes putrefactionSAt the Academy of Sciences, Paris, 1845, November 17, M. Boussingaultcommunicated an extract of a letter from Joachim Costa, of Bogota, relative to the <a name="potato174"><mark>potato</mark></a> 'disease. It appears from this letter that the malady is very common on the table land of Bogota ; that it is destructive in wet seasons, or even every year in damp spots. M. Costa does not doubt that theimnalady has always been known there, since it excites no alarm among the     midians, who live principally upon <a name="potatoes221"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. , M. Boussingault properly remarks that in these countries, where cultivation continues without intermission during the year, and where the tubes are consumed without the necessity of storing there, there is no fear, as with us, of a bad harvest, bloc. To. 140. 04aause it may be replaced immediately by a good one- With us, where the culture is annual, and the product must be preserved through the winter, iv is natural that we :should be concerned in a malady which may destroy the resources of a -whole yearSThe r me dies suggested for the cure or prevention of the evil, both in. Great Britain and ocid127n the :continent, embrace the two great objects of the Present and future crops. The attention was of course first directed as son as possible to present the spread of the disease any further aid to save those which still remained sound in the -soil or after f they were dug. After the disease had advanced, and all 1 that could be expected had been suggested in the first and subsequent stages of the disease, as related t tothetten present crop, the inquiry naturally became one of yet deeper interest, whether the same alarming decrease of the <a name="potato175"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was to be expectedtlhenext season, and to provide mean is, as r as possible :to ward off such a calamity: I tis not always possible to keep these distinct, as, whernthedisease advanced, the 'two pints were often naturally h mentioned in con -neuron.

Professor Lie big recommends "the cutting of the diseased <a name="potato176"><mark>potato</mark></a> into, slices of about a quarter of an inch thick, and immersing them in water containing from two to three per cent. of sulphuric acid. After 24 hours, draw off the acid liquor, and wash away the remains of it by sleeping the cut <a name="potatoes225"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in water. When let them be dried. The pieces are said to be white and of little weight, and can be ground to flour and baked into bread along with the flour of wheat The following suggestions are also made as to means of prevention : ' In the Dusseldorf Gazette it is stated that a farmer, living on one of the estates of the Duke de Aremburg, near Dusseldorf, has discovered a mode to prevent the rotating of <a name="potatoes226"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and even of curing it where it has already commenced. The method is very simple : it consists in merely narrowing deeply the earth in which the tubes are planted, so as to produce an evaporation, which will diminish the ferment at ion caused by humidity; and it is added that the plan has proved to be completely successful. Met it be tried wherever it is not now too late. In our publication of Monday, we quoted from the Moniteur a proposition for preserving from decay <a name="potatoes227"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> partially painted, by a sort of semi baking in an oven heated to 64 or 65 degrees of Reaumur, (about 180 of Fahrenheit) and the plan f like that of converting them into face la or arrow root may answer very well on a small scale. He would recommend sliding, st ringing, and hanging them in kitchens and outhouses, as apples are managed in America, as a means of saving part of the crop, in addition to the two first described, methods London Freemans Journal. . Steaming <a name="potatoes228"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and then drying them, has also been stated to be successful by a correspondent of the Dark Lane Express. The writer says, that " on opening a pit containing 100 sacks of <a name="potatoes229"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, nine tenths were found to be diseased." To his surprise, " on steaming them the offensive matter was removed, and the remainder was perfect and. fit for use in experiment by Major Beaamish is also mentioned in the same journal, in which, by boiling the diseased tube r in two waters, he rendered it available for human food. One of the earliest recommendations respecting the use of the diseased tubes, was that of converting then at once into starch and flour. His brought up the question, whether they were poisonous; and experiments were tried in England, and on various parts of the continent, to determine this question. The conclusion seemed to be decisive, that, as a general thing, they may be used with safety, provided suitable; precautions be adopted. Professor Kindly speaks of a fine <a name="potato177"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour received from some of his correspondents, and says: ' Professor Men slow found that while a half bushel of sound <a name="potatoes230"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> yielded 4 pounds 10 ounces. of i flour, the same quantity of diseased ones furnished 3 pounds 10 ouncescid127) Numerous methods of preparing flour and starch, agreeing in the main, are found in the agricultural journals. We have extracted several of these in our appendix, A curious experiment is named in a French paper as having been tried by M. On jean, of Chamber y, who lived for three consecutive days on bad <a name="potatoes231"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which had been thrown aside as refuse. lie said that, to determine the question of danger, he had none of the diseased portions cut away. In three days he ate 8 lbs. in butter, in soup, or simply cooked in water, without any inconvenience, except a slight indigestion. He also drank in the morning, fasting, a glass (about 8 ounces) of water in which about pounds of putrid tubes had been boiled; it was of a yellowish brown color, turbid and thick but not viscous; of a slightly disagreeable smell and nauiseous taste, leaving a bitterness which remained on the palate for an hour le says :he found " no other symptoms of indigestion fro a this' liquid except a disagreeable heat op pressing the chest for about two hours." Whatever may be thought of M. On jeans taste, his' philanthropy, at least, is deserving of praise. In a statement of a method of use, made by M. Broker at acid127neeting of the or k Agricultural Society which is very valuable, as it' may be dated- in any family he says One weight (20 I is) of sound white <a name="potatoes232"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will produce of dry marina, r flour fit for use -3 I is. 9 oz.

He also s tales that diseased <a name="potatoes234"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> make as good starch as the sound est. "The bad parts need not be cut off; they must be well washed to prevent the earthy particles from mixing with the flour The suggestions of the I wish commission, in their report, a swell as those, f agricultural clubs, chemists, &c, respecting the methods of using the crops, are highly valuable, and will repay the time spent in their perusal.

It is a point of much interest and discussion, Now shall i th next crop the pre reped ?a" It does not seem to be positively decided that diseased timbers might not be used, but it is recommended that, as far as possible, this ihouldbeavoided. Mr. Berkeley states that the presence of fungus 'would inotecessarily vitiated the powers of production. "he states" saProfessorsLih4iley, Lay fair, and' Lane; "that though there Would certainly beorlnerisk in raising a diseased progeny from i a diseaseed stock, yet th growth :offungi so evidently depends of atmospheric condition that it does not follow that because germs are present they should be developed' 'the he ofhimrie ;grown <a name="potatoes235"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, that have remained did nd drritigthewinter, is admitted tod be safe; but it is recommended that autumn ri plan iting 'shbudberesorted to instead of spring planting, and that the po states shield be planted as far as possible from where the diseased ones are raised, The use of certain substances, as lime, salt, &c, is also suggested, as lililytoprpye of advantage. The procuring of new varieties, also, occupies considerable attention, and a number of papers containing valuable suggestiaisoan this and kindred subjects will also be found in our. append i Of. Mr. Patillo and Professor Kindly both recommend as best for seed <a name="potatoes236"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> those which are not the best for table use. Mr. Tisorii states in refer life to seed <a name="potatoes237"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, that he plants an early crop, and, when fit, he remoivesthem, setting in their place small waste <a name="potatoes238"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> saved from i last season.

In reference to autumn planting, Professor Kindly recommends to look for the early varieties, and also to keep in mind the important facts 1. The eyes at the top of the <a name="potato178"><mark>potato</mark></a> are the youngest, and ve get ate first; from them the crop obtained will be a fr bright earlier than from: the lower end 2, When the -<a name="potato179"><mark>potato</mark></a> is not cut, and the top eyes are allowed to proceed in their on; growth, they, push slowly, if at all. 3.

Arthur strenuously urges that a if <a name="potatoes245"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are cut fox, planting, it should be in the au turn, and not in the spring. He seems to suppose that much of the evil arises from the latter practice: Hesayscid127cid127it may be :ut at any time during its dormant repose, as it is protected during the winter But, he says, "it is contrary to nature to dissect it at the only stage of its annual like, when we know all other plants bleed excessively if wounded.

He would place the <a name="potato185"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the clear soil, on the back of the half drill formed by the return of the plough, which half drill should be made large i than ordinary to bring the seed as near the centre of the drill as possible, the manure having been spread evenly over the surface and dug in. He also recommends attention to the selection of varieties by adoption. of some of the inferior kinds less 'liable to disease. -n ,the appendix No. (6, among other papers will be found a list ofqueriesby Professor Johnston, to aid him in the investigation of the disease.  Thisswill be useful in directing: the researches of farmers and observers another year. ; 'reference oe b has i been made to the rot described by To ni Mauritius, in 24. Germany, in 1842, we have also added some papers on this subject; one of their i, translated from his report as found in the Central Platt des Landwirthschaftlichen He reins, of Bavaria, on purpose for this report. It wasouriintention to have sub joined extracts also from another work of his on <a name="potato186"><mark>potato</mark></a>, as likewise translations from the German, Belgian, and Frenchpcid127rofess6ts, but they have not as yet reached us. It will be seen, we think, that the disease in Europe greatly resembles that in this country ; though it i may by and doubtless is, occasionally modified by the difference of circumstances in the two countries. We have not expressed any opinion as to its cause bc, as, and such conflicting testimony, it seems advisable to wait for ore light: rhecid127great importance of the subject will form a sufficient apology for dwelling at such length upon it. Our aim has been to furnish, dance; This mass of materials will be more readily at command for observers another' yea, and perhaps may afford important aid in anticipating and arresting the progress of he disease in future. The theories may all be whig; but the evil exists, and it will be a real benefit to our country, and the whole b i vi lied world, if its ravages may be checked and terminated. Stheameerican I institute, in a late session in New Work, passed the following resolution: : li- e solved, That the alarming situation of a great part of the world at this time intconseqtuericefof the disease called the rot in <a name="potatoes246"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, requires the most active, proiaepta he retiring exertions of all the producers of this most important production to subdue, if possible, the frightful ravages of this disease, and to prove, by successful experiment, that the country which originally: produced: this valuable root, one of the most sustained sourcesofubsijtence to the population of Europe as well as our o' S country, can provide a remedy to prevent its extinction' h' -a* .a^ .a! . H. -a: .a: May is a r more important crop in New Englarid and some f f the mriddleStiates than in other parts Of the United States. The vast prairies: of the west, and the moderate climate of the south and southwest, ahlbiic g paste ring eve during the winter months, render the enltivationr of (cid127itheEngdlish grasses less an object of attention in thosese3tios of our country: Theicropodf hay i seems to have been r very good in, Paine. The Of  hineFarTmer^ speakirigiof it! says, July 11: " The grass crop, from r preseeWappearances. will be light' nothing near an average one.

The old and i middle aged moaning: fields, vithbdt few exceptions, along the whole route, looted remarkably thin, and, unless the late propitious rains have given the grass a healthy aid i unprecedented impetus, the growth will be' small, and the crop harvested not more than adequate to meet the wants- of the I farmers and supply the :vill get markets' Again, July a 3 :a: " It farmers :in in :tteamidstl of this iinportait have st, ands we are happy to state halt ho .he. 249 the season was at first very unfavorable for grass, and promised a scanty return, the results are very good. In this vicinity the crop is nearly as abundant as it was last season, and the quality is undoubtedly far better. For the last week the weather, owing to the frequent showers, has been rather unfavorable for getting the hay into the barn; but the benefit that has resulted to the other crops from the seasonable rains more than counter balances this trouble." Again : We are happy to state, that although the season was at first very unfavorable for grass, and promised a scanty return, the results are very good. In this vicinity the crop is nearly as abundant as it was the last season, and the quality is undoubtedly far better." At an, earlier date the Norridgewock Dress says: " Vegetation of .all kinidsalongthe Kennebeck looks extremely promising. May seems likely to turn out as -abundant as last year' There was probably a small increase, therefore, as the crop of the previous year was a good one, of perhaps five per, cent, I it New Hampshire' the drought was so severe as to cut off' the crop to a large extent. By some the falling off is put as high as " fifty per cent n the south eastern: part of the State it is believed to have been " fifteen per cent. less." -further west, and in the central southern section of the State, it is estimated at "twenty-five per cent. less' A correspondent still higher up on the Connecticut river writes thus: 'a" Long continued dryness had a bad effect upon the hay crop as to quantity, though the quality is considered to be unusually good. Taking both into consideration, the regular crop cannot ke well estimated at more than two thirds of an average one. The copious rains of August caused the grass to spring up with unusual vigor, and the after path, or second cutting, was more productive than common, and the feed in the pastures in the latter part of the summer was unusually good. Fields recently laid down to grass, and which were in good condition, suffered none, unless the land was very fig lit and sandy ;on the :contrary, many new pieces of mowing yielded a very heavy crop, while such as had been in grass for three or four years yielded very scantily. Farmers are apt to :let their grass remain too long as long, indeed; as it will; in ordinary seasons, yield a barely remuneratingm crop; and thus they are sure to suffer when the summer is even but a little driver than common. Did a better organized and shorter system of rotation prevail, it seems probable that such a drought as that of last season would have injured the hay crop but little." The crop for the whole State (regard being had to the proportion the counties bear in the returns of the census) is believed to have been twenty-five to thirty per cent. less than in 1844. The severe drought also affected the crop in Vermont, although, it is believed, not equally with that in New Hampshire. In .the lower part of the State it fell off perhaps :a. ten per cent' in the upper it appears to have been about the same! as in the previous year. The whole decrease was probably from five to temper cent. Some fine crops are mentioned as having been presented for premium at the fairs, &c; but these, as they are secured by extraordinary means, form no fair criterion' as to the general crop. Give acres, in one case, yielded 372 000 pounds, or about 3, tons and 440 pounds to the acre. :his was produced by means of top dressing and irrigation. .another account is as follows : " Mr. H. P. Hickock, of this place, (burlington, It, Free Dress) gathered in from 21 acres of meadow, last week thirteen great loads of hay in good order. The hay was herds grass, with a sprinkling of red :c lover 'and red top; and the loads are estimated by 250 the hands in the field at -one ton each. This field v was cleared of pine stumps, and heavily manured, some 25 years ago. Since then it has invariably produced large crops, mostly of hay, and with very little manure of any description. Give tons of the best hay to the acre is something for the most fertile district of country to tell of The accounts of this crop in July and August, in Massachusetts, are discouraging. Thus the Massachusetts Slough man, of July 14, says: " He had in this vicinity last week six good hay days, and much of our early hay was secured. It is now the 14th, and the weather is i quite dry enough for any purpose. We shall .expect no rain, but of nights and on Sundays, till having is& over. ,cid127h is is th-te week for herds grass, redcid127top, Rhode I s land, and the speargraisses. Later in the month, the. Green field Gazette reports the :grass crop as light, and states that many farmers have commenced their having; and it is believed the crops will not be more than two thirds yield7And in August it is said: i The crop of grass, however, is generally light, and will probably not much :exceed the. consumption.  Of  n the north eastern part of the State it is thought: that the drought lessened the crop of English hay " 25 per cent." Fresh meadow hay was" 10 per cent. better ;" and 'salt hay also gave an increase: In the central, along the eastern part of the State, the deficiency is differently estimated 1 indifferent towns, front, ' l to 40 per cent." In the interior, 10 to 15 percent. less ;a; While in the .western section it probably fell off" "onequarterAcorrespondent of the Boston Cultivator, writing from, Berkshire county, in the early -part of July says: " 'the crop of grass is now very light, and should it be cut at the usual, time of having, there would probably be a falling off of one half from last year. : But the rains which have commenced falling for the last two or three days have give nl it a new countenance and, should July be a wet month, there may yet be a supply." (did 127) The general effect of the drought probably reduced the crop for the: whole State 25 peri the crop of Rhode I s land is believed to have been better than in the preceding year. In Connecticut there was some decrease probably 15 to 20 per centiThe hay crop in New York :wass ess than in the preceding year. Great complaint is made of the drought. Thus the agricultural report for July, in one of the public journals, says : W e have had a miserable season from the commencement." :may and June were .unusually dry months, and July has exceeded them all. The grass never looked worse i Lover ripened premature ly, and was cut out :of season, : The yield was hardly enough to pay for the labor. Timothy grass suffered less, but the crop, although secured in beautiful weather, turned out to be less than; half the usual yield he have never known the pastures to look so u i inviting. The ground is apparently burn t up. : Vegetation where the grass has been cut is dead. The springs are dry and low grounds that are usually wet and swamp y, are as dry as the hills. Battle show the poverty of the pastures by their appearance; .and the cows fail to supply the usual quantity of milk." And the, same -paper, for August, says: "a. "the rains came too late to help this indispensable crop, except on the salt meadows. The yield of the uplands is failure; but the salt grass; which is an important article, is turning out, remarkably well. The rains have fallen; so season ably :that the second cutting will, i in many places, be uncommonly large. The change between July and August can hardly be realized.

G. G' r ney, of Woodleigh, Cornwtkl, l England, has been successfully experimenting -with straw, : ashes, and brushwood as a top dressing for grain and grass crops. He applies a ton and a quarter of straw to tohestaitUaer acre, by spreading it evenly over the crop while growingcid127anytimoe between tie -months of April and October; and when an early crop of. 255 grass may be desirable, he spreads the straw in the latter part of February. Thus far his experiments have been tried upon wheat, ve aches, meadow grass, and c lover lea. but there can be no doubt it would prove equally beneficial if applied to any other of the families of small grain- and grasses, Or. Our ney, in reply to a letter of inquiry upon the subject, remarks, that the instances of benefit are numerous, and that there is not one upon record where it has failed, except in cases where too great a quantity of covering has been applied, :or, which is by far the more general, where too little has been applied." At a meeting of the Last Cornwall Experimental Club, Mr. Our ney made the following remarks: .about seven weeks since I covered half a field of three acres of grass in this manner, and about a fortnight since, I when examined, the increase was found to be at the rate of 5,000pounds per acre over the other part of the field. At the same time the straw was raked off and laid in rows about twelve feet apart on the field; 115 sheep were then put into the field with a view to eat it down as quickly as possible; and after they had been there about wee they ere ere succeeded by 26. but locks, to :eat ,off the long grass which the sheep had left.

A most wise recommendation his this : one that will greatly encourage the economy of the manure n the Dark Lane Express, of July 21, there is an account of saltinginagrass and hay in wet seasons, which is stated to be very useful. Mouldyhay put together with salt, from 8 to 25 pounds per ton, was better relish ed by cattle, and did more good, than sound hay stacked without salt. In some instances hay stacked damp with salt, so that it came out almost a paste from the rich, when opened, was devoured with aridity by the cattle na Germany, grass fresh cut is packed in with one pound of salt to the cut and it is said that it goes much further than the same quantity of grass made into hay. A method recommended as better is to s tack the green grass or c lover in layers, with straw and old dry hay, sprinkling salt on each green layer. The juices drawn from the grass by the salt will be absorbed by the straw or old hay, and not only the damp hay or grass will be. made more nutrition, but the straw itself may thus be brought towards the state of the green stalk by the salt which it absorb si and by which it is gradually softened, and thus made so ruble and digest able, The proportion, though- various, according to the dampness of the grass will be about in this ratio: Good upland grass, cut in dry weather, contains about two thirds of its weight of water, or two. tons: in three, and :one ton o of straw will absorb three tons of water ; but as it is not wanted wets, we may allow four tons to one ton of straw; and if the grass by aid of the salt, gives out half of its juice, we shall then have the whole: soft and damp, -without being disposed to drop or leakcid127. If old hay is used in place of straw, one third or one half may be enough, as this absorbs less. For meadow grass or green fodder, cut damp, the straw or old hay may be increased in proportion. If the hay is partly dried, none perhaps may be needed- The best proportion of salt must be decided by trial. One pound per cut. may be too little for fresh grass. Two pounds per cut, or about one half bushel to the ton, isithiought to be not more thancid127) the cattle would relish, and which is ,more likely to preserve the whole in i a sweet andidigestible state. For half dried hay one pound per cut. may be enough. Grand is said to be a good? substitute for straw or old hay. The only difficulty would be its liability to ferment and heat n the New York Farmer and Mechanics we find an article on the science of mowing, and as the rules given are simple and practical, we give them as Mr. It kin, by whom they are communicated to that journal, somewhat quaint ly states them. He says: It was my good fortune (for so  regard it) to have had a few years' experience in early life as a practical farmer; and as I advanced from boyhood, 1 remember, among other things, my first efforts and ultimate success: in the science of mowing i. For a time l had much difficulty in keeping my scythe sharp. This, however, I found to be indispensable. To man can approach any thing like aneasyo1ogood power without it. I had become a good power; when I fell in company with not only a good power, but a scientific one; and after the second or third day, finding that I could not keep up with him, without doing myself an injury; and painful as it was for me to acknowledge it, (for I was ambitious) yet I was compelled to call my friend to' a stand in the midst of my swash- I said' Mr. Picket, (for that was his name j) if you know any -thing which you can communicate to me of the skill of mowing, a. 257 beg of you to do so, for I am exhausted, and I may as well confess at once that I cannot keep up with you' He stopped, came back, took my scythe, and explained to me the main governing principles. I adopted them, and in less than one hour I could keep up with him with perfect ease. I need, I had at least 20 per cent. more of physical strength than he had. It was science alone that enabled him to lead me to this extreme. During the following summer I came in contact with about a dozen good mowers, and I may say some three or four of them professedly fast mowers. I adhered strictly to the science I had learned the preceding summer. My professor not being present, I could lead the field with great ease; but I kept the secret to myself. And now for the art: I will try to describe it 1st. The scythe should hang natural and easy, and, as I have said before. it should be kept in first rate order. 2d. As you approach the standing grass let the heel of the scythe move to the very point of commencement, and let it stop the instant it has done its work. Thus there is nothing lost by a backward or forward swing. If the grass stands up so as to admit of moving on, measure with the eye the utmost capacity forward of your scythe; take a quick, easy gait, moving your right foot well up towards the standing grass, and your body with it, though leaning back by bending the knees a little forward, so as to bring your whole weight to bear upon the scythe without twisting the body from right to left, as many do. thus giving ease to each clip, and ability to repeat in an advanced position without fatigue' Notei f you swing six inches too far back, and six inches too far in pointing out, it makes 24 inches loss! This applied to a scientific forward motion, will give you a great gain on ordinary mowers The Boston Cultivator contains a description, by Benjamin Millard, of a method of recovering pastures, which he says is very useful, and can be applied without manure. His account is thus presented: " This is to turn them over the last of July, or as soon after as business will permit, and sow two bushels of rye to the acre, and bush in the grass seed. I sow one bushel of plaster to the acre after the rye is up; and when it is well up I turn on sheep. In the spring, I again dress it with plaster, and give it one bushel of red top to the acre, and keep sheep enough on it to prevent its rising till the last of May; then cattle may be put on if desired. It will last through the summer, and produce abundantly till the grass is well rooted. Pastures thus treated will look surprisingly very ant and will last several years. Nothing suits sheep and calves better than the rye. The same course may be pursued with exhausted land or bushy pastures. I prefer to keep sheep there the first year, as they keep every spire of it close, and thus make it spread, and they manure it more equally than cattle, and do a of injure the grass, in its tender state, with their feet n the Quarter ly Journal of Agriculture of the High land and Agriculturalsociety of Scotland, we find mention of two new species of c lover (which are described as follows by M. Vilmorin, in the On Jardinier: one of which is the horrid, and the other the elegant. The elegant c lover was for a time considered identical with the horrid, which is cultivated in Sweden ; but when growing together, the differences are stated to be striking. "the latter is larger in all its parts than the former, and the color of its flowers is a brighter rose, shaded with white in the centre, while the elegant trefoil has rather dull reddish rose colored blossoms alike in every part of the flower head. The appearance of the herb age is different; the horrid c lover has 17 258 dark and bright foliage, and that of the elegant is pale and unequal; the leaflets of the latter are also marked with a brown band, like common c lover, which is not the case with the horrid. Another character of the horrid is, that in the summer, when it begins to shed its blossom, and during autumn, the root throws out fresh foliage, arranged like a rose the; but in the elegant trefoil this does not occur. It is the lateral branches which rest on the ground that supply the verdure. The horrid trefoil also flowers fifteen days earlier than the other; which, however, lasts the longest and branches more. Lastly, the former is taller, more beautiful, and comes in earlier; but when the latter has arrived at perfection, having more numerous stems, well covered with branches, and more solid, it will yield, when mown, as great a produce as the former. The horrid trefoil has been a great deal used by M. de Runs in the formation of artificial fields at Arab O, in Sweden, and it has succeeded well; it has grown from three to four feet high, and has yielded, during about 20 years, often more than 10,000 lbs. pertunnland, (about 1 acre English) and always upwards of 5,000 for the first 10 years. It is looked upon as a plant equally suitable for mowing and for pasturage; strong moist soils, argillaceous or calcareous, suit it well; it frequently comes spontaneously on lands in Sweden that have been drained. The elegant trefoil is found in abundance on poor e layer strong soils, where it grows thick and vigorous. It is wild in France in many places; not un frequently in ferruginous sand. It seems very probable that the species will one day form valuable additions to our forage plants, as they appear as though they would succeed on lands unsuitable for c lover, ulcer ne, andsainfoinAn interesting statement respecting the productive ness of I italian rye grass as an early spring feed for horses is found in the Dark Lane Express, as communicated to the Newcastle Agricultural meeting, by Mr. Dickinson. He says that his land, a strong clay in good heart, and under drained, is finely pulverized during the summer months, after takes, or any early crop of corn. This he sowed broadcast, with grass seed, four bushels to the acre. Narrowed it lightly with bushes, as iron harrows bury the seed too deeply. It was cut the first time in 1844, the first week in March, with about ten inches of grass; April 13, the second time; May 4th, the third time; May 24th, the fourth time ; June 14th, the fifth time; July 22d, the sixth time, with ripe seed, and three loads of hay to the acre. I immediately after each crop, the land was watered with two parts of pure urine and one part of water; the produce of each crop increased with the temperature of the atmosphere from one load to three loads per acre. He also had three, or four more light crops, the ground having been harrowed with iron harrows, but without manure as before. In 1845, his first cutting was April 6th ; second, May 3d; third, June 9th ; fourth, 2- feet long standing in the land, July 12th. He states that the I italian rye grass differs in quality and variety; there are some that bloom at a foot and a half high, but his was of a kind which stood from four to five feet. A Mr. Aunt. also used the same kind, sowing the seed which he had from Mr. Dickinson; an acre the 1st of September, 1844, after a crop of spring takes. He manured his ground with ten loads of good horse dung. The second week in April he states that he began to feed it off with eyes and lambs, and they made quick progress, especially the lambs, as the grass produced an abundance of milk. There were forty two couples, and the grass supplied them weeks ; giving the eyes chaff and oats, and the lambs peas. They then began again to feed it for want of other food. He took them off from the grass on the 13th of May, 259 and on the 18th of June mowed the whole for hay, which produced nearly two loads to the acre; this was about five weeks' growth. He adds: " I am satisfied of its being the most valuable plant I know of, especially for early spring feed ; it comes to perfection for feed quite as early as rye, and the comparison between the two for feeding qualities is as ten to one in favor of the I italian rye grass." Lie brown or dark colored, which has a more fibrous stem, is stated by Mr. Codman, in the Royal Agricultural Journal, to be better than the pale. The last report (appendix No. 2) contained a full description of the I italian rye grass. A writer in the Cultivator of July, 1845, from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, recommends ulcer ne, Guinea grass, c lover, herds grass, and rice grass, as suitable for the south, and urges the cultivation of them upon the attention of the planters of Alabama, &c. He says: " During the winter, I have seen bundles of northern hay brought to the stables of my neighbors, which had paid for carriage many hundred miles round the capes of Florida and, through the Gulf of Mexico, and five hundred miles by the course of the river into the interior. This is a standing reproach to the agriculture of, the south." His letter may be found in the appendix No. 7. The results of an experiment given in the Journal of Agriculture for the purpose of proving the best depth for burying the different kinds of grass seed, slow that grass seed is usually harrowed too deep in the ground. The condensed account of the same, as taken from the Cultivator of February, 1845, may be found in the appendix just mentioned. We have also added to the same appendix a paper on the proper time for cutting, and mode of curing grass for hay, giving the opinions of different persons in the agricultural meeting in Albany in the early part of 1845. These are valuable, as embodying the experience of scientific men and practical farmers. Hemp. The crop of hemp is almost confined to a few western States. The estimate of the last year, as appears from the letter of Thomas D. Formanesq, of Louisville, Kentucky, contained in appendix No. 8, was not sufficiently large. We have taken that which he offers mostly as the basis for the estimate of this crop in 1845. The notices respecting the hemp crops of Kentucky are as follows. I n. June: " We learn that the hemp crop of this State and Missouri is in a most promising condition, and bids fair to be greater than in any previousyearLouisville (kentucky) Courier. Later in the season: " We understand that in some neighborhoods the present hemp crop is very deficient both in the quality and quantity of its lint; so much so that it is believed that it will not average one third the usual crop Lexington I inquirer. The crop is variously estimated by others, from whom we have derived information, at from "' 25 per cent. to one third more" than the crop of 144. The following gives an account of the receipts at Days ville: <a< The receipts of hemp in the Days ville market for the month of October, including a small amount from one of the establishments not hitherto reported, amount to 69 3 tons; making the total received, shipped, or manufactured for the ten months of the year 1845, up to the close of October, 5,008 tons. He suppose that the amount which will be received in the months of November and December will swell the total receipts of the year to 6,000 tons 260: a. The On. A. Seat ty stated in a letter last year (see report for 1844) that the receipts at Mtysville would comprehend one third of the hemp crop of Kentucky. The accounts respecting the hemp crop from Miss ou i are encouraging. We have supposed it to be increased. A variety of papers regarding the culture and preparation of hemp, &c will be found in appendix No. 8. Another, also, containing an account of or. Willingss mode of culture and preparing it, may be found among the articles in appendix No. 1, mentioned in, the letter of On. H. L. Ellsworth. Another still, translated from a German journal, contains a description of a mode practised in some parts of Europe, by which the process of preparation by water rotating is rendered comparatively easy, and the time consumed in the process is very considerably shortened. This, perhaps, still remains the great desideratum to ascertain the best and cheapest method of .water rotating it, so as that it shall compete with the Russian hemp. The modes of breaking it without rotating are all more or less liable to objections on account of injuring the fibre; and numbers of machines for this purpose) respecting which sanguine views have been entertained, have been discarded, on their application to general practice, as unsuitable for the object. The trials which have been made of American hemp, in comparison with Russian, during the past year, it is believed have resulted in satisfactorily demonstrating that the former is fully equal, i ff indeed, not superior to the latter. The following scrap from one of the public journals presents the comparative strength of cordage manufactured from the hemp of In diana, Kentucky, and Missouri: "the experiments, 100 on each kind, of similar appearance and like cleanliness from each State, were made at the navy yard in Boston, and they were made on rope 1- inch in circumference, viz :I n diana. Kentucky. Missouri. West -4 710 447 4 4 195 4700 408 2 4 160- 4 896 427 2 4192S14306 12 828 .12547SMean strength of In diana, 4 768; Kentucky, 4276; Missouri, 412. The usual test of Cigar is 4 400 to 4900. It would seem from these trials that the In diana hemp was nearest the test Again: "experiments were made at Louisville, Kentucky, a few days ago, with a machine for testing the strength, of cordage manufactured from hemp, which showed that American hemp, instead of suffering by a comparison with the Russian article, gained by the investigation. In the test of larger cordage, the Kentucky article sustained a much greater weight than that imported from Russia- Philadelphia Daily Chronicle. The results of the experiments just referred to and other similar information, will be found stated in the letters of Mr. Wanders, hemp agent, which, with the instructions of the honorable Secretary of the Navy, and several articles from the public journals relating to these subjects, are sub joined in appendix No. 8. A statement respecting the profit of raising hemp is furnished in, theStLouis Republican, which we quote at this time for the purpose of showing, that this crop deserves still more attention than it has yet received: " The
st Loufcid127s Republican says that Mr. T Long with, a farmer in Scott coin ty, Slihnois, who has, for two or three years past, water rotted his hemp, and bestowed great care upon it, ll st year kept an accurate account of the cost f cultivating and preparing for the market the product of 8 acresiclidingthe rent of the land, cost of seed, labor, and expense of getting it to market and the result was a net profit of                             $213.38. In estimating the cost of labor, a rans wages was charged at 75 cents per day, and an ox team at                                                         $1.50per day; but the most of the labor was done by himself and son, and the only out lay paid in money for extra hands and transportation was about                $40. The product of the last years crop from the 8 acres weighed 6,300pounds, and was sold a few days ago in the market at                                                                $115 per ton. 'The year before he sold his crop here at                                                                 $125 per ton. He sent a sample of his hemp last year to the navy agent at Boston, who, after testing it, pronounced it, in strength and texture, equal to the best Russian hemp. We must remark, however, that his is the best article which we have seen in this market ; but we are assured by him that hemp equally as good can, with proper care, be produced in other parts of I illinois and Missourisome hemp has been exported to England ; but it does not promise a very regenerating price, as we learn that it sold for only f 20 to '25. I tis, however, well spoken" of in the English papers." The American barkWestheag, which arrived at Dundee, Scotland, in the early part of this month, brought a quantity of hemp, intended to be used for purposes to which flax has been only hitherto applied. It is said to make very excellent yarn of small sizes, but it is feared that it will not bl each so well as flax. The price is so low that it stands the sinner considerably less than the flax, even after the expense of softening (4 to 5 per ton) has been added. We understand that I. Sharp, of Dundee, holds a patent for softening the article prior to its being used by the sinner." Again: "'A house in this city, during the past summer, made an experimental venture of fine hackledhermp, by taking out of each 100 points 50 pounds of tow, and sending one parcel to Boston, one to New Work, and one to Liverpool. That sent to New York was sold early, before the price declined, and brought                                                            $170 per ton; that sent ta. Boston was sold recently at                                                                $140 per ton ; and that sent to Liverpool is not yet sold, but they are advised by the steamer Greatbritain of its arrival, with the following "brokers report" viz: 'even bales hemp, good quality, picked and pretty even, worth: 21 per ton 21 sterling are equal to $)1 50, at the present rate of exchange; from which de duct the freight and charges, and there remains but about              $45 per. ton; whilst that sent to New York net ted about                                                                $140 per ton, and that to Boston                                                                $110 per ton. These             $45 are for a ton of hack led hemp to produce which, two tons of hemp from the farmers were used, worth 130. The tow which -was hack led out was worth about                $40 per tone thus making        $90 as the cost of what was worth in Liverpool net             $45. For will hemp in its rough state do much better. As we recently stated, another individual sent some to Liverpool that cost him    $62.50 per ton, by which he will lose about                           $23 per ton collar Farmer. An account is given in the It. Louis Missouri an of a kind of wild hemp found in Missouri, which seems to deserve attention and further investigation. We have not met- with any other mention of it. The It. Louismissourian says "that wild hemp has been found in that State. A farmer from It. Louis county, being in Captain Jenks hemp ,warehouse, accidentally saw some Vanilla hemp; made inquiry what it was; and, on being 262 informed that it was Vanilla hemp, said he had produced something exactly like, it from a weed on his farm, and that he would send in a sample, which, he -id ; and it proved to be a variety of the Vanilla hemp, resembling most, thiieNew Zealand hemp, but it undoubtedly belongs to the same genus as the New Zealand, His al, and It. Domingo hemp, from which all our heavy cordage is made. If this can be found in any quantity, it is a most valuable discovery." The Dear grass is also highly recommended for the same purpose. Although we have not included flax in the tabular estimate, yet it seems suitable to add a few things respecting this article in connection with the consideration of the hemp crop. The late invention of Mr. Willings, which is applicable to flax as well as to hemp, promises to render this crop more an object to our farmers. Flax is raised also for the seed, in some of the States, in large quantities. This is the case in parts of central New Work, where the increase the past year has been 50 per cent. over the crop for that purpose of 1844. A writer in the Cultivator of April last, 1845, from Waterloo, Seneca county, says: -the success of the Seneca county farmers in making the flax crop a succedaneum for the sun stricken fallow, has induced many farmers in the neighboring counties to adopt its culture Ohio, too, seems to be prominent in such a culture of this plant. An estimate is furnished in one of the public journals which shows that much success attends its cultivation in parts of the great western State of Ohio. Thus, it is saidSiax seed in the opening of the season a good deal of interest is felt in relation to the crop just harvested. The following, taken from the Baton 0) Register, is to the point: 'his article bids fair to rank among the most staple commodities of the farmer in this part of Ohio. For the last two years the farmers of Treble county have paid particular attention to the raising of flax seed. The crop this year is about an average one the drought in the early part of to* season injuring the crop somewhat for seed, and still more for lint. Mr. Penny, who is engaged in the purchase of seed, has furnished us with about the probable number of acres, &c raised in the county this year. Take the county over, it will average ten acres to every section. This would make -the number of acres raised, there being 432 sections in the county, 4,320. Calculating 8 bushels to the acre, would make 34,560 bushels, which, at 80 cents per bushel, would bring to the farmers of Treble county this year, for this commodity alone, the sum of                            $27,648.' The above estimate is undoubtedly low enough, not only in the number of acres and average yield, but in the price' Of Cincinnati it is stated: " The manufacture of linseed oil has also here assumed considerable importance, there being six extensive oil mills, which, together, are estimated to use about 150.000 bushels of flax seed yearly. This, at seven quarts of oil to the bushel of seed, will give upwards of 260,000gallons of oil. The oil cake is principally sent to New Orleans, and there shipped to Liverpool number of interesting articles relating to flax may be found in the appendix No. 9, on this subject. It has generally been believed that flax is an exhausting crop; but a writer quoted in the American Agriculturistholds the contrary opinion. Whether or not the view taken is admitted to be correct, it may at least deserve some investigation. In a paper read by or. Lane, before the Royal I wish Academy, he attempted to prove that in the production of the fibre no exhaustion of the soil tales place ; that sub Doc. Mob 4. 1240.:staee(cid:127)being. exclusively cot t posed of organic -after, derived from water and the atmosphere. He says that in this respect the fibre differs from the wood system which :surrounds it, as the latter, by combustion, yields a considerable quantity of ash, consisting of in organic compounds, derived from the soil. The wood y part is not removed from the farm, being of little value. The proportion of in organic matters contained in the <a name="seeds18"><mark>seeds</mark></a> is very small, compared with its entire bulk, so that, if consumed on the farm, flax is not an exhausting but a restoration crop The -same opinion is expressed by G. Nicholas, esq, in the Royal Agricultural Journal of England. He says: " It has often been said that flax is an exhausting crop, but it certainly is not more so than many of the usual grain crops; nor does it require a very rich soil. I need a rich or highly manured soil is injurious, causing the plant to grow too strong and luxuriant, and rendering the fibre coarse and less valuable. Flax is grown In light poor land in Belgium and Holland and nd I have seen it growing on mere bog in I re land n the Dark Laneexpress of July 18, Mr. Earner says that, under the improved system, the seed of flax is preserved without deteriorateing the fibre, and thus the crop is rendered doubly valuable. It must, on no account, be mowed or reaped, but pulled up by the roots. The best criterion for judging of the proper time for pulling it is precisely when the major part turns yellow, and the berne l of the principal ears brown. It is better to begin too early than too late. The method of pulling is merely to collect a small quantity in the left hand, and to pluck it with the right hand, placed about halfway down the s talks. The hands thus being quickly filled, it should be neatly spread in even rows on the ground. In the course of a day, or as the weather may be, turn it with a stick. When dried to the state in which hay would not heat in the s tack, tie it in small sheaves about two feet in circumference, and put it in a barn or s tack it. If tied up before dry, set it up in the field, pull out the weeds, tie long and short .stalk sin separate sheaves, &c. The subject of flax was discussed also in one of the meetings of the Farmers' Club, in New Work; and we have given some extracts from some of the opinions there expressed, in appendix No. 9. The papers read before the society for the improvement of flax culture in Great Britain, as they are contained in the agricultural papers of that country, have presented many important facts in relation to this crop. One containing directions for its culture and management we have inserted in our appendix No. 9, from the American Agriculturists of November, 1845. In some of the foreign journals, also, we find statements respecting the statistics of flax, which may be useful for reference. The yearly product of flax in Belgium is 2,560,000 cut, three fourths of which is from the two Glanders. The value of this harvest is said to be                $3,400,000, and for i it there is required 15 to 17,000 acres of land. By breaking, rotating, and drying, the weight is lessened one half, and it then equals            $4,000,000 in value. Byswingling and hetcheling, the weight sinks to 360,000 cut, but the value is thus increased to   $6,720,000 ; so that by the continued improvement of the flax it doubled in value by each process. The amount of flax and tow imported into the: United Kingdom of Great Britain is stated by a writer in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society to be, according: to Parliamentary returns, 1,437,150 cut. This is derived principally from n Russia 264 a. Russia, Holland; and *Belgitim. About 100,000 cut. of hetcheled flax is exported from Belgium to other countries. Or interesting letter on flax and the linen statistics of Austria, furnished by Mr. Fleischmann, may be found in appendix No. 9, extracted from the Washington Union. A: A species of flax, called the Chinese flax, has been mentioned in some of the agricultural periodicals as furnishing goods which resemble French cambric, having a silk y appearance, and which, it is stated, possesses more valuable properties than flax, owing to the length of staple and strength of fibre. It has been suggested as a valuable staple, which might be added to our products, but we have seen no particular description of it, or of its habits, culture, &c. In Fingers Polytechnic Journal for July, 1845, is an account of a new spinning plant, a species of urica or settle, which is stated to have been brought from China to France, and which is recommended there for trial. Tobacco. It is believed that increased attention is paid to the culture of tobacco in some of the New England States, though they cannot in any proper degree be considered tobacco growing States. The fertile lands in the Connecticut valley, from Hartford up to Sort hampton, have within a few years furnished very respectable crops of tobacco, and the produce of the crops there is said to be very good for the manufacture of cigars. The following are some of the notices we have gathered respecting it in the two States of Massachusetts and Connecticut, and by which we seem authorized to infer that it is a profitable and increasing crop in that section of our country. The Springfield Republican (massachusetts) says: "the cultivation of the tobacco plant has been very largely entered into in this town and vicinity within a year or two. One gentleman of this town has 26 acres of it this season. When success f idly cured it proves a very profitable crop, but its cultivation requires much care, and it exhausts the soil in a large degree. A correspondent of the Brooklyn Gazette says: " Tobacco is getting to be a great article in agriculture all along the valley of the Connecticut, and it' is said there is no land in the world that will produce so good and as much per acre as our land will. 1 have about three acres growing for the first trial, and if it prove a good crop I shall continue the cultivation of itSAiorrespondent of the Collar Farmer (by) says: " Though the season has been dry, the tobacco crops in Connecticut, I think, are much heavier than any I have seen in Kentucky. It is planted very 'thick 2 feet one way by 30 to 32 inches the other thick planting being requisite for good cigar leaf. To this secret of thick planting the Mason county (by) tobacco is indebted for its celebrity; and it is worthy of note that the secret was brought out to Kentucky by some Connecticut tobacco buyers. 2,000 lbs. Of tobacco to the acre is said not to be unusual in Connecticutagain, in the New York Farmer a correspondent says: " As the growing crop of tobacco is receiving attention and is raised to good profit, I must give you an estimate of the cost to Rise one acre, made by myself, with the help of friend L.; and he should know, as he has several acres which average one ton per acre, and sells at Warehouse Joint for eight cents per pound, or                                                             $160 per ton. Mr. L. says one ton per acre is a good crop, and probably more falls short than comes up to it, Now for the estimated.

Now, that crop other than tobacco would make so good a return? His is a act worthy of considerationNorthampton, November, 1845. The increase in these two States, we believe, may fairly be estimated at 20 per cent. over the crop of the preceding years n New Work, tobacco was not included in the returns of the late census, and therefore we are unable to form any tolerable estimate respecting it. In Pennsylvania, in the tobacco district, which lies principally, as appear from the census returns, along the Susquehanna h river, there seems to have been a small gain. The early accounts respecting the tobacco crop of Maryland were very discouraging. We sub join a few of the notices gathered on this subject. The tobacco growing region lies principally on the western side of the Chesapeake bay, and includes Prince George, Salver t, Charles, and Anne Run del counties. In April, the Upper Malborogazette, Prince George county, says: "for several days past the weather has been cold and blustering, and serious apprehensions are felt for the plants of the second sowing of tobacco seed. The first was killed some weeks ago, and the beds re sown. A continuation of this weather for any length of time must so far retard the plants as to render a short crop inevitable Again, in May: 'the prospect for a tobacco crop is rather gloomy at present. The fly is making sad havoc with the young plants, and will continue to destroy them so long as the harsh weather continues. His time last year many farmers had commenced planting their crop; now, we know of some who were sowing their seed for the third time on the first of this week. The crop must be far below an average one." The Leonardtown Deacon, in July, speaking of this crop, says: "the tobacco crop, we think, will fall short of the crop usually raised, but not to that extent which was at one time anticipated. The rains which have recently fallen: have had a very be ff coal effect upon the tobacco planted late, which now bids fair to make the f her ample returns for his labor. It is impossible, though, we think, that this tobacco can cure well, as it must necessarily be cut in a green state; the season being 're too far advanced tocid127admitof its ripe ring. The most of that Which was planted early in the265SDoc. To- 140.season has been already cut and housed, and the rest will be, sptlentlyripe to cut in the course of a few days The American Farmer also says: "the tobacco plants severely 'offered by the frosts and drought, but the very favorable weather which thpiplanters have enjoyed since the middle of June will we trust had caused a decided improvement in their prospects of are of this great table of Maryland and Virginia." Met later the accounts, are in October. The Sort Tobacco (maryland) Times says : h The tobacco crop, from what we learn, has been with us ana average one, but we are apprehensive that the hasty manner in which some of it was housed, and the recent wet arid n favorable weather for curing it, may have had a tendency toe change its complexion." The It. Marys Deacon of the 2 3d says: " We understand that several of our farmers had their tobacco seriously injured by the frosts which fell during the early part of last week The Marlboro' Gazette of October 17 says: " Last Thursday, Friday, and Saturday were very un propitious days for the tobacco crop. Almost every one had housed their crop, and the close, damp, and rainy weather at this stage of curing soon rots it. Friday, in particular, was most injurious. We have not learned the amount of damage, but it cannot be inconsiderable, judging from the quantity recently carried to the house; hurried there, in many instances, from a fear of frosts. Years are entertained that the unfavorable ~eat her for curing tobacco in Charles county, and the frosts in It. Marys, have seriously injured the crop." We are informed however, that a larger quantity than usual has been inspected in the Baltimore market. The American says: " The quantity of tobacco which will be inspected at Baltimore the present year will exceed 60,000 hogs head sa larger amount than was ever inspected at Baltimore in any one yer and about double the average of inspections from 1825 to 1828." Notwithstanding the apprehensions expressed there for, we believe that the crop was considerably larger than that of the previous year, which, it will be recollected, fell off from that of 1843. The omission of the millions in the table for this State the last year, (a clerical error, which was corrected in most of the printed copies) will be recollected. We have restored the proper numbers in the present estimate. Virginia is among the foremost tobacco growing States; but for a few years past the crop in this State has not been so successful as formerly. The early notices respecting its appearances the past season were un promising. Thus, the Petersburg I intelligence r of April 15, speaking of the frost and cold winds, says: " The second sowing of tobacco will produce but few plants, and a third must generally be resorted too, in May: (did 127) Great complaints, too, have reached us in respect to the tobacco plants. Any planters indulge the apprehension that the injury is irreparable, and that under the most favorable circumstances not more than half an average crop can be reasonably anticipated The Richmond Compile r says: "there was at first, as is usually the case, an alarm about the scarcity of tobacco plants. It is now thought, however, that there will b, generally enough to plant the crop. Plants are more abundant than they were last year. I are was great complaint on an river last spring; we learn that there is :very little now n July, also, a correspondent of one of the public journals, under date of Richmond, states c With regard to the tobacco crop, many doubtsareentertainedon account of the want of rain. Reports from the counties between this city and the Blue Ridge are very discouraging. Not one in. 267 a hundred of the tobacco planters have this year put in the ground more than o half their usual quantity; and that is perishing from the drought. The region of country above alluded to is one of the principal tobacco districts, " The tobacco crop, the Virginia papers say, must necessarily be short; not more than half a crop has been planted, and the want of sufficient seasons has caused it to stand badly, and but little will be topped before August. The Lynchburg Virginian says that many planters in that region have been unable, for want of a season, to plant as much as usual and no small quantity of that planted has since died, or has been materially injured." In August we meet with conflicting accounts. Thus, the Richmond Whig of the 28th says: " The tobacco is in very many cases the largest ever known or seen ; and, by its unusual size, will bring up the crop to an approach to average far beyond anticipation Other journals speak very discouraging ly. Thus, a letter from Elbe marie county, dated the 25th, states that, on account of the drought, ' the tobacco crop will be very light indeed. Some of the farmers have been obliged to send 40 miles to supply their farms withmealAgain: "the tobacco crop will be, beyond all question, a short one. In the counties below us, as well as here, the planters did not succeed in getting an average crop planted; and since it was put in the ground the season has been most un propitious. The plant is now becoming premature ly ripe in many places ; and in others, the bud has been b lighted by the excessive heat of the sun. There can be no doubt but that there will be far less than the usual crop brought to he house n September, also: -the: Virginia tobacco crop is likely to turn out small; not one in a hundred of the tobacco planters in the best tobacco growing region have planted more than half their crop, and that is perishing from the drought Charlottesville letter, published in the Richmond Whig, says that the tobacco crop in Tucking ham, Amherst, and Elson counties, Virginia, will not exceed more than half the usual yield. Albemarle, it is also stated, will fall short onethirdStill later, we are told by one who has traversed the valley country The most sanguine do not count on half a crop of tobacco. Some neighborhoods are worse than others; but all are bad; and from numerous inquiries, I fear it is generally the case in Virginia, between the Blue Ridge and the head of tide water." -again: " From all I can learn, I am satisfied that there will not be more than half a crop of tobacco in Virginia this season. The season was unusually unfavorable for planting, and hence the stand is greatly less than what it otherwise would have been ; and then, from the dry weather, the yield from what is standing will be small. The recent rains have been very copious, and will prove very beneficial to the tobacco and to the later planted corn. I observe some tobacco planted since the rain, and this, with a late fall, will yield well." The Lynchburg Virginian says, that " a great deal of forward tobacco that had been cut and hung in the open air for the sun curing process was injured, and some of it destroyed by the heavy rains on the 10th and 11th October. In the Southern Planter for October, we find similar estimates: The growing crop of tobacco in Virginia must, we presume, from the nature of things, be a very short one. The early season was very un propitious to the growth of plants, and every man that had cabbages to set out knows 268 .
thiatit was almost impossible to obtain a stand' The drug it tis t have seriously affected, those plan to that did live, and we' greatly fear hat atheAugust rains were very productive of fire and rot. From what little we know of the crop, we should imagine that, take it through and through, a worse season could hardly, in the course of nature, occur again again, from a correspondent of the same journal, who writes from Mecklenburg: "I n relation to the amount of the tobacco crop planted, you will have a variety of statements. The general opinion here is, that not more than half a crop was planted till the August rains set in ; that part cannot make tobacco. The first plantings are very badly missing, but have improved surprisingly, and now promise to make good tobacco if we have a late and favorable fall Our other information is of the same cast generally. Thus, one writes to us respecting the eastern central section of the State, lying east of the Blueridge : " The crop will scarcely reach half the usual average. Plants, owing to the late frosts and dry spring, were very scarce, so that but little if any) more than half the usual crop was planted. The plantings, too ere unusually late, so that there is much danger even yet, (october 6th.):Aharge ; quantity must be cut' in order to save it from frosts. Upon the: ho led, I feel very certain, after very particular inquiries, that the crop will not, as before observed, reach the usual one." Still further to the east, the decrease is estimate at 'a, 25 per cent less." In the central southern section it is thought to have fallen off as much as (a( 33_ per cent' and in thelrorthwestern corner of the State to have been i "one fourth less" than the crop of 1844. Although the crop was much less than an average one, yet the fact must be taken into consideration that it has decreased largely for a few years past. The decline, then, from the past years crop, may not exhibit so large a falling off as it otherwise would. We believe that, on the whole, it has not fallen off more than about 15 to 20 per cent, if even this decline may not, perhaps, be too large. The tobacco crop of North and South Carolina suffered also severely by the drought, and in some places fell off 25 to 30 per cent. The millions omitted by a clerical error in the table of the last report, for North Carolina, have been restored. hi Georgia, the injury appears not to have been equally great; and in some parts of this State, we are informed there has been increased cultivation of this product. The crops in the northwestern part of the State have been good. Were attention is now paid to the culture of tobacco in Florida. The following statements are gathered from the public journals in relation to this subjectbTobacco in Floridathe lo price of cotton last year induced the planters in Alton, Washington, and other counties of Florida, to raise tobacco ; the result was so, favorable, that this year they are going into the culture on a large scale Again : A letter recently received from Florida shows that this new member of our family of States is about to set up a rivalry with old Virginia, as to which is to be hereafter the tobacco State of the Union. It says " Everybody here is going into the tobacco culture, which promises to replace the orange, as it requires no machinery, and the poorest can engage in it. Theexpbriments that have been made, notwithstanding the worst season ever known, have proved extremely encouraging. The article is of a superior quality, and commands a high price in New Work from 40 to 80 cents. 
 26. H--, who has just arrived from thence, states that the choice qualities will :boy and this latter price. There will be much done in it here the next ye 70 and there is e    very prospect of its becoming the staple of Florida. We have felt justified, accordingly, in giving a very considerable increase to the tobacco crop of Florida. It is stated in some of the public journals that 1,000 to 1,500 pounds have been raised on an acre in Tallahassee. There has been some increase, also, in the crops of Alabama and Mississippithe tobacco crop of Tennessee, in the northern part of the western district, as we are told in July, was very promising. In some portions of the State, however, it was more unfavorable. At a later date we learn that there was about an average crop in the State, which, as the crop of the preceding year was also an increase on that of 1843, we suppose will give a moderate gain. The early accounts of the tobacco crop of Kentucky were unfavorable. The late frosts in the spring, it was thought, would so greatly injure the crop as very much to cut off the hopes of the planter. Thus we find it stated in April. Green river (4ff) tobacco crop The last number of the Hopkins ville. Gazette has the following: 'the heavy frosts and cold nights of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday last, have, we are informed, injured the young tobacco plants terribly. Oneigentleman told us that his were all killed, and that he had burnt new beds and sowed again, but without expectation at this time of the season of being able to raise any plants. Should this be the case generally, (and, as the ground was frozen half an in c li or more, we see no reason why -t is not) .the tobacco crop of this section will fall short immensely Again, the Days ville Eagle of May 24 says: (a( The scarcity of tobacco plants, even if the season for planting be not too far advanced, will operate to produce a short crop in this region The crop, however, proved better than had been anticipated. In some places, indeed, it was i only tolerable, while in others it is said to have been very good in quantity perhaps not quite equaling that of the last year but in quality surpassing it, and in value fully equal to it. The planters we are told, do not fire their tobacco as much in curing it as formerly There are several stem series in the. State, in which large quantities are stripped and prepared for the British market. In parts of Ohio considerable" attention is paid to the cultivation of tobacco. " The editor of .the Liberty Advocate, of Radio, Harrison county, says that in passing through Guernsey county, he was much surprised to see the vast amount of tobacco raised by the farmers. Almapst every farmer had his tobacco, and a great i many paid little or no attention to any other branch of agriculture, on the ground that no other work so abundantly repaid labor." In Miamitownship, we are informed that there was raised 200 000 pounds; and in the southwestern section of the State the increase is estimated at 25 per cent. more" than in 1844. "the crop may have been from 10 to 15 per cent. more. -the same was probably the case in In diana and I illinois. I need, in some parts of these States, the increase is thought to have been as high as" to to 30 per cent." :his, however, would probably be too great an average for the whole State. :the earlier statements respecting the tobacco crop in Missouri were most 270 run promising. Thus it is said in the It. Louis Era, May 5: 'a( Those engaged in the tobacco cultivation have had a good opportunity too t their ground in a proper state of cultivation, but the planting season of that crop has -not yet arrived is the season advanced, however, the prospects brightened; as we learn from the It. Louis Republican, of July 2, that "i the crop of tobacco is better than was anticipated in the early part of the season." Met, in some sections, there was not the same success in its culture. The Hamiltonjournal of July 24 says : " The tobacco crop in this section, so far as we can learn, is next to a total failure; owing, we believe, to the fact that the early part of the season was so dry that it was impossible to rear the plants. We are informed, however, that further in the interior, and on the Missouri river, the prospect is more flattering." The Fulton Telegraph also says: " We should not speak of a tobacco crop in Missouri this year at all; there is an almost entire failure in plants; there are loud complaints n September the Glasgow Pilot says: "the tobacco crop, which has been very promising in this neighborhood, is very much injured recently by the tobacco worm, which is more destructive than has ever been known here. We have ridden by several fields of tobacco, the leaves of which are tattered by them as if cut up by a severe hail storm. The old ground, seems to suffer most Again : The It. Louis Republican of the 12th instant says: "he are sorry to hear dismal accounts of the coming tobacco crop in this State. I nm any if not most of the counties oh the Missouri there has been a very general failure of the plants in consequence of the, cold and unfavorable weather; and those who persist in attempting to raise them must rely on the most favorable aspect of the weather to bring them to maturity. In Franklin county, noted for the production of our finest tobacco, the planters are substituting corn, and elsewhere others are putting in hemp. Unless a very great change takes place in the prospect, there will be an almost entire failure in the tobacco crop. Timely rains have improved the prospect in the country bordering on the Mississippi." Of   here was, on the whole, probably an increase, though not large, as there was a considerable falling off the year before. The whole tobacco crop, therefore, for the United States, may be estimated at 187,422,000 pounds; which is about an average crop, as it is nearly 10 per cut. above that of the year before, which probably did not equal an average one. The quality of some of the crop is spoken of as fine. Thus one of the public journals says: "he clip the following from a It. Louis paper, from which it will be seen that there is all advantage in raising good tobacco a swell as good anything else. ' The first premium for the best manufacturing tobacco, at the planters' warehouse, a few days since, was taken by Samueljeffries, of Franklin county. It was afterwards purchased by T. Campbell, of this city, for the high price of                           $22.25 per hundred pounds. The second was taken by W. E. Cells, of Like county, and was bought by Price & Merry for                              $20.25.' "the following statements respecting the exports of tobacco from New. Orleans we find also in one of our papers, and give it, as it furnishes some idea of the progressive importance of this cropSExports of tobacco from New Orleansthe shipment of tobacco, it will be seen, has been nearly trip led within the last 10 years from the ports. 2712Sof New Orleans, and is within a fraction of the entire quantity exported fromthcid127e In States in 1833 83 153 hogs heads.

To the editors of the Times and Compile r: " Gentlemen : We give above the statistics of tobacco inspection is, stock, and foreign exports, for the present fiscal year, ending 30th multi mo. Is regards the inspections, they have been increased several thousands by re inspecting re prized tobacco. In reference to stock, a large portion consists of crops inspected in 1843 and 1844, nearly all of common quality. In reference to the product of Virginia and North Carolina this year, there have been throughout the season conflicting opinions entertained. The planting in May was probably equal to about one half an average crop. The drought early in June till the 1st of August was so intense and general as to prevent planting to much extent; yet in some neighborhoods there were occasional favorable seasons for transplanting; and such l opportunities being embraced in June and July, probably made the entire planting to 1st of August equal to 35,000 or 38 000 hogs heads. From 1st to 10th August, perhaps the plantings were equal to 5,000 or 6,000 hogs heads. Since the 1st of August the weather has generally been as propitious as could have been desired to hasten the growth and mature the tobacco crop; and should there not be a killing frost before the 20th of this month, the crop produced this year will be about 38,000 hogs heads of merchant able quality." Respectfully, "JONES & Blai Roctober 6, 1845."I n a letter received by the late Commissioner of Patents in March last from Dr. Use, of Last Cambridge, . Maryland, well known to the agricultural public, alluding to a parcel of Spanish tobacco seed sent by him to this office, he says he has manufactured remarkably fine cigars from the leaf raised by himself from seed imported direct from Cuba" they will equal the famous regal was." He says that he prefers the : principe" tobacco, but has never but once (seven years ago) obtained that variety. ,he states that his cigars from that tobacco were admired in New Work, at Saratoga and Philadelphia, and every where, by the most fastidious in taste. He sold them for                                                              $14 per box of a thousand cigars each. His crop for the year 1845 he estimated at that date would amount to 600,000 cigars, which he intended to manufacture himself on his plantation. Several interesting papers, relating to the culture of tobacco, &c, taken from various agricultural papers, will be found in appendix No. 10.  Among these is a description of the mode of cultivation in Connecticut and Kentucky, taken from the Collar Farmer, the editor of which refiarksthat the same kind (a" the fine cigar leaf) is cultivated in both States, to   hough the soils are quite different. In Connecticut the plants stand about 3 feet apart, and in Kentucky 3- feet from each other. A paper, also, on the Cuba mode of cultivation, from the Floridian, and W. W. Tillers (ofAlbemarle, Virginia) method, from the Southern Planter, and Mr. Enables observations on the spot in tobacco, also from the Southern Planter, will be read with, interest by those engaged in the cultivation of this product. Cotton. The cotton crop of our country is one of deep and absorbing interest to a large portion of our population. It is one which exercises great influx. 273 once over our commercial progress and enterprise, and influences to a wide extent our relations with foreign nations. It is desirable, therefore, to obtain as accurate a history of its growth, from year to year, as may be in our power. Met there is scarcely, perhaps, another crop respecting which we may not reach more approximating correctness at the period at which our estimates are made. The very fact that it is of so mighty an influence, and enters so largely into the whole foreign market of our country, renders it less easy to know what to believe of the accounts which we meet with in the various public journals. Not that there is any want of materials, such as they are; for the notices of the crop are most frequent. But the difficulty lies in ascertaining what reliance may be placed on them, and how far the different, and often conflicting reports, must be set down as designed to subserve private interest. Such materials, however, as we have, we have endeavored to apply; and if we have failed sometimes in drawing conclusions, we believe that the same difficulty would be experienced by almost any one, and perhaps many would not be even as successful in approaching to the true state of the case. From all that we can learn, the aggregate of the crop as estimated last year, was nearer to the annual report finally made up from the receipts at the principal ports than were the conjectures of many others about the same period in which we made the attempt. -the quantity of cotton made in Maryland and virginia is so small, comparatively, that it will scarcely affect the estimate. The drought probably lessened it somewhat. In North Carolina the same evil, as we have seen in treating of other drops, was most severely felt, and the estimates made vary from" 50 to 75 per cent." less than the last years crop. -his is probably too high an average; but we believe it must have fallen short at least " about one third In South Carolina, in June, we are told that "the cotton crop, in some sections, will be very good. That' which was planted early is promising, while the late crop will be indifferent." Again, in the same month: "' Forward cotton subscribe r of ours in Edge field district (says the Hamburg, S. C. Journal) informed us, on Wednesday that he had plenty of cotton squares on his field, and that within ten days or less he would send us some blooms .a." Again, in July: 1 Early cotton The Edge field (S. Cadvertiser, of the 19th instant, says: Colonel F. W. Dickens has left at our office some cotton balls which were full grown on the 4th instant. They, were pulled from one of, his fields at Edge wood, near this place. We understand that cotton is beginning to open at the same plantation." In Pendleton, it is said cotton is flourishing ; and though the plant is not so tall as usual, the number of balls is greater." -discouraging accounts, however, are given of the Tea island crop .in the same month. ' In South Carolina the excessive heat has destroyed everything but cotton, which stands drought better than anything else. His crop on the sea islands is, according to the Courier, in a peculiar situation. The early planting in March came up. and grew kindly, and still promise we l. The early plantings, in April, are half up, and. the fields show an irregular stand ,of plants from 6 inches to 2 feet high. The latter planting s did not come up .till the 20th .of May, and are of course unusually backward, and exposed :t the vicissitudes of storms, cater pillar, and early frost. It is possible, but is by no means probable, that the plant may escape all 1874 To bc.

Mr. -a- was here yesterday, and offered to take 20 bales for his crop. He made 90 bales last year from the sown ground. Some planters from Was per county say that they shall not make 160 lbs. to the acrelMacon, August 20, 1845.-There cannot be more than, 75,000 bales received in Bacon. Last year 136,000 bales were received at Bacon writer also from Griffin, Jefferson county, says: " Cotton is small and stunted, and although it can do with less rain than corn, will fall considerably short of an average crop throughout the State. In the upper counties the seasons have been more favorable, and the crops are good Again: "savannah, August 23.-Our cotton market, if it can be said we have one, remains without change, and during the past week we have no the aid of a solitary bale changing hands. The accounts from the interior are more and more gloomy every day of the growing crop; and unless we are greatly favored, the crop in this State will be materially cut off Again: 'he have cherished the hope for some time past" says the Bacon (leo) Messenger of the 2 1st inst, that a change of the season might materially benefit the prospects of' the cotton crop. But the drought has now so long prevailed that very little benefit could be derived from a change of the season. I tis only in very limited sections of the State that the crop can be a middling or an average one; in other parts it must be a very short one, .:A correspondent of the Columbia Inquirer, a planter, who states that he has lately travelled 300 miles in the heart of the State, says: " The cotton crop is in a precarious state, and there is not ,the slightest prospect of an average crop in this State. A few days more will seal its fate. The failure of the cotton crop will greatly aggravate the suffering of the people of Georgia' 'A i public journal estimates the Georgia crop at three-eighths of the average yield, and ii' some counties of the State one eighth to one half. (a( Some planters in Was per county say they will not make 100 lbs. to the acre. Atmacon, it is estimated that not over 75,000 bales will be received this years against 136,000 in 184445The subsequent accounts are 'more favorable. Thus ;ici d 127) It ober, theMilledgeville (leo) Recorder says: " Our unusually mild fall has changed in a slight "measure the prospect through this portion of the State, in referee n to the yield of the cotton crop. From all we can 6 now learn, from' all sources, as well as from personal observation- which by the be, has not been limited we have e come to the conclusion that, from the late growth having more fully matured than was at one time anticipated, there will be realized about two thirds of a crop, The article in general, however, will not be found as good staple, or be altogether as fair in quality, as usual. This arises from the balls having been premature ly forced open by theSdroaght before they had obtained their growth, and subsequent rains havingfrieqtuetlystaintedp the late picking. Again: Florence, on the Chattahooche, A, October , 1845.- Since. 217 my last the prospect is better for the cotton crop in this section, and I am now of opinion we shall gather nearly a full crop in this county, as the several growths on the uplands have nearly all matured, and considerable of it opening at this time. We have not yet had a killing frost, and the weather is now fine for the growth. of cotton. Our first picking here was not so good in quality, but the second is pretty cotton, and I think the quality will be as good as the average of the season' Line coltonThe Augusta Chronicle and An tinel of the 3 1st ultimosays : ' A sale of 100 bales of cotton, a part of the crop of W. J. Ve, of this county, was sold on Wednesday, at eight cents per pound, and yesterday a lot of 48 bales of the crop of F. Merriwether, of Oglethorpe county, brought seven and three-fourths cents. They were both very choice lots, in square packages' "from other sources, it is stated that, in the central section, lying west of the Ocmulgee river, there has been about 'three eighths of an average crop." Higher up it was better. In the northwestern corner of the State it is estimated that the crop was cut short at least "one half" We believe that the average decrease of 20 to 25 per cent. will be a fairer est innate. The prospect of the cotton crop in Alabama, in June, was decidedly good. It was considered fully a fortnight later, indeed, than the previous season. Somewhat nearer the close of the month the account from Mobile is stated to be, that insects and the disease known in the country as "sore skin" rendered the appearance less promising in some of the counties From other sections of the interior, however, the accounts are still favorable, and, although the season has generally been admitted as two weeks later than last, it will be remarked that the first cotton blooms appeared a day or two earlier this season in our own State, and about a week sooner, in Mississippi n :the 24th ulm. full. blown blooms were seen in Warren county, in this State, and balls as large as, musket balls on the 1st inst: The early bloom of cotton is regarded by many as indicating a long season, or a late frost, and consequently a large crop. The numerous casualties, however, to which this plant is exposed, and the long period yet to elapse before the crop can be considered made, should admonish us of the facility of speculating on the subject for months to come fn July, we learn' The cotton is suffering from lice in consequence of the un seasonable weather. A fine rain and warmer mornings would brighten the prospects of the coming crop considerably Again, the Mobile Journal says: " We still hear complaints of injury to the cotton crop from continued drought; but probably, ere this, those sections of the country have been visited with a sufficiency of rain to reviving the drooping plant. Correspondents from the interior begin to be apprehensive of t greater injury from the excess of rain from this time till the close of the season. In Marion county, Alabama, the cotton crop had commenced falling, but could wait longer for rain without much injury. The growth is not so large as last year at this time, and, unless we have too much rain in August, will yield an average crop. The River State Review, of the same place, of the 9th instant, says: We have had but very little rain, but the cotton crop is not injured, but very promising to, in August. Extract of a letter dated Montgomery, :alabama, August 14: "our corn and cotton crops will be very short in this section this season, in consequence of the long drought we have had. New cotton begins to come in freely. Prices range from 6 to 7 cents at. I intelligence r. Again, in the New York Farmer: " Alabamathe cotton crop will 278

Of i this crop we will give- n more than this passing notice, it beingooneofimpoirtance to the world. The -stands of cotton, when; first :iing, were the best we ever saw; and we have heard the same expression everywhere we have been; it present, this is not so. Gulch injury has been sustcid127ainediby- the cut worn and the cotton louse ; some planters have .been po impelled to re plant very largely since the :5th of May. :he saw, someeotonthat had just} risen ,on the 7th of June.

Taking all this together, we place the crop as last year, as to quantity cultivated. If we sum up the whole pros and :con staking into consideration the- unfavorable season, with the: backwardness of cleaning the crops, we do not think the cotton crop will be as good i generally on the 20 th of June as it was last year from the first toi the Off th. To human being can prognosticate thus early but we may each one count on not making what we (did last yearSThe Planters' Manner of the 20th September likewise furnishes information from the same writer, still later: "or. Of  . W Phillips of Kinds county, Mississippi, writes :us as follows, under v date of -the 7th instant: I haveimadeinquiry as to he present crop. But few planters can be induced to give an opinion. One planter who has made short crops for several years letting his negroes manage :themselves told me last night that he andfeourher neighbors t together, would not make what he made last year 25 bales.

This subtracted from last years crop, adding the supposed loss by overflow, will make the present crop less than 2,300,000bales. Will it exceed 2,000,000?"' .a. The following is of a later date; it appears in the Savannah Republican of October 31 : ' We are indebted to friends in this city for the :following extracts of letters in relation to the crop. Up to this time there has not been a killing frost in this States and the weather is now unusually warm and very favorable for maturing the plant. 'folly Springs, Miss; October 18, 1845.--Since the early part of September the weather has continued dry and very favorable for picking a swell as maturing the young balls of cotton; and the planters having made good use of the time, have already picked out a great deal more than they expected to make a few weeks ago. From all the information I have and my business and situation enable me to hear from every part of northernMississippiwe shall make the largest crop of cotton that' has ever been made in this State. In several of the river counties the planters are making 2000 and 2,500 pounds to the acre; and I think the average product ill most of the counties in this region will be 1,000 pounds to the acre. A bales to the acre is very common on the valley lands. The quality is also very fine, having been picked without any rain The information obtained still later is of considerable diversity. In parts of the State there has been :an increase; in others, a falling off. In the southwestern portion, for example, lying 'west of. the Earl river and south of the Razor river, the increase is thought to have been c 5 to 10 per cent There was an increased' cultivation in i the northern: portion of the State, though the amount per acre .may not have exceeded if it equalled the: crop of 1844.: In the whole, it is believed that the crop for the State was larger than in the previous year by 15 to 20 per cent. above. the estimate for that year, which it would appear was too low. The cotton crop of Louisiana was, we think, better than that of the previous year. The drought affected it considerably, early in the season, and some complaints are made of insects. But the long period of dry weather, enabled the planters to get out the grass from among the cotton, so that the evil was in a measure counter balanced. ;-I n July, the Natchitoches Chronicle of the 5th says: "from all parts we hear favorable accounts of the crops. The rust, which made its appearance in some cotton fields a few weeks since, has done little' injury and disappeared. :other notices in August read in this manner: " The crops in the perishes f . Last and West . Baton Gouge, says the Gazette of the 9th instant, have not generally, for several years, presented as promising an appearance as they do at present. The planters at Joint Couple are busily engaged in picking their cotton. The staple is represented to be generally of a fine text u renew Orleans Picayune' The cotton crop has suffered very much ; and now that the picking has commenced, planters are beginning to see better the damage that has been done by the falling off of the forms, and otherwise. A friend, who has been travelling over this and a number of the neighboring parishes, informs us that the hopes entertained by the planters a fortnight ago it is now certain will not be realizedConcordia I intelligence r. -subsequently, in September, &e, complaint is made in some parts of frost and rains, 'the Faint An dry (a) Whig, of the 8th instant, says: "EOr
. 281 two weeks past we have had rain every day; sometimes in perfect floods at others in but gentle showers. The consequence is, cotton is suffering very considerably. We thought it advisable to say nothing of these rains last week, hoping they would abate, and enable us to assure our friends that the damage was but small; yet it is otherwise. Our prospect in the beginning of the season was most propitious; but if we say now that at least one-fourth of the crop will be lost, from the rain and rust, we, certainly are below the actual mark. These are lamentable truths which it gives us pain to chronicle." :again : " The frosts that occurred during the early part of last week have been sufficient to check effectually the growth of cotton on the low glands. The calculation is, then, certain, that balls of the: blossoms of the 1 5th September cannot make, or rather mature- Concordia (a) I ntelThe Clinton brought down 1,420 bales of cotton. The Monarch brought 1,S08 bakes. The Sultan a 2,764 bales, the largest load yet. Taking 6,092 bales on three boats, arriving within an hour or two of one another New Orleans. Trophic, October 27. Again : "the cotton planters have had most favorable weather for picking, and we hear no more of a short crop. It will not, however, be much ;possibly no larger than that of last season, Prices range from 61 to 8 cents The information since obtained speaks of an increase of 10 per cent. more, in consequence of the overflow which was caused by the creases of the last year, (1844) There was more, cultivated, and the general crops of the alluvial lands were rather heavier, in consequence of the dry weather; and the decrease of the cotton; crop in ,the upland by reason: of the) drought ;in the whole, it is believed it will average i 10 per cent, more. The same was probably the case in Arkansas, if the ratio was not even larger, on account of more land being brought uydercutivation: I t, is believed, however, that any increase in .this way m m may have been balanced ~a~ by the emigration further west. Florida, since it has been open to cultivation by the re settlement of the country on account of peace, has gained i her crops of all kinds; and her cotton has increased probably 20 to 25 per cent, as it lies so much further south. Of  n July, it is said, in one of the public journals: -a' We hear that a good crop of cotton is expected. The Floridian of the 5th instant says : 'he were presented yesterday with an open, ball of new cotton picked on the 1st. The staple is fine and beautiful, and: would rival the snow in whiteness. We believe this to be the first ball of cotton that has been picked in this county this season' "again : " The cultivation of this valuable staple seems destined no longer to be confined to the limited section of country that has hitherto produced it. Several attempts have been made to extend its cultivation in other places; and many of these attempts have proved quite successful. Thetallahassee Floridian states that five or six samples of cotton, raisedinMiddle Florida, were lately exhibited in that place; and after being examined by competent judges, were pronounced to be worth from 22 to 30 cents per pound. The best specimen was raised on light, sandy soil, which would produce about 325 pounds to the acre. Two of the samples, grown on pine land, would yield about the same quantity. ,brother sample, grown on red clay soil, was equally good ; and, altogether, the experiments were quite encouraging 22 Di.

Sahnarticle in the Foreign Qtuarterly Review of July, 1845, deserves also sob fe notice, on 'ac to it of the deldopment if plans suggested to aid this movement. The 'sect discussed is : Railways 'in I india." The writer says: (among these, if we commence operations. with the 'Dec can, the first important' by far will be cotton, of which a sufficient quantity may speedily be ra ised in I india to render tis completely independent of: the slave States f 'Arneica. And here 'we may briefly allude to a fact, which will not be regarded with indifference by the friends of humanity: A company Has just been established ii London expressly for the purpose of roth tiding the i cultivation of -ottoncid127in I india ; primarily with a. view of coittnfg slavery, by depriving it of the aliment on which it feds. But, in whatever motive 'such an association may ii ave originated, its results cannot fail to prove beneficial to commerce. Recently, great efforts have beeniiadeto improve the equality of cotton in the collector ate of Soon ah. I none 6disiict a ri extremely fine' sort, equal to the best Earache, has been inftiedcid, and fetches a very high price at Bombay. In other parts arrangements a ire making for cultivating the New Orleans cotton, which the 284 most experienced agriculturists in western I india expect will thrive admirably, It will be comparatively of little avail, however, to expend; money on, the great cotton grounds of I india, unless, at the same time, we provide the means of conveying the produce: of, those grounds on the coast. This consideration chiefly, perhaps, has suggested to Mr. J, Chap man, a man of :remarkable abilities and extensively acquainted with the country, the propriety of running the first line of rail way across the Dec can, from Bombay on one side to Coriuga on the other. Tlfhe line would commence at Bombayrunalong a cause way to the island of Salsettereach the main land by means of a bridge thrown over what is called the Hannah river; and their traversing the To can, ascend the slope of the Ghautspass by Soon ah, a city of 130,000 inhabitants, and, di verging towards the north, cross the district of Ahmednugger ; sending out branches to Shulapore on the one hand, and Dato da on the other.  From Ahmednugger, following the great valley of; the Soda very, it would project itself eastward, till, through the Bheercicars, it entered the Liza ms dominions. Proceeding across Under, and sending forth an important branch northward to Oomrawutty and. Nagpore, which might ultimately be carried over the Nerbudda to Allahabad, it would intersect the cigar of Eilgundel; whence it is proposed that a branch should be carried southward to Hyderabad, theNizams capital a city larger than Paris, and containing 80,Q000 inhabitants. It is intended that this branch line shall afterwards be carried, across the Kisnato Had ras, from which port it is calculated that 134,000 tons of merchandise are now annually shipped. From n Eilgundel the trunk line would stretch through Tullangoar, Warangal, Kummumet, and Rajahmundry, l to poriugayprobably crossing the Soda very where is channel is intersected by numerous islands. Hence the railroad would be carried i through. the northerncicarsand the province of Drissa, to Calcutta. Among the advantages of this line, there, are some few which appear to be deserving of especial notice. Upon the first and greatest we have already touched we mean, that it would intersect the cotton districts, but there are several others which ought not to be overlooked." The writer elsewhere goes into the cost of transporting cotton to the coast. The cost of transport From Bellaryto Kamptee, in Camaraa, 184 miles, has been reduced, by having a cart road, from 7d. per ton per mile to 3d' The writer goes on to say: His cotton, ill cleaned and s subject to much damage from thorns and bushes on the road side, and dust during its passage, on the backs of oxen, below the; Chants, sells at Kamptee for little more than twopence per pound. Hence it is shipped for Bombay, where it is screwed into bales for the English market. It has been found, upon calculation, that the cost of bringing- this cotton from Cellar y to Kamptee, a distance of 184 miles, considerably exceeds that of conveying it to England, a distance of 17,000-miles. Taking the price of carriage in I india at 2- ann as per ton per mile, and reckoning, the value of money according to the price of bread corn at six times what it is in England it is equal to 221 pence there; whereas the expense in England is 10 pence per ton on :common roads, and about 3 pence per ton on .canals in general, or even as low as one penny. If 3 pence be the average, it is less than one seventh of the cost in. I india; The expense of the transport of goods from Had ras to Trichinopoly, 230 miles, is 25 rulees, or 3 10s. per ton, which is nearly as much as the freight fromMadras to London. The most important fact, however still remains to be considered. When brought into the market at Liverpool, this cotton often, 285 cells with difficulty at 3 pence per pound, so that the merchant importing it profits but very little by the transaction." -several interesting tables, as well as extracts from the Liverpool Times, giving a full view of the cotton trade of Great Britain for the past year, will be found included in appendix No. 11.-:By this, it appears that while the product of the United States imported into Great Britain has increased from 1,157,924 to 1,376,894 bales, that of the Last In dies has fallen off from 142,796 bales to 79,640 bales; and that of Demerara and West In dies, &c, from 14,674 to 6,314 bales, and Brazil and Portugal from 112,369 to 110,176 bales. The Mediterranean only, besides the United States, has increased, viz : from 63,221 to 79,707 bales. The whole increase of import is stated at over 174,000 bales. The prospect seems to be that an increased market for cotton may be opened in Russia and Austria, and perhaps some others of the European kingdoms. Such is a view of an intelligent traveller in the latter empire and as to the former, see the following extract, found in one of our public journals :extract from a letter from A. P. Gibson, esq, United States consul at It. Petersburg, dated August 30, 1845: " The quantity of cotton imported this year direct from the United States is 6,992,818 pounds, whereas the highest import heretofore was 3,150,680 pounds in 1843. If this government should not change their present policy in respect to their encouragement ofnmanufaicturing establishments, Russia will become a great consumer of raw cotton, for the number of spinning establishments is constantly on the increase ;and it is estimated, by competent judges, that by the end of this year there will be in operation in the whole empire fro in 8,00,000 to 1,000,000of spindles The progress of cotton to its manufacture, and its increased value, is curious. A statement is given in the public journals, which thus traces it when sent to Europeprogress of a pound of American cotton The following i is the history of the travels and adventures of a pound of manufactured American cotton The: cotton came from the United States to London ; thence to Manchester, where it was spun into yarn. It was then sent to Aisle y, where it was woven; next to Ayershire, to be tambov red; afterwards it was conveyed to Sum barton, where it was hand sewed. It was then again sent  t to Aisle y, when it was conveyed to a distant part of Renfrew to be bleached, and then returned to Aisle y. It was afterwards sent to Glasgow and finished; and from Glasgow it was conveyed, per coach, to London. From its shipment in America till its arrival in the London warehouse, it must have been conveyed 3,000 miles by sea, and 9 20 on land. The value was increased 2,000per cent. by the processes of the manufacturer, whilst no less than 150 people were engaged in its carriage and preparation The subject of cotton mat tresses was mentioned in the report for 1844. Since then, we have found It stated that they are extensively used, and preferred to wall others, except hair mat tresses, on board of many of the steamboats at the west. A: further testimony y in their favor, we learn, is also given in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, an account of which is thus given in one of the public journals. : "the Boston Medical and Surgicaljouirnal, in an article from Dr. Smith, says that a great business is doingi4here in cotton 8 mat tresses. There is in the city of Lowell an extensivemiannfacture of these beds of an elegant appearance. They have the ex 286 Doc.

They do not, it is: said, seem to; differ essentially in: point of reaction, after being laid upon, from hair. For economy, they put even shaved rat an at defiance, In winter, it is a non conductor of calorie.

Clarke, the senior assistant surgeon to the colony of Pierre He one, has lately brought into notice a grain called fund i, or funding i, cultivated by industrious individuals of the Soosoo, Soul ah, Pass a, and Vol off nations, by whom it is called hungry rice. It is a semi transparent card i form grain, about the size of a mignionette seed; the ear consists of two conjugal e spikes, the grain being arranged on the outer edge of the spike. The ground, says Mr. Clarke, is cleared for its reception by burning down the copse wood, and hoping between the stumps. It is sown in May or June, the ground being lightly drawn together over the seed with a he. In August, when it shoots up, it is carefully needed. It ri pens in September, growing to the height of about eighteen inches, and its stems, which are very slender, are then bent to the earth by the mere weight of the grain. When cut down it is tied up in small sheaves, and placed in a dry situation within the hut; for, if allowed to remain on the ground and become wet, the grains become agglutinated to their coverings. The grain is trodden out with the feet, and is then dried in the sun to allow of the more easy removal of the chaff in the process of pounding, which is done in wooden mortars. It is afterwards win no wed with a kind of cane manner, on mats. In preparing this delicious grain for food, it is first put into boiling water, in which it is boiled for a few minutes; the water is then poured off, and the Collahs, Joloffs, &e, add to it palm oil, butter, or milk; but the Europeans and negroes connected with the colony prepare it as follows: To the grain, cooked as above mentioned, fowl, fish, or mutton, with a small piece of salt pork for the sake of flavor, is added; the whole being stewed in a close saucepan. This makes a very good dish; and thus prepared, resembles 'kouskous' The grain is sometimes made into puddings, with the usual condiments, and eaten either hot or cold, with milk. By the few natives of Scotland in the colony, it is dressed as milk porridge. This grain could be raised in sufficient quantities to become an article of commerce, and I have no doubt would prove a valuable addition to the list of light farinaceous articles of food in use among the delicate or convalescent. Before preparation, the grain is said to be of a clear dull brown color, and when cleaned from the husks it resembles very fine milletNew Farmers Journal. Of  Of. The subject of silk culture is one which does not excite that general interest in our country which it may hereafter be destined to enlist, and which its importance might seem to render proper. There are a number of reasons which may be assigned for this. A severe check was given to its progress some years since by the unfortunate multicaulis speculation. Any who suffered from engaging in that enterprise with too hasty a zeal, have not recovered from the timidity which the issue in disappointment of their sanguine hopes inspired; and others, who have learned of the loss of their neighbors, have been as averse as they to engage in new experiments. Met, even that result is due rather to the period in which it took place, than to anything in the nature of the subject. At a time when the public, mind was not directed, as it then was, to all sorts of speculations, the multicaulis might have been successful ;19 290 though it is to be questioned if the climate at the north is adapted to it, in many parts of the country where the cultivation was attempted. Of  Another reason for, the want of success in the general diffusion of the silk culture, is the absorbing interest which has been felt (in those sectionsoflihe1 country where it might best be tried) in some other crop. This is peculiarly the case as regards the southern sections of our republic; the climate of which is so well adapted to silk culture. Still, we believe that there is a gradual advance on the subject. Comparatively little information on the topic is to be obtained except in those papers which are more specially devoted to it, and there are but few journals which even give a column to it. Our information on the silk culture the past season is mainly derived from the New York Farmer and Mechanics. From the collection of articles on the subject there, we have condensed and present here, and in appendix No. 12, such statements as may best subserve our object at this time. The reports which we have received from the different parts of the country are so few and so meagre that we are unable to give anything but a general view, without entering into much detail as to particular States, It is stated that there is three times as much raw silk manufactured now as there was three years ago, and that it is worth 50 to 75 cents per pound more than Smyrna silk. The specimens submitted at the last fair of the American institute in New York were such as would compete successfully with the French and I italian silks. The frosts of last winter proved too severe for many mulberry trees in the northern States; and the Broussa, which seems adapted to cold weather, is recommended as adapted to these sections of our country. -give Statesmaine, Massachusetts, New Work, Delaware, and Louisiana give bounties on silk. That of New York is about to expire. We have sub joined in the appendix the memorial to the legislature of that State for its renewal; also, the act recently passed in Louisiana for the purpose of aiding the silk culture there. A number of interesting communications from gentlemen at the south relating to this enterprise, taken from various journals, will also be found in the appendix. The following extracts are taken from the Planters Manner of February 3, 84 5: " To give the agricultural editors at the north an idea of our Louisiana climate, we would state that a lot of multicaulis trees in our garden; have been in leaf for three or four weeks, and for the last few days we have been feeding silk worms!

Mention is made of various experiments in the manufacture of silk fabric sin different parts of the country.

I need, it is said that not less than 50,000 bushels of cochons are now annually raised there. Mr. Bliss, in his report to the Ohio legislature on this subject, recommends a course which would do much to extend its cultivation. It is, that every farmers should have his patch of mulberry trees, and make it a point to raise at least ten bushels of cochons. The history of silk culture of this country is divided, by some writers, into three epochs. The first period, from its first introduction, in 1623, to the close of the revolutionary war, in 1783, or for 160 years. The second epoch, from that time to .the decisive knowledge of the multicaulis mulberry; or to July, 1830. The legislature of Connecticut, in 1783, granted a bounty on mulberry trees and raw silk. The efforts of Dr. Aspinwalland President Stiles were the principal cause of this movement. The consequence of the introduction of the mulberry tree more largely, through their exertions, has been, that Connecticut stands among the first in this culture at the present day. The third epoch commenced about 1830 31. It remains to be seen how great the progress shall be; but it is hoped that, our countrymen will before long awake more to the importance of its prospective bearing on our national resources, and engage in it vigorously, and also with true discrimination and prudence. For this purpose they should acquaint themselves, as far as practicable, with the experience of others and the obstacles or aids to their success. We have. placed in the appendix several valuable papers, which have been drawn from valuable sources, on this subject, and they will repay the perusal. The history of the silk culture in Georgia, by the Rev. Li am f 1 Stevens, which we have taken from the Southern Cultivator, is an interesting piece of instruction to the planters of the south. We may also mention Mr. You glass, Mr. Trains, and Judge Ernests communications, and others, as well suited for the same object. Dr. Stebbuiss letters and reports, Mr. Greens, Mr. Elements letters, &cal so relate to the more northern culture. We may again, also, refer those who desire much practical information in a small compass, to the pamphlet 292 published two or three years since, called the " Silk Question Settled" and from which copious extracts were made in a former report. The writer in the journal on the pages of which we have been forced mainly to rely in our remarks on this subject, observes that " it is evident, from letters received at the first national silk convention and other reliable sources of information, that several thousand tons of silk are now annually raised and manufactured in the United States." He thinks that, owing to the want of proper management of the worms after they have spun their thread and formed the cochons, one half probably is lost. A great obstacle to more success, is the imperfect manner in which the reeling is performed. " Hundreds of families" he says, "who raise several bushels annually, work them up into sewings and other articles for their own or their neighbors' uses. These, finding their way to the country stores, injure the cause of silk production ; for, being compared with foreign silks, produced by proper machinery, they are found defective. There is much also wasted by these methods, as feeling, doubling, and twisting instead of being made, as they should be, three distinct operations) are often performed on a single machine." He urges a division of labor, as without it we cannot succeed. Another difficulty suggested, is, that persons are often forced to keep theircocoons too long until they are injured and lose half their value. Precautions persons against the use of heat in the destruction of the chrysalis. The fibres are thus made so tender that cochons which might have yielded silk worth   $6 per pound, will only yield that which is worth                $3. Alcohol is recommended, as it leaves the cochons in fine order for reeling. It is said that the Sort hampton factories are very particular on this subject. The cochons must be spread out very thin to become well cured. Cocoons, it is stated, become comparatively valueless after the 1st December, as the gum is so dry and hard as to injure the silk. The Sort hampton factories make it a rule not to purchase after the 1st December. R. B. Horses, of Boston, who is said to be personally intimate with the Chinese climate, mentioned in the New York Farmers' Club that the climate in China, between the parallels of 300 and 400 north latitude, is the most decidedly favorable for silk, and that silk from these latitudes is 20 per cent. better than that from the lower latitudes there. It is a little remarkable that we find it elsewhere stated that the best silk in this country is from cochons spun in Vermont. It is said to be larger and stronger than silk raised in any of the southern or western States. The Vermont silk, we are informed, brings a higher price at Paterson, New Jersey, than silk from any other State. Open feeding is still recommended. Silk worms are said to suffer more in sultry, close weather, than in cold. Ventilation is all important. A species of worm among the Persians is said to produce eight successive crops in a year; and a writer in Florida, Thomas You glass, of Macavies, thinks that it would be useful to introduce this species into that State. The leaf of the for us multicaulis, he states, affords good feed for worms there at least eight months, and sometimes nine and even ten months in the year* He is sanguine that Georgia lower country and Florida silk will the quoted in the prices current of Liverpool and Are in 30 years, if not indeed sooner. His letter, which contains many interesting particulars, and deserves serious attention from the planters of the south, will be found with other papers, in appendix No. 12. a. 293 Some very useful directions as to silk culture, also, will be found in and article from the New York Farmer, by Mr. A. C. An Pps, to whom we are indebted for much information on the subject. His paper, styled" A Chapter for Silk growers" compactly em bodies his observations on the various topics of a supply of perfect eggs ; provision of suitable foliage ; place for feeding ; destroying the chrysalis, and curing cochons. He believes that the watching of the eggs may be retarded without in the least injuring the constitution of the worm. The failure he attributes to either the wormsbeingtplaced too late in the ice, or to the warmth of spring or summer, or their not being wholly imbedded in the ice. He describes the feeding frames andventilating cradles, &c, and a method of curing the cochons, in so easy a manner that any one can understand it. An interesting letter by S. A. Elements, of North Ran by, Connecticut, also from the journal before mentioned, furnishes many valuable remarks, which we commend to the attention of those who are investigation g the subject with a view to successful experimenting. He recommends cultivating the mulberry tree in rows about 31 feet apart, and as thick as they can stand in the rows. ' The trees" he says, "are kept headed down by cutting off the shoots several times in the season, as they spring from the ground. The foliage is thus easily obtained, and probably more of it than if the trees were planted wider apart and suffered to form trunks. The multicaulis has been cultivated in this way with entire successor. Elements approves of feeding with the schools, and says that as the young shoots are taken, others form in their places, which gives a fresh supply of tender foliage until late in the season, and so obviates the difficulty i a making as good cochons from late as from early feeding. He prefers the pea nut variety of worm, though he says that some in his vicinity choose the mammoth sulphur, as the silk feels more easily, and, though the silk is coarser, it answers well for sewings. He speaks of Mr. O. D. Haynes re el, of Sort hampton, as the best one. Mr. Hayne himself has also a communication in the New York Farmer. He says that the Ll pine mulberry is preferred there; it is the saccharinematter which nourished the silkworm, and much depends oui the proportions which the different elements of the leaves bear to each other. The leaf of The Ll pine mulberry is the most nutrient; and the more nutrient the leaf is, he less leaves the worm has to consume, and consequently the less labor to perform, and therefore is less liable to fatigue, languor, or disease. The small silkworm, or the Th trop, is the best, This he pronounces to be a very superior species, furnishing very superior silk, and of a very fine texture. His re el, he states, possesses many advantages over every other re el, and that Mr. Valentine, an English silk manufacturer in that place, procured some of the silk reeled on it which he considered superior to any, other he had known for even ness, color, and finish to send to England. He says that the Sort hampton Association have succeeded in lustre, smoothness, and fine ness of texture, not surpassed by the best I italian. Another writer, Mr. W. H. Fenton, of Raymond, Mississippi, approves of cut leaves, from which Mr. An ,pps dissents, and could not consent to admit it as a substitute for op l, en branch feeding. Mention has been made in various public journals of a plant, called the silk plant, sent from Tripoli; and, in the Farmers' Library and Monthlyjonrnal of Agriculture for July there is a plate representing the same, by which it appears to be a species of the asclepias, or what is termed milk 294 tweed, or silk weed. We sub join the letter of Mr. Mccauly to Mr. Markoedescribing it. It has, however, been since stated that the fibre will not answer the purpose for which it is suggested, as it resembles the fibre of our milk weed, which has been tried in the way un successfully. Silk Plantthe following letter from D. Smith Mccauly, esq, our consul at Tripoli, to Francis Dark oe, jr, the secretary of the National I institute, will be read \with much interest. He transmitted it with some seed of the vegetable silk, which, in all probability, in our varied and wonderful soil and climate, will become a new article of commerce, and, like our cotton, ante w and important source of wealth. Should it succeed, and become a great staple article like our cotton, what important consequences may we not expect to follow from its introduction. S. Consulate, Tri Poli  , December 28, 1844. I : I here with transmit to the I institute a small specimen of vegetable silk, raised from a few seed that I received from Lucca, I talk, which seed originally came from Syria. Without any instruction or knowledge of this plant, I sowed the <a name="seeds19"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in pots, in the month of March last. In May and June they obtained the height of 6 to 8 inches, when I transplanted them into my garden, about 8 inches apart much too near, as my experience proves. In the months of August and September they were in flower, and the ponds commenced opening in October, the plants being from 6 to 8 feet high; and, though we have had the thermometer frequently as low as 420 Fahrenheit, and the april cot and pomegranate trees, with the vine, have all shed their leaves, yet there remain several ponds on the silk plant which are still perfectly green, and show no signs of suffering or cold. This, with some other proofs of the plant being hardy, induces me to believe and hope that it might be successfully cultivated in all our cotton growing States: and should it become a staple commodity, no doubt the inventive genius of our countrymen would soon discover the means of spinning it without the aid of the cotton fibre, which, am told, they use in Syria to assist in spinning, their knowledge of the art not extending beyond the primitive distaff. The only information that I have acquired of this plant further than recounted above, is from the mouth of one of the ' propaganda' established here, who has seen it growing in Syria, where, he tells me, it flourished, and that the cultivation of a small field gives support to a family; that in the second and third years it is extremely productive. The6lants grow to the height of 10 to 15 feet, and are generally separated from 8 to 10 feet from each other. I also forward you, by this occasion, the small quantity of seed of the plant which the limited number I have raised enables me to spare, with the hope of sending a greater quantity next year, should the climate of our southern States prove favorable to its culture, or should it be even otherwise interesting. I beg you will distribute these <a name="seeds20"><mark>seeds</mark></a> amongst those gentlemen of our cotton growing States who will take an interest in making an experiment of the cultiatition.

That of last year (1844) was better than was cotn
295jectured to be the case at the time the estimate in the report was made. Such is made after the latest period in which we can receive such information as we must rely on to form even a conjecture. There was unquestionably a large additional number of estates turned to the sugar business. Mr. Chapommier states, in the New Orleans See, that in 17 parishes there have been 367 cotton plantations thus changed ; and he says even this does not comprehend all, for this notes only new mills ; and there are numbers of small planters, besides, who resort to the mills of their neighbors. In other sections he learns of 25 to 30, and in another 200 more. The early notices of the sugar crop are partly unfavorable. Thus, in May: " The crop of cane in the Lafourche parishes, we are informed, is not very good Planters' Manner, May 24. In the other hand, also, May 24 : "he have just returned from a ride extending about 100 miles through Attakapas and Opelousas. We took particular notice of the crops. The cane in It. Mary, It.

Again, the Baton Gouge: Gazette, of June 28 to, says: ' The drought for some time past has dried up the sugar cane." The Lafourche Gazette, still later, speaks of the kind of weather as favorable to the growth of sugar cane. The following is dated Franklin, July 12: " Down to the present time, our sugar planters of Attakapashave had quite a favorable season. The crop of cane is now ,nearly all laid by. Some of our planters will probably plough late, which will retard the ripe king of the cane. A worm, which threatened. much damage, made its appearance in the cane last month, but the heavy rains appear to have arrested its progress n September, it is stated : <a< Pale rien Martin, of the parish of Lafayette, Louisiana, has already commenced making sugar.

I believe the crop will not exceed 150,000 hogs heads, which is 50,000 short of last season. I ought to add, however, that my estimate is below that of others who are well informed on the subject, who estimate it at 175 000 to 180,000hogsheads. The crop is two or three weeks behind last year, and unfortunately we have not yet had cool weather to ripe n it, and a large majority of the planters have not yet commenced grinding ; and even some of those who had begun have suspended again, as the cane gave such a miserable yield. Last year at this time 40,000 to 50,000 hogs heads were already in the draining houses, and of course out of harms way; whereas now almost the entire crop is at the mercy of an early frost, and will certainly suffer more or less from it, as the grinding will run so late into winter Later, also: "the sugar planters are all now under full way in their grinding, and the last ten or fifteen days has been favorable weather. The complaints of bad yield are very general on the river plantations; the crop will be less than last season; the best informed estimate it at 150,000 to 17 5000 hogsheadsThe Planters' Manner, of December 6th, speaks more un favorably as the season advances: "is we predicted, last weeks rain was succeeded by a severe frost, which killed to the ground nearly all the cane standing in the parish; few of our planters having taken the precaution of wind rowing. Since .the frost on Sunday night, many have windowed with a view of preserving the cane from the influence of the sun. This it will do to a certain extent. In Monday morning, the 1st instant, at daylight the thermometer stood at 37 o- This was the severe st cold we have had to injure the cane since 1842. In that year, in a central part of this parish, on the 19th November, at daylight, the thermometer stood at 260, and the cane was killed to the ground. In 1832, on the 22d October, we had a frost which killed the cane throughout this parish before a hogs head of sugar was made. The crop was short, and the sugar was of inferior quality. The crop of this year will be cut short in our parish one-fourth, and in all other parts of the State in the same proportion From other information we also learn that a loss was anticipated from the severe effects of frost. The New Orleans See estimates the sugar crop of Louisiana at 156,000 hogs heads, as it falls short in fifteen parishes about 3 6000 hogs heads. The actual returns for 1844 appear to have been about 19 1000 hogs heads. Others estimate the decrease at about 20,000 hogs heads. The estimated decrease in the crop of the whole State by one informant is about " fifteen per cent." More have gone into the cultivation, which balances the loss; which otherwise would have been, perhaps, from 25 to 50 per cent. There will, however, be a larger quantity of molasses than before. The crop of sugar in Florida promised fair, and the prospects of success were good. Quite a number have engaged in the business, so that the. 297 whole crop of Florida is probably fifty per cent. more than before. The following statement presents the views of a public journal in that section of our country, respecting the appearance of the crop and its future promise as a staple for that new State: " We are informed that the sugar crop of this year promises fair, and that those of our planters who have engaged in the cultivation of its products feel well satisfied with their success. The short space of time which has elapsed since the termination of hostilities with the I indians has not permited them fully to recover the position they occupied before the war, and consequently the crop of this year will be comparatively limited. Several of our planters commenced grinding the cane during the last week, and the smoke of the sugar mill curls up from many a lonely settlement between this place and Matanzas. We understand that large preparations have been made to increase the cultivation of their products daring the next year, and we feel confident that the time is not far distant when the sugar crop of Last and South Florida will for man important item in the agricultural resources of our Statejacksonville News.

The sugar business in Attakapasaverse as most of our planters are to innovations and improvements, it is curious to notice the progress they have made within the last thirty or forty years. I indigo was the first article raised in It. Mary for export. It was not then thought that cotton raising could be engaged in with profit; and if any one spoke of our soil as suitable for sugar, he would be looked upon as crazy. Cotton was engaged it with profit, and it was thought by some that sugar might be produced. The experiment of raising the latter crop was tried near New Orleans, and it was said the result proved satisfactory. Still, few had the courage to try it. The business gradually extended along the coast. At last, some seed cane was brought to Attakapas, and some enterprising person invested a small sum in the purchase of salt kettles in New Orleans. These were placed between gum logs beneath an open shed ; a mill was made of live oak, and the experiment was tried. A few barrels of very inferior sugar were made and shipped to te city on a feel boat. The crop yielded a good profit, and those who had ridiculed the idea of making sugar in Attakapasfollowed the example. The salt kettles were set in brick and mortar, and sugar houses of pine, with brick chimneys, were built. Such difficulty was experienced in boiling. Some made sugar Mary dark color, and others failed altogether the first season. Gradually, however, the quality of the sugar improved, but the chimneys were constantly cracking and falling down The plan of building with double flies was discovered, and the difficulty was thus overcome. The planters, who had now become manufacturers, were quite elated; they built better houses, procured larger kettles, coated their live oak cylinders with metal, purchased negroes, &c, and began to put up their sugar in hogs heads. Demand increased for carpenters, coopers, brick makers, blacksmiths, &c. The sugar was of fair quality, and brought a good price. It was said that steam was used on the Mississippi, but of course the idea was ridiculed. But mules and horses were gradually superseded by steam engines on the coast. I m proved metal mills were now adopted, and some one in Attakapas did put up an engine !a! The quality of the sugar was now fine. Larger kettles were procured, but the sugar was not of so good a quality. The small kettles made the best article. Clarifiers were now used on the coast, and many experiments were tried. Some one in Attakapas did get clarifyes, but not more than three or four have, as yet, followed the example. Thus far, down to the present time. It is now said that precipitators are used on the coast; and this season, or the first time, they are to be tried in Attakapas. Not w the big kettles will boil as well as the little ones !a! We shall see. In the year 1825 the crop of sugar and molasses made in It. Mary was taken to New Orleans by Captain Slam Matters on, in a feel boat of forty tons! Now, the crop of sugar is 20 000 hogs heads To much for some of our wiseacres who are so inveterate ly opposed to improvements !again: The statement of Mr. Chapommier of the crop of 1844, found in the appendix, presents some interesting particulars. We have added, also, the remarks of the New Orleans Price Current of September 1, 1845,respecting the sugar crop of the season past. A discovery is mentioned in a New Orleans paper, by which molasses and sugar may be rendered perfectly transparent. We have seen no further notice of the same. We are informed that a gentleman of this State has discovered a chemical process, which will enable him to make molasses and sugar perfectly transparent. It is his intention to take out a I a tent right. 29 forthwith. He has already made arrangements with several planters to operate on the forthcoming crop; and he is to receive, the first season, the difference ii price between the old process and the new one. We further learn, it is estimated that the coming crop of sugar .vill fall short 20,000hogsheads, in consequence of the damage the cane has sustained. 'new, Orleans Native American. In the last report, mention was made of M. Rillieuxs process for the manufacture of sugar. Since then, a letter was forwarded to the late Corinmissioner of Patents, in March last, containing a statement by Mr. Back wood, which relates to this method of manufacture, which it is resumed may be interesting to some; and it has therefore been placed in the appendix No. 12, above mentioned. Another letter, likewise received by the late Commissioner from n Joseph Tales tier, esq, U. S. consul at Singapore, giving an account of the mode of manufacturing sugar there, is added to the same class of papers. The following analysis of the sugar, by Mr. Vera path, may be useful in showing the kinds of soil and culture best adapted to the sail me. It is probably made with reference to the West I india cane."

He says: "now is it with the sugar cane in Louisiana? It was introduced here at an early day from the West In dies, and i cultivated to a small extent at Her re aux Boeufs, and in the i neighborhood of New Orleans. Nobody at first imagined that sugar. could be made of it. The juice was boiled into sir up, which sold at extravagant prices. In 1796 Mr. More, residing a few miles above Newoileansa man reputed for his daring and his energy formed the desperate resolve of making s u war. He increased his cultivcid127tioton, put up the necessary buildings and machinery, and procured a sugar maker for the West   n dies. The day appointed for the experiment was come, ind' the operation was under way. The inhabitants of New Orleans and the coast had assembled there in great numbers. But they remained outside of the building, at a respectable distance from the sugar maker, who they looked upon as a sort of magician. The fir s like came, and he said nothing this they thought fatal, but still they remained fixed to the spot The second strike was out; the sugar r maker carefully stirred the first, and then, advancing towards the assembled crowd, told them with all the gravity of his craft: Gentlemen, it grains? :I t grains' was repeated by all. They 300 rushed in to see the wonder; and, when convinced of the facts, scattered in all directions, greeting everybody they met, with 'I t grains' And from the Alive to the Dubuque, from the Wabash to the Fellow stone, the great, the all absorbing news of the colony was, that the juice of the cane had grained in Power Louisiana. It did grain; it has continued to grain; it has grained the last season at the rate of 215,000,000 of pounds; and, if no un toward action of government prevents it, in ten years it will grain to the extent of more than double that quantityMaple sugar forms an important part of the sugar crop of the Unitedstates. It is true that it does not bear comparison with cane sugar; but inn any States it furnishes a valuable substitute, which is as well relished, and saves the hard toiling farmer from the purchase of the article foreign to him. The information we have been enabled to obtain respecting this crop, leads us to conclude that it is considerably above the usual crop. Vermont produces more map le sugar than any of the New England States. The Montpelier Watchman of May last estimated the sugar crop of that State for 1845 at                                                         $1,000,000 in value. The annual amount produced in the town of Everett is 13,925 pounds; which, at 9 cents per pound, would be                                                                 $125,325.  In the Boston Cultivator we find it stated that a sample of map le sugar, from Joseph M. Stevens, Caledonia, Vermont, made by him, had been received at the office of that journal, which the editor pronounces to be the purest and whites t he had ever seen. " The process is said to be simple and easy. Mr. L. manufactured, on his premises, last spring, 4,500 pounds n a letter addressed to the New York Tribune, dated Windsor county, Vermont, April, 1845, the writer says: " We are just through our annual sugar season, and all feel satisfied. The crop is large, and many have made 1, 2, and 3 tons From another source we learn that in Mind ham county there has been a large increase, owing to the improvements that have been made in the manufacture. The single town of Wilmington is said to have yielded, the last spring, 150,000 pounds. It is believed that the estimate for 1844 was perhaps not quite large enough, and that the crop of 1845 was not less than 10000 000 pounds. There was also an increased crop in New Hampshire and Paine, owing to the increased attention paid to its production. In some parts of Massachusetts, too, there are large quantities of map le sugar manufactured. The amount produced in the town of Everett, as ascertained by the assessors, was 17,473 pounds. In New York there was a considerable increase over the crop of 1844, varying from 10, 15,to 20 per cent. Similar estimates are presented from other States and sections of the country where this product was raised. In a few only do we notice any falling off. This was the case' in Kentucky and Ohio, which furnish a considerable quantity. In indiana and Michigan the crop improved. In order to obviate the objection which exists in the consumption of wood that must necessarily take place where the map le sir up is elaborated two or three times, the following method has been suggested, by which an individual of moderate means has been known to make ofer a hundred pounds of the purest white sugar in one season: "the tubs for collecting sap, a swell as those in which it is kept ready for boiling, must be perfectly clean and scalded with lime water before using. If it should be warm weather during the sugar season, put into the reservoir a piece of lime about the. 380 1 size of a hens egg for a hogs head of sap. Your it out through a s trainer, and observe the strictest cleanliness through every part of the operation. When it is boiled down enough, let the sir up stand over night to settle. I tis then to be strained off the sediment through a flannel. Dissolve the sediment again in water and boil it; boil down the strained sir up till it is thick enough for crystal living. Met it then be put into tubs, and grow cold and hard en; bore holes in the bottom and drain off the molasses; and when all the molasses is thus drained off, cotton or linen cloths of some thickness are laid on the top of the sugar and constantly kept wet. The sugar thus receives a regular and constant supply of water, and gradually s oaks down through the crystallized, dissolving the molasses and other impure ties, which drain off and leave the sugar perfectly pure and white The labor of this process is said to be light, though some weeks must be allowed for it. The specimens of map le sugar which have recently been exhibited in some of the agricultural fairs in Vermont and New York are said to have been uncommonly fine, and as white as the purest loaf sugar e believe that the manufacture of this article may be carried on profitable to a much greater extent than it has hitherto been ; and in most instances tie farmer has leisure to attend to it, as it occurs at a period of the year when he cannot attend to other crops. In appendix No. 13 will be found a valuable paper, from an able western- agricultural periodical, on map le sugar and the extension of its production in our country. The whole sugar crop of the United States, including both cane and map le sugar, amounted, according to the best estimate at which we can arrive, to 216,026,000 pounds. Horns talk sugar The attempts are still continued to produce sugar from the corns talk. T" he same difficulty respecting granulation, &c, still remains as before. But we can scarcely doubt this will yet be overcome. Mr. John Real, of New Harmony, I a, whose letters were given in the last report, still continues sanguine in regard to this matter. That molasses of a good quality for use can be produced, seems to be very evident. The following notices appear in different public journals: " Molassesthis useful domestic article is now made out of corns talks, and a very superior quality has been produced by Mr. Samuel Morel and, of Earth age, Tennessee. Mr. Morel and says the juice yields about one-fourth, as well as he can guess from the experiment he has made. The process appears to be simple enough. Dress the juice out of the stalk about the time it arrives at maturity; boil it as you would the water from a sugar tree, until it becomes as thick as you want it; then your molasses is ready for use Again : " Horns talk scid127fgarrThe Albany Cultivator gives a little additional information on this subject. In an experiment mentioned, one pint of flour was mixed with two gallons of skin milk, and one pint of this mixture was added to thirty gallons of juice. This prevented any decomposition of sugar during the process of evaporation, and is supposed to make success sure r. As the juice comes from the mill, it should run into a receiver which will hold just enough to fill one of the kettles or pans; while in this receiver the mixture of flour and milk, and also the necessary quantity of lime, must be added and well stirred in. It is then poured at once into the boiler and heat applied ; a very firm thick s cum is by this means separated, and the juice becomes clear. It is then run into one of the evaporating pans, and the boiling kept up briskly, As the boiling proceeds, it is re 3 012 
cpymmended to throw occasionally: a shovel full of red hot coals into the pay having first blown the ashes off As you put in more j vice add no re coals; and as the pan becomes filled with coal, take out that i which was first put in. This is done in the first stage of the o boiling procid127ess. Thepai far finishing should be shallow, and have but a depth of two or three inches of sir up in at one tiemAgainCOorns talk sugar and r molasses. -e have received from John Real, of N ti Harmony, In diana, samples of corns talk sugar and molasses man fact tired by him the past season. The sugar is equal in quality to any of that kind we have seen, with the exception of a single sample, which we understood to have been made by Mr. Ebb, of Delaware. The molasses is clear a and thick, but :retains a little of the peculiar p urgency in as te which seems to attend more or less that which is made from corns talks. But we can. hardly doubt that improvement will be made in the process of manufacture, by which these articles will be produced of a better quality. It should be considered that the l business is yet new, and, : "fcorirse, partakes of the imperfect ion attending al untried enterprises. Theomintiication of or. Real having been his laid untitit6o late for this number, will appear in our next .a' vivat or, He ce n berg    n appendix 'to. 13 we give Or, Heals letter abovbcid127cid127ntioned, from the butivator of January, :146; also' a letter from Mr. He ai to this office, enclosing a sample of his sugar, which had very much the taste of some of the coarser sale sugars. Mr. Real states that he has been more successful the past season than before. In a measured acre he obtained about 700 pounds of crystal liable sir up. It was also of a better quality than before. He still finds some difficulty in the drainage, and thinks if it could be ,kept in a temperature of 70 to 80 degrees the process would be accelerated, His yield, he says, was equal to 57 gallons per acre; and, estimating his sugar at five cents a pound a low estimate, as cane sugar there usually ranges from eight to twelve cents a pound he gives the net value of the sir up on the acre at                                                              $14.90; which, compared with merely raising corn, leaves a balance in favor of sugar of                $3.40. Le thinks, also, that on a large scale it would be still more profitable. He further says that the continued culture ,of corn for the purpose of making sugar is for a settledpointwtit h him and that in general it is as profitable as any thing else there, though -i some years there may be exceptions in favor of particular, articles. His letter contains his calculations in detail. In Prescotts Conquest of Mexico, the interesting fact is stated that the Mexicans were accustomed to make sugar from corns talks. I n. communicating a notice to this effect to the Cultivator, a writer from States I s land, signing himself Richmond, and now known to the public as Dr. Samuelacklerly, expresses his -sanguine belief that before long we shall see andcQnsnume corns talk sugar in abundance. The extract to which we allude is as follows : "the great staple of the country, as indeed of the American. Opetinebte was ,made or indian corn, which grew freely along the valleys and. up the steep sides of the Cordrileras, to the high level of the table land. The Aztecs were as curious in its preparation, and as instructed in it sn i ai fold. uses, as the most expert New England housewife. I s gigantictaUlCs in these equinoctial regions affords a sac charing matter not found, loathe sa die stein t, in northern latitudes, and supplied the natives with sugar little inferior to that of the cane itself, which was not introduced among the imp. 380 till after the conquest in 1519." Dr. Ackerly adds: "If a semi civilized na do non, the continent of America, more than 300 years ago, made sugar from the s talks of I indian corn, why may not the more civilized races of the present day, with i the aid of art and science, do the same? There is no, doubt that it may be done it has been done. The experiments that have been made show that it can be done but in which of the States it can be most advantageously adopted, remains to be decided by other experiments. I remember when map le sugar could only be obtained of the blackest and coarsest kind, such as was strained through the dirty blankets of the ab origines, and sold in small takes or birch baskets as a rarity." " Now" he states, "' men rock candy has been exhibited at the State fair, which had never before been made front the sap of the map le tree. Table sugar was always made in small quantity, but of late years a large amount is manufactured and refined equal i to the best imported sugar. To will corns talk sugar be gradually improved and introduced, :the account we have given of the introduction of the cane sugar culture in Louisiana, is certainly encouraging to those who are experimenting with the cornstalkThe cultivation of the sugar be et in France, and other paris of the continent, is well known. In the former kingdom, large quantities are manufactured. Some attention, and increase no l so, is paid to the same culture in Great Britain. In this, a public journal thus- says: "the amount ofbeetroot sugar 'manufactured in Great Britain and I re land in 1844, was5597j cut an increase of 1,753 cut. compared with 1843. Of this 3 420 cut. were manufactured at Stratfdrd, in Essex; the remainder atLiverp6ol, and Aorta ferry, Dowrnshirethe Journal da Gcoirnerce, of Antwerp, mentions the discovery of anew kind of be et, which is much superior in all respects to the ordinarysnuar be et for the extraction of sugar. This may be the same as a species which is partially described by Or. Tedious in the Central Platt, of Bavaria, which is said to be fourteen days earlier, and on this account possesses decided: advantages over the 'usual species; and which he recommends for cultivation by the producers of this article. According to the French papers, the state of the French sugar manufactory in 1844 45 (of bees) was as follows: Manufactories in work, 294, or 31 less than last year; man factories not it i work, 21, or 29 less than last year; quantity of sugar was 32,373,449 kilogrammes, or an increase of 5,598,051 kilogrammes on last year. Other Products, And New Arti   Cles For Culti   Vati   Of. The root crops stand next in importance to those enumerated in the table. As they did not enter into the returns of the census of 1810, we have no basis on :which to found any general calculations; but they occupy a valuable place in the agricultural and horticultural pursuits of our fellowcitizie s. We may form sore idea respecting the crop of turn is from the fact that, according to the late census of the State of New Work, there were raised in that State in 1844, 1,350,332 bushels of this product on 15,322 acres of land devoted to such a purpose. In regard to most of this crop, it is p required that there was no special attempt to raise large crops. The culture of turn is is prosecuted in Great Britain with. great care. and very large 304 crops are often secured. Some valuable papers on this subject are to be found in the English periodicals, from which we feel strongly tempted to quote, but that they are too long, and depending in their results on comparison with extensive tables, which it may not be advisable to transcribe. It is a favorite and successful crop in that country, and great attention is paid to its production, as well as reliance oh it for feeding stock. We have met with some statements of the successful cultivation of carrots in our country, one or two of which we here subjoinFor the Farmers Monthly Sister." More than 1,218 bushels of carrots to the acre or. Edi Tor: When you were at our establishment a few days ago to look at the swine that obtained two premiums at the late fair in Boscawen, you i mentioned several instances of large crops of carrots raised the present season, and you spoke of ours as looking well. This induces me to send you this statement of our success. We had just one-fourth of an acres owed on a piece of ground, a part of which, two years ago last spring, was covered with laurel and white birches. The soil is a light loam on a sandy sub stratum. It was ploughed deep, and highly manured, and dressed over with reached ashes. The <a name="seeds21"><mark>seeds</mark></a> were sown in drills one foot apart, with a seed power constructed by one of our patients; and when the weeds were hold out it was designed to leave the carrots standing about four inches apart in the drills. The carrots gathered from this quarter of an acre measured 304 bushels, besides what had been gathered previously for cooking. Most of the carrots were long, smooth, and large. The heaviest weighed 3} pounds. This is at the rate of 1, 218 1 bushels to the acre. What crop is there more profitable? The 6 or 8 patients who assisted the farmer in digging them were highly delighted with such a return for their summers labor. Very respectfully" George Chandler' N. H. Asylum For The I Nsane" Concord, November 7, 1845."Again: " Mr. C. F. Gros man, of Right on, has raised, the past season 410 bushels of carrots on one-fourth of an acre. This is at the rate of 1640 bushels per acre. Mr. C. has also grown something like 1,000 bushels of bees on one acre of land. He is extensively engaged in the seed growing business, producing several thousand dollars' worth annually Genesee Farmer, January, 1816. The white, or Belgian carrot, as raised in England, sometimes produces 30 tons to an acre. In the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, volume 5, we find a paper by Air Charles Burr all, recommending highly the culture of this roots a means of economic sing hay. He says that, in the spring of 1843, five acres were sown 41 with white, and one half acre with red Altringham carrot sin order to compare them. The sowing of the Altringham did not prove successful, nor one half acre of the white consequently, he had but 4 acres, which produced 1,200 bushels to the acre and with these, adding equal quantities of Swedes turn is, and some hay and oil cake, he fed 24 fitting beasts to April; besides which, he further applied his carrots to feeding 24 cows and 2 bulls with great economy of Doc. Top 140.305hay. He proves this as follows: : " In 1842 238 acres, and grass produced 200 roads of hay; and when hay making commenced in 1843,I had about 50 lads of old hay only in reserve. In 1843, 260 acres of <a name="seeds22"><mark>seeds</mark></a> and grass, produced 505 loads of hay, besides 21 acres of c lover, producing 19 loads and I had about 400 loads of hay in reserve, when hay making commenced in 1844; showing a beneficial reserve of hay, chiefly to be attributed to the united effects of a very good crop of hay in 1843, and the reduction of its consumption by the use of white cattle carrots, &c' He says, also, that he has a very promising crop of flax after the carrots, without any dressing. . Among other crops which are included in the New York State census are peas and beans of the former, the returns give for the State 1I761503bushels, and of the latter 162,187 bushels. In the Southern Planter, for May, 1845, we find mention of a variety of pea, called the Rocky mountain, e a, which perhaps may in profit ably introduced into culture among us. The have also received from Mr. Tax all a paper of peas, called the Rocky mountain pea, concerning .which he has furnished the following statement in n calling public attention to these peas, I am well aware how often our citizens have found themselves deceived by ardent descriptions on the one hand, or dreamy promises of profit on the other. These peas, however, will answer any reasonable expectation: I planted five quart st of them about the 20 th of Lay, i a piece of rough 1 no ground, of sandy soil and only middling in quality. The product in peas and in rich good hay exceeded anything I have ever seen. Whether we wish to save them as hay for cows, horses, or mule, or to turn stock upon them as upon cow peas, or to improve the land by their decay, they are, in my opinion, far better than an ly common pea. To instance, only one thing : I planted them alongside the red cow pea; a dry spell in August arrested the further product of the common pea; the vines were leaf less and dead; while the Rocky mountain pea was green and flourishing, and bearing peas, in an increased proportion, until the severe white frost the last day in October. They grow more like a cotton plant; do not en t wine about the corn, and consequently may be saved with ease for hay. They should be planted by the 1st of May, in good land, and not more than four in a hill; plant them as you would the common pea. They come up quickly, grow rapidly, and commence bearing as soon as the common kind. L "L. Of Erce, "I n the Southern Cultivator, for November, 1845, a statement is ma' e respecting the Chickasaw pea, which is here sub joined. ' A correspondent of the South Carolinians, writing from Green ville, speaks in very high terms of the Chickasaw pea as a fertilizes. If this pea, after extensive trial, continues to answer the expectations that have been formed of it, we need not; i the southern States, con i plain that c lover will not succeed with us. We will have in this pea what will' answer our purposes just as well. eWeshll be glad to hear more of it from those who have tried it; and especially if it be not the same as what is known as the or y pea in Alabama and some parts of Georgia. :the a count by the South Carolinians correspond le t is as .follows: There is perhaps o semi of count in. the upperd is riots which has improved more in agricultural condition h than the Oldpndleton neighborhood the result, we are told, of an agricultural society composed of intelligent and practical farmers. We were struck with the 20 36 Doc 60: 140.manifest improvement in the breeds of cattle and hogs. The Berkshirecofsshas here told Well; for the very simple reason, we presume, that stock i attended to. We have never seen a finer stock of hogs in travelling through any country. 1 More attention seems to be paid to the pea culture here than any section we have been in. We are told that it is the opinion of many good farmers, whereabouts, that land can be improved to a high degree by the pea culture. We have no doubt of the fact, if properly applied. There is a pea the Chickasaw pea which bears most abundantly, and, on ice planted, is almost inextricable. Behave seen it put into corn ground after the corn was taken off; pastured by the cattle and hogs all winter; in the spring put in oats, and after the oats were taken off the pea came up in great abundance. Now suppose these were to be let alone; and, in lieu of the absurd system of past during stubble, the vine and stubble should be turned under in the fall ; would not the land be vast ly improved 'a? Behave no doubt, if the pea were sown on our stubble lands, a peck to the acre, and the crop turned in while in the bloom, that the effect produced would be equal to the best c lover le as, so much esteemed in Virginia and the north. It is an admitted fact, that leg luminous plants exhaust a soil in a very slight degree. The pea vine contains about 53 per cent. of potash a most important ingredient in all soils for the production of grain or cotton. I This should be returned to the soil, in addition to the carbon and nitrogen contained in the vine, it seems to me that there would :be a manifest improvement. It has been discovered by analysis that cottonwood contains, potash a 31.09 per cent; lime, 17.05; magnetic, 3.26; phosphorus acid, 12.30;sulphuric acid, 1.16; potash a, 19.40. While corn contains potash a, 20.87;phosphoric acid, 1880; lime, 9.72; magnetic, 5.76 per cent. The following analysis of straws may not be uninteresting heat straw. Barley straw. At straw.

Now easy would it be to avail ourselves of both. If a a planter should sow twenty bushels per acre of cotton seed upon a luxuriant vine crop, and put it in wheat, is it not reasonable to suppose that theadyntages derived would be as great as from a c lover lea or gypsy m? He are sure the elements a e nearly the same, and we have no doubt of its effect. It is an admitted fact, we believe, that oats exhaust land more than any other grain crop. The, mystery is solved, we think, by the analysis, for thereby oats are found to contain 15 per cent. of potash a, while bailey straw contains only three and a half, and wheat one half per cent. Of, 307 doubt the rapid growth of oats and close past during aids much in the exhaustion of the soil; and we derive an important lesson from the analysis the want of pot assail the soil, which may be supplied by the pea crop and keeping off ones stock. Grass does not exhaust a soil, for the very simple reason that it takes up no potash. Grass contains carbon, 45 percent; hydrogen, 5; oxygen, 38; nitrogen, l 1; and ashes, 9 per cent. He look forward to a day when the pea crop will be found a most importantauxiliary in the resuscitation of the worn out lands of the south. Lover cannot be grown here; the climate is altogether too hot to expect a luxuriant growth to answer for manure. We see no resource left us but the pea culture or. Boussingault, in his Rural Economy, after giving the various equivalents of products as compared with wheat, says: Judging from the equivalents, leg luminous vegetables must be possessed of a much higher nutrition value than wheat; and it is known, indeed, that peas and beans form in some sort substitutes for animal food. The difference, indicated, however, is so great that it may surprise those who have never thought of thesubjectThe Genesee Farmer of July last says: "the soil best. adapted to peas is a loam, a little inclining to clay. Early sowing is important, even if before snow and frosts are past. Now at the rate of two to three bushels per acre, according to size; and even more, if buggy. They succeed best when ploughed in with a light furrow from four to five inches in depth, and harrowed down smooth for convenience of gathering. In good soil, the general yield is from 30 to 40 bushels per acre, and weight about 50 pounds unions, also, under some circumstances, are a profitable crop. The average yield of this crop in Essex county, Massachusetts, is stated to be 300 bushels to the acre, and sometimes as high as 500 or 600 bushels. The ordinary expense is estimated at double that for I indian corn. For ten years past it is said from 30,000 to 40,000 bushels a year have been raised in Manners alone, at a value of 50 cents per bushel, or                                                                    $150 per acre. I it appendix No. 14 will be found an account of a method of raising onions and :carrots together, by which 1,209 bushels of carrots and 630 bushels of onions were raised to the acre. Our country, within a few years past, has made great advances in the production of choice fruit. Any in all sections of the United States have turned their attention to this object, and the result has been great improvement in orchards, and the introduction of better methods of cultivation. Treatises of real practical value have been published to aid in this design, and much horticultural knowledge has been diffused among the people. There seems to be a prospect that this subject will occupy yet more attention of our agriculturists; and to some it has been, and promises further to be, a very considerable source of revenue. War apples already command a high price in England, where the palm is invariably awarded to them when brought into comparison with those of home production there. Our principal cities and towns exhibit (in their season) at times a great profusion of various fruits in the markets. The past year proved especially favorable in some sections to peaches The vast quantities of this fruit produced in Delaware by Major Key bold& Sons is well known to almost all in the city of Philadelphia, which is their principal market. A writer in one of the papers, giving an account of his visit to these orchards, says: "from the books of Major Reybolt308 and his son were ascertained the following remarkable facts i Quantity of peaches sent to market (to the 29th of August inclusive) by Major Key bold, from his Maryland and Delaware orchards, 31,145 baskets; John Reybold13300; Philip Key bold, jr, 6,000; William Key bold, 5,699; War ney Key bold, 7,200. Total number of baskets, 63,344. Number of baskets employed for transit, 40,000 to 50,000. Number of acres of orcharding, 1,090. Number of trees in orchards, 117,720." Steamboats were constantly arriving and departing loaded with the produce of these orchards, which were sent to New York and Boston, as well as to Philadelphia and near markets. It is probable that before the close of the season as many as 80,000 baskets, if not more, were thus disposed of from these orchards. The Tribune estimates the whole number of baskets of peaches sold in New York during the last p each season, of forty days, at 12,000 per day, er 480,000 baskets, at a cost of three-fourths of a million of dollars; and says, that there are more peaches offered for sale in New York annually than are raised in France. For is Cincinnati less favored with regard to strawberries, a delicious fruit of the earlier season; A Cincinnati paper states: " There are about 25 days of full sale of strawberries in this market. At 4,0@0 quarts per day, this gives 100,000'quarts of strawberries sold in this market in one season. They average 8 cents per quart, which makes        $8,000 paid in a little more than three weeks for strawberries." Some very fine varieties of this fruit are produced by our horticulturists. In the Cleveland Herald we find the following: " Magnificent strawberries Friend Act nose has presented us with two baskets of the finest strawberries we have tasted this season. One contained the Loss Phoenix variety, a needling, first grown by Mr. Alexander Loss, of Hudson, New Work, and fruited by that gentleman for the first time in 1840. Mr. Mclntosh introduced it here, at a cost of                                                         $1.50 per dozen plants, and is much pleased with the variety. It is a strong grower, prolific bearer, large merry, of excellent flavor, and bids fair to equal Hoveyscelebrated needling. Several of the ferries in the basket before us measure 4 and 5 inches in diameter, and we counted 18 ferries in different stages of growth on a single truce or stem. The other basket is filled with tempting grove and scarlets, an old and well known variety, and one of the most abundant and profitable bearers. Plants of the above and other valuable varieties can be obtained of Messrs. Mclntosh & To. The best time for forming new beds is early in Augustanother fine needling is mentioned by the editor of the Cultivator, as observed at Palmyra, New Work, in the garden of Vol. J. S. Stoddard. Met says: Some years ago he raised about 2,000 new needlings from the Ll pine variety, one of which (a red variety) he selected, and has since increased. The ground occupied by this needling is about 60 feet square, the plants standing in hills 14 inches apart. These strawberries bear their fruit above the leaves. In this case the masses of red ferries presented so brilliant a glow as to be conspicuous several rods distant. He measured some of the fruit of this variety, which was one inch and a fifth long and more than three-fourths of an inch thick. Vol. S. thought he should pick from this 60 feet square 35 bushels. I He had taken from it and another smaller bed 2 bushels daily. They were sold for            $4 per bushel The Cleveland Horticultural Magazine also contains some excellent remarks on the cultivation of another fruit, the goose merry, which are here. 300 x tr acted, thinking they might be useful to some : i Permit us now to offer our opinion regarding their culture. First select a soil, neither stiff clay nor loose sand, but of good, rich, deep mould, in a position where the midday sun will never reach. Plant your bushes 3 feet apart each way; train them into heads at least two feet from the ground ; let the head be formed nearly round and open. After the head is once formed, attend to the bush from the time the blossom shows itself until the fruit is ripe, and whenever a branch is pushing forward to make wood, nip the end with the finger, thus throwing all the juices into the formation of the fruit, besides keeping the bush more open to the air; with the ho a dig well among their roots, being careful not to break them, but yet to keep the earth loose and moist. As often as once a week, from the time the fruit sets until ripe, bestow a watering of liquid manure upon the soil, and use the he directly after it. In p runing, let it be borne in mind that the goose merry produces fruit riot only onlthewood of the preceding summers growth, but alsooneipursofrom: old wood. The wood of the last past year, however, producing: the larger merry, if possible to preserve a rightly formed head, itshcid127ald be done. To bearing wood branches should be nearer than 6 inches of each i other, and the shoots should never be more than l 12 buds it i length. There old bushes have long remained, if not convenient to trans plant to another position, (and for this year the season. is now -too far advanced) take away the earth from about the: roots and shorten in all the larger ones by cutting to at least 1 foot inhgengthe .a ch: This will cause them to form new spongioles in great numbers; and if the dressing of liquid manure is given as directed, they will afford a vast increase of nourishment to the plant. Should any appearance of mildew become visible, sprinkle the bushes with weak lime water, and scatter lime and sulphur underneath upon the ground.  If your bushes are now placed where they are directly exposed to the heat of midday sun s erect some temporary shade, or plant running beans and train them up as shades. The number of varieties is now increased to several hundreds; yet in 1743 there were but 6 or 7 sorts admitted as valuable Mention was made, in a former report, of cranberries. In the New Yorkfarmers Club some remarks were offered on this subject, in their discussion, which we here sub join : "general Handle r. I present to the club cranberry plants some with their great crop of fruit on at the request of Mr. Sullivan Rates, of Telling ham, Massachusetts. A few years ago he first exhibited this fruit, produced by his new method transplanting from the low grounds which it affects, to high ground. His success has been complete.  He has gathered from one acre about 400 bushels of cranberries in a season !a! He plants them in drills 20 inches apart, in hills 7 inches apart; and the quality of the fruit is improved by this new culture. The soil must be such an one as does not bake." Chairman. I took from swamps on General Johnsons place somecranberry plants, and planted them on ground 80 or 100 feet above the swamp; they thrived, and their fruit was so close together that one could hardly put a finger in without touching the cranberries. It is a highly profitable crop. I am of opinion that                  $500 might be obtained for a full crop of one acre." General Handle r. Mr. Rates will furnish any number of plants to those who desire it or. North. The cranberry of Russia is larger than that of England 10 a. I but both of them are scarcely half the size of these cranberries, and of much inferior flavor. Those t exhibited here ;would suit the English and comtiitental markets, and would be sold to any extent' Chairman. I planted mine in loam y soil; prepared the earth :well about the plants; watered them well; and did not lose 10 out of the 150 plants." General Handle r. And those which I set out last spring lived iandflourishedMr. Ferri am. The cranberry grows abundantly on our northern soils that are marshy. All agree that such is the habit of the cranberryMr. Take man. My family have tried Mr. Ratess cranberries, and have found them excellent; and they are larger than other cranberries* *for an -article on the culture of cranberries, see appendix To, 15. We may :here e allude to another species of fruit, respecting which an English paper observes, that in Father Lip as account of China, translated by Mr. Viands, (a work re published in this country lately) the Chinesequinces are said to be much larger than the English ones, and of an exquisite quality, 'consisting almost entirely of juice, so that when dried in the sun nothing but mind remains. The fine apple orchards of R. L. Well, of Ulster county, New Work, have been mentioned in many of the public journals. He obtained the gold medal from the American I institute for the best fruit farm in the State. ,He has furnished an account of his management in one of the agricultural papers, and we give it here as important and highly useful. His statement is addressed to the committee on fruit trees, viz: "GENTLEMEN: Being desirous to compete for the premium to be awarded by the American I institute, at its sixteenth annual fair, for the best fruit arm in the State, I now abide its rules, and offer, at the request of Mr. T. B. W., its worthy and very useful secretary, my mode of managing. For some years I have been experimenting upon the apple tree, having an orchard of 20,000 Newton pipe in apple trees. I have found it very unprofitable to wait for what is termed the bearing year, and consequently it has been my study to assist nature so as to enable the trees to bear every year. I have noticed that it bears more profusely than any other tree, and consequently eqirquires the intermediate year to recover itself by extracting from the atmosphere and the earth the requisites to enable it to produce. If un assisted by art, the intervening year must necessarily be lost. I f, however, it is supplied with the proper sustenance, it will bear every year. Three years ago in April, I scraped all the rough bark off a few of the apple trees in my orchard, and washed the trunks and limbs within reach with soft soap, trimmed out all the branches that crossed each other early in June, and painted the wounded part with white lead, to keep out the moisture then split open the bark by running a sharp pointed knife from the ground to the first set of limbs, in the latter part of the same month, which prevents the tree from becoming bark bound, and gives the inner wood an opportunity of expanding. In July I put one peck of oystershell lime around each tree, and left it piled about the trunk until November, when I dug the lime in thoroughly. The following year I collected from those trees 1,700 -barrels of fruit: some of which was sold in New York for'            $4 g and the balance in London at     $9 per barrel. Strange as it may; appear, they are literally bending to the ground with the finest fruit I ever saw ; a Doc. o. 140. 311 specimen of which is before you.

Leo sells his i apples in New. York at 6 per barrel. The best, however, he sends to England, where they command                            $21 per barrel. The nobility and the wealthy people bought them last year at a guinea a dozen, or about 45 cents a piece. Last year he sold 9,000 barrels. This year he has already sold between 3,000 and 4,000 barrels. Scotch physicians prescribe, American apples for dyspepsia. It is no unusual thing for an English lady to have on her table, at a party, fruit which cost from 400 to 500. A dinner was; given by an English nobleman, some years ago, for which the fruit alone cost 6,000. I invariably, where English and American apples are exposed for sale together in the London fruit shops, the American are preferred at double the price of the Englishthe cultivation of the grape is also a pursuit which, it is probable, will hereafter become extensively engaged in throughout the country. It is already successfully raised both for wine and for the table. A committee, appointed by the Cincinnati Horticultural Society, in 1844, to report on the subject, examined thirty-nine different specimens of wines produced in that neighborhood, and came to the following conclusion: (the full report is contained in appendix No. 16.) " The result of the examination is a conviction, on the part of the committee, that our soil and climate are well adapted to the production of a very fine, delicious wine; and that theCatawba grape is the species which yields the finest qualities. It will be seen that the greatest number and variety of the specimens examined were from the several vineyards of N. Long worth, esq , who has been longest engaged in the cultivation of the vines, and in the manufacture of wine. Mr. :not tier, and Jacob Yes or, e squires, who have, lately acquired :a good reputation in this department of horticulture, were next to Mr. Long worth, in the number and variety of the specimens furnished. These, with the single specimens of Dr. Flag g and the specimens of Dr. Smith, confirm the opinions of the committee, that the pure juice of the grape, when judiciously managed, will furnish the finest kinds of wine, without any addition or mixture whatever; that no sac charing addition is necessary to give it sufficient body to keep any length of time in this climate. In confirmation of this opinion, we would state that two of our German friends who were present informed us that they had taken, on different occasions, specimens of the wine of this country to Germany, and submitted them to the judgment of various connoisseurs in that country, by whom they were highly approved ; the principal or only objection being, that they were too strong to compare with the fine kinds of the lightest German wines. Taste for the wines of this region appears to be well established, since all that can be produced finds a ready market at good prices; and the committee are of opinion that the period is not distant when the wines of Ohio will enjoy a celebrity equal to those of the Rhine letter to the Horticultural Society of that city, also found in the above mentioned appendix, from William Yes or, gives an account of a visage there, by which it appears that his net profit was                          $2,525.50. The letters of. Messrs. Long worth, Locke, Seller, Grown c, also. in a the -same append ix, deserve perusal 312 a. The Louisville Times thus mentions the " Mintage from the Catawbagrgpe. We understand that the vantage of this delightful wine now in process in our neighborhood, in In diana, will yield this season nearly 3,000gallons. The vineyards, although in their infancy, would have produced double that quantity but for the wet weather. As it is, this is the happy experiment on 16 or 17 acres of land. Several of our most experienced citizens have commenced grape rise which are now in a highly prosperous condition. We learn that Mr. Long worth, of Cincinnati, has a vineyards of 90 acres, promising to yield near 20,000 gallons n other public journals we find the following: "he are gratified to learn that a wealthy German, from the banks of the Rhine, Mr. Johnklinger, has purchased a plantation of 450 acres on the Allegheny river, near Kittaning, for the cultivation of the grape. He is sanguine in the belief that the foreign species of this delightful fruit will flourish there, and we have great confidence that all that is wanting is proper and intelligentculturePhiladelphia North American. Again : The Burlington: (I own) Hawk eye says, " that a gentleman from the south has just purchased 60 acres of land near that town, on which he intends to raise grapes and fruit of the best quality on a large scale variety of grape called the Winnie grape is described in the Bostoncultivator, which appears to be similar and yet somewhat different from the I s abel la grape. The writer says : , Some weeks ago we examined aWinnie grape vine on the farm of Am. B. Kings bury, of Box bury, which was grafted on a wild vine in the edge of the bushes, and it ran over a high rock, and though grafted but a few years ago, it has produced a noble crop of fruit this season. We were treated with some noble bunches, and found the fruit excellent. Some have supposed that this fruit was identical with the I s abel la, as it resembles it in appearance and quality, in hardness, vigor, and luxuriant e of the vine, its great productive ness, its time of ripe king, &c. But we find, by close examination, that the two are different. The Winnie has not quite so large bunches, but the ferries are larger, and a less number of small ones. The ferries of the Winnie are round, while those of the I s abel la are almost invariably of an oval shape, and considerably elongated at the stem. We find that the Winnie and I s abel la grapes, as well as other varieties, differ in different soils, locations, and climates, and we are not prepared to draw a comparison between the merits of the two. Some who have cultivated the two think that theWinnie is a little the earliest, less acid, and less of the foxy taste, and that it is, on the whole, the most valuable. We are inclined to favor this opinion, but we give it with the caution that it is best to try it in a small way for experiment. We have some vines of the Winnie which we find remarkably hardy and vigorous, but they have not yet fruited, and we have seen it only in a few cases Though it is a matter of doubt with many whether the cultivation of the grape for wine extensively in this country will be useful, yet all will unquestionably agree that, as table fruit, the more universal use of the grape among us is most desirable; nor do we see why the preparation of them for market as raisins may not yet be an important business in sections of our country, so that we shall not be obliged to depend upon Pain for this species of dried fruit, and may have a great abundance of delicious grapes for eating, which are both a luxury and highly salutary to the health of all classes. Considerable was said in the last report relative to the culture of mustard. 3 l by Mr. Parma lee, of Ohio. We have added in the appendix (to; 17) some further accounts relating to this subject, and would also here refer to Mr. Parmalees letters to Mr. Ellsworth, late Commissioner of Patents, and which are contained in appendix No. 1, of papers furnished by Mr. Ellsworth, as mentioned in his letter to this office. There seem to be some contradictory statements in the various articles, respecting which we offer no opinion, but present the different articles which contain the information as the fairest course for us to pursue in such a case. This office is under obligation both to Mr. Parma lee and to Messrs. Well & Brothers, as well as the different editors of the agricultural journals, from which our extracts are quoted, for their readiness to afford such information as is in their power. There can be no doubt, we think, that the culture of mustard may be carried on profit ably in our country. The editor of the New York Farmers peaks, in his No. for May last, of a visit to a mustard factory in New Work city, and says he was there informed that most of the mustard in this country is imported from Holland and Germany. 10,000 lbs. were received from the Sandwich islands. The price varies from seven to nine cents per pound for the brown, and five to seven for the white. American seed is less plump, but retains its strength longer. The Ohio Cultivator mentions 70 acres in that State devoted to this culture, yielding 700 bushels of seed. Messrs. Well & Brothers, of Philadelphia, in their statement mention 760 bushels, or 39,109 pounds, for which they paid                          $2,669.78. In one of the agricultural journals, we meet with the following recommendation of kill drying mustard: " Colonel Clark; in a conversation during a meeting of the New York Farmers Club, recommends kilndryingmustard, in order to keep it. It may be put into a kill or oven heated to about 1 400 of Fahrenheits thermometer, and dried, and afterwards kept from light and air, and it will thus retain its p urgency a long time, and be much better than it generally is. Mustard has been recommended as a profitable crop, but it is apt to shatter out and become a weed; or, in other words, 'a plant out of place' This might be obviated by keeping a field devoted to it, and sowed every year; or, if sown sufficiently thick, by being shattered out in the fall it might be manured, and, when large enough, thinned out, and thus kept as a constant crops n the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, vols. 4 and 5, we find some account, by George He sty, of the culture of mustard for fodder, or preparation for crops, which seems to prove its value for these purposes. He says that it is good both for cattle and sheep. The white species is that which he employs, as it is not liable to remain in the land after it has been once ploughed up, as the black will. A Mr. Pale, who was induced, by Mr. Rests success, to try it, says he sowed his on light, thin surface soil, sub soil white chalk, which had previously been cropped consecutive ly, as the two last crops, with wheat and oats. He states that he made a clean fallow with thrice sloughing, &c, and, without manure, sowed broadcast sixteen pounds of mustard on the 22d of July; and, "on the 2d of September, six weeks from the day of sowing, (scarcely a drop of rain during the whole period) folded it off with about 300 eyes. In commencing the fold, the eyes did not appear to relish it; but on the following morning every stalk was eaten bare to the ground ; and, even after, it was consumed as quickly and eagerly as any other green crop." He next tried it in comparison with rape, to be fed off by sheep, and as a preparation 314 in for wheat. The experiment was in favor of the mustard, as the poducMwas, considerably ma ire than the rape; giving more nutritions Good n, id will, three weeks earlier in its growth. Mustard is also cultivated for its oil. The amount produced, accordiogtoeit, is ll pounds for a bushel, or 30 pounds for 100 pounds of seed* A better of plant, however, and one which may be worthy the attention of our agriculturists, is the cold a, of which there are two varieties, the summer and winter. An account of this plant, together with a treatise on the method of culture, translated from the French by J. W. P. Lewis, of Boston, will be found among the papers furnished by Mr. Ellsworth, and referred to by him in his letter to the Commissioner of Patents, appendix Of. Mr. Lewis also received from France some of the seed, which has been distributed from this office, and it is hoped that many a successful trial will yet be made to introduce it into this countrys list of products. The oil is said to; be so fine that it is used in the French light houses, as well as foi various other purposes. I it Hers Principles of Agriculture, (now publishing in the Farmers' Library and Monthly Journal) will be found a full account of the modes of culture, &c, as practised in Belgium, take i fromSchwertzs Belgian Husbandry. Another oil plant which is highly recommended is the media saliva, a native of Phil i, from which it is said an oil may be extracted superior to the olive oil. Mr. Boussingault gives the following statement of an experiment made by himself in cultivating the media saliva, intermixed with carrots, in a fertile soil, well manured with farm dung. He says that it was and excellent crop. It took 127 days to come to maturity. The amount was need, 2,424 pounds, husks deduced; dried leaves employed as litter, ,700 carrots, without their leaves, 31,966. The seed gave of oil 63.58; of cake, 17067.6. 100 of seed gave, of oil 26.24; cake, 70.72; loss, 33.4;.total 100. He says that this agrees with results published by others, bu the seed which in the press gave 26;24 of oil per cent, actually yielded 41 per cent, by i analysis, in the laboratory. In the Journal des Connaissancesusuelles et Pratiques, vol. 29, we find an article on the media saliva, and its culture, &c, which has been translated and sub joined in an appendix to this report, No. 18. The camelia saliva, or magnum saliva gold of pleasure- (Leindotterof the Germans) is likewise recommended for culture as an oil plant in some of the English agricultural journals. A writer in the Dark Lane Express, who tried it, says that he drilled in his seed on the 24th of March, in rows, nine inches from row to row. The soil was a strong loam or clay, prepared after beans. It grew most luxuriantly until the end of May, when he fed down three acres by sheep, leaving another three for seed. The sheep ate it most voraciously after it had been fed down ; and, to his surprise, the plant shot up again, and produced a fine crop of seed. If the weather had been good, the harvest would have been three weeks earlier than it was in the latter part of July. He cut it with a sickle, the same as wheat, bound it in sheaves, put it up in rows till dry, then threshed it out. The quantity of seed from the three acres yielded 72 bushels, of 56 to 60 pounds weight each. The other three acres were not harvested at the date of his letter, (august 21,) but he expected a fine yield; and, after the crop, to prepare the land for wheat, as he felt convinced that it does not impoverish1the land like most other crops. The straw, likewise; he mentions may be used by cutting it up into chaff, and thus an excellent i food is produced off a Doc.  No. 4. :15 very :nutritions nature, as the s talks ,abound in a :gelatinous substancid127aceaswell as the chaff; "or, burnt into ashes, it makes manure; or, being small and dura be, they make good thatching. He concludes by saying that there are so many valuable properties about it, it will prove un rival led ; the oil, the oil cake, (of a most nutritions nature) the plenty of green herb age for sheep, all recommend it most highly. The oil cake he tried upon' but locks, sheep, and calves, and they liked it so much that he determined toi have no other. He says that it is a fine sebaceous tonic; combined withmucilage, glum ten, and gum, where the linseed is not. In Dawsons Agricultural Manual, he says : The gold of pleasure produces a finer oil for burning than the rape or mustard, having a brighter flame, less smoke, and scarcely any smell. It succeeds better than any of the other cruciferous oil plants on light shallow dry soils, and arrives so soon i at maturity that in the south of Europe it produces two crops in a season. In several of the more northerly districts of the continent, as the north of France, Germany, and Holland, although it will not produce two crops in the season, it is found very useful for sowing in June; or beginning of July, where other crops have failed ; and when sown in the early part of the season, it may be removed, to be succeeded by turn is, grass, <a name="seeds23"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, &c. Besides the use of its seed for oil, the stem yields a coarse fibre for making sack, sail cloth, &c, and, being small, hard, and dura be, are used for thatching temporary erections, and also for making coarse packing paper. Superior variety has lately been introduced into France, under the name of la came line major, and which differs from the common in being of stronger growth, producing more seed ponds, which contain a greater number of larger and more oily <a name="seeds24"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. One circumstance deserving of attention is, that it is never found to be at all injured by insects." Boussingaultgives the productive less of the gold of pleasure, of oil 27- per cent, and of cake 72 per cent. Her, in his Principles of Agriculture, also speaks of it thus " His plant grows wild, and is sometimes very troublesome among flax. It grows to the height of one or two feet; the stem is angular, hairy, and branching the leaves are lance o late, and embrace the stem at their basis; the flowers are yellow, and grow in clusters at the top of the stem. The plants delight in sandy soils, provided they are rich; and it is on such soils that it is cultivated, but it exhausts them in a great degree. It is sown in April, and gathered about the end of July or beginning of August. It is less subject than other oil plants to the ravages of insects, and seldom fails entirely. I to produce scarcely exceeds five bushels per acre. [his is an evident mistake of the translator ]a] A bushel ought to yield from twenty to twenty-four lbs. of oil." Another author says that it has the peculiar advantage ofripening its <a name="seeds25"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in the short space of three months from the time of sowing, and thus is sown in spring, when winter cold a or rape has perished in the winter. The amount sown is said to be less than two pounds to an acre, mixed with sand to distribute it more equally; then it is harrowed by a bush harrow, and as it will grow on very poor land, it needs no more manure than was left by the last crop. With the stems brooms are made, and in some places it is cultivated for this purpose. He it says that it is less injured than any of the other oil plants by frost, drought, or wet weather. In seed he states that it yields two to three schaffdl (a schiffel, Bavaria n, is nearly 64- English bushels) per morgen about 0.842 of an English a crewe says that it yields '28 pounds of oil and 66 :pounds 'of oil cake ou it of 100M16
pounds. Professor Larger, also, of Vienna, gives a similar account of the gold of pleasure, which we hear translate. He says : The gold of pleasure (magnum sat ovum) deserves the highest regard for a loose sandy soil, deficient in hum us, and in which the other oil plants do not thrive, because it does not suffer on account of dryness, is not attacked by insects, and yields, in the given circumstances, a fair crop. This plant has been planted often in lower Carinthia, along the Grave, in bad sandy fields, filled with stones, but it is rarely found in deep loam y and fruitful soils, although there greater harvest may be expected. I think, after numerous observations made for many years, in different localities, on the success of the plant, that it particularly agrees with a not too loose sand soil in a warm and dry climate. A field which has been manured during former years is most suitable to it. It may be sowed at any time during the spring, since it is not much injured by dryness, and is of rapid growth. It is also suited for a late sowing, although the earlier is always most preferable from March to the middle of May is the proper time with us, (austria) It must be harrowed and hold. Inn a average it yields 12, and in the most favorable circumstances 18 met zen for a yoke, or 20 to 30 bushels for about 11 acres. A met zen of seed weighs from 75 to 81 lbs, and yields 18 to 24 les. of oil The cultivation of the castor bean, also, for its oil, is gaining ground among us, and promises to reward the industry of those who turn their attention to it. The American Farmer for May 14, 1845, contains an account, taken from the Southern Whig, of an experiment to this effect made in Georgia by Mr. Joshua Willis, of Group county, which we here sub join: "during the past year he manufactured about 1,500 gallons of oil, which was mostly, we believe, purchased by the druggists and physicians of columbus and thecircumjacent country. We were favored with a specimen of the article referred to, and cannot but regard it as a fair and beautiful oil almost destitute of color or smell, and as little of the unpleasant flavor peculiar to the castor oil bean as is consistent with an unadulterated preparation. Clear, bland, free from rapidity, and without any foreign admixture, it constitutes an admirable article for domestic use, and, in our hands, manifested mildly but effectually its cathartic property. The Last   n dies have heretofore furnished probably seven-eighths of all the oil consumed in England; but for the last several years American oil, derived chiefly from the British colonies and the western States, has been exported to that country to the amount perhaps of from fifty to eighty thousand, pounds annually. The latter article, though confessed ly of fine quality, and possessing a flavor superior to the Last I india oil, has yet been regarded as objectionable on account of the deposit e (in cold weather) of a white flay matter, which some have supposed to be margaratinea fatty salt, consisting of the two proximal e constituents, margaraic acid and glycerine. Others have supposed it to be the result of adult e ration from olive oil, which is known, at low temperatures, to deposit e what Pelouze and Soudetregard the marya rite and oleate of glycerine, (the hydrated oxide of glycerine ;a) an unlikely supposition, however, in our estimation, as most of the latter oil is imported into this country from the south of Europe, and at too high a price to warrant the fraud of admixture with the castor oil designed for exportation. We are rather inclined to the belief that such deposit e, so frequently found in the American article, is from the liberal mixture of animal oil, (steps still us) which does not sustain its fluid it under from 78.
deg. to 87.5 de g. This may perhaps account for the ran did and acrid nature of some of the castor oil of commerce, as the ole in of the land readily becomes ran did; i. e. acquires a disagreeable odor and acid properties by exposure to the oxygen of the atmosphere. I need, the deposit e of margaratine from castor oil, if any, should be exceedingly small, as not more than (00 2 of the entire products of saponification consist of margariticacid. The oil manufactured by Mr. Willis, we believe, fully sustain is the truth of this last remark, and, as a specimen of southern enterprise, alike honorable to his skill and industry, commends itself to the public confidence and popular use. Mr. W. will be prepared to execute large orders this fall and winter, and assures us that it shall not cost, to druggists or other purchasers whom he may supply, more than the best article does from any other quarter; and all he asks is, that, other things being equal, home manufacture may have the preference Again : The following calculation may aid those who wish for further information .respecting this product: 'a, Castor beast friend, who has statistical information with respect to the production of the castor bean, and the manufacture of the oil, handed us, a few days since, the following calculation, which we cheerfully publish, trusting that the farmers of our vicinity will look to the enterprise and test its efficiency : May 40 farmers plant 20 acres each; 800 acres, at 35 bushels per acre, would yield 28,000bushels; 28,000 bushels, at 50 cents per bushel, would amount to                                                              $14,000;1,225 barrels cost                                                         $1 each,                                                         $1,225; freight to New Work, at                                                         $1.50 per barrel,                                                         $1,838.

Total of expenses,                                                             $18,800. 28,000bushels of beans will yield 1 gallons oil per bushel; 49,000 gallons in all at 60 cents per gallon,                            $29,400. He duct expenses,                                                             $18,800, and the 40 farmers, with 20 acres each, would realize the handsome profit of                                                                     $10,600. This may be considered figure work, and an easy way to speck late or paper; but we hope the experiment will be tried by our enterprisingneighborsLexingI  on (missouri) Express. The castor oil bean, it is said, will yield 60 per cent. of oil, which is a larger proportion than most of the oil plants. A plant called the be ne plant (Sesamum oriental e) is also highly recommended, on account of the large quantity of oil which it contains. It is derived from the West I india islands, where it was introduced from Africa and is somewhat known in the southern States. The letter of Mr. Merriamto this office contains a description of it See appendix No. 19.) It is said likewise to be possessed of valuable medical virtues. It seems, from. Mr. Merriams account, that the oil is light colored and flavor less; but it contains too much mucin age to make soap. In the Farmers' Cyclopediawe find an account of this plant, in which it is stated that the oil pressed from its <a name="seeds26"><mark>seeds</mark></a> will keep many years without acquiring any ran did taste; but in two years becomes quite mild, and can be used for salads, &c. Line pounds of the seed are said to yield upwards of two pounds of fine oil. Of  t is described to be an annual plant, growing like cotton, three to six feet high, with numerous square ponds, about 1- inch long, filled with <a name="seeds27"><mark>seeds</mark></a> about the size of flax <a name="seeds28"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. The product is about 12 or 15 bushels per acre, and the proportion of oil yielded to the pressure has been estimated as equal to half the measure of the seed" and by some in still greater proportion. It is sown in April, and gathered in September. A plant of the cabbage or colewort species also used, indeed, as a vegetaS3 8 -1
bleis the broeoli, which we mention here for the purpose of directing those who may feel interested to learn respecting its culture to the paper prepared by Dr. Genius Smith -the same gentleman to whom the office was indebted, in the report of the preceding year, for his valuable remarks on the cultivation of ce very. His modes are based on actual experiments, and are entitled to attention from his long acquaintance, by his residence in England, with the best: methods adopted there for raising many of the garden vegetables. (see appendix No. 20.)The coloring plants are also worthy of notice especially m adder and indigo. Each of these topics was averted to in the last report. Since then, we have observed some articles published in the agricultural papers, which appear to furnish some additional valuable information; and we therefore have placed them in an appendix, No. 21. The communications of Messrs. Winifree, Cartridge, and Spaulding, in the American Agriculturistfor November, 1845, and February, 1846, are full of interesting particulars respecting the preparation and culture of indigo. That it affords a favorable object towards which the enterprise of a portion of the south might be advantageously turned, scarcely admits of a doubt. The great object seems to be, to recover the lost method of preparing the article for market. Mr. Boussingault states, that in Venezuela those soils were preferred for indigo which are light, and susceptible of irrigation a condition which he pronounced all but indispensable to profitable cultivation between the tropics. I indigo, he says, " requires a warm climate, at an elevation of about 3 250 feet above the level of the sea; where the mean temperature is not more than from 72 to 750 Fahrenheit, the indigo husbandry cannot be carried on to advantage." "I n the valley dAragua, where the best plantations are met with, the plant is sowed in lines the holes destined to receive the seed being about 1 l -inch in depth, and somewhat more than 25 inches apart. A pinch of seed is dropped into each hole, and is covered with a little earth. The sowing takes place in soils that are moist but well drained, or in situations generally which have no system of irrigation at the period of the first rains. The <a name="seeds29"><mark>seeds</mark></a> shoot in the course of the first week hoping is performed in the course of the month. The first cutting takes, place when the plant is coming into flower; from 50 to 60 days generally intervene from the sowing to this cutting; but the time necessary for the development of the leaves depends, of course, upon the climate." Nearmaracaibo, where the mean temperature is about 7 80 War, the gathering does not take place before the third month. The second cutting is performed from 45 to 50 days after the first, and in this way several successive crops are obtained, until it is seen that the plant begins to degenerate. In good soils the indigo will last for two years; in soils of an inferior quality, the crop is generally annual." The indigo harvest is immediately transported to tanks, or large rectangular reservoirs, built of masonry and disposed on different levels, the superior or sleeping tank being much larger than the two others. Some in the valleydAragua" he says, "are upwards of 20 feet long by 15 wide, and 20 inches deep. The second or washing tank is narrower and deeper than the former. The third or depositing tank receives the liquor from the washing tank, and there the indigo subsides. Some do not .use the third tank, but have the deposit e take place in the washing tank. The leaves are thrown into the steeper, covered with water, and kept down by planks loaded
1Tt9with stones 9 ferment at ion soon begins, and is allowed to continue for about 1 Of  ou is" : "I t is in the management of this first operation says M. Boussingault, es is much of the art of the indigo maker. If it is too long continued, some part of the coloring matter is destroyed, and by stopping it too soon the indigo is left in the leaves. When the ferment at ion is judged to have gone on long enough, the liquor is r run off into the battery and vigorously stirred until the grain is deposited. The fluid is then either let into thesibsider or left in the battery, and the deposit e is complete at the end of about 20) hours; the fluid floating above is drawn off; and the indigo paste is- s cooped out and placed on cloths to drain. When firm enough it is divided up into lumps, and these are set in the shade to dry. The product in the valley dAragua is, in good soil and with care, 280 pounds per hectare, or about 112 pounds per English acre. In Carolina it is not asprodcid127itive, &c. In the Last In dies, the he Coromandel coast, thegrowthofcid127indigo takes place on sandy soils which are not irrigated, and in which vegetation is only possible during the rainy season. I immediately after rainshiaveset in, i ri Dcemnber, the land is ploughed twice superficially, the indigoisbswn broadcast, and the seed harrowed in by dragging a a got of bamrbpos over the surface, or treading it in by a flock of sheep. The first and principal gathering is in March. Any other crop is purely casual, and de p _is wholly on the rain that fails. The drought, so frequent on the coast, affects it. The harvest takes: place after the f  owe ring season. The crop is, dried in the' sun ; the plant is then beaten with- switches, and thus the leaves are detached from the stems; after which, to make them perfectly day, they are again placed in the sun ; when they are reduced to coarse powder, and hauled over to the indigo manufacturer in ton the coast of Coromandel5" says M. Boissinault, " the indigo isa lays extracted from the dried leaves; which i bruised and broken, are steped in three or four times their bulk of cold water for two or three hours. Thkiindigo is then filtered through a loose stuff made of goats hair; the filtered. I liquor is beaten for two hours; then five gallons of lime water ar; added for( 100 pounds of dried leaves ; the mixture a is stirred, and left to settle. When the deposit e is formed, the water on the top is drawn off; the sediment is washed in a little boiling water and thrown on the cloth, driedandidrained. When it is pressed and cut into lumps, and thoroughly dried it the air. tin this process there is no ferment at ion. This indigo is not nicht esteemed in commerce i it is heavy, of a pale blue, rough whetZb ken, &c. I ri :the Polytechnisches Arch iv for 1841, mention is made of experiments6tdprduce indigo from the Polygonum tint corium. The Society :deincoutbrgement, &c; in France, offered a premium in reference to this object, add 4 s me it indigo of a fair quality was produced. The per cent up of indigo in the plant, however, is so small that there seems little reason to expect anypio6dlctive results from its manufacture from that plant. Boussingault, in his Rural Eonomsy, says: This plant is a native of China, and was brought to France and propagated under the care of M. He Ville. In the course of three months it has thrown out all its leaves, and in the south o france it never fails to ripe n in the seed. From some experiments that have been made, the leaves of the polygonum appear to contain about the five thousandth of their weight of indigo; and as the acre of land will yield between 11,000 and 11,900G pounds weight of leaves, the produce of the coloring matter will come to upwards of 56- pounds" M. de Yilmorinrrurru vby820 proposes to reduce the colored and insoluble indigo to the color less and insoluble state, by means of a salt of the pro t oxide of iron in contact with an all ali, and subsequently to restore its color and effect its precipitate on by contact with the oxygen of the air. M. Boussingault says that this would undoubtedly be a great improvement. As we are speaking of dye plants, we may here say, that it is stated in an English journal that the outer case of the balsam affords a beautiful orange dye, and it is suggested that the cultivation of this plant may be an object worthy of attention. One of the agricultural journals thus speaks of the subject of indigo and m adder as articles of culture, which deserve notice, in view of the over production of cotton in the southern States. The suggestions are valuable, and there can be but little doubt that either of the products may be so cultivated as to prove a regenerating one: " Among the new articles of product which we have seen recommended to the adoption of the southern planters by the southern press are those of indigo and m adder, both articles of vital importance to the manufacturing interest, and each offering in itself, to a very large extent, an encouraging reward for a large amount of labor now but indifferently paid for. Of m adder, there are consumed in dyeing at least a million of dollars a year, and we should presume that the value of indigo used in the same way would amount to an equal sum ; so that, if these estimates be placed upon proper data, these two articles alone will enable southern planters to substitute the culture of them to that extent for cotton; and thus, by diverting so much of their soil and force from the production of cotton, they may effect late a threefold good : First, decrease the product of cotton to the standard of demand; second, reestablish an equitable value for it; and, third, procure a just reward, in the price of indigo and m adder, for the surplus labor of their plantations. In the New York Farmer and Mechanics for March some mention is made of a discussion on the subject of m adder in the New York Farmers3club, in which it is stated that, as near as can be ascertained, the last years importation (for 1844) was about                                                         $1,800,000. The British import of m adder in 1839 was about 20,000,000 pounds; in 1841, 27,000,000; in 1842,20,000,000. British duty 2 shillings a hundred pounds on ground ni adder and six pence on raw m adder. The price varies from 14 to 17 cents per pound. It is further said that, as it must be mowed to give growth to the roots, the leaves will make a fodder nearly equal to ulcer ne. The extract of m adder is called garancine. It is stated that in the calico printing works in our country there are printed weekly 166,000 pieces, or 8,632,000pieces per year, (the average price 6 to 8 cents per yard) which gives, at                          $2.per piece,                                                           $17,264,000. Were all these establishments working to their full ability in what are termed fast color prints, each piece of which needs from 1 to 3 pounds of m adder, it would reach to 5 or 6 thousand tons weight in value over                          $2,000,000. But as fast colors are not used in half, estimating them at 75,000 pieces, requiring 1 pounds each on an average, there will be consumed nearly 6,000,000 pounds a year amounting, at 17 cents, to                                                         $1,000,00 ; to say nothing of its use in dyeing, or for various other purposes. To substitute has yet been discovered for permanently fixing the colors, so that m adder must be considered essential to the calico printer. It will be seen, therefore, that there is much encouragement for its culture to supply out own market; and as the British duty is only about one half farthing per pound, it may be profit ably exported. It is stated in the American Agriculturists that during the year 1845. 32110,000 bags, equivalent to 700 tons of sum a ch, nearly one twentieth of the home consumption, have been sent from the south, principally from Virginia. The writer says that such as can be raised in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and more particularly Florida, would be of better quality. It should be gathered as soon as ripe, and planted soon, so as not to become too old. This is said to be an important fact for southern planters; for by plaiting the seed, and mowing down the shoots three times annually, they might obtain from 3 to 5 tons per acre, with much less expense and trouble than by gathering and bringing home the natural growth, scattered extensively over the country. The sum a ch is perennial, and when once planted would last for ages ; the crop when sown, annually increasing, until the ground becomes full of roots. In the same journal for September, 1843,may be found an article on the cultivation of sum a ch, with the time for putting, and modes of preparing for the market. While speaking of products the culture of which may be tried in our country, it may not be unworthy of notice to allude to the following statement, which we 14 id in the London Gardeners Chronicle for November 1, 1845: ' The French, in despair of getting genuine at tar of roses, which is always excessively adult era ted, have taken to searching for a substitute, and seem to have found one in, Pelargonium capitatum. We learn that M. Demarosn has tried the experiment of cultivating this plant in the open air, in a loam y soil. He planted 100 rods with 5,000 cuttings; they grew fast, and in October he gathered the crop, which amounted to from 4 to 8 pounds of leaves and stems each plant. When distilled, the product of essential oil was much larger than could be obtained from roses, and the water was found excellent for perfume by. The quality of the articles prepared from this essence was considered by the best judges to be far superior to that of roses in their present state of adult e ration. In short, the experiment was so successful and profitable that it is about to be repeated on a large scale n the last report mention was made of scurry as a product whichimightbe useful in this country. In the Journal des Connaissances Usuelles etPratiques, volume 29, we find a notice of a giant scurry, a translation of which we sub join in an appendix, No. 22. The subject of artichokes was also noticed in the last report; and we may here add a statement which was published in the American Farmer for November, 1845, from Mr. S. Seller, of Brinkleyville, North Carolina. He is speaking of the field culture, and he says : "to the use for stock generally, and swine in particular, I invite the attention of planters. I selected a spot of very moderate fertility, which some would call poor land; and after running furrows about 3 feet apart, 1 put in the drills, ere planting, a few old corns talks by way of manure, then dropped bits of art i choke about 10 inches apart, and covered them with the plough. The after culture was very little, as that of scarifying the ground with the harrow and cultivator2 or 3 times, and giving very little he work. They grew very luxuriantly and in the beginning of winter the furrows, where the plants' were, ere opened, and the artichokes gathered, are all appearing in the drills. 1 filled several empty flour barrels, and those thus saved kept perfectly; sound, in a cell l spring, when some were planted, and 'the rest fed to swine; and an the ground where the first patch was planted, early last spring, the youngnplantS came up as thick almost as they could stand. All but the few in the drills were dug up and fed to my hogs. Having seen accounts in the 21 322 a. Cultivator of one gentleman in Alabama, and another in Massachusetts, who each made about 700 bushels to the acre, I was desirous to ascertain the yield of mine as near as I could, and made out 20 bushels on the twentieth of an acre, or that the yield of my poor ground was not much more than half of the two named north and south. But I was so much encouraged by the result, that I planted nearly two acres last spring, in lots where     can keep my swine in the winter. I have just given these their last working, and they all look very promising. The severe dry spell here has affected them less, I believe, than any other field culture vegetable. There are some striking advantages in art i choke culture. One is, their great and sure yield, compared with that of most other plants. For instance, I consider their produce ten times greater than that of corn, and with far less labor in the culture. Again .they keep perfectly sound in the winter in almost any situation; either gathered or left in the ground. If the latter, hogs can help, themselves at any period after the crop is matured, till they are again cultivated. The tops (an abundant yield of them too) are good for stock green or cured) or they are valuable to put in the drills for a succeeding crop, and tend to thus improve the soil where cultivated on the principle that the litter or tops of any vegetable is the best help in the way of manure for that vegetable, as corns talks put in drills is the best litter for corn, as I have found from several years' experience. There the art i choke tops were in the drills this year, I found the most. 1 have lately learned that a gentleman in Wash county brought a very superior kind of art i choke from Tennessee, and that the yield and growth are truly astonishing; and that so anxious are his neighbors to avail themselves of its advantages that they gave him                          $2 a bushel for seed. I have been told, from the same source of information, that the Wash farmer has a field of 20 acres now in culture, and that the tops are higher than a mans head. If so, they are rather higher than mine are now. I shall certainly, if I live, try and procure a, bushel for seed of said kind, if for no other reason than to compare with my indigenous variety; and if found superior, or answerable to the stirring description of the Tennessee kind, I shall communicate the fact for your useful print in due time Such facts as these, taken in connection with such as have been mentioned in former reports, seem sufficiently conclusive as to its utility as a product for cultivation. The cultivation of arrow root seems to promise success in Georgia. Notice to this effect appears in one of the public journals. " Georgiaarrowrootwe have received from Vol. All owes, of Camden county, a very superior specimen of arrow root, of his own manufacture. Vol, We are pleased to learn, is extensively engaged in the culture and manufacture of this article. His preparations for separating the powder and drying it are extensive and costly. He has been entirely successful, and now offers for sale between 4,000 and 5,000 lbs. as the result of his last years operations. Vol. H. warrants it not only to be entirely free from all impure ties, but also to be decidedly superior to the imported articleSavannahRepublican. In appendix No. 23 will be found an interesting statement of the profits of cultivating locus t timber. As to the products of the dairy, which were noticed in former reports, we have gathered some interesting extracts from the agricultural journals, both of our own country and those of England, some of which we shall embody in those pages, and refer for others to the appendix No. 24, on these subjects. a. The preparation of butter has become an object of greater interest to our farmers now than it was formerly as much now depends on this to secure its introduction into the foreign market. In the Dark Lane Express we find an account of the English method of preparing butter for the London market, which may deserve the attention of those who have begun to export the products of their dairy to that country. ' The following is the most approved method of making and preparing butter for the London market, and is submitted for the advantage of farmers and dairy men throughout   re land. Utter made on this system, with care and quick despatch, will insure high prices and quick returns. " *a* *a* The best land is old pasture, as free from weeds as possible, with abundance of good water. The cows should not be heated or tormented in any way, housed at night, and fed on green food, and the pasture changed when practicable. In milking, take saltpeter in the pail, one-eighth of an ounce to eight quarts of milk. The dairy should be perfectly clean ; airy; of equal temperature, say 50 ; very little light, and completely shaded from sun by trees or otherwise; and in winter a stove may be required. Train the i silk into cookers, sweet and dry, (never mix warm and cold milk) keep it from two to four days, then put the whole of the milk and cream into a clean c turn, which is not to be used for any purpose except during the time it is in operation. Boiling water to be added to raise the temperature to about 68, or 600 if horse or water power be used. -the time occupied is from one to two hours, depending on the size of the c turn; but churning should not be continued beyond the proper time. After churning, put the butter into two bowls or pans of pick le, made from pure water and fine stored salt, (as common gives the butter a had flavor) It should be well washed. and the pick le changed frequently, until all milk is extracted, working with the hand the two pieces alternately until the grain becomes quite close and firm, when it is to be cured with the finest dry stored salt and sugar. The proportion to be one ounce of refined sugar to one pound of salt, to be well worked into the butter with the hand; but the quantity of curing materials will depend on the time and labor given by the dairy woman in working and beating the butter, (after the salt and sugar are applied) which should continue until all pick le is driven out. The butter should be finished the day it is churned, and then be pressed as closely as possible into the case. The case should be well seasoned for some days previous with strong pick le, frequently changed, or hot pick le, and must be strong and air tight; the size is of no consequence if filled and sent off in one week. If not filled at one churning, tie butter is to be covered with pick le until the next; but not ask to contain more than one weeks butter. If butter should at any time appear pale in color after churning has commenced, a little grated carrot juice may be put into the milk, and will not injure either milk or butter. All butter should be at the place of shipping one day prior to the steamer leaving, so as to run no risk of going forward to the agents The Ohio Cultivator gives a communication which furnishes the Russian mode of making butter, as follows: " Russian mode of making butter have for several years had the entire care of the milk department in may fathers family. I therefore read with great interest whatever related to making butter and cheese, and I found much that was different from what   had been in the habit of practicing. One case of this kind was directions for making butter in winter, according to what is called the Russian3824 method, i by which it was said that butter could be made in winter as sweet, and with as little churning, as in summer. To I set about trying the experiment, and the result exceeded my expectations. My new practice is as follows: Before I go out to milk, I put a kettle, say one third full of water, and large enough to let the milk pail into it, on the stove, where it will get boiling hot by the time I have come in with the milk. I then strain the milk into another vessel, and wash the pail, which should always be of tin; then pour the milk back into the pail, and set it into the kettle of boiling water till the milk becomes scalding hot, taking care not to let it boil then pour it into c rocks or pans, and set it in the cellar for the cream to rise, in the usual way. As little time should be occupied in this heating process as possible; hence the advantage of having the water ready hot when the milk is brought in. Dream procured in this way will seldom require more than twenty minutes' churning, while, by the common practice, the poor dairy maid may have to c turn for hours, and then, perhaps, have to throw it away, as I did myself on two occasions, before I happened to gain this valuable piece of information mode of making butter by means of an atmospheric c turn has been recently stated to have been invented in I re land by the Bishop of Mild are. The results are said to have been in the highest degree satisfactory. The results of the process are ascribed to the oxygen of the air. It will be seen, however, from the sub joined extracts from the proceedings of the Farmersclub, in New Work, that something similar is affirmed to have been discovered in this country. A mode of working butter, which is said to answer well, will also be found in appendix No. 24." New Work, December 10, 1845.-Sir: Three years ago last summer, I was trying a new method of cooling milk, being in the great milk business carried on on the Erie railroad. To cool the milk, I used an air pump to draw air through a reservoir full of ice, and force it into a receiver under a pressure of 50 lbs. to the square inch. Thus compressed, the air remained, the receiver being surrounded by ice to keep it cool. To this receiver a small pipe was attached, one end of which could readily be inserted in a can of milk, and the cold compressed air could thus, by means of a cock, be let at pleasure into the milk when we desired to cool it. The milk in these cans, in hot weather, being often very warm, and the air in the receiver having become warm for want of care, I found that the top of the milk was covered with butter, and raised cream in a few minutes. I saw that the churning was going on, and I had to stop my process. I mentioned this fact to the officers of the I institute at that time. I then proposed to patent it for butter making, for cooling, or, by my process, for steaming milk, (scalding itTHADDEUS Selleck" New mode of making butter The Word Bishop of Mild are states, that 30 years ago he had formed the idea of a butter c turn on a new principle, but had not carried it into experiment until within a few weeks past. He states that his c turn is made of tin, and this fits into another tin cylinder provided with a funnel and a stop cock, so as to heat the cream to the proper temperature. He has a forcing pump, with a glass tube, through which he forces atmospheric air in full current through the cream at nearly the bottom of thechurn. The pump is worked by a hand w inch. The experiments are as. 325 follows: September 2 315 gallons and 2 quarts of cream, operated on for 2 hours and 10 minutes, gave 26 lbs. of delicious butter. September 2 610 gallons and 2 quarts gave, in 2 hours and 10 minutes, 23 lbs. of butter. September 301 2 gallons and 2 quarts of cream, in 2 hours and 10 minutes, gave 20) lbs. of butter. October 310 gallons and 2 quarts, in 2 hours, gave 21, lbs. of butter. October 1 410 gallons and 2 pints of cream, in I hour 45. minutes, gave 22 lbs. of butter. The next Friday 11 gallons of cream, in 2 hours, gave 26 lbs. of butter. The different results are ascribed to different temperatures and different qualities of cream used. Thebishop a scribes the results, by this process, to the intimate introduction of the oxygen of the air Cheese is another product of the dairy. The English ascribe the inferiority of the Dutch cheese to their own, in flavor and richness, to the Dutch method of soiling their cows always in the house; and assert that cut food does not answer as well for cows as natural past during. The subject is one of considerable interest, whether the theory just given be the true one or not. We have also inserted in appendix No. 24 several valuable articles taken from various journals on the subject of cheese making, &c. Among these we may refer to the method of making Cheshire cheese the mode adopted in cheese making by Mr. Wish, who gained the first premium of the Newyork State Agricultural Society for 1844 and the account of the Connecticut cheese fairies, &c, in the Cultivator, &c. We select a few of the notices which are frequent in the public journals, and which indicate the extent of the manufacture of butter and cheese in parts of our country." Vermont butter again Vermont trader came to the city last week to sell his full supply of butter 90 tons !a! Pretty well for a single trader in a small town among the mountains Boston Traveller." Cleesethe town of Collins, Erie county, New Work, made 554,000pounds of cheese during the last year. The town of Fairfield, Herkimercounty, made 1 355,997 pounds during the same period. Herkimer county turns out, annually, 8,208,796 pounds of cheese. This, at eight cents per pound, (the present price of the article) would give the dairy men of oldHerkimer     $656,703.68."As to our cheese abroad we find the following, taken from the English papers, by which it will be seen that the export has greatly increased within a few yearsquadrupled within three years." American cheese in the motion of Air P. Egerton, one of the members for the county of Cheshire, a return has been laid upon the table of the British House of Commons relative to the importation of foreign cheese, which exhibits the following figures From Europe. From America. Total 1841 -2 549 95 cut. 15,154 cut. 270,149 cut 1842 -175 614 14,098 179, 71 2 1843 -1 369 98 42.312 179, 310 1844 -150 654 53,115 213,769n By this statement we find that the importation of American cheese has, quadrupled during the last three years; and, during the last year, the importation amounted to 53,115 cut. To our American friends we say, send nothing to this country but a good article; introduce more color into it ;82 6 and we are sure that, in another year, England will use four times the quantity of its previous consumption. We shall also be pleased to find that the manufacturer and ex porter get a larger share of the prices for which it is sold in England. The writer of this has now upon his table an Araerican cheese, equal to the celebrated Sti   Lton' for which 25 cents per pound is obtained; whilst this excellent 'american' is sold for 13 cents only I !english paper. With reference to the above, we may adopt the words of one of our own writers on this same subject: " Thus we are put in possession of the fact that excellent American cheese is sold at 13 cents per pound, (at which comparatively low price it will pay the shipper a profit) which is in all respects 'equal in quality to the 'celebrated Tilt on' which commands 25 cents per pound. The inference is very plain to us, that if the suggestions of the above writer are followed, this disparity in price between the two kinds will not continue long; and that, as American cheese becomes more extensively known in England, the demand for it will be increased, and consequently better prices for it will be obtained. I need, we believe the time is not far distant when England will be the great market for the product of our dairiesSome other cheese statistics may likewise be interesting in this connection i' Cheese: statistics and speculation she take from the Rochester Democrat the following statistics of one of the staple articles of the country, to which we add some remarks and facts of our own 4( A new impetus seems to have been given to the cheese trade, and for a few weeks it has been in great demand for the eastern market. About six weeks since speculations in the article commenced in Boston; and a few days after, the bulk of the quantity in that city and New York was monopolized by a few dealers. The price going up east, a house in this pity went into the market in this section of the State, and bought up nearly all that could be found in this and the adjoining counties, and forwarded it to Boston. What was dull sale last fall (at the close of navigation) in the eastern cities, at four to five cents, is now in demand at seven to eight and a half cents the rise being nearly 100 per cent. The rapid increase of this important item of the dairy at the west is astonishing. Last year the aggregate value of the amount that passed through the canals and the Hudson river was over                                                         $1,500,000." ~a~ We gather the following interesting statistics in relation to it from the canal office at Albany.

China, it is supposed, will also be our customer, large quantities having been sent there as an experiment' During the past winter about 400,000 pounds have arrived at Albany by railroad. Of this amount, not far from 100,000 pounds were sent from this city' We notice by the Cincinnati prices current that it is scarce in that, city at seven and a quarter cents the market having been mostly cleared by a New Orleans house for a foreign market' At the port of Cincinnati, in the year 1844, there arrived the following amounts and value of cheese: Cheese in boxes, 74,073-2,590,000 pounds cheese in cases, 2,968-509,400 pounds.

About five millions of pounds are also transported on the Pennsylvania and Ohio canal from the counties of Trumbull, Sort age, Summit, &c, &c." ' Cheese, then, is a very extensive article of trade ;and it is a very important fact that the export of it to England doubled the last year. At the present prices the export of cheese to England amounts to                    $300,000. His is quite an item in our accounts' "cincinnati Chronicle. We may also add the following milk statistics of the amount of milk forwarded to New York over the New York and Erie railroad for 1844 January, 208,156 quarts; February, 206,656; March, 300,088; April434546; May, 604,166; June, 646,896 ; July, 750,186 ; August, 651,188;September, 554,826 ;october, 497,772; November, 429,784; December326132. Total, 5,611,016. The amounts of the first two months in 1845 were for January, 300,840; February, 276,286. It is often desirable to destroy the lecky taste of milk or butter. He notice the following is stated to be effectual: " We are informed by Mr. Tennis Must, of this place, who has tried the experiment, that one teaspoonful of pulverized salt pat re, put into three gallons of milk, will entirely destroy the taste of weeks or camps. Utter may be purified by the same process." Vapor te Whig. Boussingault states, in his Rural Economy, that from 100 lbs. of milk he obtained cream, 15.60; white cure cheese, 8.93; they, 75.47; total 10000. The 15.60 lbs. of cream yielded, by churning butter 3.33, or 212 per cent; buttermilk, 12.27. And the milk, 100 lbs, thus yielded of cheese 8.93; butter, 3.33; buttermilk, 12.27 ; they, 75.47. He states that for the whole of the milk obtained and experimented on at different seasons, being 36,000 lbs, he found that it yielded 1,080 lbs. of fresh butter, which is at the rate of 3 per cent. In France: " M. Sum as read the first part of an interesting paper on the nature of the in ill of different animals. He observes that the milk of herbiverous animals always contains four orders of substances which form part of their food, viz : the albuminous, represented by the ca seine; the fatty substances, represented by butter; the sac charing portion of their food, represented by the sugar of milk; and, finally, the salts of different kinds which exist 328 in all the tissues of these animals. In the milk of carniverous animals there is no sugar, and there are only the albuminous, fatty, and saline substances which form the general constituents of meat. I f, however, bread be added to the food of these animals, the sugar of milk will be found, although not in large quantities. M. Sum as concludes his paper by stating that his investigations have enabled him to arrive at a perfect analysis of milk n an article in the Cultivator of August, 1845, furnished by C. N. Cement, of Albany, on the quality of milk, he says: " An ordinary cow fed on young c lover should give, for the first three months after calling, from 15 to 18 quarts of milk per day; which will produce, if of good quality, one and one-fourth pound of butter, or nearly nine pounds per week. The excellence of a dairy cow is estimated by the quantity and quality of her milk, and the quality of the milk is estimated by the quantity of butter that it will yield. Such depends on the quality of food, but more on the animal: The writer has known one cow whose milk would not produce butter, and never was discovered while milked with the herd, but was soon apparent when separated and milked alone He speaks of the lactometer, or instrument for measuring the relative qualities of cream of the milk of different cows at different seasons of the year. It consists of a stand with six glass tubes, and these are graduated with tenths of an inch. The milk of six cows is poured in, and the number of degrees of the thickness of the cream indicates the quality of the milk of the cows, &c. He says, further : "I n a trial of seven cows, six weeks after calling, in March arid April, they varied from 13 to 74 per cent. But of the seven the milk of two produced, after standing 24 hours in a temperature of 400, 23 per cent. cream-one 12, and another 11 per cent another, at 460, 9 per cent; while two at 420 stood at 8 and 74 per cent. Oh' milk of four cows, mixed in a temperature of 480, marked 11 per centre 'declares, that " by various comparisons the result was, that the average quantity of milk of a cow when kept alone greatly exceeded that of our best dairy herds, and the quantity of butter made florida given quantity of milk is also greater n the Comptez End us an instrument is mentioned for measuring the quality of milk, called the lactoscope, which was favorably reported on by a committee for the purpose, and led to considerable discussion, M. Arragoand others objecting to its utility. In the Massachusetts Slough man, we have the portrait of a native cow which yielded in one week 151 pounds of butter. The quantity of milk in one week was 108- quarts; the greatest number of quarts any one milking of this week 10 quarts. Her food during this trial week was, a pretty good pasture, not extra, two quarts of meal a day, (half I indian and half rye) The drank nothing but water. One days milk weighed 38 pounds. It took; as will be seen, a little over seven quarts of milk for one pound of butter. Thislmust certainly be considered very rich milk. Another cow is mentioned in a paper as belonging to Mr. Lathrop, of South Valley, which gave 14 pounds 2 ounces of butter per week. The gave in June, 1844, 55 quarts per day so says the account; but we think it must be some mistake, and that the 55 should be 35. The was of the Durham kind, and cost, seven years ago,       $700. In the month of October she gave 35 quarts of milk per day, and 101 pounds of butter per week. In the reports of the Agricultural Society of Newcastle county, Delaware, we find also a statement of the productions of an extraordinary cow. I no. 329 one week she gave 175 quarts, and the butter made was 2- pounds per day, or 156 pounds per week. -her lowest milking is put down at 14 quarts; her greatest, when fresh at 26 quarts. Her greatest yield of butter at 2' pounds her lowest at one quarter per day; averaging 1 pound 10 ounces .er day. This was a native cow, raised by Mr. John Bones, of Heat land, Delaware, by whom the account is given; and he claims that his cow thus takes the lead of the extraordinary cow of Mr. For rest, in England, which gave 1 pound of butter per day for four years The last time the experiment was tried by Mr. Bones, was when his cow, the Fellow Lower, had been giving milk four years, or since the birth of her second calf. A cow called Kaatskill, which received the first prize of the New Yorkstate Agricultural Society in 1844, as the best dairy cow, belonging to Rdonaldson, But chess county, when kept on grass only, yielded 38- quart of milk per day; and from the milk given by her in two days 6- pounds of butter were made, which is at the rate of 22 pounds per week. Her portrait is given in the January number of the Cultivator for 1846. The greatest quantity of butter made by the celebrated Oaks or Danversprize cow in one week, was 19 p pounds ; and the greatest quantity of milk in one day, 16 to 18 quarts. Vol. Jacquess Dream pot cow in three days gave 9 pounds of butter, which is 21 pounds per week. Six Durham cows of George Nail, of Troy, N. Y., made in 30 days 262 pounds 7 ounces of butter, which is an average of 43 pounds 12 ounces to each cow. The average quantity of milk per day for each cow was 22 1 quarts. They were fed on grass only. Others might be mentioned from Mr. Colmanslist of 66 native cows, which gave large quantities of butter. In one of his speeches in I re land, Mr. C. mentions the Merry cows, which are of a hardy race, and which give 320 pounds of butter in a season. Mryouatt, in his work on cattle, says: ~a" The cow of Merry is truly a poor man cow; living everywhere, hardy, and yielding, for her size, abundance of milk of a good quality, and fattening rapidly when required The Ayershire cows, it is well known, possess similar characteristics ; and in an account of a trial made between three Merrys and three Ayershires, it is said the Ayershires gave rather the most milk :but the Merrys exceeded them all in butter. In an article in the Cultivator for March, 1845, headed 'products of the hairy" we find it stated that the committee on cheese fairies of the Newyork State Agricultural Society reports Abraham All, of Lloyd, Oneidacounty, as having made the past season, (1844) from 40 cows, 23,427pounds of cheese and 200 pounds of butter, an average of 585- pounds of cheese to a cow; and adding the butter, equal to 598 pounds to a cow. Mr. Wish, of Herkimer, made, previous to 17th September, an average of 592 pounds per cow; and he estimates the quantity for the season at 700 pounds. Mr. Porter, of One ida county, from 12 cows and 3 heifersone of them three, another two years old made 2,600 pounds of butter for market, besides supplying a family from 7 to 9 persons, during the year, probably not short of 200 pounds. Another from five cows expected to make 1,200;pounds. In the Cultivator for September, 1845, we also find an article, entitled" Connecticut Cheese Fairies" which contains some interesting statistics on this subject. The average quantity of cheese reported from the single town of Os hen is stated at 500,000 pounds; and of butter only about 40 000 pounds per annum. The average quantity per cow of cheese may 330 be estimated at 300 to 350 pounds. The first manufacture of the pineapple cheese in America was commenced there in 1808, by Mr. Lewis N. Norton. A description is given of the mode of manufacture. He has 68 presses, and makes 28 cheeses per day; weighing, when dried, five pounds each, and it usually nets about 10 cents per pound. W. Morris Toe, of Winchester, (where one firm usually purchase about 500,000 pounds of cheese annually) is also celebrated for making cheese, for which he usually obtains from 16 to 18 cents per pound, and which retails in New York and the southern cities at from 29 to 25 cents per pound. The two papers from which we have quoted above may be found in appendix No. 24. Besides the dairy and its products, the various methods of feeding cattle and stock of different kinds, and the use and value of their products, may properly claim more than merely a passing notice. These are subjects which are extensively discussed in the ablest treatises, prize essays, and communications to periodicals, which continually issue from the agricultural press. The main difficulty is in making a selection, where there is so much that is valuable and well adapted to aid the agriculturists in every portion of our extensive country. It is a practice in many of the agricultural associations in England to invite, to aid in the discussion of subjects, men of distinguished science and practical knowledge; and thus much admirable instruction may often be found embodied in the reports of their meetings. The same, to a more limited extent, prevails in our own country. In the account of the meeting of the Rough borough Agriculturalassociation, contained in the Dark Lane Express of October 6, 1845, we find some valuable suggestions on the principles to be adopted in feeding cattle. They are the same as are adopted by the ablest lecturers on animal physiology on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr. Dawson, surgeon, after describing the elements in animals, proceeded to inform the meeting of the various uses of each. " Nitrogen" he said, " was the principal ingredient in flesh and muscles. At is composed of carbon and hydrogen. If they wished to make an animal fat for sale or for show, they must feed it on carbonaceous food. Unripe saw is very carbonaceous. As the seed ri pens, it becomes less so, and not so suitable for fattening. Rows generally feed well on after path. Half a pound of Swede turn is contains 110 grains of nutriment, while the same weight of white turn is contains only 85 grains. The outer temperature is very important; it should be brought as nearly as possible to the temperature of the blood. The same regard to temperature is necessary with respect to a milking cow. At is a mere deposited secretion; it does not impart strength rather the contrary. Hence we do not make a horse fat for racing, but make him display muscular power. In fattening horses for sale, carbonaceous food, young grass, oil cake, Swedeturnips, &c, should be given: in feeding for use, should be mixed with an equal quantity of other kind of foodLiebig, it is well known, divides the elements into two distinct classes. Those which are formed by the combination of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, in different quantities, are what Lie big calls elements of respiration. Under this head are starch, fat, butter, sugar, and alcoholic fluids. By combining all the four elements, we obtain the elements of nutrition, or thenitrogenized constituents of food such as vegetable and animal fibrin e, ca seine, albumen, and glum ten. The constituents which are not nitrogen sized are for sustaining the animal heat of the body, and protecting its parts and thus provision is made to be used when the body is diseased. The. 331 oxygen of the air destroys these. It is often found that if a cow is driven home from a considerable distance, instead of being milked in the field, much of the butter disappears, which is owing to the action of the oxygen of the air on those substances with which it most readily combines. The same reason, owing to the increased action of the muscles, is also why the milk of the cow after calling contains so little butter. The less the food that is expended in maintaining the heat of the animal, the more matter she will yield. Tall feeding, it is thought, will effect this result; but then, as in the Dutch cheese, made where the cows are more confined, the product is not as well favored. Most writers object to stall feeding on account of the want of exercise; and when the weather is warm there is no call for exertion to keep themselves warm, and the gentle motion they take increases the healthy state of the body, and thus they not only eat more, but also assimilate better their food. But in winter, the temperature being so much lower than their own bodies, and the air more condensed, and so containing more oxygen, they need more nonnitrogenizedfood to combine with the excess of oxygen ; and hence it is that stall feeding, by preserving the warmth, produces a saving of food. The cooler the body is, the greater the expenditure of food, In this account Mr. Her nays, the chemist, in his address before the meeting above mentioned, whose remarks we have thus embodied, recommends that the animals be regularly fed, have plenty of litter, and be kept clean. He says that if warmth is equivalent to food, the form in which food is given cannot be in material, and the more digestion is facilitated the greater the saving. By cutting up the food, some expenditure of force in its preparation is saved by the feeding animal. If the food contains water of a lower temperature than that of the animal, it must be raised to that temperature at the expense of a part of the food. Steaming obviates, this difficulty. An ox, in a winter month, the air being 320, consumed 60 pounds of m angel wurzela day. To less than one twentieth of this food was needed in this case to raise the temperature of the water of the m angel wurzel to the temperature of the body of the ox. Figs, likewise, thrive better on dry that non wet fodder' If the object be to increase and sustain the animal, as in the case of the young growing one" Mr. Good also, a surgeon, says, " you choose those vegetables which contain a large proportion of muscular fibre or nitrogen and phosphates of lime for the bones; such as peas, beans, oats, barley, &c. I f, in a full grown animal, you aim to sustain it and increase its fat, you give those vegetables which contain fat ready formed; as lent is, I indian corn, oil cake, &c. But with a mixed object in view, mixed food must be given, such as will produce bone, muscle, and fat, also." His explanation was" There is no motion in an animal body, or emotion of mind, but what causes a corresponding absorption of the tissues of the body; and in order to keep up this daily waste, a certain amount of food is necessary. This is called sustaining the body. Thus, cattle working hard require a larger amount of food than when at rest. This necessity being attended to, constitutes health. But fattening is an unnatural condition, and requires an increase of substance. Hence the necessity of unnatural means, as the absence of exercise, light, and the influences of the atmosphere, a mixed diet, (to bring out all the materials of the animal body to the greatest perfection) in a dry warm state. Mr. Childerss beautiful experiment proved that warmth alone, with an animal, would produce one third more of flesh 332 and the expense of one quarter less food. Mr. Norton also proved that the absence of light, with warmth, produced still greater results. The reason of this is obvious. Very animal possesses both a nutrition and respiratory apparatus; the one to sustain the body, the other to support its vitality, by producing heat or warmth. The first object is effected by the glum ten in the food principally, the basis of which is nitrogen ; the second by the starch, sugar, and gum contained in the food, which form bile, the basis of which is carbon. The bile passes into the intestines, where it meets with oxygen, and thus becomes carbonic acid. In this state it enters the circulation, where it meets with peroxide of iron, (which the blood always contains) the carbon unites with the iron, and forms carbonate of iron. In this state it passes to the lungs, where it meets with fresh oxygen during inspiration which re converts the carbon in the carbonic acid, which passes off during the expiration, while the peroxide of iron is reformed and taken back by means of its carriers, to be again transformed into carbonate. The result of this combustion of carbon is heat. The heat of the animal body is nearly 1000. All food, therefore, before it can be assimilated, must be raised to its own temperature, which can only be done by the consumption of carbon or, in other words, food. <a name="potatoes248"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, linseed cake, and oleaginous <a name="seeds30"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, on account of the starch, sugar, oil, and gum they contain, are well adapted to accomplish this end." He then averts to the great inattention which farmers pay to these principles, and adds: 'a: At is a reservoir of carbon for the system to draw upon for the purposes of combustion, in the event of the food not containing a sufficient quantity of the proper elements to keep up the animal heat. As manure is the proper result attending the feeding of animals, it may be well to remark that its quantity depends upon the refuse of food and the amount of absorption going on in an animals body; or, in other words, upon its own destruction; thus returning to in organic nature, as food for vegetable life, the elements of its own nature. But the quality depends on the quantity of nutritions food given to the animal. The young growing animal, requiring increase as well as sustenance, consumes all the nitrogen and fatty matter in its food. The milking cow the same. But in the full grown feeding animal a large quantity of these ingredients is not consumed ; a rich and valuable manure is the result or. Her nays also said that we must not judge of the value of the food by its bulk. Green top turn is, m angel wurzel, and red be et contain 89 percent. of water, Swedes 85 per cent, <a name="potatoes249"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 72 per cent, oats and wheat straw 18 per cent, hay, peas, and lent is 16 per cent, and beans only 14 per cent, He likewise stated that we should distinguish between f lessening, or the formation of muscle, and fattening, or the formation of fat. " According to the supposed fattening properties of food, it ranks thus: 1st, oats, barley meal, and hay; 2d, beans and peas; 3d, lent is, <a name="potatoes250"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; 4th, turn is and red be et. According to their f lessening properties, they stand thus: 1st, lent is; 2d, beans; 3d, peas; 4th, flesh; 5th, barley meal 6th, oats; 7th, hay; 8th, carrots and <a name="potatoes251"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> ; oh, red be et; 10th, turnips100 pounds of lent is are supposed to be capable of yielding 33 times as much muscle as 100 pounds of turn is." In this account there is great advantage in mixing food. " An animal fed chiefly on oil cake would, on being turned out, increase in size much more slowly than the animal which has been fed on hay, or on turn is and hay. The oil cake produces chiefly fat and little flesh; hence the movement of the animal will consume much of the ready formed fat or tallow. It is only where the oil cake is given with flesh. 333 ening food, such as beans, oats, and hay, that lean is proportion ably formed. Warmth, confinement, and fattening food, are most favorable for the formation of butter, fat, and tallow. Erb age, which is generally den ordinated poor, but which, in reality, is rich in nitrogen sized constituents, and which cows have to crop themselves, is favorable to the formation of cheese, but not of butter." He recommended food also to be given to animals in a warm state, "a little lower than the temperature of their own bodies he have given somewhat at length the above account, as the science of nutrition seems to be presented in a very clear light, and the results of practice, in a great degree, will be found to correspond with the theory. Some very interesting facts are stated on these subjects in a prize essay on fat and muscle, by W. F. Karkeek, veterinary surgeon, Neuro, and which is published in the Quarter ly Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, vol. 5. After stating the theory of nutrition, he says : " From what has been stated, then, we may very safely conclude that fat is chiefly produced from the starch y matters contained in the food of animals, all the excess of which that is not consumed in producing animal heat is taken back into circulation, and deposited in the form of fat, in cells appropriated for that purpose. It would appear, also, that the blood vessels have the power of taking back the fatty matter again into the circulation when it is required, so that one of the objects which this disposition fulfils is to store up, when nourishment is abundant, a supply which may be taken back into the system and made use of in time of need." He then averts to Professor Playfairs discovery, that "1 animals possessing small lungs, small lives, and small spleens, indeed small off al of every description, have a greater disposition to fatten, and to lay that fat on the proper places~ or a fair proportion of fat and lean, "than coarse bred, ill proportioned animals, which will be found to possess larger off al than well bred animals, in proportion to their size and growth" and also mentions another fact, which has likewise been ascertained in consequence of inquiries respecting the former statement, " that in proportion as an animal fattened, so in proportion did the organs which are chiefly connected with nutrition become diminished in size a fact which he says is intimately connected with the breeding, rearing, and feeding of animals He illustrates the above position by reference to facts, and then draws the conclusion " that by pursuing the system of breeding from fatted animals, or from those having a great tendency to fatten, function must react on organization, and at last those qualities become not only increased, but fixed in the race. He refers to different breeds to prove this. He next averts to certain external signs or tokens which indicate early maturity, or a determination of the animal frame to produce fat or muscle in an eminent degree as, first, touch: as a thick, hard, unyielding hide indicates a bad fee der, while a thin, paper feeling hide, covered with thin hair, indicates the reverse, as such an animal will speedily fatten, but not carry much muscle; and this, too, indicates a delicate constitution. ' The perfect touch" he says, "in a feeding animal, will be found with a thick loose skin, floating, as it were, on a layer of soft fat, yielding to the least pressure, and springing back to the touch of the finger like a piece of chamois leather. This indicates hardness of constitution, and capability of carrying plenty of muscle, as well as sufficiency of fatSmallness of bone is also another indication. ' The size of the head when the head of the bull approaches to the narrow elongated form of the 334 female, his stock will be certain to fatten readily, but will not carry much muscle ;" thin ears, fine horns, proportionate union of length, depth, thickness, C. Another fact to which he alludes as important is, that L nearly the whole of the fleshy part of an animal which will afford any profit" to the farmer: is assimilated chiefly during the period of its growth." " Thus the object of the farmer, whose purpose is profit, will be to force his stock on during the period of their growth, by such kind of food as will produce the largest quantity of muscle at the least expense He recommends that growing stock, therefore, be fed with peas, beaus, and barley meal, in conjunction with good hay, grass, and turn is, varied according to seasons and circumstances; also a change of diet, which he asserts is proved to promote health and appetite more than by limiting the quantity and quality. He gives, to aid in this, the following table, constructed by him from Johnston and Boussingault, in which the glum ten, &c indicate the fieshening properties, and the starch, gum, and sugar, the fattening.

He points, also, toi" the peculiar adaptation of the carrot crop to the rearing and fattening of stock" and also to the quantity of water contained in these roots, as rendering it desirable that dry provender, such as o at or barley meal, o at straw, hay, or pea ha ulm, be given to sheep to prevent the frequent scouring of these animals, and which, by making the food remain longer in their stomach, will impart a greater quantity of nourishment. " The best kind of food for pigs" he says, "' is a mixture of barley meal, peas, and <a name="potatoes253"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> potatoes are frequently used by themselves for this purpose; but neither the fat nor muscle of pigs fed in this manner can be compared with cor rag rain and peas fed pork, the fat having a tallow y appearance, and both fate at saw 1 Y V

The editor of the Cultivator is disposed to doubt some of Mr. Karkeeksconclusions, especially that animals having naturally small lungs are most disposed to fatten is sustained by practical observation; and if it were demonstrated, he thinks it would by no means follow that farmers should breed cattle with this organization. He refers also to the West Highlandcattle of Scotland to show that a tendency to fatten is not inconsistent with strength of constitution and muscular vigor. He, however, admits the great excellence and utility of Mr. Karkeeks essay. In one of the numbers of the Cultivator, we find the following rules which we sub join, as furnishing the editors ideas on the subject of fattening animals: "there are some rules which may be advantageously adopted in feeding animals, which, however obvious they may be, are too often passed over or Neglected. Some of these will be specified; and" 1st. The preparation of food his should be so prepared that itsnutritive properties may all be made available to the use of the animal and not only so, but appropriated with the least possible expenditure of muscular exertion and energy. The ox that is obliged to wander over an acre to get the feed he should find on 2 or 3 square rods; the horse that is 2 or 3 hours eating the coarse food he would swallow in 15 minutes if the grain was ground or the hay cut, as it should be; the sheep that spends hours making its way into a turn in, when, if it were sliced, it could be eaten in as many minutes; the pig that eats raw <a name="potatoes254"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> or whole corn, when either cooked could be eaten in one-fourth the time may indeed fatten, but much less rapidly than if their food were given them in a proper manner. All food should be given to a fattening animal in such a state, that as little time and labor as possible on the part of the animal shall be required in eating 2d. The food should be in abundance From the time the fattening process commences until the animal is slaughtered, he should never be without food. Health and appetite are best promoted by change of food rather than by limiting the quantity. The animal that is stuffed and starved alternately may have streaked meat, but it will be made a too slowly for the profit of the owner." 3d. The food should be given regularly. This is one of the most essential points in feeding animals. If given irregularly, the animal indeed consumed his food, but he soon acquires a restless disposition, is disturbed at every appearance of his fee der, and is never in that quiet state so necessary to the taking on of fat. It is surprising how readily any animal acquires habits of regularity in feeding, and how soon the influence of this is felt in the improvement of his constitution. When at the regular hour the pig has had his pudding, or the sheep its turn is, they compose themselves to rest with the consciousness that their digestion is not to be unreasonably disturbed, or their quiet broken by unwonted invitation to eat. All creatures fatten much faster in the dark than in the light, a fact only to be accounted for by their greater quiet: Some of those creatures that are the most irritable and impatient of restraint while feeding, such as turkeys and geese, are found: to take on fat rapidly when confined in dark rooms, arid fed at stated hours by hand. There is no sure r proof that a pig is doing well than to see him eat his meal quickly, and then retire to his bed to sleep, or cog it ate until the hour of feeding returns Albany Cultivateor336 a. The fact that sugar is contained in food has suggested the idea of using it as a means of feeding cattle. Molasses has accordingly been tried, and it is said with good results. Another case of the application of saccharinefood is thus given : " Saccharine food The Manchester Guardian, after quoting a paragraph from our last weeks paper on the use of molasses for feeding cattle, says: 'some 30 or 40 years ago, Dr. Cartwright, the inventor of the power loom, communicated to the board of agriculture an interesting account of some experiments he had made on the effects of sugar in fattening sheep. He states that he gave to fifteen sheep 4 ounces of sugar per day each, mixed with other food, and in the short space of 28 days found that, on the average, they had increased one fifth in weight, and that two of them had increased upwards of one-fourth. As to the cost of the sugar, he was, of opinion that sugar, supposing it to be purchased at 4d. per pound, would, at the rate of 4 ounces per day, be paid for in a return of flesh, exclusive of the advantage of expeditions feeding and the benefit to be derived from the manure' "london Times. The loss sustained by driving cattle, instead of transporting them on steamboats and railways, has been tested in Great Britain by experiment and we find it stated in the Dark Lane Express, that " Mr. D. Martin, ofWainfleet, sent five sheep to London, to walk the whole distance on the road, and killed five others at home. The two lots were of exactly equal weight 858 lbs) when alive. The car cases were weighed when dead, when it was found that the sheep which had walked to London weighed 435 lb sand their loose fat 60 lbs; while the five killed at home reached 489 lb s their loose fat weighing 74 1 lbs. The total difference amounted to 681 les. or 14 per cent. of the original weight of mutton; and this was evidently the loss of meat occasioned by compelling the five sheep to walk from Lincolnshire to Londonwe take the following from an agricultural journal, the Paine Cultivator. It may, perhaps, admit of some doubt how far the quality of the milk might be affected by such a process of ferment at ion as is described. It would seem to resemble too much that obtained by feeding on distillers shops, which have been the subject of so great complaint in New York city and elsewhere. ' M. Chabert, the director of the veterinary school at Ll ford, England, had a number of cows which yielded 12 gallons of milk each per day. In his publication on the subject, he observes that cows fed in the winter on dry substances give less milk than those which are kept on a green diet, and also that their milk loses much of its quality. He published the following recipe, by the use of which his cows afforded him an equal quantity and quality of milk during the winter as during the summer Take a bushel of <a name="potatoes255"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, break them whilst raw, place them in a barrel standing up, putting in successively a layer of br an and a small quantity of least in the middle of the mass, which is to be left thus to ferment during a whole week; and when the venous taste has pervaded the whole mixture, it is then given to the cows, who eat it greedily paine Cultivator. In connection with the true principles of feeding cattle, is that of soiling, of which the editor of the American Agriculturists remarks: "the true principle of soiling consists in the combination of both pasture and stall or rack feeding; and where circumstances will justify it, both should be united at the same time. An abundance of succulent grasses, c lover, pea vines, corns talks, or vegetables in the yard, with a supply of salt, lime, a. 337 ashes, and sulphur, with a daily r amble in the pasture for a few hours, where easily accessible, or, if not, then as often as practicable, would undoubtedly most effectually secure the greatest quantity of milk his subject has also been discussed in the New York Farmers' Club, and we may refer to the report of that meeting in the number of the Newyork Farmer and Mechanics for May, 1845, to present here some of the views there expressed. The advantages of soiling are thus stated by Johnson, in his Cyclopcedia: 1. Having of land ; 2. Of fencing; 3. Economy of food; 4. Letter condition and greater comfort of cattle; 5. The greater product of milk; 6. The manure obtained. Mr. Well, of El ham, New Work, says that eight acres will afford more and better food than fo ty would, pastured; and the manure saved is sufficient to pay the interest of a large farm. " The On. Josiah Quincy, of Massachusetts, says, 'at the end of the soiling season I had                                $200 worth of manure ; had kept 20 head of cattle on 17 acres; by past during, I had to allow 50 acres for 15 head; had my stock in prime condition ; a full supply of milk all the season; saved all expense in cross fences, (not requiring one rod of interior fence on by whole farm) while previously I had 1,600rods of fencing, and paid     $60 yearly for repairs. The additional expense     had gone to in curing the food, and giving it to the animals, amounted to                                                           $163. My manure alone paid for this, and no consideration would induce me to abandon it" Others also gave their opinion in its favor. Dr. Under hill said, that where land was worth               $50 to                                                                    $150 per acre, he had no doubt of the value of soiling cattle. The manure pays for the expense of thus feeding, and less land is needed. He recommends combining with it the root crops. He mentions, also, in its favor, that in summer cattle suffer far less from flies and heat, cows give more milk, fatten more easily, and require less food; more manure also can be made in this way; and by adding leaves, &c, these resources are greatly increased; while he thinks the stock fattens with one-fourth less food. Mr. Down send also gave his opinion in favor of it. He soiled seven cows and a pair of horses on the produce of five acres. If they had been fed out, the feed would have been small for them. A number of papers on feeding and fattening cattle, &c, will be found in appendix No. 25. The number of cattle in our country is great, and it is in many parts increasing rapidly. In the single county of Chester, Pennsylvania, a writer in an agricultural journal says that there are annually fattened 50,000head. He states that in Lancaster and other adjoining counties there is also a growing enterprise in raising cattle and preparing them for market, owing to the fact that by the cessation of many distilleries, the grain which was so consumed is now converted into food for stock. The Chicago Democrat, speaking of that place, says: 'a" We are inclined to the belief that Chicago is destined to be the greatest beef market in the United States, if not in the world. Beef fed on the prairies is always the tender est and sweetest, which gives us the preference in the outset. Beef is now being packed here not only for the New York and Boston markets, but also for the Montreal and London markets. Messrs. Lads worth, Yer, & Chapinhave been, and still are, slaughtering one hundred head of cattle daily, and they have now already engaged five thousand head to be slaughtered immediately. They are now packing both for the United States navy and the British government. Other firms are packing, but not so extensively as Messrs. Lads worth, Yer, & Chap in. We think something like two 2 338 hundred to two hundred and fifty are slaughtered in our city daily, and this number will soon be increased. The average price now paid by our packer is                          $2.50."The subject of sheep has occupied much attention from various writers in the agricultural papers during the past year, and it is evident that there is an increasing spirit of enterprise, with regard to this species of stock, indifferent parts of our country. Considerable discussion has taken place as to the different 1 reeds and the purity of the stock of Merinoes, as large f locks are mentioned as purchased in Ohio for States further west. Sheep are raised for a double object: for their wool, and for their flesh as food, and also for the sake of their tallow. In an article in one of the agricultural journals, referring to an account of the trying up of sheep in one of the British colonies, the writer makes the following observations: "9 Whenever wool reaches a certain minimum price, the pelt, car cases, and tallow are worth more for the sham b les than the animal is for his flee ce; and it may be worth the inquiry, whether, on sufficiently cheap and well adapted pastures, sheep may not be a very profitable production for this object alone. It is certain that our western farmers have, for some years, found their advantage in slaughtering many thousands annually for this purpose. It would, perhaps, not be an. extravagant estimate to put the number thus slaughtered in New York and Ohio alone at over 100,000 during the past season ; and that, too, while wool is comparatively high, and with every prospect of continuing so. 30,000 have been thus disposed of in Buffalo and Cleveland a single point in each of the above States. The business has been reduced to a perfect system in the colonies above named. Mr. Lloyd, of a steam melting establishment at Sort Philip, says: ' We have given the result of tallow, that may be depended on, (our most anxious study) and have arrived at the following conclusions, which we are certain will be found correct: 1st. That a sheep of the ordinary Peri no breed, weighing 55 pounds, is just in nice condition for the sham b les, and will produce, at the melting establishment, 20 pounds tallow; and for every pound over 55, four fifths will be tallow. 2d. Young sheep, say two toothed, will not produce as much as four toothed and upwards, of same weight. The following results were obtained from six f locks of different average weightSThose averaging 44 pounds produced 151 pounds tallow each 47 1634 8 1752 195 4 1916 5 274 The above tallow was worth 28 shillings per cut, which brought the average value of the lowest flock to is. 2d, or 75 cents each; while the best reached the very handsome price of is. 10d, or about                                                         $1.60 each, besides the pelt, which is usually worth 35 to 60 cents in addition. In this country the hams are extracted and cured like dried beef, or veins on, and find a ready sale." We find various estimates of the quantity of wool cropped in different sections of the country. Thus, the Cincinnati Chronicle thinks the wool produced in Ohio amounts to about 2,000,000 pounds per annum. In Jackson county, Michigan, the yield is estimated at 50,00t-pounds-worth                                                                $12,000,I or Ohio: L' In the county of Rich land, 200,000 pounds of wool have been rec. No. 140. 389 sold during the past season, at an average price of 30 cents per pounds Wisconsin wool There will be shipped from Wisconsin this season 50 000 pounds of wool, the clipping from 25,000 or 30,0(00 sheep in the Territory. A great portion of this large quantity will be sent to market from Machine, a flourishing village on Take Michiganthe Chicago account of the market, under date of June 23, says the whole receipts of wool there for the season would amount to 50,000 pounds. In the early part of the season, quoted by another public journal, we have the following statistics, which it may be useful to transcribe : The basis of the calculation is the year 1836, at which time there were in the country12897658 sheep, each flee ce averaging 34 pounds making 41,917,324pounds; excess of imports over exports for same year, 12,286,249: making total amount of wool in the country 54,214,573 lbs. Consumption estimated same year, 51,000,000 pounds. Excess of foreign and domestic wool over probable consumption, 3,213,573 pounds. In consequence of the in accuracy of all such calculations, a reasonable allowance should be made but, taking the above as the correct data; it is found that about one-fourth of the whole amount of wo in the country at that time was foreign, the estimated value of which was                                                         $1,270,000. Since then importations have fallen off gradually, with the exception of one or two years, while in domestic a great increase has taken place. The opinion of the increase of sheep varies from 15 to 33 per cent. per annum; but taking the minimum say 15 per cent) on 12,897,658, in 1836, up to the lass year would give33000000 sheep, which would yield at the rate as above 107,250,000 les of wool. This year we have at the same rate over 38,000,000 sheep, and123500000 lbs. wool; being an increase of 16,000,000 lbs. over last year, which, even at the low price of 25 its. per lb, would on the whole clip amount to                  $30,875,000. When this statement was made, there were not taken into account I illinois, In diana, Michigan, and I own, which at present have a great number of sheep. They increased rapidly last year, as the high price of wool induced a speculation in sheep; and the spring being favorable for lambs, the increase was unusually large in the old wool growing States, part of which was driven into the new States, instead of coming east to be slaughtered as usual. The cheap and fertile lands and climate of these States make them well adapted for raising the lower grades of wool, and 18 to 25 cents in the eastern cities would regenerate them well, as the cost of transportation is very trifling upon their value, in comparison with other articles raised in the west. At these prices the foreign wool, which is now used for blankets, jeans, &c, would be driven entirely from the market. This would not be all; but we would have England and France as constant purchasers, as they would prefer our wool at these prices over the Mediterranean and Due nos Tyres wool, of which at present they are large consumers. The subject is well worthy of the western wool growers attention. The time is near at hand when they will have to grow wool cheap enough for export, as we will have more than we can consume.

The English papers state that in the months of August and September about 500 bales of wool were received from the United States; and during a subsequent month it is stated that 1,500 bales had been shipped to England from New York and some other ports. The importation of wool into Great Britain and I re land, for 1844, was as follows: "I importation of wool into Great Britain and I re land in 1844.-By an official report of the House of Commons, we find that the total quantities of sheep and lambs wool, foreign and colonial, imported into the United Kingdom during the year 1844,amounted to 65,079,524 lbs, of which 5,402,098 came from Russia; 1,609,-.099. from Denmark ; 21,847,684 from Germany; 1,346,613 from Portugal2818353 from I talk; 1,286,963 from Turkey, Syria, and Egypt; 1,101,-284 from Morocco; 2,197,031 from.

Warns of woolen and worsted, including yarn of wool or worsted mixed with other materials, 1,271,-906 lbs n connection with the subject of raising sheep, &c, we would refer to the appendix No. 26, where will be found some interesting papers. Among these is one on sheep husbandry of Kentucky, by Judge Seat ty. That the south affords great facilities for raising sheep has been repeatedly stated. In proof of the productive ness of this kind of stock in Southcarolina, we find it mentioned that " Leicester lambs, 14 months old, from the flock of Colonel Made Hampton, shared from 11 to 13! pounds of wool; and that 60 head of lambs dropped the present year, and shorn when hot weather came on, to relieve them from the oppressive heat of summer, averaged four pounds each." In the appendix No. 26, above mentioned, will also be found a very interesting letter from Germany, written to this office by Charles L. Fleischmann, esq, (formerly draughts man in the Patent Office) respecting the fine wooled flee ces of Russia. Mr. Fleischmann having been thoroughly educated both as a scientific and practical agriculturists, in the celebrated Agricultural I institution of Schliessheim, in Bavaria, is well qualified to furnish valuable information on all the topics connected with agriculture; and the large collection of samples of wool which he expects to bring over to this country, will no doubt be of great value to those who are desirous of having the opportunity to select fine animals. He purposes also, it is believed, to lecture on this and kindred subjects connected with agricultural improvements on his return to this city. It would seem, from his letter, that the far famed and long celebrated Merinoes and Saxony S have lost their repute, and that the Russian. 34 sheep now hold the first rank; or, as he expresses it, have the " constant character." Mr. Fleischmann will be able also to give much information a to the mode of keeping sheep, &c. Mr. King ham, of Cornwall, It, gives, in one of the agricultural papers, the following account of his management of sheep: " My mode of management is this: I as sort according to age and condition the oldest by themselves; middle aged, young ones, &c, into about nine different flocks, summer and winter. My hay is a mixture of timothy and white and red c lover. I feed from 12 to 14 tons to 10 sheep, which is the principal feed, except for my stock bucks, oldest eyes, and weak est lambs, to which I feed a small quantity of roots, with mixture of corn cob meal. I feed my sheep in the pure air, in racks, and have sheds to shelter them in case of storms. Myewes and rams commence breeding at two and three years of age. The general average of lambs I raise is 97 to 100 eyes. Last year I raised fr on 132 eyes the same number of lambs. There were no twin lambs. I put my buck with the eyes about the first of December. 1 put the back with the eyes about two hours each day, marking -him on the brisk et with red chalk; and then what e was I find marked red I remove before putting in the buck again. At the time of lambing they run in, the pasture, taking care to have them sheltered in case of storm. The live weight of my bucks over one year old is from 115 to 145 pounds; the live weight of eyes from 85 to 130 pounds. Luck lambs, four and four and a half months old, weigh from 50 to 70 pounds. I shared last year 530 flee ces; the average weight per flee ce was 4 pounds 14 ounces. The sheep were washed in a stream of clear running water. I recommend s hearing four days after washing. There were 51 yearning bucks, and 37 over one year old. The remainder of the flock consisted of stock eyes, one and two years old, and a few wet hers. The average price of my wool last year was 46 cents per pound, with the exception of 334 pounds of grade wool. There has been no disease among my sheep excepting the g rub in the head, which occasions more deaths, in my opinion, among sheep, than any other disease. The following I consider a sure remedy : To 100 sheep one and a quarter pounds of Scotch snuff, mixed with four quarts of water. Throw it up each nostrils by means of a syringe. This operation is performed by cutting a hole through a board large enough to admit the nose of the sheep two thirds of its length from the eyes. It keeps the head perfectly steady, so that there is no difficulty in performing the operation. The average weight of my wool per flee ce, this year, is five pounds three ounces. It is still un sold. I shared this year 5 87 flee ces." Merri Of Of Ngham. Scornwall, Of, September 8, 1845."The following relates to wool growing on the prairies of I illinois; it is communicated to the Albany Cultivator, by Messrs. T. & I. Harvey, of Lasalle, I illinois: (a( But a few years since we emigrated from Vermont to this State. We soon became satisfied that wool could be grown much cheaper here than in our own native State. In 1843 we purchased in Clumbiana county, Ohio, 2,300, and drove them through by land into this region. In crossing streams, without bridges, we managed to take about 50 to the waters edge at a time ; and, by the aid of two shepherds dogs, would crowd them into the river. When these two dogs would go and aid the one that was left to guard the main flock, and urge them all up and 342 a. Intothe stream together. They would all swim over without much difficulty. They travelled generally about 12 miles a day. O n our arrival home we let and sold all but 1,200. Our rule for letting was for- one half the wool, and one half the lambs, and as many sheep returned as let, at the end of the year. We wintered them on prairie hay, and a very little grain fed after the month of February, not to exceed 160 bushels of corn. The first winter we lost about 60, and raised over 400 lambs. The second winter we fed part of the flock on timothy and clever the balance on wild prairie hay. Those fed on the prairie hay did equally well as those fed on the English grasses. We met with considerable losses by dogs the second winter; otherwise the sheep came through finely without grain, except to about 30 stock bucks wintered by themselves : these we fed with a little grain daily through the winter. Our flock, at this time, amounted to about 10 50. We also raised this season over 400 lambs. The first year our flock yielded a little short of three pounds of wool to each sheep, and sold for 33 its. This season we sold for 271 its. per lb, and the yield increased a little over one quarter of a pound to the flee ce. We procured good rams, in Ohio, at                                                                     $10 each said to be full blood Merinoes. I tis no more than justice to acknowledge the increase of our second clip from a lot of 64 lambs got by a yearning buck which we ordered from Vermont, from the flock of S. W. Fewest, said to be a son of his stock buck Fortune. Very flee ce from this flock of 64 was weighed as soon as shorn, and we did not find one that shared less than 4 lbs. The lot averaged over 5. lbs. One lamb, got by this young buck, and out of a e we we purchased of Mr. Fewest, which dropped in the month of April, the a red this season a flee ce of 8 lbs. 15 oz of beautiful wool. We therefore have become satisfied of the difference in the breeds of sheep. We might have added that these two Vermont sheep bore the first prize at our State and county shows in 1843 and 1844. Bethink our sheep are better washed than we used to clean them in Vermont. Our mode of washing is cheap and expeditions. We run two fences angling from the stream where we wash, to guide the sheep at the terminus he build a platform over the river ; then, by the aid of our dogs, run them over this platform as fast as possible to give motion to the water. They are obliged to swim about four rods to strike the opposite bank. When return them across a shallow place below, where they can wade the stream. He jump them off this plank work into the river three or four times, till we are satisfied that they are thoroughly cleansed. In this manner we might with two men and two dogs wash 10,000, if at hand, in one day. We cut wild prairie hay from land owned by government and speculators who do not occupy. In contract, it is delivered in our yards at                                                         $1 each ton. The yearly cost of keeping our sheep cannot be over 30 its. per head. One boy we employ the year at        $8 per month. He has the sole charge of the flock, with the aid of two shepherds dogs, which we could not do without. They aid in yarding them nights, and keep off the small prairie wolf. Ascotchman by the name of Kitchen raises and train r these shepherd dogs, from a pair of Both col lies, imported by Murray & To. He sells his p up pies at about            $4 each. Hours, &cTRUMAN & I Saac Harvey.

Connected with the subject of sheep may be noticed also the efforts that are making to introduce the al papa into this country. Governor Paine, of Vermont, it is stated, has sent for a pair of these animals, to make trial of them ; and we see it mentioned, likewise, that an association is formed iniNew York city which intends to appropriate some            $4,000 or          $5,000 to the same object. The Nashville Agriculturists, too, has the following notice : "(A company Was been formed among the most wealthy and influential farmers of Bourbon county to import several al paces immediately into this rotate. The shares are all taken, and the money paid in. A man has been chosen, and an agreement made with him to start before Christmas to Southamerica for them; so that, within the next year, you may count with certainty upon seeing this most interesting and important experiment tested in Kentucky, by Kentucky farmers, to an extent and in a manner that must insure success, if our climate is at all suited to the constitution of this most valuable animal. Before I write to you again, I hope to see some of -the company, and to be able, in my next, to give you a more detailed and particular account of this important movement Nashville Agricullurist. The following fact shows the .importance of this movement to introduce the al papa into our country, both at the north and south; and we cannot doubt that our climate will be well adapted to them, and that they may also prove to us a source of national wealth. The cloth manufactured from their wool is now well known in the list of our cloths. At a late meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Mr. W. Dawson stated that six years before, he brought before that society a subject that received its countenance in an especial manner; which was, to induce manufacturers to exercise their ingenuity to discover means for consuming a wool of a silken texture in a manufactured state, and also to prepare the landed gentry and farmers to naturalized the animal called the al papa, a species of sheep that eat that which the cow, the horse, the common sheep c, reject. He added: " The manufacturers have succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectation, and the naturalization also. The former has, created a national wealth of 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 per annum; the latter is progressing rapidly. I have proved that these mountain rangers can be domiciled in our own country, though brought from beyond i the 344 a. Andes mountains in Peru. I have tried the experiment in my own lands on the west coast of I re land, in the wildest districts of the county of Merry, and already a company is on the tap is to bring over 10.000 of those animals for the national good." He said that the race was nearly extinct in Peru, and therefore it was desirable to bring it over to the British isles their wool approaching silk, and their flesh being improved by English air and pasture. ~the Queen and Prince Albert were wearing royal robes from the wool of some bred in Windsor Dark. And he gave it as his opinion that" in ten years these animals will add S20000000 per annum to the national wealth The I ark Lane Express has the following notice of the attempts to domestic ate the al papa in Great Britain; which seems to afford strong hope that the animal, when introduced here, will succeed :11 The alpacaI t may be satisfactory to persons interested in the naturalization of this useful animal in the British isles to learn, that some of the latest experiments have been singularly successful, fully establishing the fact that upon our soil the flee ce improves in quality and in weight. G. A. Stirling, esq, of Craigbarnet Place, (Lennoxtown) near Glasgow, lately sent 15 lbs. to Yorkshire, the residue of two flee ces clipped last year, the quality of which, although not finer than the best sorts imported, was nevertheless more glossy, and of one uniform jet color. This small parcel was since spun by Mr. James Whitney, of Norton mills, and manufactured by Gregory Brothers, of Shelf, into a web of thirty yards, mixed with ruby silk, the figure rose, sham rock, and whistle, (queens pattern) on alternate stripes of black and ruby. This is the second instance of homegrownalpaca being manufactured in this country, the first having been the Queens in last December. About two months ago, Air Robert Her on, M. P., ofStubton, near Grant ham, Lincolnshire, sent down a black flee ce, just shorn on his own estate, with the view of ascertaining its mercantile value, which, by professional men, was pronounced the most splendid. they had ever seen. It weighed 17 I is, a most extraordinary weight; the flee ce in Peru seldom, or ever, exceeding 10 lbs. This remarkable specimen of home grown was sold to Messrs. Gregory Brothers at 2s. per lb. At the same time Air Robert forwarded to the manufacturers a mac hur ga flee ce, white, and weighing lbs, clipped from the horrid, obtained by crossing the la ma with the al papa. This animal was imported from Peru, and purchased he Liverpool in the winter of 1842, and may justly be considered a curiosity, as being a rare specimen among us. In Peru this mixture is frequent; but, like the mule, the offspring is barren, and never used unless as a beast of burden. Thefleece in question possesses some of the properties of the al papa, such as its length, and a partial gloss i ness, mixed with the harsh hair and keep of the la ma, which, of course, is not a wool bearing animal. The difference between this and the al papa flee ce is so great, that it is difficult to say what mercantile value can be set upon it. Samples of the three flee ces, above mentioned, together with patterns of the Queens textures, including her favorite plaid, have been deposited at the Polytechnichogs, also, form an important item in the agricultural productions of our country ; as the raising of swine is closely connected, in many parts of the land, with farming operations. A variety of articles relating to this subject may be found in appendix No. 27. A writer in the Cincinnati Chronicle says, that, taking the census of 1839 as the basis of calculation, there were26301293 hogs in the United States, which, at 180 lbs. average for each. a. 345 and allowing them to be worth                $3.50 per cut, their value would be not less than                                                              $160,000,000, or three times the entire cotton crop for the year 1845. He supposes that, in the western States, commerce consumes about one-sixth of the whole number, though a less proportion probably would apply to the whole United States. He then enters into several comparisons, and, taking Mcgregors statistics as his authority, says that the number of swine in all Europe, calculating on an increase of 10 per cent. on the table he gives for 1828, were as follows Russia -16380000Austria -6050000Great Britain -5775000France -495 000 italian States -2750000Bavaria -1650000Netherlands -1540000Prussia -1645000Sweden -1320000Spain -1100000Portugal -770000All other States -2348000Total -46278000Thus it seems that Russia, Austria, and Great Britain, with a population of 120,000,000 of people, have only as many swine as the United States with only 20,000,000. Right western States, with a population of only 6,000,000,have as many as Great Britain, France, and Russia, with 75,000,000. The proportion of swine in the United States is to Russia as .6 to 1; Austria, 9 to 1; Great Britain, 7 to 1; France, 10 to 1; Pain, 16 to 1. It is said in one of the public journals, that "A gentleman in the trade, just from Cincinnati, says the number of hogs slaughtered there in November will be at least 70,000. There is a strong body of eastern men on the ground buying. It was estimated that Kentucky would turn out 90,000,against 45,000 last year. Any hogs were being driven from the south in i consequence of the scarcity of corn." An article in the American Agriculturists, quoted in the Ohio Cultivator, earnestly advocates the advantages of feeding and fattening hogs of a younger age than is commonly practised. He makes his calculations as follows: " The pigs used for experiment were of three litters, from my own pig very, viz: "A, three pigs, half Chinese and half Berkshire, three pigs, half grass and half Berkshire. Of, three pigs, of same family as B, but a subsequent litter. 46 Ice. No. 140. Absfarrowed. Act. 10,'42Oct. 22, '43SApril 10, '44 The pigs of class A had not the advantage of sucklings, the sow having died in the act of parturition. They are an encouraging example of what may be done by care and attention for a few days after birth. Each class Was fed on the same kind of food, treated in the same manner, and attended by the same swine herd. B and C were weaned at six weeks old, and, till then, at no expense for food. As a further illustration of the truth of my i hypothesis, let us, from the whole age of B, 421 days, and the whole age of, 241 days, de duct the age when weaned, (42 days) and we shall have the time fed of B, 379 days, and of C, 199 days. Again, let us, from the average weight of B, 313 pounds, and the average weight of C, 249 pounds de duct the presumed weight if slaughtered when weaned, (20 pounds which gives the weight gained by B during the feeding, 293 pounds, and of C, 223 pounds. C, 199 days, 229 lbs. 1 day 18- ounces. B, 379 days, 293 lbs. I day 123 do. Extra gain of C per day, 6,- ounces." But another and more common sense view of the subject is, that B was fed a little over 6 months, and gained 229 pounds. Difference for 6 months feed only 64 pounds. Superadded to these facts, it must be admitted that, from 6 months to 12 months' feeding age, consumed much more food than C consumed from 0 to 6 months; consequently, that B, during his whole feeding time, consumed more than double the quantity that C consumed during his whole feeding time. Or go, that C was about 100 percent. more profitable than Of n the Mobile Daily Advertise r a statement, by way of calculation of the comparative advantage of raising stock in Kentucky and Alabama, is made respecting the profits of raising hogs in Alabama, which would seem to recommend this object of enterprise to the planters of that State. The writer bases his views on a farm employing 10 hands, and already stocked for operation. He says: "' In Kentucky it would require a landed property of 325 acres; which would cost, at                                                                $15 per acre,            $4,875.

The 300 acres of improved land would be cultivated in the following proportionsicid12750 acres in corn; 125 in oats and rye; 125 in c lover and blue grass: and 20 in artichokes. This would be the labor of 10 hands, which would only provide food sufficient to raise 300 hogs of one year old. The 300 acres of blue grass, c lover, oats, and rye, would receive 300 pigs, and pasture them from the 1st of May until the 1st October. It would then take all the artichokes and corn that would be made to feed the 300 hogs from the 1st of October to the 1st of May-seven months, (part of the corn having to be fed to the pigs while on pasture) The hogs now one year old would weigh 150 lbs. each, and would make 4,500 lbs. of pork, which, at                          $2.50 per 100 pounds, would bring to the owner                                                         $1,122, sold in Kentucky. In Alabama it would require a landed property of the same number of acres as that of Kentucky. Met us now see if there is any difference in the profits of the capital invested. The 325 acres of land calculated for a farm of this description can be purchased in Alabama at        $8 per acre, which would make a cost of                          $2,600. The ten negroes cost the same as in Kentucky,          $5,000. The cost of the land and negroes in Alabama would be     $7,600-                         $2,750less than the outfit in Kentucky. Of the 325 acres there would be 300 acres in culture; 40 acres in corn and cow peas; 125 acres in sweet potatoes; 25 acres in ground peas; and 100 in rye and oats. This would furnish food sufficient for 700 hogs. The 25 acres in ground peas would receive 700 pigs the 1st of September, and furnish them with food for two months, ending 1st November.  The 125 acres in sweet potatoes would yield, at 250 bushels per acre, 31,250 bushels, which would alone feed the 700 hogs one year, allowing 4 quarts per day for each how, which would be more than sufficient food for them one year. The corn, rye, and oats would be a reserve ; and the Alabama farm of 300 acres in cultivation would yield 700 head of hogs of one year old, weighing 150 pounds each, making 10 5000 pounds of pork; which, at                $3 per cut, would bring to the owner               $3,150: showing a proceed of                          $2,028 more than the farm in Kentucky with a capital of                          $2,750 less than was employed in Kentucky !a! The above is made upon a supposition that the hogs are to be kept in an enclosure and not suffered to run at large to be depend ant entirely upon the product of the farm for sustenance. I have made the above estimate upon my own experience and information n the last report some observations were made in one of the append ices respecting the value of the poultry raised in this country. I increasing attention is now paid to this subject, and new kinds of fowls are introduced, and improvements are making every year as to breeding and feeding them. Any valuable suggestions are found in the agricultural journals, as well as in volumes especially devoted to the subject, respecting the methods of keeping them so as to be profitable. That it is a profitable business there can be no doubt. A single statement made respecting successful experiments will show this. In the Cultivator mention is made of one of these experiments, to ascertain if the raising of hens would be profitable, by James L, Box, of Panes ville, Ohio. He says that in December and January, 1844 45, he had 24 hens and 1 cock; the eggs hatched well in this proportion 110 set, hatched out 75 chickens. This was previous to July 1, 1845 ; and besides the eggs set, the hens laid in the same time 1,096 others. The grain eaten amounted to            $4.25 for six months. He was prevented, by absence, from keeping an account for a whole year. W. Odd, of 348 a. Smith field, Rhode I s land, gives the following statement in the New Yorkfarmer: " From the 1st of April, 1844, to April, 1845, my hens, 25 in number, have consumed 26 bushels of corn, at 75 cents per bushel, which amounts to                                                          $19.55, during which time I have sold in market 242 dozen of eggs, averaging 15 cents per dozen, which amounts to                 $36.30; no account being made of those used in the family. I have also sold            $4 worth of chicken sin all amounting to                $40.30. Were, then, I have left                              $20.75clear profit."

His manner of keeping them is this: " I place a layer of sawdust in a keg; then pack the eggs closely to each other, with the small end down ; over this place another layer of sawdust, packing closely to and between the eggs, where they do not touch, and so on filling the keg; then head it up tight and change it end for end every 24 hours' He says they will thus keep a year perfectly fresh and good. A writer in the London Gardeners' Chronicle says that the following will be found an excellent method of fattening chickens: " Met rice over a fire with s dimmed milk ; let it boil till the rice is quite swelled out, then add a teaspoonful of sugar. Need them three times a day in common pans, giving them only as much as will fill them at once. Met the pans be well washed, and set in clean spring water, that no sour ness may be conveyed to the fowls, as that prevents them from fattening. Give them clean water, or the milk of rice, to drink. By this method the flesh will have a clear whiteness, which no other food gives. It is said that a portion of animal mixed with vegetable food causes poultry to thrive rapidly, but they should be confined to a vegetable diet for some time before they are killed. A quantity of charcoal, broken in small pieces, and placed within reach of the poultry, increases their appetite and promotes digestion." Some papers on the subject of poultry may be found in appendix No. 28. In connection with this general subject of poultry, also, we quote the following method of preserving eggs from the Boston Cultivator, which deserves attention : " We have seen many recipes for preserving eggs, and have tried several without success. They have been saved in good condition, a year or more, in lime water; but this requires much skill, as the lime water may be too weak or too strong, there being a vast difference in the quality of lime. These nice chemical preparations may answer for those who are doing business on a large scale, but for common domestic purposes they will not answer. We put down some eggs in plaster of Paris last July (1844) in a close vessel. First, a layer of Master, then a layer of eggs, not allowing one egg to touch another. In top we put a few inches of plaster, then covered the vessel over closely. The eggs were. 349 fresh, being put down as fast as they were laid, or within three or four days. They were placed with the small end downward, and placed in a dry cellar. In another vessel we put down some at the same time, and in the same manner, with fine salt. Eggs from both lots have been tried every month from January; the last trial was on the 1st of this month, (june, 1845,) when the eggs had been put down nearly eleven months. They have all proved to be perfectly sweet and pure; and at the last trial, the white, in a raw state, had its natural taste, and those saved in salt had no perceptible taste of salt. The eggs looked, when broken, like recently laid eggs, excepting for the last three months. In those saved in salt, the york adhered to the shell; on this account, and as salt is liable to melt in a cellar, we prefer the plaster n one of the public journals we find the following article on the egg trade of Cincinnati, which is worth, perusal: " The egg trade of Cincinnati bids fair to rival the celebrated pork trade of that city, to an extent which will soon sink the sob piquet of Porkopolis to that of Eggopolis. It is, indeed, enormous beyond c amputation. One firm alone (down send &a. To) during the first six months of this year, shipped to New York 234 barrels of eggs; to Baltimore, 70 barrels; and to New Orleans, 3,976 barrel !a! Each barrel contains 90 dozen; which makes the aggregate shipments 4,624,400 eggs! During the year ending as above, the egg trade of this firm amounted to                 $36,144.60. There are five other houses in Cincinnati engaged in the business. The foreign egg trade of Cincinnati the past year has amounted to 10,700 barrels; which is 963,000 dozen, or 11,556,000eggs !a! The aggregate value of this trade for the year, according to the data here given, is        $90,361.50. The business is a very hazardous one, owing to the great fluctuations in the New Orleans market. In the course of the past year, for example, western eggs have sold there as high as                           $22 per barrel, and as low as                $3. In addition to this export trade, these establishments do also a heavy home trade. That of Down send & To. supplies regularly five steamboats with 36 barrels a trip; which, at 12 trips a year, is 432 barrels. It also furnishes constantly the consumption of several of the largest hotels, which use at least 260 barrels per year, and does a retail business amounting to not less than 33 barrels per year. These several amounts make 72 5 barrels to add to the 4,280 barrels shipped, which gives an aggregate of 5,005 barrels, or 450,450 dozen, as the annual trade of this one house. Besides this, the annual city consumption is estimated at1213333 dozen. A further re capitulation shows the following results as to value value of 10,700 barrels of eggs shipped from this port, at       $8.44 per barrel -       $90,361.50Value of 1,213,333 dozen eggs consumed in this city, at 8 cents per dozen -97 066 64 Total annual value of the egg trade of Cincinnati                                                             $187,428.14Among the other objects which belong to the agricultural pursuits of oar country, or connected with the domestic economy of the farm, may be mentioned bees. Great improvements have been made within a few years as to ,very branch of this business. Numerous hives have been contrived and patented, for the purpose of obviateing the difficulties of having, to prevent the incursions of the bee moth, to save the swarms alive, and to sub tract easily the honey when wanted. Any of them are constructed with 350 much ingenuity, and seem to answer valuable ends. In the Ohio Cultivator we find the following short article on the profit of bees, which seems to indicate that it is a branch of business which, under proper management, promises to repay those who engage in it: As an instance of what can be done with a few swarms of bees, in good seasons and with good management, we give an extract from a statement furnished us, when travelling in this State two years ago, by Mr. D. B. In ney, of Berlin. Mr. Kinneycommenced, in the spring of 1841, with five swarms of bees-four of the min Weekss patent, and one in an old box hive. The debit and credit account stands as follows First year. Of.

The prices above stated, for swarms and honey, are those at which they found ready sale at the time. Mr. In ney informed us that his bees had suffered very little from moths or other casualties, since the use of Weeksshives. The honey has been of the finest quality, as well as extraordinary quantity. If any of his swarms appear weakly, Mr. In ney puts two together in one hive in interesting letter of Mr. Belly, on the subject of bees, will be found in the papers furnished by Mr. Ellsworth appendix No. 1. Preparati   Of Of The Soi L, <a name="seeds31"><mark>Seeds</mark></a>, &c. The science of agriculture is advancing continually every year. The great principles on which tillage should be conducted, the economical red. 351 nations of one part of farming. to another, are undergoing close investigation n and thecid127) elementary combinations, by- which fertility: may be sustained or increased are studied, with accurate analyses of the soil; the crops, and the necessary aliment to be afforded. Discussions of a most interesting character are going on in the various periodicals to determine the comparative value of one method of tillage over another, and how far this or that preparation may answer for any particular portion of our country. He cannot, of course, enter largely into these various points, but it may be proper just to avert to some of them, and touch more or less lightly on others. One of these is the rotation of crops. Of course these must vary according to the main object in view; but there can scarcely be a doubt that our farmers are, many of them, very negligent of the great principles on this subject. They go on dropping year after year successive yields of the same product, and yet they affect to wonder that, with perhaps increased diligence, they cannot obtain as large crops as when they begun. There is, however, no mystery in the matter. The soil calls out for a new .pplyofits exhausted materials, which some other crop might furnish, and which could be obtained through some other means of enriching it. In this subject Boussingault says: "that there is no absolute necessity for alternation. of crops where dung and labor can be readily procured, is und enable. Nevertheless, there are certain plants which cannot be reproduced upon the same soil, except at intervals more or less remote. The cause of this evidence on the part of certain vegetables is still obscure, and the hypothesis propounded for clearing it up far from satisfactory One of the marked advantages of alternate culture is, the periodic- cultivation of plants which improve the soil. The main thing to be secured in the rotation of crops is such a system :as shall enable the husbandmen to obtain the greatest amount of vegetable produce in the shortest possibletimeThe next point which we may notice is the practice of extensive cultivation. The consequence of this, in too many instances, is imperfect tillage and spare crops. Such ground has to be gone over to obtain :results not more regenerating, if as much so, as were half the quantity of land employed. It might be a serviceable work if any one were to make an accurate: calculation or comparison, embracing the additional fencing, theamunnt of additional travel to and fro, and time thus consumed in sowing cultivating, harvesting, &c, the crop of the same number of bushels or pounds obtained on the larger farm so cultivated, and a smaller one tilled with the same amount of manure, &c. The loss thus suffered, it cannot be doubted, would prove a considerable item on many a farmers year book, were it carefully noted: There is, however, so much gratifying to human, feelings in the possession of broad lands that we can hardly hope that, till our population has become really dense, our agriculturists will listen to the voice of science and true economy on this subject. A stinted culture, spread over numerous acres, may be the- cause of lessened prosperity to many. The subject of draining is one which is now commanding: the attentioniofthe agriculturists both of our own country and i those abroad. It is maintained that the depth of soil: may be thus increased. The system adoptedandiadvocated is called the 'a" frequent t drain system or (thorough draining system." The principle is, 'the providing of frequent opportumitieas352 for the water rising from below, or falling on the surface, to pass freely and completely off." Such is the statement of James Smith of Means ton, Scotland, whose works on the subject are frequently referred to in the English agricultural periodicals. He says: "I n the natural circumstances of the soil on the surface of the earth the drainage is extremely various, from that of the dry, light loam, incumbent on deep beds of open sand or gravel, to that of the thin, sterile crust of soil incumbent on massive beds of if pervious till. In the former, there is no water springing to the soil from below, and whatever falls from the surface, in the shape of rain, is instantly absorbed, and passes through the sand or gravel to some outlet at a lower level. In the latter case, on the contrary, water, whether springing from below or falling upon the surface in the shape of rain, must either run slowly off over the surface, however great the distance, or, in the event of a horizontal surface, must remain stagnant till elaborated by the sun or absorbed by the atmosphere. In such a sub soil a sufficient depth of active soil can never be long maintained; for even if trenched and enriched by lime id dung, it will bear but scanty and precarious crops; and if laid a ut for posture, it will, in a few years, revert to its former thin crust, producing but the coarsest herb age. Some soils are incumbent on sub soils partially or slowly pervious to water. Such, by judicious management, sometimes produce good crops in favorable seasons ; but when much rain prevails the crops are neither bulky nor of good quality. Boils so situated are unfit for wheat, as the alternate frosts and thaws of winter, acting on the water in the soil, are sure to throw out the plants. When soil is immediately incumbent on open rock, especially on wh in or green stone, which is very open from its many fissures, the land is uniformly fertile." Professor Johnson says, as to the depth of the drain, that 30 inches is not too deep, and that the most intelligent and practical men are in favor of drains 3 feet deep. Great improvements have been made in Scotland by the drainage system. The following testimony to the utility of draining we take from an agricultural journal" The magic effect of draining neighbor has a clay garden, which has sufficient inclination to carry off water; still, in spite of a large admixture of coarse manure, the sunrise would bake and crack it open in dry weather. Last spring he cut two deep ditches on each side of the garden 40 feet apart. The result is, that the mechanical structure of the soil appears to be changed from a heavy tenacious clay to a light and porous loam, on which the drought of this season had no injurious effect Connected with this subject is another, viz: deep or sub soil sloughing. The great importance of this has been thoroughly tested both in Europe and this country. In many cases it has proved a protection of the crop against the effects of the drought, besides enabling the farmer otherwise to obtain an increased crop. In appendix No. 29 will be found an account by Rev. John Jaffray, of Run bar, of an experiment on this subject, which is decisive. The practical conclusions, the author says, to be drawn from this experiment, are: 1st, that deep sloughing increases the produce next, that as both portions of the land used in the experiment were opened up eighteen inches deep by the sub soil plough for the crop of 1837,the full benefit of that operation is not obtained till the earth so loosened is again ploughed up. And the reason is evident; for it is then only that the soil is deepened, by an addition from the sub soil with which it is intermixed, and rendered more fruitful. Lastly: If deep sloughing increases, 353 the produce, it increases also the supply of vegetable manure ;and a greater portion of manure, added to improved culture, must produce a progressive increase of fertility and of produce." Other instances are the following, which, as they are short, we sub join from different journals: -a. Deepploughingwe have occasionally urged the importance of deepening the soil, by turning up and mixing with the surface small portions of the sub soil, where its nature is such as to produce beneficial effects. We have known many instances of the beneficial effects of such a course. Dr. D. H. Robinson, of Farming ton, Ontario county, New Work, being compelled to prepare a piece of grass land for wheat, late in summer, ploughed it very deep not less in any place than eight inches, but averaging nine or ten inches. This was thoroughly harrowed, with a small dressing of rotted manure, and sowed upon the inverted sod. The product was thirty-five bushels per acre, on land where twenty bushels are usually considered a heavy crop. Another very skilful farmer, of our acquaintance, finds so much benefit from the mixture of the sub soil, that he considers a decided advantage would result, so far as raising wheat is concerned, if six inches of the surface of his land were entirely removed and carried off. Subsoilploughing would doubtless be useful, in such cases, to a certain extent; but we would more particularly recommend thorough trench ploughingoneplough to follow the first, so as to loose n and throw up the soil to the depth of at least one foot; the last team to be double, and attached to a strong plough' from the Southern Cultivator. Deep ploughingMr. Camak : By your request, I give you the result of a trial made by myself, last year, in deep sloughing. Having received, late in February, several varieties of wheat distributed front the Patent Office, I immediately prepared a small piece of ground in the following manner First, I ran a good turning plough, and followed in the same furrow with a long s cooper. I attended to it in person, and am certain that the ground was thoroughly broken to the depth of both ploughs. The wheat, as I feared, was too late, and was destroyed by the rust. A thick coat of crab grass came up, and was suffered to grow until August, when it was cut and cured making, on about a fourth of an acre, three cart loads of most excellent hay, of unusual length, measuring three feet and upwards. I need, it was the thickest and most luxuriant plat of grass I ever saw. The land was without manure; the season was unusually dry so much so that   made but little over half a crop of corn. I had another piece of land left for the purpose of making hay, which I know to be a great del richer, having had the drainings of the horse lot for years. This received one single sloughing, but did not produce grass high enough to cut. These facts led me to reflect upon the cause of the difference between the product of the two pieces, without intending it as a comparative experiment. The result, together with the attending circumstances, satisfied me that the superior yield of the un manured piece could be attributed alone to the deep and thorough sloughing it received in the spring Very respectfully, Of. Rutherford, Of. Cowpens, Walton County, March 21, 1845.  Stirring the earth is likewise said to be very beneficial in dry weather. Experiments on this subject have proved this. And it is said that the dews settled on the newly turned earth, and imparted moisture I thus showiag23854 that such an operation has a tendency to attract moisture to the roots of plants which lie buried in the earth. It is thought, also, that by moving the surface and keeping it in a light and porous state, it is enabled to resist the heat of the suns rays. A writer in the London Agricultural Gazette, writing on this subject, says: "Pulverization of the soil increases the capillary attraction, or sponge like property of soils, by which their humidity is rendered more uniform. Travels or sands retain little or no water ; while stiff soils, as clays, which have not been opened by pulverization, either do not absorb water, or when by long action it is absorbed, they retain too much. The depth of pulverization must depend upon the soil and sub soil. In rich land it can scarcely be too deep, and even in sands, unless, the sub soil contains particles noxious to vegetables; but very dry sands, if the season is hot or dry, should merely be stirred, otherwise the great evaporation of moisture, which would take place by deep pulverization, would render them too dry for the vigorous growth of plants. The grand object of deep pulverization is to cause the soil to retain heat and moisture, so necessary to the healthy growth of vegetables of every description. Some proportion ought to be observed between the depth of the sloughing, the nature of the soil and sub soil, and the quantity of the manure annually spread n connection with the preparation of soil may be mentioned the account of prairie cultivation, which is given by the late Commissioner of Patents, and which may be found in the appendix No. 1, including such papers a she has furnished to the office for this report. The experiments respecting the electro culture of plants do not seem to have resulted favorably, and the idea of its proving of any value is now discarded by the best agriculturists, both of this country and abroad. Professor Folly stated to the meeting of the British Association the result of a series of experiments, which in some cases seemed favorable, and in others not. "but of a series of 55 experiments on different <a name="seeds32"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, 21 appeared in favor of electricity, 10 against it, and 25 showed no effect whatever; and in carefully counting the whole number of <a name="seeds33"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in the entire series, there were found 1,250 of the elect rifled, and 1,253 of the nonelectrified. In conclusion, Professor Folly stated that he felt doubtful whether the effects observed were really due to the influence of electricity n the Electrical Magazine for October, the experiments of Professor Folly are also confirmed by the Rev. Mr. Kidneys statement. A process of quickening the germination of <a name="seeds34"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, however, is referred to in the following extract from one of our public journals: "' I important to agriculturists electricity communication was read at the late meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society, England, from Mr. A Beaume, in relation to experiments in quickening the germination of <a name="seeds35"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, invigorating their plants, increasing their fecundity, and improving the quality of their products, by means of electricity. 'the means I have employed' says the writer, 'are not atmospheric electricity, galvanism, orelectromagnetism, which cannot apply, but electricity developed by a machine of adequate powers, and by a simple, peculiar, and effective process, easily understood and easily used, with very little manual labor. The time required is on the whole about half an hour, and 1,000 bushels of wheat, or any other grain, can be elect rifled as easily as an ounce, at the same time. I beg also to announce that this, my process, applies equally to the resuscitation of the impaired vitality of old as well as bad <a name="seeds36"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, to the revivification
. 355 of withering plants, and to the increase of the quantity and quality of their fruit. In order to a more extended trial, and to. the establishment of the facts I have communicated, if several members will send me some packages of turn in and other seed I will freely and cheerfully electric y and return them in a day or two, so that success may be proved by an impartial trial under your auspices; and I shall neither seek nor receive any other reward than your approbation, and the satisfaction of diffusion of practical knowledge for the public good' Further trials by Messrs. A Beaume, Karl of Essex, and others, were promised at the next meeting. We doubt not any American can readily try the experiment from the above notice. I to importance certainly should prompt them to do so at once discovery, which it is thought may be useful to florists, &c, has been made in England by the secretary of the Royal Holy technical Society, and which is both curious and interesting. It relates to the germination of <a name="seeds37"><mark>seeds</mark></a> under colored glass. " By this it is proved that the yellow and red rays are destructive to germination; while under the influence of violet, indigo, or blue light, the process of germination is quickened in a most extraordinary manner. The rational e is, that every beam of light proceeding from its solar source is a bundle of different colored rays, to the absorption or reflection of which we owe all that infinite diversity of color which is one of the greatest charms of creation. These rays being known to possess different functions, the light which permeates colored glass partakes of the character of the ray which corresponds with the glass in color. Thus blue glass admits the blue or chemical rays, to the exclusion of others; yellow glass admits only the penetration of the luminous rays; while red glass cuts of fall but the heating rays, which pass it freely. This affords a very easy 3 method of growing plants under the influence of any particular light that may be desired in the quantity of seed to be used for an acre, there exists a diversity of opinion; the question of thin or thick sowing both having its warm advocates. By the sub joined table, prepared by the editor of one of the agricultural journals we believe of the Cultivatorit will be seen that there is less seed used to an acre with us than in Europe. Now far this may affect our comparative crops, may be worthy of attention 356 p s |a| a i. a ."I I I I I I I 3 I I I I I 'l i ll lips 0 >a> .0 a s? nag a au E 3 a 55 It p

The great facts respecting the operations of manures, it is believed, are now thoroughly established. The constituents of soils of various grains and vegetables have been determined, and the proportions, in many cases, may be considered fixed with all the precision of the deductions of science. The theory advocated by one or another may not be free to every mind from objections; but the bearing of particular substances in the production of certain results is readily admitted. It is considered an axiom, it is believed, that there are certain substances which, when found in the soil, render it more than ordinarily fertile; and on the other hand, that there are certain things in the different kinds of plants or vegetables which render it necessary that they be allowed a particular adaptation of the soil, and its auxiliaries, in order to be successfully raised. The great object in relation to manures now seems to be to bring as much efficacy as possible into the smallest compass. Ammonia is admitted to exercise a great influence in production ; and to fix this so as to derive its fe utilizing power to the crop, is one of the ends proposed. In preparing and preserving manures, as it has been said, the rational objects to be obtained are, first, to preserve and collect all matters containing the organic or in organic constituents of the crops which we are about to raise; and, secondly, if the matters so collected are in such a state as not to be immediately available as food for plants, to render them so by artificial means. In these latter cases ferment at ion is the great operation, and this may be either hastened or retarded, accordingly as care is or is not taken in the disposition and arrangement of the materials, and in adding the necessary substances as helps in the process. Various methods are proposed, according to circumstances, to effect the object. Both science and practice have determined some general rules; but exceptions, too, will l exist, so that it need not be thought surprising if experience sometimes runs counter to the views of even the wisest in these subjects. To doubt, also, in many cases, on closer scrutiny, it might be found that the conditions were not exactly similar; and that, perhaps, the failure may be the result of a deficiency or an excess which has been overlooked, or considered too trifling to be taken into the account; but, for all practical purposes, the case may be termed an exception. The opinion seems to be very generally entertained that the liquid manures, which have been too generally neglected, hold a very important place in the means of enriching the soil, which are at the command of the husband man. The principle is universally maintained, that all manure must be in a so ruble or de composed state, in order to act either proximatelyor indirectly on the plant or soil. 'though applied in a solid condition, yet, by moisture, &c, it must be made to give out its fe utilizing properties, or it is vain to look for success from its use. Professor Lie big, who is considered one of the ablest writers of the present day on the action of manures on plants, it is stated, " has discoveredetrtain compounds, &c, which are of such a nature that different states of moisture in the atmosphere, or different localities, will not diminish their efficacy." In his pamphlet, he declares: "I have found means to give 358 to every so ruble ingredient of manure, by its combination with others, any degree of sol ability, without altering its effect on vegetation. I give, for instance, the alkalies in such a state as not to be more so ruble than gypsy mr< The reason why, in certain years, the best and most plentiful maturing is scarcely perceptible, is, that during the moist and rainy springs and summers the phosphates, and other salts with alkaline bases, as also the solubleammonical salts, are entirely or partly removed. A great amount of rain or moisture removes in the greatest quantity the very substances which are most indispensable to the plants at the time that they begin to form and mature <a name="seeds38"><mark>seeds</mark></a>." Again: "1 have succeeded in combining the efficacious elements of manure in such a manner as that they will not be washed away and thus efficacy will be doubled." He states that the following may be considered as the constituent elements of a powerful manure, applicable to all sorts of soils, viz: phosphates of lime, found in bones, &c; phosphates of magnetic, which it is well known enters largely into the composition of the grains. Alkaline phosphates also are important elements of the <a name="seeds39"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of grass, peas, beans, &c. The alkalies, (potash and soda) sulphate of potash, chloride of potassium, salts of lime, salts of ammonia, decaying vegetable matters, which contain carbon, are also useful. He thinks that an ~artificial manure may be formed to supply the place of gun no. Behave placed his whole letter in the appendix No. 30. That he is mistaken in the probable speedy exhaustion of gun no, we think is evident from the official report made to the tPeruvian government in 1842, and published at Him a, under the authority of the treasury department. This report, it is stated, gives the result of a survey made by the order of the Peruvian government of three islets near Disco, in latitude about 140 south, called the Thin chas, where is found one of the many deposites of gun no which abound on the coast of Peru and Bolivia, to an extent of 800 miles. "the superficial extent of the deposites the surveyor found to be 1,554,406 square varas, (33- inches English is a vara) and the depth to vary according to the irregular surface of the rock upon which it is based; but making liberal allowance for the points of rock rising above the bed of the general mass, he calculated an average depth of 60 varas, which gives the sum total of 93,264,360 cubic varas. The cubic vara of grand, as found in these deposites, weighs more than half a ton; but taking no account of the excess, we have here 46,632,180 tons, which, if extracted at the rate of 50,000 tons per annum, would last more than 900 years; and valued at               $50 per ton, amounts to                          $2,331,609,000, a sum such as no mine has produced There are various other places where gun no is found ; but all the different kinds' are not of equal value. The Peruvian and true Bolivia are esteemed the best: after these the first quality from I ch above; then the second quality from I ch above, and that from Saldanha bay. The Chilian is an inferior kind. The deposit e at I ch above is mostly exhausted. It is stated thatguano has been found on some of the islands in the gulf of It. Lawrence and it is conjectured that it may be yet found on the coast of Labradoralso of Florida. The principal ingredient which gives gun no its great fe utilizing power is ammonia ; though there are other elements also, and animal matter, to be discovered by analysis. It has been thoroughly tested in its application to various descriptions of crops. The agricultural journals abound with proofs of successful trials, and the books and treatises on manures also. 359 furnish similar evidence. One of the best pamphlets on the subject, detailing in plain language the experiments made in different crops, is that of Mr. Teschemacher, of Boston, called "in Essay on Pua no." Mr. Teschemacher is a strong advocate for its use, and offers many valuable suggestions, which we should like to transfer to our appendix; but the work being a copyright one, precludes such a free use of its pages, and we have not time now to con dense its results. We have placed, however, in the appendix No. 30, a letter of J. P. Norton, from the Am. Agriculturists, which relates to gun no and other manures. Also extracts from a letter of or. Picket t to the National I institute on the gun no of Peru. A remarkable case of death produced by the inhalation of gun no, furnished by the attending physician, will also be found quoted from a public journal in the same appendix, No. 30. The consumption of gun no in Great Britain up to the 1st of July, 1845, is thus stated : " Consumption of gun no in Greatbritaini n 1841 it amounted to 500 tons of Peruvian ; in 1842, to 2,000;in 1843, to 5,000; in 1844, to 10,450 of Peruvian and 16,000 African 1st July, 1844, to 1st of July, 1845, of Peruvian and African 135,550 tons value, at 61 average per ton, is 881,075, or            $4,291,160; and the stock on hand (140 000 tons)            $4,368,000; making        $8,659,160 expended in four years for one species of manure." In the London Gardeners' Chronicle for June 28, 1845, under the title " What will a ton of Pua no produce" we have a c amputation, said to be furnished by a correspondent, as follows your cut. of guanoper acre will produce of turn is 25 tons; one ton, therefore, will produce of turn is 125 tons, and 125 tons of turn is will produce 31 tons of dung; which, at the rate of 2s. D. per ton, will bring 4 2s. 125 tons of turn is will give 1,500 pounds of beef at 6d, amounting to 37 10s. Produce of 1 ton of gun no, 41 12s. Again: Give cut of gun no will produce of <a name="potatoes258"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 10 tons; 1 ton of gun no will therefore produce 40 tons. 40 tons of <a name="potatoes259"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will give 50. Produce of <a name="potatoes260"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 50. Produce of turn is, 41 12s. Balance in favor of <a name="potatoes261"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, .98 8s sufficient to purchase a to ii of gun no. But to show the value of gun no in its true light, on a broader view, we will suppose that there are few farmers in this country who do not grow their five acres of green crops. To effect this with dung alone it will require (at 40 yards to the acre) 200 cubic yards, which most farmers can manage to raise on the homestead. Give acres of turn is, at 25 tons to the acre, will give 125 tons; yielding, as above, 41 12s. The same manure distributed over 10 acres, along with 1 ton of gun no, (20 yards dung and 2 cut. of gun no per acre) at a cost of 10, will yield double the quantity of turn is ; which turned into beef and manure, will yield, at the same ratio, 83 is. The profit arising from a ton of gun no, after de ducting 10 for its price, is 31 12s. This is the profit from one crop only, on five acres, "of  t is well known that gun no is the dung of fowls, and our farmers therefore have it in their power, by saving the manure of their poultry yards, to avail themselves to a considerable degree of the benefits of this special fe utilizing substance. A bushel of hens dung will have a decided effect on their vegetable crop; and, as it may be applied to advantage in a liquid state by adding water, it can be made to go further. Some of the poudrette manures are also valuable for the same purpose. In the appendix No. 30 will likewise be found the account of Mr. Cells experiments with prepared manure, read by him before the American Agri360 cultural Association, and which we have taken from a late number of the American Agriculturists. In the same appendix we have likewise included some other papers- on, he subject of manures, which, as will be seen, we have taken from various sources. Had we sufficient time and space, we might insert a great variety of experiments, which we have noticed on record, as' to the efficacy of different manures. Bones, salt, charcoal, nitrates, anthracite, and other ashes, lime, and a great number of other articles, a recommended for particular purposes. I need there is scarcely any refuse which may not be made valuable for this object; and our farmers have yet to learn the secret of the wonderful powers at their command, if they will only read and reflect, and apply the knowledge they may thus obtain as tofertilizing their lands. The following useful suggestions we take from the American Agriculturists. It applies to other cities_ and towns besides New Work. " We will make a simple suggestion to the public, without charge. I insert under each aperture of a or ivy, drawers made of wood, iron, or metal, two feet wide, two feet deep, and any required length, with handles at each end, so that they can be as easily drawn out and handled as those of a desk. But into these drawers pe at, mixed with a little plaster of Paris, or charcoal dust, mixed with plaster, to the depth of six inches or a foot. Thus arranged, not the slightest unpleasant smell would arise from the or ivy; and, every week or fortnight, carts, with tight boxes in them, should call at the house, and the drawers be emptied into them. In this vewy the yards would be purified of a shocking nuisance, and vast quanti tied of poudrette could be weekly manufactured, for which any company could well afford to pay the city of New York                                                                         $100,000 per annum. Oil of vitriol diluted in water, at the rate of five pounds to a barrel, poured into a vault of moderate size, will completely disinfect it. There drawers are placed to catch the faces, as directed above, no other liquid but urine should be emptied into them. Boussingault estimates the solid and liquid excrements of a man at 618 pounds per annum, containing 18 pounds of nitrogen a quantity sufficient to grow 83 6 pounds of wheat From other public journals: " Word Barrington has just issued from the London press a small work 'on the agriculture of Went' in which he says that for ten years he has never failed to grow a good crop of Swede turnipsSby invariably putting charcoal in the drills with the seed' He pulverizesthe soil very fine before planting, and scatters (after the seed are in the ground, and before they are up) a top dressing of common salt, at the rate of 200 pounds to the acre. Good ashes, bone dust, and gun no, are all used in Went for both turn in and wheat crops. Ashes, coal saturated with urine, and salt, are the cheapest and most valuable fertilizes to be had in this country" What next ?sugar recommended as the cheapest and best minute for turnipsA writer in the English Dark Lane Express of the 5th of May, says: Farmers are busy in preparing ground for <a name="potatoes262"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and turn is, and. the fallows generally are in a forward state. This is the period now, and from now till June, for the farmer to be on the alert. If he loses his turn in crop it is more his fault, in the majority of cases, than any controlling cause. His motto should now be, to keep his soils moist by compression; and the seed is certain to terminate, and go on, too, if he will but supply the young plant with the necessary food. Sugar will, (now the price is reduced) I have no doubt, be extensively used. I speak from ex doc. No. 140. 361perience when I say that, of all extraneous manures, if one it may be called, it has produced more visible effects in the least space of time than a dy other I ever used, and is strictly what the turn in plant requires in the first stage of its growth. 1 would strongly recommend it to be tried on a small scale, mixed with ashes' "again, from the Boston Cultivator, which derives it from an 'English source : " The waste of manure from the farm yard (especially the liquid portion) has of late been the subject of frequent remark. One of the best constructed yards in the country, for the purpose of securing all the manure raised, is that of R. Spooner, esq, M. P., of Trick fields, near this city, who, our readers are aware, has a fine farm of from 150 to 200 acres in the highest state of cultivation. This farm yard has excited the admiration of a correspondent of a western paper, who states, upon seemingly good authority, that Mr. Spooner has not expended a shilling for manure for many years, (with the exception of a trifling sum for the lately introduced novel ties, by way of experiment) but has sold much farm yard manure to his neighbors, not knowing how to dispose of it on the farm. Although he does not possess an acre of watered meadow, he has generally hay for sale. In the centre of Mr. Spooners farm yard is the manure pit, six or eight feet deep, covered by a roof and surrounded by a dwarf wall, so as to prevent the possibility of any water getting in. It is of the same form as the yard, but leaving sufficient room for a carriage way between it and the building. It is entered b, an inclined plane, wide enough to back in a cart opposite the approach to the yard. In to this pit the dung from the stables and cowhouses ispromiscuously thrown; in the middle of the side contiguous to the latter is a well, and a pump which receives the drainage therefrom and the stables, which is pumped up and spread over the manure by a shoot. The surplus liquid that is not absorbed is drawn off by means of a drain into a receiving well in the stock yard, where it is pumped up into the liquid manure cart and drawn out on the mowing ground as soon as the grass is cut, until such time as it is laid up again ; in the spring it is otherwise disposed of, on head lands and heaps of soil. Liquid and solid in manure, prepared in the way above described, preserves all its nutritions qualities the one is not diluted with water, and the other is not suffered to deteriorate by over heating, and is of treble the value of that made in the commonmannerAgain: " Mr. Grown finds that plaster, applied to his manure heap and his stables, has added 50 per cent. to the strength and value of his manure. He sows plaster over his barn yard once a week. Mr. Grown has used salt as a manure with great benefit. He sows it broadcast upon wheat and grass, at the rate of from three to five bushels per acre. In grass he would sow it in the fall; for wheat, he would sow it just before the wheat is sewn. He found that three bushels of salt to the acre on his wheat field occasioned an increase of seventeen bushels of wheat to the acre over that which had no salt. The soil was a strong loam, with a stiff sub soil. Mr. B. had not tried salt to kill wire worms. Boussingault made a communication relative to a newammoniacalmanure. Having remarked that magnetic, the basis of which has always, been regarded as injurious to vegetation, was found in the ashes of all vegetables, and in a proportion in accord with the quantity of phosphorus also found in the ashes, and of that of the a note, which enters into the come position of plants, he was led to infer that vegetables must assimilate with 362 ease and advantage the ammoniated magnesium phosphates. Being desirous of verifying this by experiment, he planted, on the 1st of May last, some grains of early maize, which had already terminated, in two series of pots, into the half of which he had poured 15 gram mes (about half an ounce) of double phosphates salt for each pot. The two series of pots were then placed in the open ground. During the first twenty-five days, the vegetation was the same with both series; after that, there was a difference in favor of the pots which had been watered with the phosphates. In the 25th July, the plants in them were double in height those of the other series, and the diameter of the stems was two thirds thicker. By the 25th of August, the proportion had diminished: the height of the plants watered by the phosphates was then only one third greater, and the size of the stems double. At the moment of their coming to maturity, the phosphates plants bore two sound ears and one that had failed to come to maturity; the other plants had only two ears each, viz: one complete and one that had failed. This was not all; each grain of the ears of the phosphates plants was double in weight to that of the non phosphates plants. M. Boussingault concludes, therefore, (and with great reason) that the salt in question may be used with great advantage as an artificial manure or. Seller, of North Carolina, in one of his communications to the Nortkcarolina agricultural paper, has the following recommendation for improving the land : "I observe, ere I close, that one most effectual means, as I have found by years of experience, to make land better, is that of covering small grain, immediately after sowing, (but if wheat, when up, and ate leisure, during winter) with pine leaves or straw from the old field or woods an inch or so deep, spread over evenly. I have frequently doubled my crops of oats, wheat, and rye, this way. In that part of the field thus covered and shaded, twice as good as the part not covered. Besides, the ground, by the after decomposition of that vegetable matter, is gradually improved. And one grand advantage of this covering of small grain is, that even sandy land (if sufficiently rich at least) may have a c lover crop thereon, sown with or after the small grain, (if wheat, in spring, after covering in winter) without the usual danger of being burnt out by the hot sun and dry weather of summer. I need, I have found such repeated covering equivalent to mary, and less trouble of putting it on. There pine straw is not to be had, wheat straw or other litter is equivalent, and perhaps better for wheat, on the principle lately discovered, that the straw or litter of any kind of plant makes the best manure for the same. Hence, corns talks are the best litter for corn, if managed as before stated." In connection with this subject of manures, it may not be inappropriate to sub join the following statement of the analyses of different crops, as they show the constituents required for their protection. With comparative tables of analyses of manure and soils of various descriptions, arranged correspondingly, the farmer would be much aided. We have not been able to lay our hands on any such tables, or found opportunity or materials with which to compile them ; though, perhaps, by long search they might possibly be obtained from a great variety of publications. Sprehgel has the most extensive analysis of soils and manures of which we know; but we do not find all we seek there, nor inThaer, He it, or Boussingault, and other authors whom we have consulted. In Surgery Economy of Farming may be found many tables, as to soil, a. 363 from Schuyler and Sprengel. We take the following from the New England Farmer, furnished by Mr. Teschemacher: "the English agricultural societies have voted a considerable sum of money for the purpose of analyzing the ashes of plants, none of the analyses yet made having been found satisfactory; and those of Sprengel, asLiebig justly observes, being altogether incorrect. In the mean time, however, two German chemists, Messrs. Fresenius and Will, in the laboratory of their great master at I essen, have undertaken the analyses of ashes of <a name="seeds40"><mark>seeds</mark></a> and plants, and have recently published an account of them, with the methods pursued, and the precautions taken. Some of their observations and results I propose to give, as I find by the last number of your paper that this information is desired. It would be misplaced to give here the beautiful processes by which the analyses of these gentlemen were performed; the results will, no doubt, be more satisfactory. The first I give are 5 out of 10 specimens of tobacco grown in Hungary, on land in various districts, which had never been manured, and on which this plant had been some time cultivated. And in these we shall see illustrated the beautiful law of substitution of one base for another, which may be wanting in the soil, as laid down by Lie big. It will be observed that as the quantity of potash decreases, that of lime increases; the former being exhausted out of the soil, is replaced in the plant by the latter, which is in plenty. There is no doubt, however, that this substitution must cause a difference in the quality, and is, therefore, a subject worth studying by the tobacco planters of this country. I give only those made after de ducting the carbonic acid, the charcoal, and the sand. Analyses of five specimens of tobacco.

The ashes of <a name="seeds41"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, so far as their composition is known, consist, like those of the blood of man and of other animals, chiefly of the phosphates of the alkalies and the alkaline earths. The curious fact, moreover, has been lately observed, that the phosphorus acid is not, in all <a name="seeds42"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, combined with the same number of equivalents of fixed bases.

We have already furnished some examples under the head of an individual product. But there are others which we deem worthy of notice, and which appear to come in better with this part of the report than in any other. We shall throw a portion of them into the appendix No. 29. The account rendered by John Bones, ofWheatland, Delaware, respecting his farming operations, is an interesting* Phosphates of lime364Linseed258507125270223674041170092Sainfoin67520338575489287110155 2.18-f31C0 A. a. 365 one. His farm, to which he removed on the 4th of March, 1834 and which contained 360 acres in Delaware, and 30 acres in Maryland, when he entered upon it was in a very poor state, and scarcely paid six per kept on the purchase money. In 1837 he commenced living it, and, up to 1839, put on 12,000 bushels of lime, at a cost, at the kills, of 20 to 22 cents per bushel. By 1840, he saw and felt the good effects of the lime, aid determined to go on and complete the first dressing of all his arable lands, a swell as another farm of 380 acres. He purchased 10,000 bushels oflilpe, at 17 cents per bushel. Previous to 1840, he had sown c lover and other grass <a name="seeds47"><mark>seeds</mark></a> pretty freely-one year as much as 45 bushels; and the same year he purchased 20 tons of plaster. At first he got but a poor return even for his lime, as he supposes, for want of vegetable matter; but when his c lover had grown so as to make a swash or lay for turning under, his crops began to increase even beyond his expectation. The crops for the year 1844, which closed with his best wheat crop, were all got out and sold by the 25th of July, producing the following results: At crop, light, not many sown crop sold for                               $209; rental share,                                                                      $104.50. Worn tillage, large 97 acres, including an orchard of four acres, not well tilled, produced 3,000 bushels; rental share 1,500 bushels at 40 cents,        $600. The wheat crop amounted to 2,820 bushels, exclusive of b rock or ra kings; the rental share one half, or (say) 1,410 bushels at 90 cents,                                                         $1,269. It was grown on two fields-one of which of 97 acres, a c lover lea, well turned under produced 1,872 bushels, exclusive of b rock; which would have made this field amount to over 20 bushels to the acre,                                                         $1,973.50. Add 64 bushels of b rock, at 90 cents per bushel, (a(          $57.60,) and we have                          $2,031.10. His other field of wheat contained about 60 acres. The product of this field was 9 48 bushels, exclusive of ra kings; or, had they been included, the yield would have exceeded 16 bushels to the acre. This field had been hard cropped, for the wheat followed corn; which corn had followed wheat stubble the year previous, without c lover or manure' I need, this field has had nine crop sin 12 years, with but little manure at any time, it being farthest from the farm yard, and his place is poor land near by. The principal help this field had was 40 bushels of lime to the acre, put on in 1838, and two crops of c lover turned under; and on a part of the field a crop of oats was turned under that had been injured by the hail storm of 1840. The rental value of these three crops of oats may be set down at                          $2,031.10; allowing, according to usage, half of the grain for rent; and this pays the interest, at six per cent of the capital of                 $33,850. The original cost of the farm was            $4;100. The cost of the lime, 4) bushels, was long since reimbursed. I including his stock c! he considers his farm yielding a rent equal to the interest of                                                                         $100 per acre; and his crops have been gained by ordinary good tillage, a rotation of crops, and fifty bushels of lime. In the London Earners' Chronicle forAgugust 30, 1845, we find the following method, by which on three acres, to keep four cows all the year: " Plant one acre to <a name="potatoes263"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the produce should buy three tons of hay ; equal, for November, December, January, February, and March, to ten pounds per cow each day. Plant one-fourth of an acre to m angel wurzel, one-fourth of an acre to carrots, and one-fourth of an :acre to par ships : the first will give you 25 pounds; the second, 15 pounds ; and the third 30 pounds per cow, each, during the same time ; but in feeding during winter you would need to keep the ni angel wurzel untouched till March or April. This will more than provide for you during winter. For summer, sow one fourth of an acre of rape, and one-fourth of 366 rye, as soon as you have dug that extent of your <a name="potatoes264"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. These will be ready for March and April use: the ground on which they stand will come in for m angel wurzel and carrots Your third acre may be planted half of it to ulcer ne, and the other half may be sown to ve aches, at successive so wings, in October, November, March, or April. These, with what maybe left of the hay and m angel wurzeland some of the latter will remain as late as June will last you from April to October. You should cultivate all these with the spade, and your success will depend much upon your care and proper application of the manure." For this country very probably the above might need modifications. A mode of raising corn, <a name="potatoes265"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and pump king in alternate rows, is thus described in the American Agrictlturist, by one of its correspondents: ' "or. Muir, of this town, gave me an interesting account of an experiment made by himself in 1837, in planting one acre of land with corn, <a name="potatoes266"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, andpumpkins, which was as follows: The land was ploughed from six to eight inches deep, well harrowed, and a light coat of manure spread on, and harrowed in well. The land furrowed lightly 2 feet apart, and planted one row of corn, and the next <a name="potatoes267"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, alternating them to the six throw, which he planted with pump king. Thus every other row being corn and <a name="potatoes268"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, except the sixth row, Which was pump king, throughout the field. The corn in the rows stood only one stalk in a place, in this manner: 6 14 8 16 6. One corns talk, and then a space of six or eight inches to another; then a space of 14 to 16 inches. The <a name="potatoes269"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and pump king were planted as thick as they would bear, bu the did not describe the manner. The amount of produce from the acre was as follows: 187 bushels of corn in the ear; 153 bushels of <a name="potatoes270"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and 100 cartloads of West I india pump king. He has since followed a similar course, and is satisfied that this is the best way for him to get the most profit from his land. P., Essex county, N. Y, March 25, 1845."Some other useful remarks on the subjects of cultivation in general maybe found in our appendix No. 29. Surplus, And Marketsf In some of the States the amount of provisions raised on their own soil is not sufficient for the consumption of their population, and they of course must depend on others to supply them. But they, in their turn, have products of various kinds to give in exchange. This creates a brisk domestic trade, the results of which are seen all along our coast, on our inland seas and the different rivers, canals, and railways connecting the various points of commerce in our land. The surplus, too, seeks an outlet abroad, and becomes our medium of commerce abroad. It is unnecessary to attempt to trace out its courses. We refer to the appendix, Los. 31, 32, for a number of tables, &c, which will illustrate the relation of our agricultural products to our foreign trade. We add here a few items which may be useful, as showing the amount of our resources, which we have taken from different public journals" The exports of Ohio for 1845.-The Cincinnati Chronicle says: Behave before us the shipments from Cleveland, Ohio, and Cincinnati, for the year 1845, to the last week. As the season is nearly closed, we can give a tolerably accurate view of the exports of 1845 from this great agricultural State. It must be remembered that, in estimating the exports of a year commencing the 1st of January, we do not get precisely one seasons pro
67duction, but only one seasons transportation. The production belongs to both to the last and the present season. The shipments of the surplus of flour this year will be very nearly as follows, reducing the wheat to its equivalent in flour: "cleveland, 450,000 barrels; Cincinnati, 150,000; Sole do, 100,000;Milan, An dusky, &c, 150,000; Marietta, &c, 40,000; Portsmouth, &30 000. Total, 930,000 barrels. The other articles we estimate in money, thus: Flour, in all 930,000 barrels,            $4,000,000; pork, in all                $3,500,000;cattle and beef,                  $500,000; wool, (2000 000 pounds)                  $500,000; cheese 5000 000 lbs)                    $300,000; manufactures,                $3,000,000. Total,                                                               $11,800,000. We think these results are under estimated, and that there are miscellaneousarticles enough to make the net surplus in value                                                                $12,000,000. The flour product is                          $2,000,000 less than it would have been had the last two harvests of wheat been good ones The following exhibits the amount of grain and flour transported in 1845 on the different lines of the Pennsylvania improvements named Flour, bals.

Heretofore butter and land went forward as one item; and bacon, hams, &c, passed as pork, and were reduced to the barrel standard. This year they have been kept separate. The amount in bulk cleared for the Hudson this year was 1,218,810 pounds equivalent to 6,000 barrels. To that, by adding this with the quantities of pork shipped this season, it leaves a deficit of 18,130 barrels, as compared with 1844. Hemp is now becoming quite an article in lake imports, and will hereafter pass freely towards tide water for a market; but, as it is cleared at the canal office among sun dries, we are unable to say what the quantity going east has been. The table below exhibits a full account of the canal business here for four seasons. Property shipped for tide water 1842.

A fraction less than 400 tons of the former commodity is observe able over the shipment for last season. Cheese was 200 tons more, and flax seed has increased 1,080 bushels; while c lover and other <a name="seeds48"><mark>seeds</mark></a> have fallen off 13,580 bushels. Tobacco has increased some, but not enough to meet the bulk of 1842 43. Utter and land combined have fallen off 21,500 pounds. The increased demand for lead here has absorbed all the import from the west. The increase in leather is very great, and much of the surplus going east is from man factories along the lakes. Nearly all the hops required for consumption are imported from the interior of this State, or places along 'the seaboard. The few hides passing cast are designed mostly for manufacture in this State. The perversion in the movement of dried fruit is singular. Large quantities were imported from below last season to supply the demand here and along the whole lake country. The increased shipment of states shows again of 50 per cent: but, as the cargoes leaving here are always estimated below the actual aggregate, the real increase must be still greater. Number can be more accurately measured, and shows an increase of 33 per cent. Nearly the whole of our best shipping lumber, such as cherry, black walnut, white wood, and cabinet and chair stuff, generally, are the product of this State, obtained from the two western counties bordering on the lake. The pine is all from Canada. A portion of the pine used for building here is from our own State and Pennsylvania. The vast increase in the quantity of coal going east cannot fail to attract attention; and was formerly averted to as being entirely owing to the opening of the Erie Extension canal into the bituminous region of Pennsylvania. The diminution in the article of corn is of such magnitude as to call for the especial consideration of the canal board. With millions of bushels .lying uncalled for in theScioto and Wabash valleys, a tariff of tolls is pertinaciously adhered to, which entirely prohibits its being brought northward, to increase our trade and augment the State revenues. Other coarse and bulky articles might also be particular sized, but the above catalogue embraces so many that it were loss of time in attempting a detail( From the Albany Citizen. Flourwheatbarleythe closing of the canal enables us to lay before our readers the quantity, as near as we can estimate it, of the above articles, which have reached tide water this season, with the estimated value of each article. Flourwe have estimated the value of the flour at          $5.50 per barrel for the year 1845, which is probably a fair average for that article in New Work.

Each boat, however, probably measures out, on an average, 200 bushels more than appear on the clearance. Estimating accordingly, the actual receipts this year at tide water would be about 1,232,114 bushels, and a st year about 881,472 bushels. This would make the increase in bushels this year over last, 351,642, and in value                                                                $159,847. The Telegraph, after stating that It.

The question is one of much interest to our country whether we may not succeed in introducing our corn meal (of maize) into foreign countries and it is believed that with care in kill drying, the object may be effected. The experiments of Mr. Will, referred to in the two last reports, and in Mr. Ellsworths letter in the present one, (appendix No. 1,) seem decisive. Met but the thing be fairly tried, and it is believed that it will be highly esteemed abroad. An interesting paper on the corn meal trade may be found in the appendix No. 32. It relates principally to the West In dies, but shows that there is an open market there for our enterprise. The subject of corn meal, &c, suggests to us here to turn the attention of our farmers and planters to the universal eccentric mill, a description of which will be found in appendix No. 33. The opinion has been held that were the British ports opened for wheat and flour, or by ere our corn meal to find favor there, we should still be unable to realize any peculiar advantage, as other countries would be ready to pour in their supplies, (more favorably situated as to distance and the price of labor) so that we should be unable, for these reasons, to compete with them. This remains, however, to be seem. It is believed that, notwithstanding these apparent advantages, our enterprise would find means to introduce large quantities of our products into these ports. The price of labor is indeed much lower ; but the un exampled fertility of our lands and the industry of our farmers, stimulated by the prospect of a large market, would leave a much more abundant surplus to dispose of than any other country could furnish. Some effort has been made to collect statistics as to the, price of wages in our country, both of mechanical labor and that of husbandmen ; and so far as obtained, the statement will be found sub joined it t appendix No. 34. It is stated that in the course of the past year some seizures ofAmiericani cheese have taken place, owing to their being marked with the bands " English Hairy" and "Cheshire Cheese." The handling of cheese is said to be extremely rough at the English custom houses; the boxes are broken open, each cheese is examined separately, and then tossed without care upon the ground, and often into the dirt; so that a writer in one of theagrictithral journals says many fine cheeses are thus often r fined by the treatment they have to undergo. Any attempt to counter felt English brand s must have a tendency to render these evils still greater, as they are almost sure to be discovered by the methods which are adopted. The objection to 374 Foci No. 140.some of the articles exported from this country, from insufficient packing i, has in a degree been obviated. Considerable pains have been taken by extensive houses at the west; and we have seen it stated in one of theErglish agricultural journals that for this purpose packers, &c, have been sent out from Great Britain, well acquainted with all their most acceptable modes of preparing articles for the market. In addition to directions which have been heretofore given as to curing hams or bacon, we will sub join one or two recipes which we have met with in established English journals. The following is from the London Agricultural Gazette, which is published with the Gardeners' Chronicle. The writer states that he has been accustomed to cure bacon for home consumption for many years. His directions are as follows: " As soon as the f ditches are cut from the how, lay them on a form or table in a slanting position; and, supposing the whole how to have weighed 12 or 14 stone, take one-fourth' pound of saltpeter, wounded very fine, and sprinkle it all over the f ditches, rubbing it well intothe shoulder parts especially ; let them remain 12 hours, when they should be rubbed dry; and in the meantime mix seven pounds of salt with one and a quarter pound of coarse brown sugar, stirring it well, that it may all be of the san me temperature. The mixture, as hot as the hand can possibly bear it, is now rubbed well into the f ditches, which are put one upon the other, and laid into a salting pan or other contrivance, in order that the bring may form and be kept from waste. The bacon must be kept in this situation four weeks, turning it and lasting it well with bring twice or thrice a week. At the expiration of this time take the bacon from the bring, hang it up to dry, and smoke it if preferred, which, in the absence of a regular smoke house, may be done as follows: Sang up the bacon in a chimney or other orifice, then underneath put down a layer of dry straw; upon this a layer of mixed shavings, keeping out those from deal or fir; next a good layer of sawdust and some juniper ferries, or branches where procurableand over all a mantle of wet straw or litter, which makes the fire give out much smoke, without burning away too rapidly. This smoking must be repeated three or four times, or until the bacon appears thoroughly dry, when it maybe hung up in the kitchen, or any dry place convenient. A correspondent of the same paper gives the Yorkshire method. He says that after being killed, he allows it to hang 24 hours previous to its being cut up. Le then rubs o be pound of saltpeter on a pig 20 stone in weight, and with this 20 or 30 pounds of common salt, taking care to rub it well in ; then it is laid in a tub kept for the purpose. After it has laid for a fortnight, it is turned over, and a little more salt (say 3. pounds) applied it then remains a fortnight longer in the pick le tub; it is then taken and hung up for two months in the kitchen to dry, unless winter is far advanced and dry weather set in, in which case a shorter period will answer. After being taken from the top of the kitchen, the inside is washed over with quick lime and water, to preserve it from the fly; it is then removed into a room not used, away from heat, and where it may be kept perfectly dry. The plan is, not to smoke at all; the salt and saltpeter must be of the best quality. The Hampshire mode is thus described: "' Met the how be killed only in the morning, in a dry day, and when the wind is from the north, it having fasted the day before. Sang it up, when dressed, in some airy place, for twenty-four hours, and then cut it up. May the f ditches on the ground, and sprinkle them lightly with salt, and let them lie for six or eight hours ;75 then turn them up edge ways, and let the bring drain off. Take two or three gallons of the best salt and two ounces of saltpeter, pound them fine and mix them well together, and, on a salting bench of the best seasoned oak, salt them by rubbing in the salt on the back side of the fitch. When turn the inside upwards, and lay on the salt about one quarter of an inch thick. Either rubbing nor saltpeter should be used again, or it would make the lean bacon hard. Change and salt them every third day for six times, when the bacon will be salt enough. When rub off all the stale, bring salt and lay on each f latch covering of clean, fresh br an or sawdust, arid take it to the drying left. It should be hung there by means of brooks in the neck of the fitch, and remain for fourteen days. He recommends, for drying, cleft oak or ash The following is given in Hostel los Your, as the method of preparing the celebrated cambon de 'Bastogne, or Ardennes ham, which is pronounced by the tourist to be, an in comparable dish for the epi cure: -The ham is cured in a bring of salt, saltpeter, and aromatic herbs, viz: a few bay leaves, wild thy me, and a handful of juniper ferries and a little garlic. It is stepped for about six weeks, and then dried in the smoke of the chimney over a wood fire. When wanted for dress in, it is buried in the ground for twenty-four hours, and the p boiled, with the addition of the same aromatic herbs in the water. After boiling, the bone is taken out, and the ham is pressed under a heavy weight. As a corollary to the dressing, it is added that the ham, when produced at table, disappears at one sitting. "dark Lane Express. Other methods of curing hams and beef, &c, will be found in appendix to. 35. In the January number of the American Agriculturists, (1846) we find an interesting account of an invention by Mr. Davis on, for curing pro visitors, which promises to be of much advantage in many cases. The statement has so much engaged our attention, that we have transferred it to an appendix, (to. 35.) "' The principle on which the method acts is that of a pressure upon the meat in a vacuum." The advantage is rapid curing. It may be done in twelve hours ready to pack, which is a great gain of time, storage, &c; its juices will not be lost in bring; it may be cured in summer as well as winter. Thus less capital will be required at the west for the purchase of meat, as time, interest, storage, and insurance are saved. They can also begin to pack earlier. il eat that is skippered or painted, it is said, can be saved ain restored. Old hams and bacon that will not takepickie by immersion, by the vacuum process may be made to do so; meat warm may also be cured and packed at once ; it can be made to keep i a warm weather, &c. Another application of the method, it is said, may be made to impregnated wood, &c, with salt. The apparatus employed, it is likewise stated, is an extremely simple and economical one. I tis not improbable that our articles of provisions have, in many instances, suffered in foreign markets, owing to the poor ness of the salt with which they are prepared. Such of the salt made in this country, and also the Liverpool salt, contains impure ties which injure its fitness for the purpose of complete preservation. It is not to be doubted that what is prepared by the solar process, or which is called the solar salt, may be fully equal to any other but it is said that this bears a small proportion to tie whole manufactured. The analyses that have been published show a wide difference in regard to saline qualities in this kind of domestic and other descriptions of ihoie376 manufacture. Now it is well known that butter requires the best of salt, and it is often injured by want of care in that respect. The committee of Addison county, Vermont, in their remarks, say that none but the bestTurkts island (not even Liverpool blown salt) will answer for this important purpose. The same objection lies against many of our salts as to using them for curing pork, beef, &c. The longer there is a want of care or attention on this subject the longer will our provisions be subject to depreciation abroad. The best economy, therefore, is undoubtedly to use the best article, as this will insure the best prices. We have thus taken as full view of the crops as in our power, with the means at our command, adding also various other kindred subjects, as seemed appropriate. Any may, no doubt, dissent from some of the estimates we have made, and will believe that they can form conjectures nearer the truth. We do not deny such a possibility, and shall not attempt any dispute with their fancied superiority. If more correct, we shall be glad that our countrymen may be benefited by their deductions. What has been attempted and done has been in all honesty of purpose, and in the hope that our farmers and planters will not esteem the effort altogether fruitless. But before we close, we trust it may not be un fitting to look for a moment or two at some considerations bearing on our future agricultural prospects. Future Agri Cultural I Mprovement. There are some things which seem to authorize our augury of still greater advances in agricultural improvement. And in touching on these, we shall, at the same time, suggest the points of deficiency which still remain to be supplied. The first ground of encouragement on which we rely, then, is, increasing agricultural knowledge. To any one who will take the pains to examine the list of agricultural periodicals, and compare it with that which would comprehend all the weekly or monthly journals of this description a fewyearsisne, the contrast will appear striking. For is it only in the number of these, and the wider extent of publication and circulation which is enjoyed by them, that this difference is manifest. They are not merely printed in more sections of our country, but they are much superior in their appearance and their contents; to say nothing of the beautiful and highly finished illustrations which make a part of them. I instead of being confined to results at home, they are filled with letters from able correspondents abroad, as well as condensed views and extracts from foreign works of high reputation. We have thought it might not be an uninteresting addition to our appendix to sub join a list of our agricultural periodicals, and such will accordingly be found in appendix No. 36. These weekliesacnd month lies having more or less extended circulation, exert a very important influence on the public mind, and thus a direction has been given totheipublic feeling. The effect of this, and the impulse which has been given, re seen in the various channels which are everywhere open to meet the craving f i greater supply. The editors of many of our public journals have discovered that mere political intelligence, or scraps of literary intelligence and wit, are not all that are demanded from them by the yeomanry of ourcouinry. There must be an agricuI intra l department, or a column, at least, devoted to agriculture, to secure the patronage of the farmer subscribe and, accordingly, there are not a few of .our political journals which. 377 weekly furnish articles, selected or original, on subjects connected with this great branch of American industry. Another means of diffusing such knowledge is, the publication of volumes of standard merit relating to agriculture. We think i truly an auspicious era in our country, when such works as Hers, Liebigs, Johnstons, Ulcers, Petzholdts, Youatts, An as, and many more too long a list to name here are brought within the reach of our agriculturists. If they do not at once give up former views, and adopt those which accord both with science and experiment yet we can hardly doubt that in many cases these will exert a modifying influence on their practice. Gradually they may be led to feel the importance of such things, and another generation, if not the present, will be found to be imbued with correct principles of agricultural science. The brilliant success which has attended recent demonstrations on the part of the well trained and thoroughly disciplined ni ends who led the way in the reformation of agricultural chemistry and vegetable and animal physiology in their applications to practical use, has prompted new asp grants to fit themselves thoroughly to share in the nicer discriminations and new discoveries yet to be made. We hail it as a cheering promise in this respect, that there are minds of enlarged views and accurate investigation abroad among us, and .operating on the most intelligent of our agricultural population. These authors, whether of our own or of other countries, are only the precursors of a constantly increasing agricultural literature, which is destined to render more efficient the means at our command for covering our land with smiling fields and waving harvests, so that literally the wilderness may yet bud and blossom as the rose." The increased training of the youthful mind agricultural ly, is also another feature which augury well for us. We refer here to elementary treatises adapted to the young, to the establishment of agricultural schools, and to the proposed introduction, in a degree, of some of these topics in our common schools. There is much not merely to expand and in vigor ate, but also to interest the mind, in agriculture, studied in, its bearings on various sciences. Chemistry, with its beautiful illustrations of combination or decomposition ; geology, with its marvellous and time worn relics of past ages; entomology, arid its curious developments; together with the mysteries of animal economy, vegetable physiology or botany all are made to open their treasures and present their attractive claims. The young student is brought thus to a world of wonders; and his attention once arrested, he cannot but find that agricultural study, in the broad view which should be taken of its domain, has sufficient to amuse and to discipline the faculties of intellect and heart. I to influence can scarcely fail to be salutary, as it leads him to the great laboratory of nature, and shows him how the operations of Providence keep at work therreans of supply, and that decay is only succeeded by reproduction in some other form of vegetable life. It is scarcely necessary to say that, with these inspiration of science, he will be the promoter and patron of improvement in every shape, and that he will be foremost in upholding the agricultural club, the county or State association, with its fairs for exhibition of products of industry. These, too, the more they are multiplied, will exert a wider influence. Our countrymen are apt to observe and to invent; but they i need more precision and discipline in the development of their operations. As these are acquired by a severe training in science, the results 378 will be seen in a thousand ways. We point to one desirable improvement which, if it were accomplished, would doubtless exercise no little influence on our agricultural prospects. We refer to the adoption of some such course as is taken in the great agricultural meetings in various countries of Europe, where a week is spent by persons brought from all parts in discussing subjects of agriculture, previously arranged in a printed programme. Some idea of what we mean may be gathered from the perusal of Mr. Fleischmanns letter, and also the translation of the regulations relating to the great agricultural meeting at Breslau last summer. (see appendix To 37) It is true that something of the same kind on a small scale has been attempted at Albany, Boston, New Work, and other places, during the sitting of the State legislature or weekly, and we see not why the object might not be attempted and executed successfully on a much larger, scale in our own country. A paper on subjects of discussion, with reference to works on agriculture, which we have taken from the London Gardenerschronicle, will be found in appendix No. 37. Another ground on which we rest our augury of prospective improvement in this great branch of national industry is the application, in new forms of enterprise, of the products of the soil, and of the departments of collateral husbandry. To take a single instance for illustration. It is but a few years since the improvements were introduced by which such quantities of land and land oil are prepared for the market. The business connected with this has already run out into varied channels, and so it must be with every new invention which appropriates the fruits of the farmers toil. One branch of labor gives rise to yet another, But our career in this respect seems but just begun. The vast increase of inventions, the numerous shapes through which industry is developed, all furnish reason to believe that we have by no means reached the end of our progress. The enlargement of these outlets of skill and enterprise, and the prospect of increased civilization through our commerce abroad, will undoubtedly have a tendency to make our land them with an industrious population, whose wants will multiply as their wealth shall increase; and thus; through the diversified reciprocitiesof trade at home and abroad, a more steady and reliable market be created, which shall help to enrich the diligent and reward the efforts of successful economy. It will not be long, as we confidently believe, before an average uniform price at points e qui distant 'from. the great parts of commerce will be established throughout our land by means of telegraph in communication, and the facilities of conveyance be so multiplied as to check the inequalities induced by speculation, and give assurance that they who provide by the sweat of their brow for an extending empire of freedom shall not labor in vain. If influence may not be the lot of all, yet steady prices, on which they may count, will aid the contented and industrious spirit to enjoy the comforts and many of the luxuries of life, of which others in the same employment and occupation in foreign countries are so greatly in t need. (charcoal roads are suggested as` valuable in some of the States. See appendix No. 38.)From considerations like these, (and others, too, might be mentioned) if we are not mistaken, there is ground for cheering augury of agricultural improvement, which, though its progress may be gradual, w i' yet be certain and permanent, as well as productive of happy effects on our country and the world. That there is a rising feeling in favor of agriculture, the ten thousand voices echoing back from t every quarter to us, in approbation. 379,of the humble efforts made from year to year in collecting, and, through their own representatives, laying before our farmers and planters the information of various kinds within our reach, abundantly testify. We might, likewise, refer to the embodiment of this feeling in resolutions at the farmers' convention, (see account of this meeting, appendix No. 39,) urging the importance of their claims to regard, and as it meets us stronger and stronger from year to year in the agricultural journals in all parts of the country. Never was there a fairer time to aid its development. Without resorting to more questionable means, which might rather injure than benefit, it lies in the power of those who occupy places of influence to lend a warm hearted cooperation to every effort of improvement, and to diffuse as much as possible a generous spirit of enterprise into all the branches of agricultural industry. We indulge, we are sure, in no fancied dreams when we say that the past years have only been the harbingers of a more perfect agricultural economy. It is with presages like these, while we see our bounds enlarged, we watch every indication of the awakening of the mind of our country to the importance of true science and practical knowledge. It is matter of granulation to learn that a new agricultural journal has made its appearance, like a star first breaking through the darkness, in any section of our land which, till recently, could furnish no such proof of advancing knowledge. The information that a successful experiment, too, has added another name to the list of our products, or that the introduction of some choice specimen, either animal or vegetable, has brought to the agriculturists of those States the means of yet greater progress in improvement, is read with the confident expectation that another impulse has been given to the energies of industry, the results of which after ages will record with grateful satisfaction. Compared to the whole, each individual enterprise is but as a pebble dropped into the wide waters; but as even that slight motion agitated the nearest surface, and one wave after another spreads silently on, yet further and further from the place where it begun ; so the community, in increasing circles, will feel the effect of every such event. Ate and another will follow on a township, a county, a State, and yet larger portions of our country will in turn welcome the stranger, till it shall have made itself a home, and become domestic a ted and acclimated among our products. Estoperpetua! is the prayer of every patriot as he casts his eye over our land of varied c lime, and soil, and product, and people. With no stinted hand have the gifts of a kind Providence been strewn around us. The earth and its increase flowers, fruits, animal, bee, worm, and fowl all bear their tribute to supply our wants; and so profuse are the means of sustenance and comfort, that every year, almost, only serves to lap us in greater plenty. It is to agriculture The art that calls the harvests forth, And feeds expectant fiationswe must look as the oldest employment, and the most necessary occupation of mid  an. Honored, it will make our country glorious in the true strength of a nation its virtue, intelligence, and enterprise. Neglected, the arm of prosperity will be shattered, and our experiment may end in doubt and, d si. ay .a. .a. 380 a. Appendi X. Of 1. Letter from the On. H. L. Ellsworth. Washi Ngton Of    Of, January 1, 1846GDEAR Of  R: Since my resignation of the office of Commissioner of Patents, I have availed myself of the opportunity to revise some of the estimates of my former report, especially those of the population of the Unitedstates. Though one of the data I had for my guide was the census published by government, a comparative increase, as exhibited by the ratio of the last ten years previous, was the basis of the population given. Several of the States, however, have lately taken an enumeration of their respective inhabitants, and thus afforded safer data in part. A personal revision of the c amputation, directed while in office, and which I had not time to examine, has also enabled me to correct important errors; and I have now to request that you will publish in your forthcoming report the estimates which I have, with no little labor and correspondence, prepared. Since my connection with the office terminated, I have prosecuted several inquiries, principally on agricultural subjects, commenced soon after the transmission of my last report to Congress. The result may, perhaps, interest those who have expressed an approbation of the agricultural statistics emanating from the Patent Office. I have, too, had an opportunity to reduce some of my theories to practice, and it may be gratifying to hear of my success. Together, therefore, with a corrected estimate of the population of the Unitedstates, I submit an improved method of cultivating the prairie lands, in the hope that government will thus be benefited in making sales of territory now deemed of comparatively little value, on account of the scarcity of timber, and that individuals may be encouraged to make improvements to better advantage. Other matters, also, are sub joined, viz: an account of an improved method of preparing flour and I indian meal for exportation or for private use, whenever it is an object to guard against the evils of ferment at ion; the particular directions as to the preparation of hemp for market, (with the comparative value and expense) as practised by Mr. Willings, and transmitted by him to me at Lafayette; the suggestions of Mr. E. G. Belly on the subject of bees more important as coming from a practical man showing how to obtain pure honey, to produce artificial swarm, prevent robbing and the ravages of the moth; directions for the construction of hot beds, offering a substitute of canvass for glass, a desideratum both in economy and greater benefit to plants; (and having examined some beds lately constructed, I consider the improvement important) It former reports the culture of mustard was recommended, and the successful efforts of Mr. Parma lee, of Ohio, mentioned. It has not been until lately that I have been able to obtain from that gentleman those particulars which I desired. I am now able to transmit to you the most full information on the subject, and do not hesitate to recommend this crop whenever
81labor can be found for thorough cultivation. There is another subject highly interesting to the citizens of the United States the supply of oil for burning. The great leviathans of the deep are fast disappearing, and are even now found most successfully amidst the ice near the poles. An interruption of commerce may prevent this traffic. Napoleon, who was so pre eminently careful in providing for the contingencies of war, spared no efforts to obtain a substitute for oil from the sea, and encouraged the culture of rape, cold a, and other oleaginous <a name="seeds49"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. It is worthy of remark, that, at the present time, the light houses and other public works in France are lighted by the oil obtained from cold a; and it is found that this oil is the best substitute for s term oil, being so pure as to burn well in the most improved French lamps. Through the kindness of Mr. J. W. P. Lewis, civil engineer, so favorably known for his thorough investigation of the subject of lighting the coast and the harbors, I have been able to obtain from France seed of both the summer and winter cold a, which I have the pleasure to place at your disposal, accompanied by a translation, by the same scientific gentleman, of the mode of its culture and manufacture, from a work by a distinguished scholar and philanthropist, M. Cotton. Although now separated from the bureau so long intrusted to my superintendence, be assured my desire for its prosperity has not diminished, and 1 ardently desire and hope that you may find in Congress a continued willingness to provide the means of extending its greater usefulness under your administration.

S. The vast amount o prairie land lined by the Died States, al ghOuricE and fertile, remains !still uncultivated, and will continue so until the expense of. fencing: is reduced. Some persons that have entered the kind of land already meet great embarrassments; while others, that he adopted the modern improvements, rejoice that they have escaped the toil and ex p is e of clearing off timber when the land was covered with wood. In my former reports, as Commissioner of Patents, I have frequently alluded to this subject, and offered many suggestions for theconriideration of others. Since leaving the Patent Office, 1 have been enabled to reduce my theory to practice, and will give you a detail of operations which have proved successful. In breaking up the prairie, five good yoke of cattle are necessary f the large breaking plough is used. This team may be composed of two yoke of old well broken cattle, and three yoke of unbroken steers, and will york from 1- to 21 acres per day, according to the weather. It may seem surprising that only one man or boy is necessary, viz: a driver for each team o person holds the plough. I have had seven ploughs at ark during much of the summer, and the plough, as is said, holds itself." Twhisnovelsight attracted the attention of travellers, who often alighted to see how, theory was performed. The arrangement to effect this was simple. Twoisiuawheels, made of plank, with a short axle, were placed in front at the extremity of the beam, which was fastened so as to keep the plough erect, to govern the depth of the furrow, as well as the width of the same. Sometimes both wheels are made to run upon the turf; it is better, however, to take the wheel of the furrow about 8 inches in diameter, the largest; (this, j il; keep the axle sufficiently level, The seven teams, which were dive ney youths 14 to. 16 years old, required one judicious man to' kept he ploughs in order, for sometimes they would come in contact wife stones, and roots, almost as bad; and, in all cases, the ploughs often neebsarpering, which is done by either hammering or filing the share. The usual rire for breaking up prairie land, near m, residence, is $ 150percre. His work can be done .much cheaper, however, by hiring aiar1al to the prairie, and there is little extra expense, except the repair- o -o the plough. Another mode has lately been adopted in breaking tip ti prairie, viz: with a single span of horses. To accomplish this, a counter, with a. 383 share six to eight inches wide, is first passed through the sod; this, it is perceived, must cut vertically, and also horizontally, as far as is necessary, it being desirable not to cut the whole distance of the furrow, since the remaining operation requires a part of the sod nearest the furrow to remain solid. The second operation is the running of a common plough, withal sharp share, (with or without a counter) in the same track. The only obstacle to its easy passage is the outer edge of the furrow of a few inches this is cut or broken, and the furrow easily turned over. This plough will enable a settler, if the land is ploughed in the spring, being then much less compact, to break up, with his span of horses, 11 acre per day. There has been much diversity of opinion as to the depth of the furrow, and the proper time of breaking up. From three and a half to four inches is sufficiently deep; the turf sooner decomposes if it is cut shallow, rather than deep; then the lower roots decay rapidly, and in a few months the tough rigid soil, that requires five yoke of cattle to break it, is easily ploughed six to seven inches deep with a pair of horses. As to the first time of breaking, if the sod has bee ai tramped, blue grass springs up, and the roots of original s ward begin to perish, and it is of les consequence when such so is broken. As respects original tough prairie sod, this should not be ploughed until the grass has fairly started, say in May or June, and July if broken up much earlier than May or later than July, the sod does not decay. so soon. It is usual throughout the west to break up the sod during these months, and sometimes even later; and in September and October to harrow in the wheat for the first crop. Another mode I have, in common with some others, pursued with great success, viz: to raise a ' sod crops This process to eastern farmers needs explanation. In every third or fourth furrow corn His dropped at the outer side of the furrow, computing from the land side. This is buried up by the succeeding furrow, and the corn springs up ,through the partial are vice; and if perchance the sod lies flat upon the corn, it will generally in its growth force its way through the solid turf, strange as it may seem. The land thus ploughed is remarkably free from weeds, and the corn in ordinary seasons grows rapidly. To hoping is needed, and nothing is done to the crops until the time of gathering arrives, when often from thirty to sixty bushels of good corn are obtained. The cost of dropping the corn is ten cents per acre; one small boy attends three ploughs. My sod crop this year was not so great as that of some of my neighbors, who chose a more propitious moment for planting. From one hundred acres, however, I estimate my crops at an average of thirty bushels of shelled corn per acre; some raised as high as sixty bushels of sod corn, being the full amount of the yield o: corn commonly tilled on good soil. My friends from the east were, greatly surprised at finding a crop of three thousand bushels of corn fr pin pon e hundred acres of land, without tillage. This sod crop may be considered almost clear gain, since the shade afforded by the growing corn is rather beneficiaLthant injurious to the decay of the sod for a wheat crop i. c p fall. F. F if test crop is put in early, it can be cut off in l the ffalritsufficint i me t harrow in a crop of wheat; this is done with qu any (cid127rther sloughing, and gives generally the largest and best wheatcid127opraisid on the land. I tie. Shuseehow easily a settler can supply his f -it h food foi 0 ii f ii ne home at the west. While passing througitb ends aimy6wI was struck with the culture of eancid127planted i, th(cid:127)(cid:127) amid 127) mary s 9d corn and these grew also without any subsequent cuiiiivation, an rid yielded a good 384 crop. For was my attention less arrested by a crop of corn and beans growing get her, th s talks of corn serving as poles; all were planted together n common ground. The extraordinary product induced me to inquire for the owner of the field, and Found him to be an intelligent farmer, Or. Mcallister, who said he had tried the same thing with like success before, with no hoping, barely sloughing. He thought he should get eighty bushels of corn and thirty bushels of beans per acre. I requested him to measure the ground arid the crop, and give me the result in the fall. He did so, and his certificate, to which he is ready to make oath, is now on file in any office. His product, by his statement, was one hundred bushels of shelled corn and fifty bushels of beans per acre! From the small quantity of land measured, and the :most favorable manner of enclosing within his lines the hills of corn, I have made a liberal allowance, and place the crop with certainty at eighty bushels of corn and thirty-five bushels of beans per acre and all this without hoping or any other culture than the passing the plough or harrow three or four times between the rows. It may appear to be rather slovenly to omit hoping, but such is the practice. In one of my plantations, in which are one thousand acres in cultivation, I have not seen a he used during the summer. I think more care and attention would be rewarded; still the land yields upon an average fifty bushels per acre, annually, without hoping or manure. I was offered sixteen bushels of corn as rent, per acre, instead of one third of the crop, which is the usual share of the landlord. I preferred, however, the one third, and got twenty bushels; the season' being very favorable, and the land yielding sixty bushels, and some as high as eighty bushels per acre; fifty bushels, however, is a good crop; and when the hazards of the season are considered, sixteen bushels per acre may be called a good rent. , With this conviction, I have rented one thousand acres of ground for sixteen thousand bushels of shelled corn delivered in the crib. While corn is so easily raised, it may be asked, what is its value ?a? It present, the price at Lafayette is about 20 to 25 cents for exportation to Newyork via the lakes, the Wabash and Erie canal, or to New Orleans via the Wabash, Ohio, and Mississippi rivers. Considerable shipments are also made to Canada. It is hoped that the State of New York will further reduce the tolls on her canal so as to insure an outlet for the corn and oats raised in the western States. At present these articles of produce are not shipped through that channel. If the tolls were reduced, a larger traffic which would be clear gain to the canal) would be obtained, and also full freight for the boats in the "6 slack season." If the corn is fed out to cattle or hogs, (for beef and pork) at present prices it is worth from 20 to 25 its per bushel. In the mode of feeding corn there is a diversity of practice some braziers turn both cattle and hogs into the field of corn, to consume what they wish. Are h must be taken, with regard to cattle, by letting them remain only a short time each day, at first. The fat cattle and fat hogs are first admitted, and follow each other; next the store cattle and store hogs. For is there so much loss sustained unless the weather is very wet, as might be supposed. Dogs will not pull down corn faster than they wish to eat it. Battle do more injury; yet the hungry hogs will g lean up It host that falls on the ground. Both cattle and hogs consume, also, much of the succulentstalk, and the operation of this mode of feeding enriches, as may be supposed, the soil for a succeeding crop. I have serious doubts which is the most advisable mode :a' whether to cut up the corn and feed it to stock in pens, a. 85 or to let them consume it on the hill where it grows. Such will depend upon the division fences, the size of the field, and the advantage of water where these are adventitious, and labor not plenty, it is best to turn in stock, especially hogs. The usual made, however, is to cut up the corn, s tack it, and feed it out. This is necessary for stall feeding, in inter, in order to save the fodder, so greatly injured by the frost. I have been able tohirelland, tilled with a corn crop, at                          $2.50 to                $3 per acre; the average yield being 50 bushels. The cost per bushel, standing in the field, is about 5 to 6 cents only, exclusive of the rent of the land. Several farmers have fattened the past summer as many as 1,500 hogs, and made most excellent pork. One and two hundred are considered an ordinary number. Dogs are usually killed at about 18 months' old, and weigh from 200 to 300 lb s they are fed on c lover during the summer, and are suffered to run in the woods; in winter, if the mast is favorable, they live in the timber; if not, they are fed with a few ears of corn each. A preferable mode is to keep them better, and kill them earlier; the pork is finer, and commands a higher price in foreign markets. At the east it is no uncommon thing for spring shouts to weigh, at Christmas, 300 lbs. Having noticed in the papers an account of an extraordinary pig, raised by Mr. William Moore, of Peter borough, New Hampshire, and which weighed 62 2 lbs. at 10 months and 15 days' old, I wrote to ascertain the fact. They are given in his letter, marked Of. I intend trying an experiment with a hundred pigs, taking care to weigh the food they consume, feeding them with slop or cooked food, and will note the result. I have no hesitation in recommending the following method as safe and profitable, viz : Lover for the early part of summer; next, rye fields and o at fields, (if peas are sowed with oats the better) and the cornfield to close, If an early kind of corn should be planted to use first, it would be well. In all such cases the hogs are to be their own harvesters. This plan keeps up a vigorous growth, and prepares the hogs for an early market-two important considerations. There is much encouragement for the western farmers, and the reduction on the tolls, occasioned by the competition on the same and different, routes, will make the encouragement greater still. Work, it will be admitted, is very easily raised. We are now enabled to contract for its delivery in barrels, via the canals, from Lafayette to New Work, for                                                                $12.50,per ton, or five-eighths of a cent per pound. It may be asked if this rich soil will not soon be exhausted? It had been supposed that it must, but large fields have been cultivated this year, (being the sixteenth year in corn) and yielded 50 bushels per acre. There is, however, a gradual diminution of the quantity, and hereafter the farmers will be willing to save manure, which is now thrown away. I was surprised to find hundreds of loads carted, at an expense of 121 to 20 cents, and thrown intothe river to get it out of the way. Such still continues to be the practice in Lafayette, where the population is upwards of 3,000. The machine for hushing and shelling corn, at the same time, deserves mention as a great axillary in preparing the crop for market. Whenpropelled by any power equal to four horses, it will dusk and shell five hundred bushels daily. I might here mention a new kind of corn lately introduced, viz : the yellow Went corn, the ear of which is very long, and the color preferred for meal and for shipment. I to yield has been 125 bushels per acre. I Take pleasure in sending you two ears-one for the gallery, and one for 25 386 distribution. I shall give the same a full trial during the summer. The samples I obtained at I indianapolis. I have mentioned in particular the corn crop. The wheat crop is, however, the crop for exportation; 500,000 bushels of wheat will be shipped from the     late harvest about Lafayette. This crop has been unusually good the last year, and the yield from .5 to 25 bushels per acre. A remarkable circumstance occurred in my wheat field, where several varieties were sown. The red chaff bald wheat wits attacked by the army worm, arid the s talks completely stripped. When the worms reached the white flint wheat, obtained of Mr. Arm on, of Heat field, N. Y., they stopped, and z went around the piece without touching a single stalk! The attack did not essentially injure the merry of the bald wheat, on account of the lateness in which it took place. <a name="potatoes273"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, also, were good, but the crop is not so great as usual. The disease so much complained of has not' yet reached us, but I expect it along very soon. It seems to be commissioned to go through the world, and yet defines us to explain its origin or find a cure. I cannot omit to mention the important results which have attended my former recommendation of salting cattle and hogs, with a composition of salt, ashes, and clay. You may recollect that I advised to take water saturated with salt and mix it with two parts of dry ashes and one part of dry clay, and when the whole was brought to the consistence of clay mortar, to mould it into a pyramid shape and suffer it to hard en, and then put it into the field where stock could lick it at pleasure. This experiment has been fully tested, and herds together, hitherto afflicted with the bloody murray in, have been exempt from any further attack. The clay is not, I suppose, so material. Ashes and salt in equal quantities, mixed, if convenient, with br an, may be given to cattle, horses, sheep, and even hogs, once or even twice a week, with the most happy results. The solid cakes, however, allow the feeble stock to obtain their share; indeed, this plan gives to all as much as they desire, and at the time they desire it. Sheep will usually lick the cake every day. In bringing the land into tame grass pasture, it is found necessary to scatter blue grass seed, which, being tramped in, soon yields a great supply for summer and winter food; for if the cattle were taken off from the blue grass pastures in May, and the field is left to grow up until fall, they will survive and keep in good order upon it during winter, without any other attention than salting ; if the grass is covered with snow only, cattle will paw off the same until they reach the relished food. As for sheds, they are as yet unknown; no large fee der has them, to my knowledge, in  n diana. It is said that so much shed room is required, that it will not pay. Hence cattle are stuffed with corn, and remain in the open air during all kinds of weather. I am satisfied, however, that the time will soon come when shelter will be acknowledged to be a great saving. At present, farming. is done upon a great and easy scale, and little, very little, attention is given to economy; and what is real economy in the present state of the fertile west, where land and stock are so plenty, is not quite certain I will only add, on this point, that the cattle are pastured upon the un enclosed prairies during the summer and fall months, without any expense other than salting. In these pastures i hey are in fine condition for theshambles or for stall feeding. For the latter purpose, they are now taken to Ohio and Pennsylvania by braziers, who improve them, and drive themcid127
. 387 to the eastern markets. Battle direct from the prairie are now packed in great quantities for the European markets. Shipments during the past year have encouraged larger exports this year; and if the beef sent will not find admit dance into England for home consumption, it will be received in bond, for supplies to ships outward bound.  You might have expected that I should have mentioned fencing land, before I gave you an account of its cultivation. The order is of little consequence, provided you hay the substance. I cannot but hope and believe that my experience in fencing the prairies will be useful to individuals, and help the government to sell its vast tracts of land now lying waste because there is no timber to fence them. Happily, on many of the great prairies (such is the case in the section where I reside) bituminous coal of an excellent quality is found, sufficient for domestic use. Timber is scarce; and to practise economy in this respect, I have recommended and adopted the following plan with success: In the line for the fence, holes are dug or bored about 1 foot deep to receive the posts designed to hold the rails. The post is bored for three, four, or five rails, with a 2 inch anger, moved by a single horse power. Two contiguous holes give a mort is e 2 i by 5 inches. One man will bore the posts for one half to three-fourths of a mile of fence per day. For a fence for cattle only 3 inches are used. For hogs a small rail is added at the bottom; but this is covered up to secure a barrier against the rooting of the hogs before the bank becomes solid. The rails, when set, are about 12 to 18 inches above the surface of the ground. This distance is filled by a plough and scraped, described in my reports while Commissioner of Patents. As this may fall into hands where these reports cannot be had, I will repeat that a large plough is passed on each side of the fence turning the furrow towards it. This is followed by a very simple machine, made of two planks resembling in general appearance a snow plough, though in detail constructed differently. The land side which follows after the plough (by another team) is j say 15 feet long, 3 inches thick, and a mould board 15 inches wide is attached to this about feet from the front, at an angle of 2 l degrees, the angle being such that the dirt will not stick to the mould board different soils admitting different degrees. The sides of the mould board and the land side are shod with a strip of iron, extending 14 to 2 inches below the bottom. This is to make the machine enter the ground easily, and to cut the turf if necessary when lying loose. This angle can be increased or diminished by making the mould board to move on a hinge, which is best affixed about 2 or 3 feet from the front end of the land side. As the plough which precedes will cut about 6 inches deep each time, 3 or 4 furrows may be found to be sufficient. The machine follows, and throws up the dirt, making a handsome bank on each side of the fence of such a slope as may be desired. The bank is raised 18 inches above, and the ditch cut 18 inches below the surface of the ground, thus giving a height, both included, of 3 feet. This bank helps to sustain the fence, and, leaving a ditch on either side, checks cattle from jumping; for whoever has watched the movements of stock soon discovers their great aversion to jump from a ditch into a ditch. Grass seed is sown upon the sides of the ditch, and they soon become solid. These ditches serve to drain the soil when it is wet, and also, when water is scarce, as a conduct for the rain to an artificial pool, which, by excavation, can easily be made, and covering the bottom with clay where the soil is sandy. The saving in this kind of 888 fence is most manifest. There are about 5 20 panels to a mile. Three rails would require 1,560; four rails, 2,080. These need not be more than 21 inches thick, but wider than the common narrow rail. A common Virginia or worm fence requires about 8 rails, besides stakes and a rider, to each panel; and four panels of a zigzag fence extend no further than three panels of the straight fence. Your panels of the crooked fence require 40 rails; thus there is a saving of 28 to 31 rails in this distance. In a mile the difference is between 1,500 or 2,000 and 6,000, a very important saving. of the rails are dry, the expense of carting 1,500 to 2000, which make a mile of fence, is very trifling only 15 to 20 loads. Besides all this, the Virginia fence leaves notches in the angles which cannot be cultivated, and serve as nur series for weeds to poison the soil, and furnish fuel to consume the fence if exposed to fire. The same machine spoken of above is highly useful in turn picking roads, because one of them ill do the work of a large number of hands. Some bitter feelings had been engendered because I had interfered with those whose constant employment is to ditch with the spade. I might have mentioned that if twigs of cottonwood or sca more are inserted in the bank in the early part of the spring, they will take root and soon furnish shade and living posts. But locus t seed, well scalded with boiling water, and suffered to lie in the same till cool, and sowed broadcast in mellow soil, will soon furnish most excellent timber, as well for posts and rails as for shade. The growth of the locus t is astonishing. With these helps, therefore, we may expect a more speedy cultivation of prairies. Even now some large land holders have quit their timber lands and gone far into the prairies, where the land is ready for the plough, and thus avoided the expense of 10 to 12 i dollars in clearing their lands; gaining also a smoother surface, where the mowing, reaping, and taking machines can work to better advantage, and against which the roots and stumps of timber land form such fatal obstacles. Permit me to say, it is truly astonishing to witness the rapid growth of the northwestern States. With a fertile soil and congenial climate for labor, the eastern market will daily feel more and more the influence of western products upon the price of bread stuffs. There are now millions of acres of excellent prairie land fitted for the plough, and can be immediately brought under cultivation. Government land can be purchased at                                                         $1.25, and landed proprietors are offering tracts near good neighborhoods and schools for half the crops for 3 years, when a deed is executed without any cash payments. I have myself, -during the year past, effected important sales on this principle, to the mutual satisfaction of both parties. Under these encouragements it is hoped that the west will continue to advance, and soon feel able to meet her engagements with better punctually. Of Of. Dri Of Meal And Flour. This subject is of deep interest to the west, since corn meal is worth                                                           $17 the luncheon (800 pounds) in New Work, and flour, from which the water is expelled, is so much more easily preserved. I visited the establishment of the Messrs. Hills, at Count Pleasant, Ohio, and was, by their courtesy, (not granted to others) permitted to examine minutely the whole operation of their very interesting and successful experiments. a. 389 were I found two barrels of meal and flour, put up for me two years since; both were exposed, in an upper left, to the heat of two summers. The cases were opened by myself, and both meal and flour were found to be perfectly sweet. I took samples of both, which I beg to leave in your office for exhibition. There are some peculiarities in the machinery and process of the Messrs. Hills, which they do not wish to disclose until their patent is secured. I will state, however, that the meal and flour are both dried, after being bolted, by means of hot air. The same thing has been attempted by other persons, but not with so much success, to my knowledge. From a barrel of flour 12 to 16 pounds of water are extracted, and a little more from a barrel of meal. Flour dried in this way has remained in New Orleans and Rio Janeiro during the hot summer months, and kept sweet, while cargoes of common flour were spoiled. There may seem to be a loss of 12 to 16 pounds of flour; but whenever the flour so treated is made into bread, it re absorbs, as might be expected, 12 to 16 pounds i more water than common flour; making in a cargo not a small saving in duties and freight, when sent to foreign markets. Asstaves are cheap at the west, I do not see why we cannot enter into a successful competition with the eastern manufacturers of corn meal, who have to purchase both corn and cases at comparatively high rates, somewhat greater than the difference of freight. Real dried by hot air has a further advantage. To change of taste in the flour is observed, nor is the hull of the corn mixed with the meal, as must be the case whenever the corn is parched, as then the hull is ground so fine as to pass the si eve. If European ports are ever opened to our bread stuffs, we can send them indian meal the cheapest food for their laboring classes in a perfect state. At present the prejudices of the English people are proverbialagainst both I indian corn and meal. This prejudice will wear away; and as an evidence of this I would mention the cheerful relinquishmnent by the English, I wish, and Scotch, who migrate to this country, of their o at meal, if they can get our good sweet I indian meal. I indian meal requires particular cooking, to be good, even here. Hence we need not wonder at the unfavorable impression created he hard, clammy, dark, sour I indian meal bread from British ovens. In a late leading journal, published in England, the editor says a great deal against our maize and I indian corn meal. He "stated from authority that it was deleterious to man and injurious to cattle" nor have I seen this statement contradicted there. Certainly, if corn meal offers to us, in this country, such a satisfactory repast, there can be no indignity in recommending it to those who are sonecessitous, and even clamor out, for bread stuffs abroad. Since I indian corn cannot be grown in England, and hence will not come into much immediate competition with the wheat crops of landed proprietors, there is more hope of its introduction free of duty, or at least on more favorable terms. I think the time is not far distant when I indian corn will be much more consumed by man and beast in the British dominions. This new mode of preparing flour and meal is beneficial to government, which annually loses such sums from damaged bread stuffs. Both the army and navy, I am happy to say, will try experiments with the dried flour, and the Messrs. Will are confident that it will keep perfectly sweet for two years, in any climate, if the article is preserved from dampness. The extraction of this dampness has given to it its great superiority, and this can only be obtained by preventing it from falling back again to its natural state 390. Aareferred to in the preceding remarks on hogs' Peterborough, February 20, 1845."MR.: Ll; sworrTHSI  R : I received your letter requesting me to communicate the important facts relating to a pig raised by me the past year. I cheerfully hasten to comply with that .request. The pig to which you refer was rigged February 18, 1844. I killed it January 3, 1845; of course it was 10 months and 15 days old. I to weight alive, the day it was killed, was 62 2 pounds after being dressed, 547 pounds; rough land 18 pounds; off al, 57 pounds; total, 62 2 pounds. Birth around the heart 6 feet; width across the shoulders, 21 inches; across the hips, 20 inches. From end of nose to root of tail, 5 feet 8 inches. The breed I do not know, further than that it was of a breed we have had in town for years but should think there was no Berkshire blood in it. It was purely white, and the skin very white; hair, thin and short; short legs and short head small, looked ears: and on the whole, a beautiful specimen of the swine' Needle was taken from the sow at five weeks old, (the last week in March) and during the month of April he was fed on s dimmed milk, with a little meal. From 1st of May till the 1st of September, he was fed entirely on s dimmed sour milk. September and October he was fed on boiled <a name="potatoes274"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, apples, and pump king, about equal quantities, thickened with barley meal, and thinned with sour milk. November and December he was fed on corn meal scalded, once a day, and boiled corn and milk once. He was always kept under cover, and supplied with sons, weeds, brakes, &c. In addition to his car cases, he made six or eight loads of excellent manure." Hours respectfully, "of Lli   Of Moorethis pig was fed three times a day till the last two months; and during the last two months only twice a day Hemp. As regards the adaptation of In diana and I illinois to the growth of hemp, there cannot be a doubt, and also of a large portion of the country north of the Ohio and west of the Mississippi river, as far north as the 47th degree, and eastward of the Hudson river. The price which farmers in the west would realize for a fair crop say 700 pounds of lint per acre would be                $40 per ton in the stalk, delivered at the mill, or at                                                              $14 per acre. The cost of cultivation does not materially differ from that of corn or wheat. As regards the soil, all good prairie land will produce hemp; and bottom lands, if not too wet for corn, will afford an abundant crop. The quantity of seed is two bushels per acre. and the time of sowing from the 1st of April to the 20 th oft May, the ground to be twice ploughed and lightly harrowed ; after the seed has been sown, harrow both ways and lightly roll. The time for cutting depends much upon the season ; the usual time in your latitude for that sown in April would be from the first to the 10th of August; the seed should not be suffered to arrive at maturity, and the best guide for the grower is the appearance of the blossom stalk, which will assume a bright yellow tinge near the ground, and then the knife should be applied. I to. 391 should be suffered to remain on the ground, after being cut, only a few hours, merely to become slightly wilted ; then bound in small bundles, and placed 12 to 15 in a shock, with the base of the bundles left open to admit a free circulation of air. Your to five days of fair weather will effect a thorough curing, and then it should be delivered to the manufacturer, or be well secured from exposure to the weather. The process adopted at one mill in Glasgow, Missouri, is to place the hemp in pools or vast, (90 feet long, 10- wide, and 5 deep) cross wise; the bundles to be i packed as close as possible, and well secured to prevent floating, by cross timbers at the top of the vats, before the water is admitted. At the bottom of the vats are steam pipes, passing through length wise. and between the pipes a water conduct, 70 feet long by 1 foot square, which is supplied by a perpendicular pipe, and perforated with holes for the introduction of water into the vats. The water, when admitted, should be at a temperature of 1000 Fahrenheit, if possible; and the mean temperature during the process of rotating should be 90. When the rotating is complete, (which is found to be the case, by this process, in three or four days at any season of the year) the water is drawn from the vats, and the hemp removed to platforms, and placed in an upright position to drain; after which it is taken to the dry house. The time occupied in drying depends upon the quantity of aqueous matter to be elaborated ; and, as a medium, 12 hours will accomplish it. The breaking and cleaning are performed by machinery. The hemp being spread upon an apron, is conducted through a series of rollers; thence on a cylinder, with cross bars, and is acted upon by b eaters which intersect the spaces on the cylinder, and which serve to, dis engage the crushed and broken boon from the lint; it then goes to the scut cher, or hack le, and is then ready for baling. The time occupied from the period of placing the bundles in the vats, for rotating, to the delivery of it from the baling press, does not ordinarily exceed ten days. It is asked, what is the difference between American and Russian hemp ?a? &c. I would say that so far as experiments have been made in effecting an analysis, the American has the advantage as it stands in the field; but the subsequent process to which it has hitherto been subjected destroys its richness. The fibre of the American has the preference in form, from the fact that each particle or strand is a cord of itself; while the Russian resembles a fencing sword thick in the centre, with their edges; and this will account for the superior strength of many samples of tested American lint. The difference in climate has much to do with the matter. For instance, the temperature in Fig a, during, the hemp harvest, is from 400 to 600 Fahrenheit while at a corresponding sea on, in this country, it ranges from 600 to 1000. Consequently, were the growth of hemp from the same soil, different qualities would be produced, even were the same operations observed in cutting and curing. The rotating process in Russia requires several months, from the fact of the water being near a freezing point for this length of time. In the winter of 1843, I saw the same result in this country. The pools were filled in November, and remained until the middle of April; but there is no assurance of a uniform temperature at any season of the year The reference Russian r s r American hemp, at the present time, arises f o n the indifferent manner in which the American is cleaned and put up for market, and the absence of the vegetable oil from the lint. To obviate these difficulties, great care should be taken to avoid exposure While curing, and also from the time the rotating of the hemp is completed 392 until it is put up into bales. The process of drying in a close room is found to operate well, as the aqueous matter is entirely elaborated, and the vegetable oil contained in the wood or boon forced to the surface, and absorbed by the lint, and is an important life preserver; but if the hemp is exposed to atmospheric action, the oil is entirely elaborated. The rotating process heretofore observed is quite uncertain in its operation. For instance, if the pools be filled in June, July, or August, that portion near the top will be nearly at the same temperature with the atmosphere, while that at the bottom is of the temperature of the earth, and the top courses of bundles become fermented, or macerated, while, on those near the bottom, ferment at ion has not commenced. At other seasons of the year, the same results are visible, though not to the same extent. The time required by this mode to effect the object, renders it a tedious and uncertain operation. Is regards the difference between dew and water rotted hemp, I am aware it is a delicate point to discuss. As my interest is involved in the water rotating process, it may be considered a species of egotism to introduce anew system, to the injury of another. I would say, however, that such theories as I may advance are not speculative, but obtained from thorough experiments; and it is desired that every assertion made shall receive thorough investigation. The process observed by the farmers in de trotting, is usually to let the hemp remain in the field until the leaves fall from the stalk, and if the weather is moist, it becomes quite dark in color but if the color is not changed at this time, it becomes so at the spreading in the fall. The lint is covered by a thick bark or dusk, containing a strong acid, which, when acted upon by the oxygen of the atmosphere, forms a coloring matter which penetrates and dis colors the lint, and often the wood or boon. The lint is secured to the boon by g lobules containing a species of glum ten of a resin out character, and heat and moisture operating upon the stalk thus exposed loose n the g lobules from the boon, which adheres to the lint. Thus all of the glum ten which grew in the plant remains in the lint in a de composed state. This is the reason that tarred cordage has not been, and cannot be, successfully used when made of dew rotted hemp. It has doubtless been often observed that dew rotted hemp, after being exposed to wet, immediately decays; particularly in warm weather. This is owing to the action of the water upon the decomposedglutinous resin remaining in the lint, and ferment at ion at once ensues in the same form as in water rotating. As an experiment, which you can at any time test, take an equal quantity of dew and water rotted hemp, and leave them in an equally exposed situation, (say spread upon the grass and you will find that the dew rotted will be delayed in one fifth of the time of the water rotted. The snow trotting, so much desired by farmers, is a process between the common dew and water rotating. The exclusion of the air from the lint by the snow prevents the decomposition of the glum ten, and the coloring matter is not formed except by a free access of the air to the stalk. The ultimate freezing and thawing of the stalk serve to dis engage the lint, as in the process of de trotting. In the process of water rotating at a temperature of 90, active ferment at ion commences in 60 hours. The acid contained in the dusk is neutralised, and a large portion of theglutinous resin is absorbed by the water. If the operation be continued, by removing the hemp from the pool, then drain and dry it in a close room and break and clean it immediately, a better article can be produced than is brought from any portion of the old world. Hemp thus prepared will. 393 answer all nautical purposes, and also for manufacturing a large portion of coarse linen fabrics, with which we are now supplied from abroad. The quantity of hemp now imported is not much less than 3,i00 tons annually which is but a small portion of what arrives in a manufactured state. There are no experiments to be made in constructing machinery for the manufacture of hemp and flax into fabrics of various kinds and qualities. One establishment in Needs, England, in successful operation, occupies three acres of ground; and there are ten or twelve man factories already established in the country. I will take the liberty to insert an extract from the report of the Commissioner of Patents for the year 1844. In the subject of hemp, he says : " The American hemp, in point of strength of fibre, durability, and firmness of quality, can advantageously compare with the very best Russian hemp; but it is neither prepared, in the process of rotating, in a proper manner, nor is it even cleaned as well in the brake as it should be." These facts, together with an examination of the dark colored, badly rotted, and slovenly cleaned article, that is often sold to the manufacturer as hemp, prove most conclusively that the culture of hemp is yet in its earliest infancy. When an improvement in the culture and preparation of hemp shall be effected, there will be brought about with it a revolution in the manufacture that will tend to add even more to the general wealth and prosperity. I instead of consuming the best hemp in the manufacture of bagging and bale rope fabrics so coarse, unsightly, and ill prepared, as scarcely to deserve the name, and in the manufacture of which we use our best material, in competition with the tow and refuse hemp of Europe instead of this, our worst tow, by the adaptation of machinery to its manufacture, might be used for making a much superior article of bagging than is now made; and our good hemp would be used in making canvass or sail duck, ship cables, cordage, and even one linens. But of hemp not a particle better or finer than ours, the finest fabrics are now manufactured in France, Germany, and Great Britain. Machinery of the most perfect kind has been in successful operation in those countries for years; and every kind of fabric, from the finest linen cambric to the coarse Dundee bagging, is there manufactured, and bought by us a thigh prices, when we have growing at our very doors, spontaneously a sit were, the very material with which we could make the same articles, and furnish them in the whole of Europe at half the price we are now paying. As it regards the position government has assumed in the use of American hemp for the navy, the law of 1843 requires it to be tested, inspected, and purchased by agencies in the west. Thus far the requisitions of the law have not been complied with. I would here say a few words in relation to flax, an article that has nearly ceased to have a name among the productions of our country; and if a cause can be assigned, it is that no system has been introduced to assist in its production. The process of de trotting has been generally observed in this country; or, if water rotating has been attempted, it has been at a season of the year when nothing could be effected. I would say that the process, as described for the culture and preparation of hemp, is equally applicable to flax, and, if strictly observed, will yield a rich reward. The time of sowing is the same, and the quantity of seed should be slightly increased say 2- bushels per acre. The harvesting should take place before the seed matures. It is important that great care should be observed in the curing, and also in all the manipulations to the balep9
ress. In the present crowded state of the market with may of the products of the soil, it seems desirable that all the branches of agriculture lit will afford a good investment should be prosecuted. Geo. W. Of Lli   Ngsstr. 6 vis, Of  ssobRI . Of Bees, &c. Of E. G. Kelly, Of Newburyport, Mass. To department of agriculture seems so much neglected at the present time as this; whilst the same amount of capital invested in any other branch yields less. Notwithstanding the large importations of honey and wax, at only twenty and fifteen per cent. duties respectively, the domestic supply commands a high price, ready sale, and fair profits. It appears that more than 628,000 lbs. of wax alone are annually produced in this country. Were there even no protection on the former, the foreign article would then be obtained at a rate that would enable the beekeeper to feed it out in his a diary after the foregoing season was over, and realize a great advance for the honey in the comb. Success in the management of bees depends chiefly on a correct knowledge of their habits and instincts, thereby enabling the keeper to control them almost at will; and, also, on strict attention to their requirements, rendering them healthy, contented, and industrious. Your leading points essential to profit are yet but imperfectly practised or understood, viz : to obtain pure honey, uniformly free from brood comb ; to produce artificial swarms; to prevent robbing; and, lastly, to prevent the ravages of the bee moth. Most, if not all the pure money, is at present obtained by placing small boxes or drawers in the upper part of the hive, in which the bees will work when no room is allowed the na elsewhere; but even in these, though equally unnatural to her, the queen i will sometimes lay her eggs. It is their instinct to work not only downwards, but beneath, and in continuation of old stock. They will, however, build readily in side boxes, but here the queen is almost sure to interfere. To obviate this, I have inserted small bars across the entrance to the lateral drawers, with inter spaces to admit the working bees, while they arrest the queen and drones. This idea was suggested by an experiment made by Number for a very different purpose. The least possible space through which the largest workers could pass, laden with honey and pollen, was ascertained by experiments at the entrance to the hives. The aperture allowed is a fraction less than three-sixteenths of an inch, being less than the diameter of the small cells for which I shall claim no patent Artificial swarming, particularly in such seasons as the "a st, when bees very generally refused to swarm, has many advantages to commend it. I believe only one swarm came out in this town before the first of August, after which they are worthless. While my neighbors were in daily expectation of swarms in the usual way, with their drawers closed till too late to obtain much honey, I had three stock hives arranged over empty hives, and the bees busily at work. In the 12th of June, a young brood was discovered in one of the bee hives, then two thirds filled with bees and comb the old hive was at once removed to another stand, still placed over a second hive or box, and then shut up for twenty-four hours. A cover was secured upon the other, and the bees confined thirty-six hours. New com bloc. No. 1i40395Das rapidly formed in the second under box, and the old one wa sagairemoYved in like manner. In the 4th of July the old swarm was driven into a third by, leaving 50 I is. of honey. "A drought soon checked the usual supply of moisture, so that the second and the transferred swarm s required feeding for their winter store. I divided a second stock the 5th of July; but being in doubt if the lower hive contained any brood comb, I immediately expelled the bees from the stock hive into an empty one, using tepid water in order not to injure the young bees, which it contained in abundance. This brood comb being in a large old fashioned hive, was cut down to 12 inches square, (the size of the new ones) and arranged in two of these. One was set over the transferred swarm, which immediately ascended, and, having a queen, took quiet possession. Aftertwentyfour hours they were allowed to roam abroad, returning to their new home, ten feet from their former stand. The other box, containing the old comb, was placed over the bees at the old stand, and a communication opened. They reared a queen in due time, as did also the two that had been separated from the first stock hive, the cells of which were distinctly seen in each. It is not uncommon for one swarm to rob another, especially in an un productive season. In this respect I was vexed for weeks, through carelessness in exposing honey in the comb to common access. Myriads of my own and neighboring bees destroyed each other in the contest, till the honey was removed, when the latter made a vigorous attack upon my hives. Narrowing the entrance is the principal remedy given by writers but in one instance this (lid not succeed. During the second, the queen in the infested hive was constantly creaking as if held prisoner, and at night but little honey could be seen. The bees also were greatly diminished by the combat, and perhaps by being enticed away. Early the next morning the robbers returned in great numbers, meeting with but little opposition. Finding the queen yet alive, and anxious, if possible, to save a favorite swarm, I closed the mouth of the hive and drove with it a distance of three miles. This was of course effected. At night I determined to try another experiment. I swept Of  pounds of bees hanging out of another hive into an empty box, and took them to the rescued swarm. These were united by placing one above the other, and u ligating both effectually with cigar smoke. To disagreement was observed, nor was it possible that but few, if any, found their way back, even of the robbers. In six weeks they were returned to their former stand, having apparently collected more honey than any one at home. Thus it will be seen that transferring andequalizing swarms may be as readily effected as dividing. In each operation the precaution should be taken to have a free circulation of air. The great pest to the agrarian is the bee moth. To device will entirely prevent its incursions, without great care. Loosely twisted yarn, thickly studded with its woolly fibres, has completely protected the are vice between the hive and its bottom. Gives are not safe either on the ground or in the tops of buildings. I have tried them in the second story of a barn, the bottom boards projecting through, but around these the large of the moth were frequently discovered. Another decided objection to such an elevation is the great difficulty the bees meet with in lighting upon the pedestals when returning heavily laden and fatigued, particularly in a high wind. When a swarm is unable to dislodge the moths, both bees and honey have hitherto been a total loss. By the use of the tunneled bottom, the396
existence and progress of the larvae of the moths may be known and watched by observing the size and quantity of their black of long faces, which falls down with bits of comb, &c. By this means I first discovered that the hive containing the old brood already described was thus doomed. The bees were at length transferred to an empty box and placed over a small swarm, with a sheet iron plate drilled full of holes between them. At night, after the atmosphere of the two was sufficiently com mingled, the divided of the two was removed, and the swarms united. To quantity of faces was observed among the workers, and a few only covered about the place of their former stand the following day. The moths had burr owed chiefly in the old comb. They evidently commenced their depredations where a bar entered the hive to confine the comb, which in the hurry of the operation was imperfectly adjusted, and the strong odor of the old wax attracted the parent miller. Most of the worms were drowned in the tub, and the honey was saved for feeding other swarms. The simplest outdoor arrangement for hives is undoubtedly the best for bees, while it affords the least harbor for moths. My stand is constructed of joints, seasoned, planed, and painted, 20 feet long, fastened a foot apart upon three posts two feet high. Three such pieces of iron rods are so set upright in this frame that four will support a hive. The tops are filed to points to receive the bottom firmly. The hives are protected from the heat of the sun by trees, and in winter may be removed to an outhouse. I am convinced, from a very limited experience in the management of bees, that this plan is better than housing, unless the moth can be entirely excluded. The tunneled and canaled bottom, recommended by Thomas Of fleck in his work entitled "see breeding in the West" is one of the greatest improvements in the a diary. His "sub tended" or section hive, consisting of boxes a foot square, inside measure, placed one above another, I have also adopted, with the addition of glass, and the frames made use of in theSRussian hive" and his bottom, with the entrance enlarged three or four inches. I also use under hives, with drawers. These are made ,A feet long, 1- wide and deep, including seven drawers, two on each side and three at top, with glass backs and hinge doors. Hours, &c. G.

Take two ounces of lime, four ounces of linseed oil, two ounces of white of eggs, two ounces of york of eggs. four ounces of finely powdered dry cheese. Six the lime and oil; break the eggs well, separately, then mix them with the oil and lime; with a gentle heat; and, lastly, add the cheese, and stir it well. Spread this mixture over the cotton shades with a brush, allowing each coat to dry before applying another, until they become waterproof. I made several attempts according to the foregoing form, slightly varying it each time, but with the same unsatisfactory result a thick mass, about the consistence of stiff mortar, which it was impossible to lay on with a brush. I lastly substituted two ounces of. 397 strong lime water for two ounces of lime, and mixed the other ingredients, excepting the cheese, in the heat of the sun. If greater heat be applied, this compound also will become a thick mass. The cheese only serves the purpose of filling up the interstices in the cotton or calico, if it be of open texture. The stuff I made use of was of very close texture, and did not require the cheese. The application of this composition renders the cotton semi opaque, or like the ground glass shades. Among the advantages these shades possess over glass ones, the following may be mentioned :first, the cost being hardly one-fourth of glass; next, break age if any accident happens to the calico, a needle and thread, and the composition, repair the damage. Next, the light the shades require no watching; no matter how intense the heat of the sun, the plants are never stricken down, burnt, or faded, and therefore never checked in their growth; nor do they grow up long, sick, and weakly, as they would under glass, and still there is an abundance of light. Next, the heat the heat arising entirely from below, and being less influenced by the sun than when glass. is made use of, is equal be and temperate; which, in our variable climate, is a great object. The vapor arising from the manure and earth is condensed by the cool air passing over the surface of the shade, and hangs in dew drop son the inside of the calico. I gave the experiment "a fair trial" in the fullest sense of the term, having laid down both calico and glass, with the same manure and heating, the same seed, and under the same aspect southwest; and the result was, that the plants raised under the calico were stronger and wealthier than those under the glass. The calico shades were always in advance of the college hotels, which are under the care of a professed gardener; as, also, of all the other gardens in this neighborhood. If the frames or stretches are made large, they ought to be intersected with cross bars about a foot square, to support the calico, and thus render it less liable to injury. Throughout the frosts of the last three weeks, the heat of the beds under the shades has not been checked for an instant. Mode Of Rai Of  Of Mustard. Of J. H. Parmelee, Of Duncans Falls, Ohi O. The ground should be light, lively, sandy loam, rich enough to produce fifty bushels of corn to the acre; ploughed as early as it will do to work the tops of the furrows level led with a light bush. This makes it easy and even for working the drill barrow. Owing use a drill barrow-one with two large light wheels, easily worked by hand, made by Ruggles, Course, and Mason cost fifteen dollars in Boston ingenious, simple, and dura be implement. With this (supposing the lines from top to bottom to be the direction of the rows) lay them first one foot apart, then two feet, so alternating them thus, /I/ i, and have the hole in the tin plate, through which the seed falls, of a size sufficient to drop three pints of seed to the acre. Begin with the plate which has the smallest hole, and ascertain the requisite quantity of seed by observation of the first, second, or third half acre, dear easing the hole if necessary, to adjust its size to the quantity 8 98 a. You will see the advantage of the rows laid off as above by inspection of any given number of feet say sixty-six feet. The difference in the number between the manner above and single rows at two feet distance is the profit, and the growth of the plant in the former way no more than fills the atmospheric space; whereas, in the latter it looks too thin and poor. These double rows have another important use, as will be seen presently. The largest yield per acre of corn ever raised in Ohio, was on the above plan, one foot and four feet, drilled s talks, nine inches in the row. Three pints of seed per acre makes the plants stand very thick; but, no matter nature adjusts the distance and size of the s talks to the strength of the land. The undergrowth ,that is smothered helps to smother the weeds also. Therefore, let no thinning out be done. Cultures soon as the weeds peep above the ground, which is as early as the plant, and before it is large enough for a cultivate or to pass between the rows, the fields must be plentiful ly stocked with hands, having light hoes and nimble fingers, to attend to the rows only, otherwise the weeds will be apt to smother the crop, which is very slow in its early growth. And these hands and cultivates must continue going over andover the field, (if it be large and the weed bad) say four or five weeks, until the plant springs up and blossoms and branches, so that further working would be injurious to it. Cuttingwhen the leaves have all fallen off from the stalk, and it turns yellow, and the <a name="seeds50"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in the ponds, which are near the ends of the branches, are changed from a deep green to a brownish color, for the most part, through the plant and through the field, or such parts of it in which it will do to begin, then cut it immediately with the sickle, (crawling, which I have tried, would knock out the grain) tenderly handling it, and laying that cut from two double rows upon the stumps of one, in heaps. These stumps form a fine support for the grain clear from the ground, and admit a free circulation of air under it. Met it lay three or four days until it is bone dry or for a week if you please until you are ready to take it up for threshing. If rain come upon it, no matter it will not hurt it. Housingaccording to the extent of the field or force, have one or more canvass sheets of light I hempen duck, 24 feet square. Clear a space and spread it upon the ground in the field, supporting the corners and sides by small stakes about the height of two feet. In this place top to top the heaps that lay around, or that may be drawn a short distance on a s led, furnished with a sort of hur due of poles, to support a canvas sheet on that also. Thresh with flails. Your men can work to advantage on one sheet-three to thresh and one to turn and shake up. The heaps of grain should be taken close to the but tends of the s talks and lifted perpendicular ly up, not dragged or gripped hard by the hand otherwise much loss will ensue. When the sheet is charged with as much grain and chaff as can be conveniently handled, tie up and haul it to the barn floor, and then the canvass may be spread on another part of the field, if desirable, and so through. Curingat the barn should be a hand to rake the bulk of the chaff from the seed as it is delivered, otherwise space wilt be wanted; and the seed, being at the bottom, will be prevented from drying. The hand must work ,without shoes. and rake the chaff from side to side repeatedly off the floor every time sweeping the space clean before removing the chaff back to the opposite side, to be sure that no seed is thrown out with the chaff, a. 399 After such taking, the seed should lie in bulk in the remainder of the chaff and dirt (which keeps it from packing, and sweating and heating for three weeks, and be thoroughly shovel led up and removed from side to side every day. By this means the seed cures bright and dry. When pass it twice through a farming mill, furnished with a riddle No. 12, and the article is ready for market. The foregoing is the result of fourteen years' trial in every form in rows at different distances, broadcast, mixed with c lover seed, with the view of smothering weeds, on different soils, at different times of the years and is the only method that was ever successful with me. It seems to me that the agricultural community, both of the north and south, will be apt to complain of over production, so long as its attention is wholly absorbed by a few leading and important objects, to the entire exclusion of various minor and profitable interests. In our goodly land, stretching through so many climates, we have a spot, and a good spot, for every production of the temperate zones of both hemispheres. An examination of that great work of the Secretary of State (his report of 1842," on the commercial relations of the United States with foreign nations shows us that we might very profit ably trans plant into our own genial climate various fruits, costly drugs, and valuable materials for manufactures, with a special view of exportation to other countries, without reference to the supply of our own country, where the demand, however would be large and permanent. And your own report shows (and in behalf of the industrial interests of our country, I am thankful for your valuable labors) that mechanical inventions, in their bearing upon agriculture, will soon place us on a level, as to cheapness of production, with those countries that are filled withcoolies, serfs, and slaves.

As you want facts, I think it not amiss to state to you that I have followed the same process, in a like enterprise, the past season. I planted 28 acres with brown, and two acres with white mustard seed. Of the former the yield was 305 bushels, and of the latter 15 bushels 320 bushels in all; which was 61 bushels less than from 27 acres of the same ground the year before. The whole expense of the crop this season, delivered in New Work, wasg1089 ; for 298 bushels I received                                                         $1,117. The article being plenty in the market, I was obliged to submit to a reduction of one cent. pet lb from the price of last year. This diminished quantity is to be ascribed to the capricious ness of the season, the weather having been either too dry or too wet, alternately the reverse of that which the different stages of the plant required. Comparatively, the result was fortunate, as several undertakings of the same kind around me proved entire failures; owing, I judge, to the neglect of seasonable and thorough tillage.

Dear Of  R: The acquisition of any new branch of industry to a nation whose population and territory are so extensive as ours, will be hailed with pleasure by every true friend to his country ; and it is a marked feature in the character of Americans generally, that they are always prompt to avail themselves of every useful improvement in the arts or sciences, no matter from whence it emanated. We perceive almost every year the development of some new product of agriculture or the mechanics arts. Under circumstances of great difficulty and discouragement; we have thus seen the gradual increase of our iron mines ; our silk and wool growers the opening of our vast coal regions ; the extension of our foundries and machine shops, and remarkable and striking improvements upon the ingenuity of the old world, produced by the very obstacles and difficulties that embarrassed our earlier steps in each and all of these industrial pursuits. The dense population of western Europe, whose vast mass are so depend ant upon the various products of agriculture for the staple commodities of subsistence, require at the hands of the cultivate or a higher degree of knowledge in the practice of his art than is expected, or we may even say needed, from the American farmer of the present day. The irrigation and drainage of land, the chemical composition of manures, the alteration and fe utilizing of soils, are now reduced to a system in many parts of Germany and France a system that we shall attain whenever our necessities develop its value. The cultivation of the be et root in France is an evidence of what improvements the wants of a people will produce; and the same remark applies to the cultivation of the family of <a name="seeds51"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, that are so productive of oil; an article that modern refinement applies in a thousand ways, and which ministers so directly to our comfort, when used in the production of artificial light. The present magnitude and importance of this branch of European agriculture may be traced to the destruction of the fisheries of the Atlantic seaports during the long continued wars of Napoleon. The necessity of a supply of oil for domestic as well as public uses encouraged the farmer to the cultivation of the rape, cold a, and other <a name="seeds52"><mark>seeds</mark></a> known to be capable of yielding a sufficient quantity of oil to pay the costs of production. And the continued absence of all kinds of fish oils from the market enabled those who attempted to make good this deficiency from the <a name="seeds53"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the earth, to mature their experiments, and, after much difficulty, find a method of culture that would repay them for their labors. In a tour through various parts of Belgium and France, in the year 1844,I saw extensive plantations of the cold a, which is a species of cabbage, defined by botanists as the brass i ca campestris ole i fera, that produces a very excellent oil for combustion and other purposes. Upon inquiry, .was surprised to learn that this seed, and the oil expressed from it, is now considered one of the great branches of national industry, both in Belgium and France. To extended has its culture become, and the crop of oil is so abundant, that it is afforded at prices which I should suppose would effectually prevent the entrance of s term oil as a competitor in the market. Observing that the soil upon which this seed appeared growing was by no means of the best description, I afterwards learned that the plant is so hardy that it will flourish even in a poor soil, though the crop in such cases yields but] a, 401 lightly. In the belief that this seed might be successfully introduced intothe United States, and that, if not now, we may hereafter derive some advantage from its culture, I procured a quantity, together with a treatise upon the method of cultivation, written by an eminent agriculturists, who has for many years given close attention to this subject, and is considered the highest authority as to the peculiar management of the plant. It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity of placing a translation of this treatise in your hands, together with a sufficient quantity of the spring and fall seed to enable you to supply many of your correspondentswvho, I doubt not, will be willing to make trial of the plant, and ascertain how far it may succeed in our climate. The oil of cold a is, in its sale able condition, a clear, limp id fluid, of a specific gravity nearly equal to s term oil, and one of the richest hydrocarbonsfrom any of the family of oleaginous <a name="seeds54"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. It was owing to these qualities that the French government long since adopted, and still continue its use in all their light houses, which are estimated to consume, in the aggregate, 32,600 gallons per annum. The Belgian and Dutch governments also use it for a similar purpose; while the salons of Paris and Brussels are illuminated by its means. A perusal of the annexed translation will show that the culture of the cold a plant is a very simple process, though requiring considerable care in the outset, tint il the nature of the plant is fully understood. There are, it appears, two plantings during the year, viz in the spring and fall; with a transplantation of each, when the plant has attained a proper size. 1 have omitted no portion of the instructions that relate to the work in the field, but have left out a long and unprofitable portion relating to the threshing and storage of the grain, as well as a description of the wind mills used for grinding; knowing that our farmers are well qualified in the art of securing their crops, and that wind is not used as a motive power in this country, where water power is so common. There are two kinds of mills used for expressing the oil from the seed after it is ground. The first is the hydraulic press, the same as used for s term oil. The second is called the Dutch wedge press, or crushing machine, a very clear description of which may be found in the supplement to Tres Dictionary of Arts, &c. The <a name="seeds55"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the French cold a yield about 40 per actor two fifths of their weight in pure oil, whose specific gravity is 0.9136,(sperm oil having a specific gravity of 0.9231.) It burns with a clear bright flame, with much less incur station upon the wick than occurs during the combustion of s term oil or land, all animal oils being somewhat troublesome in this respect. The article is sent to market in small barrels, containing, by French measurement, one hectolitre, which is one hundred li tres; and, converted into English wine measure, is 26.4 gallons. The market value of this oil averaged, during a period of 10 years, 92 francs perhectolitre ; which, reduced to our currency and measurement, is about 69.6cts. per gallon. For. Fresnel, the chief engineer of the French light house service, made a careful series of experiments, some years since, to determine the economical value of the oils of cold a and spermthat is to say, which of the two consumed the s lowest in lamps producing flames of equal size and intensity; and he found the difference so to fling as to be unimportant, Similar experiments were tried at Edinburgh by the engineer of the Scottish light houses, who States, ;in his report on the subject, that I the difference is nearly one-fourth: in favor of s per mi; ,which result appears the most correct of the two, and 26 402. Toe. o. 140.have no doubt it is so. If the soil of our western prairie should prove congenial to the cold a seed, it would seem as if that were the most appropriate region for its culture, where the farms are usually extensive and crops abundant. The principal difficulty seems to be in the transplantation necessary to the production of the crop, and the amount of labor which such a process necessarily involves. I f, however, our farmers were merely to raise a small quantity, and a market were once established for the seed, the oil crushed would soon appear among the list of our manufactures.

By J. W. P. Lewis, C. E., 1845. G Culturecqiza is a variety of the cabbage. It produces an oil generally used for illumination, but is also employed for many other purposes. The yellow flowered cold a, designated as the cold cold a, is the only kind raised in Belgium or Glanders. Almost every variety of soil is adapted to the growth and profitable cultivation of this plant. Good soil will of course produce more abundantly than poor; but, in some years, as large crops a reproduced from soil of medium quality as from the best, hence the importance of improving soil of the former description. The above remarks are applicable only to the cultivation of the cold a that is to be transplanted the sowed cold a, on the contrary, requires a good soil, and one that is in a fair state of cultivation; consequently not exhausted by previous crops. Thus the cold cold a can be transplanted to all soils after the harvest of wheat, rye, and oats, while the grain that is sowed in general yields but poorly, except in the best soil. This difference in production arises from the fact that the sowed cold a derives all its nourishment from the ground in which it is sowed, while the transplanted cold a has the benefit of two soils. Further explanation on this point will be found in the following remarks on the period for sowing and planting cold a. Plantinigcolza designed for transplantation is commonly sowed inJulya little earlier or a little later, according to the state of the weather. The success of the crop depending upon the vigor of the plant, care must be taken to get those plants that are in a good and healthy condition. His i may be effected by sowing early and rather thinly, though then there is some danger of the cold a blossoming before transplantation; while, on the other hand, by sowing late there is" equal danger of the plant being feeble at the proper time for transplantation. It is a difficult thing to obviate these matters in a genera i way ; the only probable remedy is to choose a favorable spot of ground, and bestow particular attention upon the irrigation of the seed. Olga is generally transplanted during the months ofSeptemberandOctober; more often in l he latter, The sowed cold a is generally sowed o wat the end of August, or during the month of Septemberaccordingitothe xv eager. The seed should be cast at distances of about tnelbfoot
. 403 March cold a (cold a duty   R) is sowed from the 15th of March to the 15th of April. At this period the seed: rust be cast deep, to prevent it len long destroyed by insects. Souza sowed in July is always designed to, be, transplanted in September. The grownd must be well ploughed and abrlanltlymanured; then harrowed, and the seed thrown in small quantities. ,When too thickly sown, a thin and long stalk is the consequence. A good plant should be firmly rooted, with a thick and rather short stalk say about one inch and a half in thickness, and a foot in height. The htarrowingis indispensable, as without it the seed would sink too deep, and would thus be prevented from coming up uniformly. Souza is planted either, with the spade or with the plough. Any give the preference to the former fret had, but we think without reason, for it is only with considerable difficulty that the stalk can be well planted in holes made by the spade, while in ploughed ground it can be planted with ease at a sufficient depth to be protected from the frost a consideration of the utmost importance. The ground intended to receive the transplanted cold a should be twice ploughed; the first time as soon as the crop of wheat or oats is taken off the second at the time of transplanting. The latter sloughing, must be so managed as to leave beds of eight to ten feet in width, over which, the harrow is drawn with the teeth upwards, in order to smooth the surface. In these beds holes must be made with the spade in as straight a line as possible, and the plants inserted in them. There is no objection to transplanting in the priest weather ; on the contrary, though the plant may, in consequence of the dryness, droop for a while, it springs up with more vigor after the first rain. Your or five weeks after transplanting, the process of hilling must be gone through with. This is done by digging a ditch about a foot square in depth between each row, and by throw in- the earth taken therefrom about the roots of each plant. The foregoing remarks are equally applicable to spade planting. 'to plant with the plough, it is only necessary to insert the plant in the furrow, and cover the roots with earth. Owing t l has already been remarked that the sowed cold a requires a better soil than the transplanted. The preparation of the ground however differs but slightly. As soon as the crop that precedes the cold a is taken off, the groupd must be ploughed, and shortly after harrowed. The same process must then be gone through a second time, the seed put in, and a light harrow passed twice over the ground; after which it must be rolled. This being done, furrows must be ploughed at intervals of about eight feet, and, as far as possible, they should be drawn, on a slope, in order to drain the ground. About two months after sowing, the hilling (the process of which has already been described) must be commenced. It is desirable to preserve the cold cut from the ditch entire, it being very efficacious in protecting the plant from frost; and this being done, no further are is required. Souza should be sowed as soon as possible after the crop that precedes it most generally oats) is cut; and in order to avoid loss of tire, the oats should be gathered into sheafs is ?j 1 placed a sprig he, with st efficient space between to admit the p o ugh- and harrow. By the meals the ground can b prepared for the seed without waiting g for the previous crop, to be taken away; :march cold a is, however, though of an inferior quality to the winter solar held in esticid127atiqon" from t th far that the crop, not being exposed to frost is more certain in its results. It requires, a good and moist soil, and is generally sowed from the 15th of March to the 15th of April 404 a. Harvestingthe period at which the grain becomes ripe varies according to the weather. Most generally, however, the time for gathering it is about the middle of July. The period of maturity may be known by the leaves, branches, and seed vessels assuming a whitish appearance. Great care must be taken not to cut the plant premature ly, as on this point depends, in a great degree, the success of the operation. When too ripe, a large quantity of the best grain is liable to be lost; and when too green, the quantity of oil is much diminished, and the quality becomes poor, The plant is cut, with a sickle, about five inches from the ground. The reaper generally stands in the furrow and cuts on either side; this method being found to hasten the work very considerably. When the weather is dry, the cutting should take place only very early in the morning, because the seed vessels being then closed, prevent the grain from falling out, which is not the case later in the day. The plant being cut, it is left to dry, and this is accomplished in from two to four days, according to the weather. Threshingthe grain is threshed in the same manner as wheat, andwinnowed after this operation. The bulk of the s talks is generally preserved for fuel, and the residue burnt on the ground the ashes being valuable for be aching purposes. The preservation of the grain requires care, it being subject to ferment at ion if heaped to too thickly when newly threshed. The fermentationmay be readily detected by the grain assuming a whitish appearance. To avoid this, i must: be spread out so as riot to be more than one inch thick, and must be turned every day for a week; after which, it n my be formed into heaps of six or eight inches high. It must, however be turned pretty frequently during the whole time that it remains in the g tertiary. 'the spade being of great importance in the cultivation of cold a, it may not be amiss to state that the most approved instrument of this description is that called the Belgian spade, the blade of which is an of long square, concave in its entire length; the socket solid, but not very thick; and, when the handle is in, the whole instrument forms a slight curve. Manufacture of cold a oil The extensive use of wind mills in France and Belgium for grinding the various sorts of grain, has growth out of the absence of suitable water powers in many of the richest agricultural districts. The steaminess of the latter as a motive force, renders it at all times preferable for such purposes. The machinery commonly applied in the reduction of the cold a seed to a meal, suitable for the oil press, is composed of a pair of vertical mills tones, running on a horizontal bed stone, enclosed in a circular wooden hop per or tub. The two vertical mills tones, which are of granite, revolve on stout axes, passing horizontally through a vertical central shaft, upon the head of which is a large spur wheel feared into a smaller one, the lower end of whose shaft connects with the water mill by a pair of level gears. The two vertical mill stones are thus made to travel round the circular bed stone, and by their weight crush the seed into a coarse meal. The operation is continued until the meal is of a suitable fine ness to go through the next process. Before putting the seed under the operation of the edges tones, as above stated, it is found advantageous to pass it through a bruising mill, which consists simply of a pair of iron cylinders, turned smooth, and made to revolve so as to bruise the seed as it drops between them from a hop per placed over the opening above them. Capers are fitted to the under surface of each cylinder to remove any oil take that may form upon them. This operation of bruising the seed is very l necessary, because the. 405 un bruised seed will slip away from under the pressure of the edge stones in grinding, and thus retard the operation very considerably. The next step, after the seed has been ground to a meal y paste, is, to remove this immediately into the press when cold drawn oil, of fine quality, is wanted ; but, for general purposes, the paste must be heated before pressure, as the yield is greater, and more easily obtained. The oil cake, from the first pressure, is passed through the edge mill a second time, then heated up to 212 of Fahrenheit, before receiving a final pressure. The apparatus for heating the seed paste, which best fulfils the purpose, is that ofHallette, and consists of a pair of iron kettles, concentric, one within another, the space between being formed into a steam tight blue, with an induction and eduction pipe to admit or blow off the steam with. Gate, valve opens on one side of the kettle to draw off the seed, while hot, into bags of hair cloth, which are then immediately subjected to pressure. Slirrers are made to revolve in the kettles by machinery. The hydraulic press and the Dutch wedge press are the two machines that are used in the extraction of oil from <a name="seeds56"><mark>seeds</mark></a>; some prefer the former, while oh any assert the latter to be most applicable to this purpose. The best fuel for heating the seed, where steam is not used, is found to be coal dust made into cakes, as the heat must be raised slowly and kept low. The manufacturer of oil who would economized in the article of barrels, and, at the same time, prevent losses by leakage, generallyconstrtlcts a deep cistern of brick, laid in hydraulic cement, and plastered inside with the same. This cistern should be of a sufficient capacity to contain all the oil that is not intended for immediate transportation. Such cisterns are used in Your nay, and are found to answer in every respect. The cold a oil undergoes a final process of purification in the hands of the oil merchant, but this is beyond the province of our treatise. The experience of many years has proved to us that the cultivation of this .sed in Belgium, Glanders, and France, may be safely entered upon as a branch of industry that, under judicious management, is sure to repay those who make the enterprise, and the annual extension of its culture is the best proof of the truth of this opinion 46 To' iso. 140 Appendi X No. 2. For the Prairie Farmer. Smwt In Wheat. Of At L. Castleman. Messrs. Edi Tors : l am very glad to see the subject of the causes of smut in wheat discussed in the two last numbers of your paper, and propose to have the discussion continued by adding my mine of experience and observation. First, then, to Mr. Hard up I say the plan recommended in the March un nicer of the Farmer is excellent probably the best one now inn use. But as scientific farming is in its infancy, it is right that we should be correct in theory as well as in practice, else the utility of our discovery stops with its first application; whereas, on the other hand, if our theory be correct, or, in other words, if we attribute an effect to its proper cause, we are enabled to apply the same fact to other subjects, and with our eyes opened as to what we are about. Now, how do bring and lime prevent smut in wheat? By destroying the vitality of the s po rules, says Mr. Hard up. Wetus see. In the farm on which I now live, the gentleman of whom 1 purchased it sowed about five acres of wheat, (on the sod) and so careful was he that he went some distance to procure seed free from smut. His he did, and sowed it. I saw it at harvest it was very smut ty, although the season was not one in which smut ty wheat prevailed to any great extent. The grain was sown late in the season, and was immediately followed by a light rain and cool weather, which much retarded its "coming up." The spring following, this same five acres of ground appeared so handsomely set with wheat, from the self growing of last years smut ty crop, that the owner concluded to let it grow and see what it would do. At the harvesting of this crop I owned the farm. Although it was a summer in which smut prevailed to a greater extent than 1 have ever known it (1843) in this country, yet this self sown smut ty wheat, on five acres, produced scarcely a smut head. In this case, what become of the s po rules which are said to be "taken up by the sap vessels Again: In the fall of 1842 I sowed wheat on the same farm, and find the following amongst my "notes on farming" for that year" In the first and second days of October I ploughed and dragged three acres of o at stubble land in fine order. In the third I sowed two bushels of Egyptian wheat on an acre of it, and dragged it in. From this acre, notwithstanding the lateness of the season, I got a good crop of wheat, (20 bushels) but rather smut ty. In the twelfth, the other two acres were sown in the following manner: In one acre 1, bushel red chaff bald wheat, ploughed in. From this acre I got a yield of 18 bushels, and nearly as much smut as wheat. The remaining acre was on the same day (12th ploughed a second time a bushel and a half of the same kind of wheat sown after sloughing, and dragged in. From this acre I got 221 bushels of clean plump wheat, almost entirely free from smut. What could have made the difference ?a? All my seed was prepared alike, bribed and dried, by rolling in ashes; the different pieces of land were equally good, and sown in equally good order. An it be that the deep covering with the. 407 plough at this late season weakened a part of this seed, and that this weakened portion produced the smut ?the above is a quotation from my note book. I think we can spend a few moments profit ably in recapitulating the above facts. The first sowing to which I have alluded was done in October, followed by a rain and cool weather the seed lay chilled a long time, before it came up the produce was sit from clean seed. The second sowing (self sown) must have taken place in August, when the ground and weather were warm the seed must have started immediately the product was, a clean plump merry, from smut ty seed, without either living or bringing. Went, we say nothing of Egyptian wheat spoken of in the quoted' notes as that might have been more or less liable to smut than other kinds of wheat. But of the second kinds sown on the same day, from the same seed, prepared alike, and on like soil, we see that covered to the depth of three or four inches producing largely of smut, whilst that sown on. top of the ground produces scarcely any. Another fact worth noticing these two acres were sown the same season of the self sown smut ty wheat, and within, twelve rods of it. Now, I ask any man to look over these facts, and say what he thinks is the cause of smut in wheat. I am a new farmer, Mr. Hard up, but have given much attention to this branch of the subject, and shall give more; and should I be so fortunate as to bring to light any facts worthy your notice, you shall have them, provided the Prairie Farmer will i, consent to become the medium of communication. One request of you. Will you inquire of all your neighbors whether any have a distinct recollection of having raised smut ty wheat from a self sown crop, and communicate ?from the Cultivator. Rust Of Wheat. Of. Rrrr    Vator: I investigation would seem to have established that rust on wheat is a small plant of as regular and uniform a growth as wheat and if such is the fact, any speculation on the subject would be useless. But if so, the rapidity of its growth, visible to the naked eye, is truly astonishing, and any information concerning that growth must prove interesting to the community, Your years ago, the writer had on his farm in Tompkins county fifteen acres of beautiful wheat. The field was the admiration of all who saw it. It stood thick on the ground was as tall as was desirable ; the heads, were large and long, and it presented a rich and beautiful appearance; It then promised from thirty to thirty-five bushels to the acre of superior wheat his was the first week win July. The weather then became very warm, and for three days there were frequent light showers, with bright sunshine between them.  In the language of the farmer, it was close, oppressive weather. Before the commencement of the rain, there was not the least appearance of the rust upon any of the wheat. In the contrary, tit then promised one of the finest and heaviest crops ever raised in this State ; but in less than four days the whole field was stricken with rust, and the rest l twas twelve bushels to the acre of shrunk en, instead of from thirty to forty, "bushels of superior wheat to the acre. The land on which it was grown 40 -toe. Of. 140.was a rich clay loam, with a small portion of gravel, rather moist than otherwise. The lot is situate near a creek of pure spring water, and during and immediately after the rain a fog was discovered above the stream, and also above other streams in the vicinity. All the wheat growing near those streams was much injured by the rust; whereas that which grew half a mile distant from them remained uninjured. He von acres of mine growing on new ground, one hundred and fifty rods from the stream, escaped entirely; but it was sheltered by woodlands on two sides, and the ground for the most part was dry. The first crop on this fifteen acres gave twenty-eight bushels (wheat to the acre; the second, (oats) forty; the third, (corn) one hundred bushels of ears; the fourth, (oats) forty; the fifth, (wheat) after oats the same season, twenty all the finest of grain, and no rust to cause injury. It wast heh stocked down with c lover, and summer followed the second season for the wheat which was so seriously injured by the rust. I f, as is maintained, rust is a plant, whence came it in three days ?a? It was not wafted by the wind, for there was none ;it being remarkably calm, damp, warm, and sultry, and the sun between the showers shining intensely bright. But if it be a plant, for its growth, so as to injure wheat, it requires calm, damp, warm weather, and such weather must occur when the wheat is in the milk, or the grain soft. Some of our observing farmers say that if the rain is accompanied by wind, the rust does not injure the wheat. My belief is that the rust plant or fungus, whatever it may be, always exists on the stalk of the wheat, but that its growth is not such as to injure the plant unless warm weather and moisture unite at a particular period during the growth of the plant, and that prior to that period it is not visible to the naked eye; also, that during seasons unfavorable for its production it does not attain maturity. I f, for example, the grain has passed the milky State, and has become in a degree hard, then the rust will not injure it in the least, however favorable the weather for its production may be. In confirmation of this, he would remark, that during the most part of July last, in this section, the weather was very dry and warm. Met about the 15th of the month, we had some wet, warm weather, and the consequence was, that most of our fields of wheat were stricken with rust; but the merry was formed when the wet weather' commenced, and the wheat was too far advanced to be injured the rust proved too trifling to cause injury the wet and warm weather was not perhaps of sufficient duration. The showers were short, and the rust did not so far progress as to stop the circulation of the sap, and the merry obtained the necessary supply. Our crops of wheat have not been so fine for many years the merry is large arid the wheat of a superior quality. Even the late sown wheat, although affected by the rust, has escaped injury. The merry is not inferior to that sewn earlier, but the yield to the acre is not so great by one-fourth. Superior cultivation and early sowing are the best preventives of the injurious j effects of rust yet discovered. But the writer believes he has discovered a remedy for the rust, plant or no plant.  He is preparing to, make the experiment the next season ; and if successful, the result will be communicated. Of ailso6believes that great crops of wheat city yet be grown as well in the counties ba the Hudson as in western New Work. He shall see. S "A Ffar. Mer Of 0TOMPKI . Of" Countydoc. To 140. 409 : .a: From the Dublin Evening Most." Smut in wheat is of two affinityes to the growing crop in which it is found: the large fillearedismut, equal in growth, in luxuriant e, and, at first sight, equal in all respects to the healthy ear beside it; and the small, stunted, and comparatively innocuous smut. Now are these two species of smut produced? The argument in one case will hold good in both i; we shall, therefore, confine ourselves to the fiilleared fungus. The grain of seed, in this case, is equal in size to the sound grain, but diseased from some accident, either while on foot in the field, by an un toward season, such as the present has been, or by damp in the sheaf while in or after having been removed from the field, or by any one of the thousand accidents to which it is liable before it is committed to the earth to terminate, in the hope of producing its quota of a new harvest. Now, we will suppose it to have s been injured by moisture, no matter from what cause the effect is s pre to be the arousing of the incident powers of germination ; the across ire [plumulejwill swell and make an advance from the seat of germination along the back between the two coats of covering, or br an, in which the marina is enclosed. Now, suppose this first disposition and spring of germination be stopped, and that the grain be restored to a dry state ; the natural result will be, that vegetation will at once cease, and the vegetation already produced will shrink back, leaving no visible trace that it had been ever brought into action. The question is, would that grain, if sown, ever produce anything but an abortion ?a? Never: and that abortion would be smut. The natural spring was called into action by moisture; it was afterwards retarded by drought. Nature, in the assertion of her laws, will not be commanded in her processes of reproduction; and when the husband man will sue to have that grain of wheat restored to its original state, in the hope that new wheat would form it, nature resists the application, and forbids the base grain a participation in the reproduction of its species. We have said that the sound grain will terminate, will produce a sound stem, will blossom fully, and yield its. quota of wheat. The other will re terminate, will produce an equally luxuriant stem, shoot forth an ear in the young state perfectly equal to the sound one, but will not blossom nor receive the impregnation of blossom from the ears surrounding it. The result is self apparent. If it do not manifest in itself, nor receive the impulsive principle of reproduction from its own species, it is plain that it cannot bring forth a reproduction of that species. Met, the ear is full of what ?a? Of a lupus nature the smut ball. *a* *a* *a* *a* *a" We would suggest that no man should sow any portion of the present produce of his own farm. A change of seed from a distant district will do more than compensate for the pains and expense of procuring it. The soft, ill conditioned, and partially sprouted grain is to be avoided. The even, well shaped, sound, and friable grain is to be chosen. Having selected that, and the ground being ready to be sown, the first essential is, sleeping of the seed for about fifteen hours in sea water and blue stone. There sea water cannot be had, strong bring will answer the purpose. About half a pound of blue stone, first prayed .to powder; and then dissolved in soft water, will be sufficient for half a barrel of bring to steep the first barrel of wheat a quarter: of a pound for the second, and two ounces for the third barrel ; adding bring according as evaporation and absorption may have decreased the original half barrel. When the seed will have been about fifteen or eighteen hours in_ steep y it sit to be removed from the bring, and s lacked lime sifted- on it freely. When the external moisture has been. absorbed by the 410 Toe. -to; 140 lime, the seed may be sown with that confidence which has its rise in the conviction that all that man could do had been effected in the order of re pro, suction. : " The properties of blue stone and salt in solution are of so penetrating a nature as to be resisted only by the sound grain. The sickly; or diseased, or otherwise injured grain does not possess the principle of vegetable life sufficiently active to resist the influence of the solution; and the plain conclusion is, that all the powers of incident germination are destroyed in the diseased grain, ,which: when thrown into the ground, will rot, and never shoot forth a stem; consequently, in a field sown with grain thus prepared, we may, generally speaking, look in vain for' smutNEW York Farmers- Of    Lub. At a meeting of the New York Farmers' Club, held on the 5th of August, Dreunderhill said: " To avoid the fly and the worm in wheat; sow early or late; when your grain has attained some height, you will i find the nitsofthe insects upon it; then turn: in sheep or young cattle, who will eat of fall the blades, n its and all. If you sow late, you avoid the its you may miss them; besides, the manure 'left by your sheep is very good for your crop. I know but one remedy, which is easily tried, and is said to be effectual. -I t is quick lime, s lacked perfectly fine; when dried, take it with your three fingers (just as you do grass seed) all over your wheat field; soon after the wheat is in blossom, and when you see the flies covering over the field: sow in this way about two pecks of lime on an acre. The dew will moist en the lime, and it then reaches the insect larvae and kills them. His process has saved a whole wheat crop on one field, while a neighboring one was destroyed by the worm From the Paine Farmer. Weevi L, Of Grai N Flyi Miacid127.

Joosui Of, J Or2tt. Monoutrh, One 26, 4845. a. 411NoteWe thank our friend for this account of his experiment. By experiment and observation we obtain much valuable knowledge. We are inclined to think i however, that, on a careful comparison of the two flies viz: those from the f roth and those on the wheat) they will be found to be different speciesEDI Tor. From the American Farmer. Another Wheat I Nsect. An insect has been found the present season in the wheat fields in various parts of the State, which does not correspond with any description that we have met with. It is a white worm, about one-fourth of an in chin length, ribbed, without feet, with two formed black lines upon its head shown by the microscope) and in some instances, with a streak of light green extending length wise. It is invariably found just above the upper joint, and within the straw. There it feeds upon the inner surface of the straw, abstracting its juices, and preventing their ascent to the head. I twas first observed by us when the grain was in the milk, and its presence was denoted by the head having turned white premature ly. Upon examination, the head was found perfectly empty; the straw, like the head, white for several inches down; while below the upper joint it had the thrifty green color of the rest of the field. In opening the stalk, the worm was generally found as before mentioned; in some cases its ravages were, seen, but the insect had escaped. In such cases a slight puncture in the straw was commonly perceptible, where it might, have made its exit. I none instance nine eggs were found in one straw, and a very minute worm, apparently just hatched from one of them, resembling the insect as found elsewhere, except in size. With a view of observing the transformations of the insect, we put several wheat s talks, that showed its presence, into a glass jar, with a little dirt in the bottom, for the insect to bury itself in, if such should prove to be its habit, and undergo its transformation. As it increased in age, it became of a yellowish green color, and at length i was found slightly mottled with black, and motionless; After the lapse of a fortnight, we observed one morning, on the inside of the jar, a greenish colored fly, about three-sixteenths of an inch in length being a little shorter than the worm, and of the same color. In the surface of the dirt was observed a cast off skin, resembling that of the worm. To be certain that the fly proceeded *from the worm, we enclosed several of the pus closely in the paper, and, a day or two after, found, upon opening it, the same kind of fly, and the skin whence it issued. To 0 most farmers with whom we have conversed we find that this insect is, as it was to us, a stranger. We have met with one who says he observed it several years since. With some, the b lighting of the wheat heads passed as the effect of the late frosts. The injury done by it as yet is not serious. Whether it is destined to become another troublesome pest to ;the wheat grower, time will determine. If any person can give us in formation 'concern in it it we should be glad to have it co0mmunidatedPe1haps so mb of or exchanges can tell us all about it 412 a. From the Boston Cultivatorssed Wheat. Messrs. Edi Tors: We are told, that in the island of Jersey, (england) where the farmers sell their produce and live upon the refuse, it is customary for them to tie their wheat in small sheaves, and by striking each twice or thrice across a barrel while lying on its side on the floor, a super fine sample of wheat is obtained for market; after which the sheaves are thrown by to be clean threshed, in the evenings of winter, by lamp light. I have just met with the account of a farmer in Vermont, to whom his neighbors resorted for the purpose of securing seed wheat of superior quality; very fine in appearance, remarkably productive, and of early maturity. He readily commanded three dollars per bushel, when the price of wheat was a dollar and a quarter calling it the red and genuine barrel wheat. But the secret was at last discovered ; he used, before- threshing his wheat, to select the best sheaves, and, striking them over the side of an empty barrel as it lay on the floor, three or four times before laying them down to becleanthreshed, he obtained in this very simple way a very superior seed wheat, which the whole country coveted at a double price. Thus the largest and ripe st kerseys were separated and collected without labor or difficulty, and a profitable business was carried on, until his neighbors discovered how to make "barrel wheat" for themselves. Edmund Lawrence. Newarkn . J. Sbloomfi Eld Farm, New lMiddletown, Frederick county, Maryland, January 8, 1846. In: According to the promise I made when I last saw you, I now communicate to you the information I have of the growth and production of wheat, corn, rye, &c. I have been experimenting for a number of years, and have discovered that in all diseases of wheat, rye, &c, there is a first cause, unvarying in its effect; and in order to avoid the disease, we must first find out this first cause, and the proper remedy may then be employed. In order to improve wheat I select a piece of new land with a northwestern aspect; ;and if I have no new land with such exposure, I take old land lying in the same way and manure it with fresh horse dung, and find it will answer equally as well. You may ask why I select land with this particular exposure to sow my wheat for seed the next year. The reason is this. in n the first place, a cold hillside renders, the wheat more hardy and its color brighter, and when sowed on level land, or southern ,hillsides, it stands the winter better and ri pens six or eight days sooner; consequently it is more likely to escape the mildew and scab, which are known principally to attack late ripe king grain, and every year destroy millions of bushels. .a. . In order to prevent smut, after selecting my wheat for seed as above mentioned, letting it get thoroughly ripe before I cut it, I put it up in round, shocks, tapped, with two sheaves butt end up, to secure it from the weather. After threshing it I put it in my granary, sprinkling s lacked lime over it at the rate of one peck to ten bushels: of wheat. This prevents the wheat from getting into a sweat or heating. It also is an effectual preventive of. 413 the attacks of the weevil, applied either in this way or sprinkled over every layer of sheaves in the stacks or rows. When I am ready to seed my land      prepare my wheat by sleeping it in a strong bring of salt and water, that will float an egg, and add to this two pounds of saltpeter and a half pound of blue vitriol (sulphate of copper) to every ten bushels of wheat. After taking it out of the bring I roll it in lime before sowing. The above articles are very cheap, and are in my opinion a certain antidotes to smut, and improve wheat in quantity and quality at least ten per cent. The crop from seed thus prepared ri pens eight or ten days sooner than wheat sown without any preparation, and consequently is less liable to mildew or scab. Last year 1 had 15 different species of wheat growing. Of these I think the following are best adapted to our soil and climate: First, the China. This is a beautiful white wheat, first introduced from the north of China. It produced me this year 47 i- bushels per acre. Secondly, the Oregon, brought from Oregon by a missionary in 1839. This year it yielded me 50 bushels and, one peck per acre. (for a full description of this wheat see the On. H. L. Ellsworths report, as Commissioner of Patents, for theyacid127ar 1845, page 433.) The " Yorkshire Grown" is a beautiful large, red merry, early in ripe king, brought from England, and produced me 37 bushels per- acre. ' Count Vernon" is a beautiful wheat, and derives its name from its having been first grown in this country by the illustrious Washington, at that place, many years since. It is believed to be a Frenchwheatsent over by the friend of Washington and his country, Generallafayette, in 1795. It is an early bald wheat, well adapted to poor land. This year it produced on poor land 35 bushels per acre. "may" wheat is very early, and yields well. It ripe he before rye, and consequently is not subject to rust or scab. This yielded me , 37 bushels per acre. "mediterranean" wheat is well adapted to this climate, and grows well on thin lands. I to weight is remarkable. In several instances it has been known to weigh 67 to 68 pounds to the bushel. I sowed this year, for the first time, several very hands me kinds of wheat. The first is from Poland, and calledSPolish" wheat. The appearance of this wheat, growing, is splendid. I that almost the appearance of young broom corn when it first makes its appearance above ground, the stalk is so very strong and coarse; and I am disposed to believe, from the experiment I have made, that it will be well adapted to our climate and soil, and a profitable wheat to sow on thin soils. From the fact of the stalk being so hard and strong, I am induced to believe that it will be imperious to the attack of the fly. It is a white bald grain, heads very large, and the yield great. I have also made an experiment with a wheat called the "Etrurian" wheat. This is from I talk; very large merry, white, and of good appearance. Another I italian wheat that I have, de nominated the " Tuscans" can t be beat in its beautiful form and color. The merry is beautiful very white; the chaff is white, without owns, or beard, and the growth of the plant closely resembles that of Polish wheat. I am disposed to believe it will suit our section of the country well; and the shape and appearance of the merry will recommend it to the attention of those who are select in their choice of seed. It ri pens early, and, before ripe king, it casts off its leaves, leaving room for the free circulation of the air and sunshine, and consequently ri pens perfectly. This, I think, will always exempt it from danger of mildew or scab. I have been frequently amused with the speculation of some farmers in relation to the well known failure of the rye crop in this section of the 414 . country. They exhibit so much ignorance of the nature and instincts of vegetation, that it must be a matter of surprise that men who are brought up to farming, living in the midst of vegetable life, should not be better acquainted with the laws of nature which govern the growth of plants. I wonder how much wheat we could raise here if we had continued sowing the old red bearded wheat, when it had actually exhausted itself, or run out, as it is commonly termed, in ten years. In consequence of rye being less valuable than wheat, farmers have never taken the pains to change their seed; therefore the rye has degenerated, and becomes so weakly that it will not bear the severity of our winters; or if it does, and arrives to maturity, the merry is not much better than chess, or cheat, as it is commonly called 1 would recommend them to procure the seed of the large I wish white rye, as the best adapted to' their use. I will now give you a history of the introduction of the Oregon corn, and its characteristics. It was brought to Cincinnati in the winter of 1838,from the southern part of the territory of Oregon, and presented to Generalharrison, who cultivated it in the year 1839, and stated that it would produce 30 per cent. more than any other species of corn he ever planted. He was induced to make this statement from the fact that nearly every stalk bore from two to three ears, and from 18 to 24 rows of grains to each ear. This corn has a remarkably thick stalk. I to roots run deeply 'into the ground, and consequently resist the drought better than any corn I have ever known. The grains are from a half to three quarters of an inch, and in some cases one inch, in length, growing on a very small red cob. I to yield in 1843, from several acres at one end of -a field, was 121 bushels to the acre, and shelled seven and one half bushels to the barrel. (our corn mon corn only shells five bushels to the barrel) From this it will be readily acknowledged that it is deserving of the attention and cultivation of every agriculturists desirous of receiving the largest return for his labor, as it yields at least 40 per cent. more than the corn generally planted by the farmers in this section, and is much better adapted to their soils than any kind now in use. My opinion of the nature of the Hessian fly, and its destructive character, you will see by referring to the report of the Commissioner of Patents for the year 1845, page 433. I have discovered another steep for wheat, previous to sowing, different from that I spoke of as having used, in the commencement of this letter, which is cheaper and better for that purpose. By subjecting wheat to this process, it will not only be improved in quantity l~ per cent. an acre, but it will cause it to ripe n sooner, and change the color of red wheat to white in two years' application. This is a discovery entirely my own, and many persons have advised me to have it patented. I have not the receipt withcid127mef at this time, but will give it to you at some future me, I but e, as I consider it too valuable to be withheld from the farmers of our land.

415From the Cultivator. Splendi D Sample Of Wheat. The recording secretary presented the following letter, with the accompanying sack of wheat  a: I send you, for the State Agricultural Society, a sack of the wheat considered the best grown in old A stile, and sent me lately by a friend in the north of Pain. The Mala vera wheat, already familiar to English and American farmers is also a Spanish variety. It came originally from Estremadura, a province in the south of old A stile, and of a milder, more uniform climate. Thecastilian wheat, it may therefore be inferred, will prove a harder species. I have sent to General Dawson Arm on a similar sack, and proposed to him, should its introduction be accomplished under his experienced and enlightened management, to name this variety the Guerre wheat, after D. Macsimo de Guerre, our excellent consul at Oil boa, to whose good offices am indebted for the specimens I have received.

Similar, qualities are raised in A Miancha and Valencia, but none superior By reference to a letter addressed by me, with a sample, to the N. Y. S. Agricultural Society, and published in the Cultivator for the month of. August, you will find some particulars respecting this variety which may possess for you some interest. In the letter, the wheat was erroneously stated to be of old A stile, instead of the sister province of Leon, and to weigh 68- lbs. per bushel, instead of 67, as was determined by more accurate instruments and more care in the trial. M. Guerre sent me a face ga of the grain. Of this I have distributed all, except two small sacks of four or five pounds each.

On. E. Burke, 'C., 4 c. From an Ohio paper. Hackleman Wheat. Having heard of this wheat, I inquired after its history and qualities The Rook ville American thus answers our interrogatories. We hope, before long, to visit Hayne county, and shall embrace the opportunity to procure some seed. If any of our farmers would like to try this wheat, we will cheerfully aid in getting it for them( In our previous notice of the Tackle man wheat we were not sufficiently understood. The wheat known it i this neighborhood as the Hackleman1or Alabama) wheat, was introduced here by Judge Hacklemari in the year 1836. This was the first that was known of it either in Ohio or In diana. In the summer of 1836, the judge was travelling in the south, and being a good practical farmer, Who always sees and improves upon everything worthy of his attention, saw a small quantity of wheat different in appearance from the usual crop. He obtained from a wo a w a small quantity, which he brought home in his saddle bags, and from which all the wheat of this kind in this State aid Ohio has been obtained e The Hackletman wheat has many qualities which make it superior to any other :heat in this country. It ri pens from ten to fifteen days earlier than i any other wheat; ad consequently has yet never been known to be affected in the least i by rust, which so often proves fatal to other wheat. It averages about sixty-five pounds to the measured bushel; being, on the average, three pounds heavier than the red chaff bearded, five poundsDoecN. No. 140. 417 heavier than the common, and from five to ten pounds heavier than the white wheat. The Tackle man wheat is bald, with the exception of a few long beards on the point of the head; the wheat is rather dark, and flourswellThis year this wheat did not do as well, probably, as other wheat, it having been injured materially by late frosts after it headed and jointed, from being earlier than other wheat. But in ordinary seasons there has not been this objection." Such a demand has there been for this wheat for seed, that little or none found its way to the Cincinnati market until probably last fall, and then in small quantities. For the last year it has been selling here from fifty to a hundred per cent. higher than the common wheat, for seed. Of late, however, we see it has been favorably noticed in the Cincinnati paper smudge Tackle man called it Alabama wheat, although he did not obtain the seed in that State; and it is due that the farmers and millers should call it Tackle man wheat. Should distant friends wish it, we believe any quantity can now be had in this region. If it should prove to be no better, it will be well for farmers to sow a part of this kind, as it will ripe n sooner and thereby give farmers a longer wheat harvest To the Editor of the American Farmerma. Edi Tor: Any improvement in the various kinds of wheat is a subject of much importance to the agricultural community generally; and when anything has been effected in this way, it cannot be too generally disseminated. Any have been the efforts to introduce foreign wheats and assimilate them to our soil, but very few were found to which our climate was congenial. Among the most valuable is the " Mediterranean." The success with which this variety was cultivated induced a search after a better kind, possessing the same advantages, but without its objections, among which is its weakness of straw, causing it invariably to fall on ground of much fertility. It is also a bearded wheat, which is a decided objection, making it very disagreeable to handle, and withal a very dark wheat. But a variety has been introduced by Worn. Stewart, called the ' Etrurian" which possesses all the advantages of the Mediterranean, and has, besides, a remarkably strong and vigorous stalk. It is quite as early as the Mediterranean, and has a beautiful long, smooth head. The grain is of a superior quality, being round, plump, and white, with a remarkably thin br an. My attention was attracted to this valuable wheat, a few days since, on the farm of the Rev. Daniel Zollickoffer, near Union town, in this county. In inquiry, I found that Mr. Zollickoffer (who, by the by, is one of our most enterprising and successful farmers) had procured it from Com. Stewartssecond crop. Mr. Z. has cultivated it two years, consequently full opportunity has been afforded to give it a fair trial; and he assures me that instead of deteriorateing, as most foreign wheat generally does, it has improved in every crop that has been grown in this country. I saw it growing beside the Mediterranean both sown at the same time, about the middle of September, and on ground of the same quality. The Etrurian is equally as forward as the other, and much better headed. It is the richest piece of grain, 27 418 a. I think, 1 ever saw, and must yield very abundantly, although growing upon 1 ground of but medium quality. This wheat is not, as its name would indicate, brought from the littleisihld of Etruria, but from I talk' It will very probably, ere long, supersede all other kinds of wheat, as it certainly possesses decided advantages overt him. One great recommendation of it is, its being so early as to be in no, danger of the rust. It is believed, also, to be fly proof, as ho fly, I am inforiried, has been discovered in it since to in traction n to the Unitedstates. From the America A Farmer. The Etruri Of Wheat. We would call the attention of farmers to the advertisement of Messrsbqardly & Box, on our last page, offering for sale a lot of the wheat of avare ty termed " Etrurian" noticed in our last as having been raised by He. D. Zollickoffer, of War roll county, Maryland, from seed imported byCol6imodore Stewart, and raised on his farm in New Jersey. We have full confidence, from what we have learned of this wheat, in its value, and strenuously urge upon our farmers to obtain some of this seed, if ever so mall a portion, in order to give it a trial; and as the lot on sale is small, to prevent disappointment no delay should be had in the application as it will no doubt be speedily disposed of. The peculiarities of this wheat, will be found noticed in our July number, and in the advertisement .to which we have referred, from information obtained for Mr. Z., who has given ;us a similar statement when recently in our city. He thinks that on lands suited to the growing of white wheat, it will be found peculiarly valuable. Since the above was prepared, we have received the following from Mrzoilickofferlauderdale, July 21, 1845. Dear Of  R: Enclosed you will find a few of the remarkable beards or owns of a variety of wheat of which I made mention when I was with you last. This, with several others, 1 received from H. M. Zollickoffer, of Philadelphia, who received them in a distribution made by the councils of that, city f various specimens collected for Gerard college. Nearly all of them failed from their late ripe king. One variety of spring wheat (labelled I italian) I still retain for further trial. It is a bald or beardless wheat l It is of a compact headed variety, (titi cum compact sum) and may yet prove valuable. The above long bearded wheat resembles somewhat in n s ear and owns a variety of turbid wheat (titi cum turgidum: received four years ago from England, but differs very materially in the form and appearance of the grain. This turbid wheat, with two other varieties, subsequently obtained from Lincolnshire, England, with an expectation of getting a kind had would answer for cold clays, were all given up because of their late3ipening. I go in for early wheat; hence my preference fir Mediterranean and: (cid127Erurian. The Etrurian especially regard as an important acquisition to the wheat grower, It has also the advantages of the early varieties escaping rust and smut and is, to say the least of it, as productive as any variety I ever grew, and more so than any of the white I ever tried. It haswnereover maintained its color better than any other white variety I ever tried, as white with me has turned red in one season. I it to go back. 419 again to our long bearded variety. I had given it up, with others. Three held were found among the Etrurian by y youngest son, and perfectly ripe at the time of cutting that grain. By it got there i more tar car tell. I am disposed now to give it another fair trial. The a wins I sed you as a mere curiosity. When I get a little more time I want to notice that valuable paper of Mr. A ills. There has been too little attention paid to the proper time and manner of putting in our wheat crop. I dont mean, by" too little attention" too little pulverizing the earth. The fact is, in many instances we pulverize too much. In this' we follow British husbandry in a case that does not suit our climate, and attribute our failures to anything else other that the :e al cushay son has j u me st a tired one pie de of ground, on which was grownEtruriadn Heat, the product of which we know, ha ing threshed it by itself. The result is about twenty-eight bushels per acre. In this piece there are some twenty large apple trees and a large cherry true. Any person acquainted with the c edition of the 'round would pronounce this a larger produce than could have been expected from r i cry other kind of wheat. I aim satisfied that it is five or six bushels per acid i more than the Mediterranean grown along side of it, under equal circumstances. Respectfully yours, Dani Of Zolli   Cki Offer. Etrurian wheat few days ago we were politely favored with the following letter, from Apt. G. N. Diehl, of the firm of Diehl & Brother, merchants of this city Philadelphia &saturday Courier. Sphi Ladelphi A, December 19, 1845. Gentlemen: Having heard of the superior quality of the Stewart orEtrurian wheat, imported into this country by Commodore Charles Stewart, and of its Valuable properties, not possessed by any other wheat I have ever heard of that of electing the Hessian fly, and its nbnsusceptibility to rusty was induced, in the fall of 1843, to purchase a small quantity from the commodore, which I sent to a relative of mine near Sort Penn, Delaware, with the view of testing its quality, and comparative product with that of wheat generally grown in that section. It is perhaps proper to observe (as the character of soil in the State of Delaware varies from the heaviest clay to the lightest sandy) that the soil upon which this wheat was sown is of a cold clay by nature, and not above mediocrity in quality. I requested my friend to sow it in the same field with his other wheat, giving it no advantage whatever. This was done; and the yield of the Stewart wheat was at the rate of 32- bushels to the acre, at the standard of 60 pounds to the bushel; while his other wheat, in the same field, only produced 15 bushels, to the acre as. the average yield. His entire sowing, in the fall of 1844,was of the Stewart wheat, which also produced 32" bushels to the acre, at the standard weight, and, if nicely cared for, would have yielded from 33 to 34 bushels. I think this test sufficiently establishes the superior character (the quality is also most beautiful) of the Stewart wheat. In my opinion, it is the very best seed in the country, as it is adapted to any climate and to any soil. Very farmer should supply himself with this seed, as the advantages pe 420 
cuniarily would be considerable, and to the country immense. The excess, as per statement above p at the present price of wheat, say                                                         $1.30 per bushel, would very nearly pay for the land. Respectfully yours. G. W. Of Ehl. From the American Farmer. May Wheat. Of correspondent at Clear Spring, Washington county, Maryland, writes us (june 4) that his May wheat was already filled, and would be ready to cut in ten days, or perhaps sooner, He considers it superior to any other variety. L. B. Finely, esq of the Sub b Will farm, War ford turn pike, near this city, left wit, us, about the 1st of June, a stalk of wheat six feet high, which he considered a fair average of a six acre field. Mr. F. informs us that when he took charge of this farm, several years ago, it was so poverty stricken that the whole farm, of several hundred acres, would scarcely produce grass sufficient for the support of half a dozen head of cattle. He commenced the burning of lime, and with the refuse of his kills he has brought his farm into a state of tilt h which would bear comparison with the boasted farms of Lancaster or Chester county. From the Geaesce Manner, Charcoal For Wheat. By all means remember that it is far better to sow but five acres, and so feed the plants that they will give you 40 bushels per acre, than to sow fifteen acres and starve the young wheat plants down to 12 bushels per acre, and have even that badly shrunk en with rust. Wont forget that it takes less seed, and fewer hard days' work, to raise 200 bushels on six, than on fifteen acres of land. Nothing is more common in western New Work, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, than for land to be too rich in vegetable mould to bring good wheat. The straw grows too rank and thick, and is very liable to be affected by rust. To prevent this latter malady, Mr. May wood, of Buffalo, has used charcoal with signal success. Mr. H. is the owner of a tract of splendid wheat land near An dusky, Ohio, where he has two flouring mills. He has kindly furnished us with a plot of seven wheat fields, taken for experiments this season, with the results which follow to. 120 acres; applied fifty bushels of coal, ground fine, per acre yield 25 bushels per acre. No. 24 acres, no coal applied; wheat badly rushed; yield 5 bushels per acre* No. 315 acres; coal as in No. 1; yield 25 bushels per acre. No. 425 acres; coal as in No. 1; yield 35 bushels per acre.

Nvotno. 4 was seemed with old Heat. a. 421 The soil, culture, &c, were precisely alike, except the use of fifty bushels of coal per acre, as designate down in April and May. The soil abound sin lime and organic matter. Mr. May wood will apply 10,000 bushels of coal to the fields to be sown in wheat this autumn. It costs him                  $30 per 1,000 bushels. He grinds it in a common bar a mill, used by manners. For the Farmer and Mechanics. Charcoal For Wheat And Rye. Gentlemen: In fulfilment of my promise, I communicate the following statement of some of the results of my inquiries in relation to the beneficial effects of charcoal as a fertilizes and as a preventive of shrinkage in winter grain. Mr. Follow ay, of An cock, Delaware county, informed me that he had heard his father remark that he had never known land to wear out where there had been a coal pit; but that such places always produced better than the adjoining land. It may be well to remark here, that in some instances have been told that the burning of a coal pit had for a while destroyed the fertility on the immediate site of the pit. But this may be owing to excessive burning of the soil, or too great quantity of the coal. We would not expect a crop from seed sown in a heap of lime or s iliac. Almost all of whom I have inquired confirm the account of Follow ay as to its uses as a fertilizes, and its durability. I will state but one of a number of facts proving its benefit in increasing vegetation, besides the luxuriant growth on the sites of coal pits. An aged and credit le man, Mr. Now, of Chehocton, in Delaware county, said that some years ago, when living at a place called Utter nuts, he purchased a load of charcoal to use in a small furnace. The man who brought it, in passing though a piece of ground, occupied as a garden, upset his load. They gathered up all they could, but much fine coal was left. Mr. Now and his wife both said that it was astonishing to see the increased vegetation to the extent of where the coal was left. They say it was a moist soil. These, and a number of facts, the result of much inquiry on the subject, have convinced me that coal can be profit ably used as a fertilizes. But it is peculiarly valuable as a preventive of rust and shrinkage in wheat and rye. In proof of which, Colonel Holiday, of Vol chester, Delaware county, a reputable man, well esteemed for truth, who was himself a blacksmith, and whose father had followed the same trade, and had burnt man y coal pits, told me that he had made the remark to his father that he had never known grain to be shrunk where there had been a coal pit. Last year, my son in law, Henrywoolsey, of Beer park, in Range county, said he had a piece of rye much shrunk, and of little value except whereherethre had been a coal pit, where it was plump and fair. Any other facts have come to my knowledge confirming my opinion that charcoal may be used so as to greatly increase the profits of farming, and particularly where wood is abundant. But as there has, as yet, been little experience on the subject, I would suggest that every farmer who reads this should try the experiment, at least in a small way. Almost any one can procure a little, (if only a bushel) try it il a different proportions ;observe the nature of the soil; and, if possible, compare the effect of coal422Doc. Too 140.from different kinds of wood if those containing more potash are better and if so, what soils, &c. Some (as the coal from hem lock) contain little or no ash; if such are beneficial, it proves pure carbon to be indeed a mature. Respectfully yoursHEN $ Y V. Kleei T. From the Dark Lane Express.

To th. Editor of the Cuitiyator. Wbeat Culture. At one of the weekly agricultural meetings held during the past winter, the subject of discussion was the culture of wheat.  M. clean, a member of the assembly from Monroe county, made some very interesting and valuable remarks, which, at our request, he has furnished us for publication. Of  n offering a few remarks (said Mr. Clean) on the cultivation of wheat, I deem it most proper deferring the minor details of special cultivation, manures, diseases, and different varieties -to introduce the subject by and  exposition of the general principles and circumstances of soil, natural adaptation and climate, which will ever control the production of this to st important crop. An examination of the geological map of the State will at once and most readily indicate to the intelligent observer what portions of the State are most naturally adapted to wheat. First in :blue, aid occupying: a are surface, is the Onondaga salt group. The rocks of this group are sometimes de nominated the gaseous limestone, or shales ; connected with which are the plaster qu armies, a. 423 the water lime, and the salines of the State. This group, as a whole embraces the most natural and enduring wheat soil of the State. It includes and extends from Grand island eastward, narrowing to a point in the county of Schoharie. I to soil is composed of alluvial swells, chiefly resulting from and based upon the limestone a sub soil susceptible of fertility at any depth, and which, with the sub stratum of lime rock, is adapted to absorb the super abundant moisture. Hard water, a prevalent growth of oak timber, also upon much of its southern line a comparative absence of vegetable accumulation, and often of timber, consequent upon the annual burning of its natural product, the opening grass, characterize this group. With a surface at once beautiful and accessible, few portions of the State presented a more un promising appearance of soil to the first settler. I to un surpassed and permanent value has been demonstrated by time and experience, and it is due to the mineral character of its soil, and the fertility and adaptation of the sub soil. Although I have dwelt upon this group more at large, because of its natural peculiarities, I am far from claiming for it exclusive natural adaptation to wheat; and only mean to say that it is more generally and permanently adapted than any other, as a whole; that as a whole, it is more certain and enduring, and better resists every unfavorable vicissitudes of season, climate, or defective cultivation; and that under continued cultivation, there has been little if any falling off in its annual product of the except when managed with great imprudence. I am aware that there are large portions of superior wheat soil embraced in the collateral geological groups, very much of which is but little if a tall inferior to the above in natural adaptation to wheat. Of these, extending north to lake Ontario, are the Niagara, Clinton, and $ edinagroups ; and towards the south, the Elder berg, tail to, and of the Them rung group, more or less of the northern portion, aecordingtothe extent of the northern lime drift; for it is an important fact that tkediluvial current from the north has conveyed and intermixed beneficially the rock of each of these groups with all the others; conveying the fe utilizing lime far south of the actual existence of the rock, in place. These various groups contain collectively a very large portion, perhaps one-fourth, and the most valuable soil of the State. When the important question arises, where have occurred, and to what causes are due, the evident and conceded diminution of the wheat crops of the State ?a? it will be found that it has occurred chiefly in the last mentioned groups, and generally in the ratio of their distance from the first; owing, in some instances, to the deficiency of lime, deficient mineral qualities, and excess of vegetable matter and hum us in the soil very frequently to the too level and wet surface; but more specially and injuriously to the tenacity and imperfect ion of the sub soil; resisting the escape of the super abundant moisture, whereby large surfaces are often super saturated with water, inducing winter kill, debility, and various diseases of the plant, especially under the action of sudden and extreme frost, or heat atnddroutght. Collectively, these results become more man i fe stand injurious, as the soil has been retained under long continued cult i at ion, so that only in the most favorable seasons can a full crop be realized in much of these soils ; and in these have occurred the principal falling off in. the wheat product of the State. As there are large portions of soil thus circumstanced in the wheat re12
gion of the State, and especially in the last named groups, it follows, if the premises are correct, that in no way can the area of wheat growing be so advantageously extended, in no way can capital and means be so profit ably applied, as in improving and adapting these lands, by open and thorough draining, where the mineral qualities of the soil are in other respects proper. It is an indisputable fact, that very large surfaces under cultivation scarcely yield a regenerating return, from the causes here indicated. In further illustration, and in order to a more comprehensive view of the whole subject, as connected with the above general principles, I desire to remark briefly upon the influence of climate upon the production of wheat, as I am not aware that the importance of the subject is generally appreciated. Perhaps there is not on earth a better wheat soil than is to be found in New Work, so far as the natural capability of the soil is concerned; and yet it is only when the most favorable circumstances of season and temperature combine with a proper condition of the soil that we obtain products approaching those of Great Britain, from lands under no better cultivation, and inferior in natural adaptation to ours. The cause of this is to be found in the excessive character of our climate. Our growing crop has to sur mount the extreme severity of our winter, and the more injurious and frequent spring frosts, acting upon a wet surface, producing what is called winter kill; the succeeding heat and drought acting with sudden change on the same wet surface, upon a plant flourishing only in a dry soil, and naturally incapable of resisting these adverse conditions and, finally, encountering the excessive heats of summer, (often in connection with moisture) stimulating the plant to premature and diseased ripe ness. Or, if the foliage is very dense, en feeling and lodging it, so that the grain is deficient in proportion to the straw. It is a frequent occurrence that the. crop is heavier than can be carried to profitable maturity, under the influence of our climate; and practical farmers have long since learned that crops of a medium weight are generally the most profitable. The influences of climate apply not only to this State, but with more or less injurious force to all the United States, in one extreme or the other of heat or cold; and it is probable, that in the southwestern States of the Union the cultivation" of wheat is limited more by the influence of climate than by imperfect ion of soil 4 n accordance with the above principles, and for the reason assigned, it will be always practicable on equal, or even inferior conditions of the soil, to raise heavier crops where the climate is more temperate and uniform for the reason, in addition to those stated, that the crop occupies the soil a much longer time in arriving at maturity, and it is also less subject to the adverse vicissitudes and influences alluded to. This is believed to be the case in some parts of Europe and in Great Britain, in which last the crop generally occupies the soil in growing state, excluding the fall and winter, from the first of March to the middle of August; but doubtless its insular position has a favorable influence. In such climates, also, it is more practicable, for the same reasons, to carry down the cultivation of 1 wheat to soils of inferior natural adaptation. As the influence of climate is a fixed condition, and little subject to human agency, our alternative is to adopt our soil to the climate: and this we may do chiefly by laying the land dry, and obviateing on a large extent of our soil the injurious effects of super abundant moisture. In clearing new land, the importance and economy of retaining, or even planting, at proper intervals, narrow belts of timber, as protection against the winter winds, will engage the attention of practical men. The white oak, which retains its leaves through the winter, is admirably suited for this purpose, and indigenous to the soil. In continuation, it may be remarked that the winter frost, and heat, and drought of our summers, while offering superior advantages for cultivating and subduing the fallows, affect injuriously at the same time the growing crop, especially in wet and heavy soils: urging their drainage also from the consideration that they are afterwards more easily and season ably tilled, and more productive of all other crops, as well as wheat. The additional conclusions resulting from these general views and principles, are, that the first requisite, in the cultivation of wheat, is to obtain a good soil; that a good soil is one that a bounds in lime, is clean and dry, and right in the mixture and quality of its mineral matter, including fertility and absorbent qualities of the sub soil; that a soil containing vegetable fibre or hum us in excess produces much straw and little grain, and that consequently alluvial soils are not well adapted to wheat, except when naturally overlaid by a proper mixture of the neighboring upland minerals; that there is much unprofitable application of labor and capital, because of non conformity to the 'natural laws of soil and climate; that the cultivation of wheat may be profit ably continued or extended on large portions of our land, by adapting the soil to the climate and thus to the cultivation of wheat, on lands that are too level or wet, provided the mineral qualities of the soil are correct in other respects. I would finally offer the suggestion to practical men, that, as good wheat lands are well adapted to the production of nutritions pasturage, it will be found most profitable, at the relative prices of products and labor, to re nova te the soil to a greater extent than is now practised, by rendering pasturage accessory to the cultivation of wheat in preference to costly or artificial manures, beyond a judicial economy and application of those that accumulate on the farm, and that lands not natural to wheat will be most profit ably applied to other crops. From the Ohio Cultivator. Ohi O Wheat Crop For Next Year. We venture to predict, that if no unusual injury befalls the wheat crop now in the ground, the yield of the coming year in this State will be greater than for three years past, if not greater than was ever before produced. Our reasons for this opinion are the following 1. The general drought during the past summer and fall will be found to have had a very beneficial effect on the soil of summer f allows, not only in destroying the grass and weeds more effectually than usual, but in effecting chemical changes in the elements of the soil, by which means the peculiar food of the wheat plant is rendered more so ruble and abundant 2. The present wheat crop was generally better got in than any preceding one for a number of years past. This, we find, is the testimony of 426 farmers from all parts of the State. The weather during the fall was remarkably fine for this work, and, in the principal wheat counties, the partial failure of crops gave farmers more time for performing the work well. They also had more land unoccupied, so that a greater number of acres have been sown 3. Farmers have also been led to bestow more study and attention to the science of wheat farming, and to discover the means of increasing the productive ness of their lands. This has led them to adopt a variety of improve rents, which will be found greatly beneficial in many cases, and instructive in all. I need, we hear from all quarters of the State that the: farmers have been trying a multitude of experiments in regard to the wheat crop this fall, suggested by the Ohio Cultivator; and when the results of these experiments are published, as they will be in our pages after harvest, next year, the instruction they will impart respecting the culture and improvement of this great staple of Ohio will be worth Of  Lli   Ons Of Dollars to our readers and to the State. From the Ohio Cultivator. Experi Ments In rWHEAT Culture. Benefits of agricultural improvements in Ohio. The following are some of the experiments and improvements in the cultivation of wheat, to which allusion has been made, and the results of which will be made known through the columns of the Ohio Cultivatorafter next harvest 1. Previous crops Some farmers have sown part of their wheat after summer fallow, and the rest after frosted wheat, or after oats; others (in the central and southern parts of the State) after corn cut off, and a part among standing corn, with various modes of covering, so as to test the difference as to winter killing, &c 2. I n/ the preparation of land there have been a great number of improvements adopted, or experiments tried, such as more frequent or extra deep plowing, sub soiling, under draining, narrowing, rolling, &c; also in maturing or enriching the land with lime, ashes, plaster, charcoal, &c. The results of this class of experiments cannot fail to be vast ly useful 3. New varieties of seed have been sown to a greater extent than ever before, in nearly all parts of the State. We know of quite a number of farmers who obtained seed from New York and other States, and some have sown as many as from six to ten different varieties for the sake of experiment and comparison. One farmer in this (franklin) county has sown 150 acres of wheat, consisting of ten varieties-three of these were obtained direct from England, one from France, one from Canada, others from New York and other States of the Union 4. Preparation of the seed with bring, lime, &c, has been practised in a larger number of cases than ever before, and a number of farmers have prepared a part of their seed, and sown the rest without preparation, so as to test the merits of the practice 5. The *manner of putting i wheat has been varied more the past fall than ever before, mainly with a view to protect the young plants from winter killing. Thus some farmers have harrowed in a portion in the usual
427way, after sowing on a ploughed surface, and ploughed in other portions, then narrowed a part of the ground smooth, and left another portion rough. Others have rubbed the land, as practised by Mr. Noble, of Stark county, so as to have the sed fall in drills, as mentioned in our paper ofSepitmber 1st, and a few have tried drilling in the seed with a machine constructed for the purpose. Who can extirpate the importance of the instruction that may be derived from all these experiments, when the results re made knonasthey will be? n And then, too, this is only just the beginning of this gr at march of improvement, Met the State board of agriculture and the county societies be organized and efficiently sustained, as provided for in thelbillnow before the general assembly, and such experiments will be: nmitiplied, another year, more than ten fold, and the results will be made known to multitudes of farmers, who cannot be reached by the means now in operation. Who is there so blind as not to see that such improvements in the culture of the staple crops of the State as would i e effected by these means would soon increase our surplus products and the revenues of the public works so as to return to the State treasury, many hundred fold, the sum that is asked to be expended in the promotion of these objects? To that instead of the impoverished condition of our State finances being a valid reason for with holding this appropriation, it is, in fact, the greatest reason why the appropriation should be made. Such might also be said on the benefits that such improvements, in agriculture confer on individuals, in the increase of prosperity, and he consequent means l of physical, intellectual, and moral progress but time and space and the, patience of our readers forbid any enlargement on these topics at present. For the Prairie Farmer. Mowi Of Wheat, &c. Of James M. Goodhue. Messrs. Edi Tors: Have any of your readers ever tried the effect of mowing their wheat in the spring ?a? The experiment has been made this season, with such decided success, by some of the farmers in this neighborhood, that I wish you to be informed of the results. Mr. Schley had a field of winter wheat, growing on the bottom land of the Grant rivet a stream much like the U Age. In the spring, when the the t had grown to the height of seven or eight inches, and being thickly interspersed with weeds, it was evidently too luxuriant, and threatened to' be a mere mass of lodged straw, with heads that would never fill; and, in i short, not worth harvesting. He took a scythe and mowed the greater part of the field. The part of the field thus mowed produced a fine crop of lean, straight, well il led Heat, entirely free from weeds. The remainder of the field, at the same time, was badly lodged, green, rusty and, ii what, not worth 'harvesting. Mr. Need, of our place, has tried the same experiment with spring wheat; and with similar results. The advantage resulting from mowing wheat in the spring, I suppose, is principally that you thereby give the light and heat of the sun i access to 428 the earth and to the roots of the plant. It is plain that wheat will thrive best without a blanket on, in summer. Would not mowing also destroy the Hessian fly effectually that is, the larvae of the fly, deposited under the leaf* It might be worth the trial where the Hessian fly prevails. Owing wheat, as above mentioned, is nothing new in husbandry; but, I believe, like a great many other useful facts in husbandry, it is new in our part of the world. I find reference made to the practice of mowing wheat, in the following extract from " The Compleat Body of Husbandry5published in England one hundred years ago; by which extract, it will also appear that the old chaps who were then living knew at least the alphabet of wheat growing and more than could be expected, considering how far they lived from Box river. Age 356: " Mr. Yelverton, in 1742, had the prize in I re land, having six hundred and sixty-eight stone and eleven pounds (153 bushels and 32 hundredths) of wheat off of one acre f The method he took was to change his seed; then he sowed it not too thick ; and he mowed it After which follows some further account of Mr. Yelvertons method. In fact, by referring to the work above quoted, I find we are in our own day and country only trying over again experiments and methods long since proved and practised in English husbandry. A few words more, and I will close this hasty communication, already perhaps too long. Mr. Hesse Miles sowed his field of o at stubble, and another of corn stubble, at the same time with winter wheat. The oats that had scattered in harvest sprouted above his wheat, and formed a protection for it through the winter. One of the wheat sowed on the o at stubble was winter killed; while much of that sowed amongst the corn froze out. I have this information from Mr. Miles, who is a man of truth. He believes that if oats are sowed with winter wheat, enough to form an overgrowth, there is no danger of wheat being winter killed. Lancaster, Grant county, Wisconsin, August, 1845. For the Prairie Farmer. Hedge Row Wheatearly Sowi Of. Of R. J. Cross. Messrs. Edi Tors: The farmers through this section of the country have about finished cutting their grain ; much of it, however, is yet in the field, and not secured ; but this week, if we continue to have fine weather, will finish s tacking or housing nearly all of it. A better quality of wheat, both fall and spring, was never raised on Lock river. In some instances the quantity may have fallen short of the expectations of some; but the merry is as good as could have been anticipated. For spring wheat we are raising here mostly hedge row wheat; the head is quite short, with along beard, and looks, when growing, much like barley. The grains in the head are quite thick, and are short and plump, and weigh heavy. I tis driving out all other kinds of spring wheat from this neighborhood.

429Yourrself (cid127id correspondents have been continually recommending sowing winter wheat early. Now, I agree with you that wheat should be sowed early, but experience has taught me that it may be sowed too early. I had this season a field of thirty acres of prairie, broken last season. The piece was sowed on shares I had the centre fifteen acres, leaving five acres on the south of mine, and ten on the north. I sowed the same ind of seed, and limed mine, which was not done by the others. When we came to harvest, I found the east part of mine some four or five day slater, shorter straw, and poorer wheat than that on the north or south; but on the west side there was no perceptible difference. I can only account for the difference that that part of mine which was inferior to the other was sown about the 25th of August; that adjoining on three sides the first week in September. Your years ago I observed the same difference in wheat sown in August or early in September. I' intend this year to sow from the first to the tenth of September, but not earlier. Springiwheat I do not believe can be sowed too early. Rosecoe, 2 8th July, 1845. There is now and then a season when late spring wheat succeeds better i than early. Such a case is, however, an exceptionEDI All. From the Ohio Cultivator. The Proper Of   Of For Sowi Of Wheat. Mr. Bateham: There are, in this section, many different and contradictory opinions respecting the proper time for sowing wheat. A large majority of the best farmers of this latitude concur in the opinion that the best time is from the 15th to the 25th of September; that period being sufficiently late to avoid the depredations of the fly, and likewise early enough to enable the grain to ripe n before it will be liable to be attacked by rust. But there are a few others, intelligent farmers too, who are in favor of sowing about the 1st of September, so as to enable the grain to root deeply and firmly, thereby enabling it the better to withstand the severity of the February and March frosts; arguing, also, that, being sowed thus early, it will have time to out grow the attacks of the fly. It is further maintained that, by early sowing, the growth will be sufficiently large to admit of its being pastured when the ground is hard frozen in the winter lit, while it is argued by some that wheat, which obtains a heavy growth in the fall, may be fed off without injury in the winter, it is maintained by others that it can never be fed off without serious injury, by producing a feeble growth, 'C turning the wheat to chess" &c. Taking into consideration the fact that our meadows have not, on the average, turned off one-fourth their usual quantity of hay this season and also the fact that the straw off our frozen wheat will not be fit for cattle to eat; and still another important fact, that the best possible pains in saving all our turn is and corn fodder cannot supply the deficiency, it will be very desirable to adopt the plan of early sowing, with reference to winter pasture, if it can be done with safety 430 a. You will confer a particular favor by giving us your opinion respectingtheetmatters. . Hours, &c R. Eastport, Tuscarawas county, Ohio, August, 1845. P. Perhaps you can inform us at what particular time in the moon the sowing ought to be done; also the time in the too for past i ring, so as to render the plan perfectly safe. Please to be especially serious (a) in regard to this matter. G. R. Remarks n regard to the time of sowing wheat it is of course impossible to lay down any exact rule that will pp ly to all parts of thiscouthry or this State, with all the diversities of soil and climate, and the differences in respect to the liability to injury from the fly and other casualties. In the north part of this State, and in western New Work, from the 10th to the 20th of September is generally considered the most suitable time. In central and southern Ohio, and in other regions of mild climate, the latter part of September or the first week in October is considered the best time. Our own opinion is founded on but slight observations, as yet, in this climate; but, from what we have learned, we are in favor of early sowing, then feeding off with sheep in the fall, if attacked with fly, and at any rate in the latter part of winter, or early in the spring. As to sowing or past during "' in the moon" we have no correspondent for subscribers in that satellite as yet, and therefore cannot give any definite information concerning its agricultureEXPERI Ments In Wheat Culture. To the Editor of the American Farmersi  R : Owing to the drought during the autumn of 1842, the crop of 1843 came forward very irregularly, and ripened in the same manner. That which had vegetated promptly was well matured, that which vegetatedlater Vas severely injured by the rust, and that which vegetated during the winter was entirely lost. I had sown may crop a shade later than I otherwise should have done, through fear of an excessive growth during the fall, on account of the warmth of the earth an offence against good husbandry I shall endeavor to avoid as far as possible in the future. I had observed during the fall that the grain upon the warm exposures about the fields had vegetated more uniformly, and showed a better growth than the surface generally, upon which it was evident much of the seed had trot vegetated, notwithstanding the fine ness of the weather, until the middle of November, when the weather became unusually cold for that season of the year. My crop had been sown from the 24th September to the 22d October, with the exception of two bushels reserved for an experiment upon the habits of a certain variety of wheat. Line showers fell on the 18th and 22d, and on the 25th a deeply soaking rain ; on the 27th I sowed the two bushels of wheat upon rich <a name="potato188"><mark>potato</mark></a> ground, ploughed just before the rain 9. 431 on the 25th. It did not ve get ate until January, when it came up: erybe6utifuly, th.,thermoreter, on the 20thopf that month, standing at 670Abot, uthebegining :of February it became very cold and theigroundwa ;deeply frozen n i the absence of snow in March, also; the thermometer, sunk t zero; my experiment failed the wheat entirely- perished, which no doubt was the. fate of much, if not all, of that portiocid127) of the crop which came up in January. The crop ripened from the 15th to the 25th of July, some three weeks too late. The fate of the crop had certainly depended upon the circumstance of its early vegetation. The. inquiry, could, anything have been done which would .have promoted the early growth of the crop ?presented itself for consideration. Now had each field b been prepared: in what state of cultivation as to! fine ness and looseness; what had been manured, and in what manner; whatnot; when sown, &c? were all reviewed, and the result appeared to be pretty much as follows: 1. The vegetation of the crop. First, That landwhihcid127had been prepared earliest, whether ploughed once, or twice, and had, had some rain and was well settled, whether dunged or not, vegptatedbest; perhaps because it had retained most moisture, and grew best because it absorbed less of the fall rains and retained most heat, as a cloverfieldploqghed early and not stirred merely worked on top. Second. Fields that had been stirred or ploughed late stood next; perhaps, because of their looseness, they were more exposed to loss of moisture by evaporation during the drought: and of their heat through the same medium after the fall rains. Third. My experiment, although entirely accidental in this connection, served to show that there was a point of time during the fall after which the crop ceased to ve get ate, and during the winter a degree of cold, or other circumstances, which destroyed the plant, not before, but after it had. vegetated2. The growth of the crop. That portion of the earlier sown grain which vegetated promptly was considerably in advance of the great bulk of the crop, the whole of which, however, did not improve as much as it was reasonable to expect prior to the commencement of cold weather. From which it would appear that the rain on the 18th and 22d exerted great power in causing the germination of much of the grain sown previously, which, I suppose, was owing to the great quantity of heat then yet remaining in the soil, but considerably reduced by evaporation during and after those rains, and so far reduced by the rain of the 25th as to retard the growth of the whole crop, and entirely prevent the germination of all grain grown subsequently, as certainly was the case in the experiment; which ground being fresh ploughed, gave it the greatest possible capacity to absorb water, which, combining with the remaining heat, passed it off in vapor, and reduced the temperature of the earth below the terminating point, from which it did not recover until the warm weather in January, when the infant plant came forth but to be destroyed by another element of destruction growing out of the great absorbent power of the loose soil its expansion, when. )ozeawhich expansion would be in proportion to the quantity of water contained in the soil. The cold in November and December, and in the early part of January, had not destroyed the germ, but the cold in February or March destroyed the plant. I f, then, the soil had been ploughed early, had been well settled by rains or the use of the roller, and top dressed (the proper place, 1 apprehend, for ali 432 fermented manure, instead of stirring in) as far as manured in the fall, and put in with shovel ploughs, cultivates, or harrows, moisture sufficient to cause the vegetation of the crop might probably have been retained and, by proper attention to top draining, so as to throw the excess of water promptly off the fields during, rains after seeing, much heat might have been retained to assist the fall growth, and to prevent injurious expansions by freezing during the winter. I have con formed as nearly as I could to the above view of the subject in sowing the crops of 1844 45. At stubble, well ploughed immediately after removing the crop, top dressed with manure, harrowed, and left to lie till the time of seeing, and put in with the cultivate or, more than quadrupled the product of land of the same field stirred for* experiment in the crop of 1844. Owing to the unusual mildness of the last winter, the shade of difference in the present crop is not very great, but very perceptible. The whole may be summed up thus: That land to be sown in winter grains ought to be well ploughed when in proper order, and well settled by rain or the roller, previously to seeing, so as to diminish the absorbent power of the soil; to have the full benefit of which, particular attention ought also to be paid to top draining, so that the excess of water may pass off of the fields as promptly as possible, whereby heat would be retained to promote the fall growth and protect the plants from injurious expansions during severe weather through the winter, when not covered with snow. The memory of every practical farmer, I have no doubt, will furnish data to sustain the results. If I am mistaken about the causes, I promise myself the pleasure of being corrected; and as it is an affair of ' temperature" pretty much, I promise in advance to keep in the best temper. Different soils may no doubt produce somewhat different results, which gentlemen will please recollect. The soil upon which the above conclusions were arrived at, would be about as followsSilex (sand) coarse and fine, and other insoluble matter -75Alumine, (clay) -4 Oxide of iron -9Phosphate of magnetic and lime -05Destructible matter at red heat -9Humus, so ruble in all ali, saline and other matters -25 100. W. Mcnai Of. Cottage Farm, Dams S Greek, Red. co, D, June, 1845. Preparati   Of For Sowi Of Wheat. The following communication from R. T. Under hill, M. D., ,on the subject of " the preparation of ground and seed for the wheat crop" was read and ordered for publication. It was an interesting practical instruction on that very important subject. 433NEW York, September 2, 1845. Of Dear Fri End : Being engaged to attend the meeting called for this day in the town of Greenburg, to form a " Farmers' Club" in that town, in accordance with the constitution and by laws of the Society of Agriculture and Horticulture of West chester county, I shall not be able to attend the discussions at the New York Farmers' Club on the subjects proposed at the last meeting' The preparation of the ground and the seed for the wheat crop" &c. The wheat crop is so valuable, so intimately connected with the prosperity of not only the agricultural, but also the manufacturing, mechanical, and commercial interests of the whole country, that we cannot be too well informed on the subject. And that has been well manured in a previously cultivated crop, such as corn and <a name="potatoes275"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, is, with proper sloughing and narrowing, very suitable for winter wheat. It is always best that the manure should have been applied in the previous crop, particularly if it is rank or recently formed; or your wheat will produce too much straw, be weak, and fall down. There are a few exceptions to this rule. One dust, oily fish, street manure, &c, have often been applied at the time of sowing, to secure a good crop. A sandy loam, with a good supply of calcareous earth or lime, forms the best soil for wheat a certain amount of sand or s il ex, clay, and lime, being essential to secure a good crop. When I say that the land should be thoroughly ploughed three or four times, and harrowed as often, I am fully aware of what is the usual practice, and also of the loss sustained by only one sloughing and two narrowings. I do not apply these observations to land just cleared from the forest, (though then, the more and better the sloughing, the larger the crop) or the prairie sod just turned over, but to the land in all the old States, and all lands long under cultivation. The object in sloughing the ground so much, is to turn under more completely atmospheric air, which consists of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbonic acid, a thorough mechanical mixture of which with the soil will insure a great increase of crop; it also acts as a manure. The thorough pulverizing of the soil, so as to make it fine, is secured in this way, which renders it so much better for the fine roots in the early growth of the plant to get well rooted before winter sets in, thus securing it from being winter killed. This also enables you to pasture your sheep and young cattle upon it in the fore part of November without any fear of pulling it up. They will secure it from the Hessian fly by eating off the larvae, It is also very important to prepare the seed properly; you should have the most plump and clean seed that can be obtained. Six shillings or a dollar more per bushel for the best of seed is no consideration, when the advantages are taken into the account. In a barrel or half hogs head make a bring that will bear an egg, from the old salt taken from your meat and fish cases ; or, if you have not saved this, ordinary fine or coarse salt, the former dissolving much the soon est, and is generally preferred for that reason. But in one, two, or three bushels of wheat, and mix well with the bring, and skin off all the chess and other foul seed and light wheat that rises to the top. There should be bring enough to cover the wheat three inches deep. Stir up the wheat with a stick occasionally, and let it remain in the bring three or four hours. Some persons let it remain all night but I think there is some danger of swelling the graino38A434; and acting upon the marina too much by leaving it so long in the bring, and there is no real necessity for it. Raw off the bring into another s ask, and lay the wheat on an oblique surface, so that the bring may draw off; then to every bushel of wheat add three or four quarts of fine airs lacked lime, and rake and shovel it through every part, so that every grain is coated with the lime, and the seed as much separated as possible from each other. (some good farmers use more lime than the above) If you have not lime, and cannot readily obtain it, use unleashed wood ashes instead. You must measure your wheat before you prepare it, or you will likely, when you sow it, put less seed in than is proper. You will also find it difficult, from the increased bulk, to hold enough each time in the "and. It is, therefore, better to sow twice, and at right angles; that his, take rather less than usual in the hand, and when you have gone over the field, begin and sow it over again in the same direction, (across the first sowing) You will thus have it more even, and secure sufficient seed, which is rarely the case. When you have taken pains to prepare your land well, use plenty of good seed a virtue rarely practised in this part of the world. The object gained by the above preparation of the seed is, first, you destroy all the smut, which is a parasitic al ll plan placed on the fury end of the grain ; also all the eggs of insects, that frequently maybe seen with a glass on the same part of the grain. The salt and lime also act as a manure to stimulate the germ of the young plant, so as greatly to in vigor ate it in the early stage of its growth. Hours, truly, R. T. Underhi Of, M. D. H. Mei as, Esqsecretary N. F. Farmers Club. Rai Of  Of Wheat In New Jersey. I will suggest the inquiry whether the culture of wheat might not be improved in this and adjoining counties, where the soil is somewhat wet and clay by, by adopting the Canadian mode of summer tilling ; sloughing light the first time, and the second time running the plough one or two inches below the first, and laying the land off into narrow beds or land sloughing up and down instead of sideways of any elevation in the ground, and taking care to keep open the furrow between the lands, that the water in fall and spring may be carried off, and not left to stand upon and kill the wheat. This is almost the universal practice in Upper Canada, upon moist clay lands, with a thin soil above the clay, where the farms are more noted for good wheat than in any other part of the province. Their new lands produce better and more wheat after a few ploughinigs, and several crops have been taken off. The first crop the straw has too rank a growth. E. P. Sessex County, . J. Proli   Of C Wheat. In the harvest of 1840, Mr. C. Spring, of To ham, Cambridgeshire, gathered from one of his fields eighteen very fine ears of wheat, (which
435were five, six, and seven set) the proceed of which filled a common wineglass. The above was planted the following autumn, and produced one peck; which was again planted November 3, 1841, and produced seven bushels and one peck; planted the same Sov. 2, 1842, the produce one hundred and eight bushels and two pecks; which was again planted in the autumn of 1843, and produced one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight bushels. Thus the increase from the eighteen ears, in the short space of four years, was the enormous quantity of four hundred and sixty-seven toombs. In March last a blade of wheat sprang up in the garden of a poor man at Shipbourne. It was cultivated, and produced 40 ears of corn, having2cid127013 grains. Another blade of wheat, of a different description' also sprang up in the same garden, which produced 26 ears of corn, containing 1 392 grains English paper. . From the Southern Cultivator. Whteat Straw A Substi   Tute For Fodder. This is the season wheat is got out, and I regret to see the straw is thrown out to make manure. I once had a meadow of thirty acres producing good grass, (feather c lover and a broad leaned blue grass) all of which made a very fine quality of hay. To save the trouble of feeding, and to furnish shelter for my cattle, I put forks in the ground, and on the     r placed poles, of such size and at such a distance apart that the cattle could draw lay. I stacked wheat st re in the same way, generally on the poorest spots in the field. By y cattle were turned in and permitted to feed themselves, and at pleasure to use the stacks as shelter, of which they soon learned the advantages. I found my cattle would use the stacks of hay as shelter, but would not eat any of the hay so long as the straw last a; Whichprovd to me, if they had proper taste, t that he straw was more valuable than the hay. My horses and mules were furnished with i hay alone in the stable, on which they showed, health and his al th rift. This experiment for some years was observed, and regularly this prefercid127rice was shown fo tie straw by the cattle; and they improved and looked better while enjoying the feed on straw, that\ when they were confined to hay alone, which was as soon as the straw was coicid127sumed.  I have never tried to feed the straw alone to horses, but I would not hesitate to say it is worth more than fodder. Cry it; save your own straw; it will feed and sustain cattle, 'horses, and 'rules, i and ultimately make manure more valuable than by the slovenly process of -throwing out to rot. D. Rei Nhardt.

Red des, esq, of Onondaga county, New Work, for the following detailed account of several experiments made by him, with great care, the past season, in the culture of I indian corn. They will be read with interest, and our readers will be glad to learn that these experiments will be continued, with the same exactness, the ensuing season. Mr. Red des says :the soil is a deposit e of gravel, mixed with sand and clay, resting upon a gaseous shale. The previous course of cultivation has been as follows, viz : In 1837, a crop of corn was raised on a heavy sod turned under that spring, and slightly manured with barn yard manure. The yield was estimated at 65 bushels to the acre. In 1838, corn was again raised, and without any manure; estimated to yield 50 bushels to the acre. In 1839,it was sown with oats, and yielded a very heavy crop. Grass seed was sown with the oats, which succeeded well. The next four years it was pastured. Plaster was put on both corn crops, and on the oats, and once or twice on the pasture. The ground was ploughed about the first day of May, six inches deep, and planted on the third and fourth days of that month.

It is proper to say, that i the cost of labor, for such small parcels, is adiflicultthing to determine with perfect accuracyrThe; s talks being of such equal value upon each piece, I have supposed it unnecessary to attempt any separate measurement; neither have I kept any separate account of the cost of the seed. for the same reason. The whole was plastered, but the expense being so slight, and costing the same for each piece, no account has been made of it. The manure is charged at its, full value in each case, though the land is greatly benefited for future a purposes. Hardly a quarter of its cost is justly charge able to this crop. in No. 2 we have an example in which the effects of the manure are easily traced through many years. The last maturing this piece had was in 187, and it now produced 60 1 bushels to the acre. To charge being blade against .it for manure, it appears to be profitable above every other experiment. But if the account could be stated for a period of years, fortaclh piece of land, as we have it for this year, I doubt not the manure would be found to pay fully all its cost. These experiments were made chiefly to determine how thick corn should be planted ; what is the most convenient form to place the plants ; and whether the manure should be rotted and applied to the surface, or ploughed under un fermented. The conclusion that now appears likely to bearrivediat is, that hills three feet by three feet apart, put in rows, so that acultivator can be used both ways, is the most convenient form for cultivation, and that six kerseys put into each hill will make the corn thick enough. I counted, and made examinations that satisfied me that at. 439 harvest my hills averaged five s talks to the hill; no thinning was done, except by insects and accidents. That this is not too thick, is prove n by experiment No. 6, where the hills were three feet by two feet, the product being 65. bushels to the acre, and with one half the manure that was i put on No. 1, which was three feet by three feet apart, and the product :only five bushels more to the acre. In fact, I believe that more bushels, with the same maturing, would have been raised with the hills two by three feet, than three by three feet; but the extra labor of planting, hoping, and harvesting, will more than counter balance the gain. The labor required to plough under u fermented manure, in any considerable quantity, is so great, and its great bulk, compared with its value, making it so expensive to draw; and the fact that it is not felt until late in the season, and that the next sloughing must be deeper in order to bring it all up and mix it with the soil are great objections to its use. That the next sloughing must be deeper, in order to bring up all the manure, is evident from the consideration that every time the soil is saturated with water it must sink deeper, unless it is held up by some stratum that is imperious to water. If the contents of the barn yard are piled up in the spring, as soon as the frost is out, and covered with gypsy m, so as to prevent the escape of any of its gases, and turned and replied at midsummer, and again covered with gypsy m, the <a name="seeds58"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of weeds will be destroyed, and the manure will be entirely rotted in time to put on the corn the next spring. The manure used in these experiments was but half rotted, in consequence of neglecting to return and re pile it. From the decrease of the bulk, the expense of handling and mixing the manure with the earth will be so much lessened as fully to compensate for all the expense of piling and rotating it. The cost of the gypsy m, too, will be but slight, as but little is required merely enough to whiten the heap. The corn will then have its stimulus at the time it needs it most; and but few weeds will spring up from the manure. All these considerations lead me to prefer fine manure to coarse. It is worthy of remark that in No. 2, where no manure was used, the yield was 60 1 bushels; in No. 3, where 150 loads of un fermented manure were used, the yield was 70 bushels a gain of 9- bushels, to be ascribed to the manure ; in No. 4, with the like amount of un fermented manure, and 25 loads of fine manure, the product was 80 bushels a gain of 10 bushels, to be ascribed to the fine manure; showing that one load of fine is worth more than six loads of coarse manure : while No. 6, which was manured with the fine only, yielded 65- bushels a gain of 5 bushels, to be ascribed to the same amount of fine manure; showing i that one load of fine is worth about 3 of coarse manure. But the land on which No. 6 was raised was not as rich as Los. 2, 3, and 4 ; eving to the fact that it was so situated in the field that it had not been as highly manured in those years gone by, when manure was only drawn out of the barn yard "to get rid of it." -los. 2, , and 4, were nearer the gate, and had been served about alike, and furnish the fairest test of the value of the different kinds of manure. Some of the results obtained by these experiments were unexpected. The highest yield is very far- below the great crops that have been reported. I know not why a hundred or more bushels to the acre were not raised on No. 4, with manure both on top and under the furrow, amount 440 king to 150 loads of coarse and 25 loads of fine to the acre; and that, too, alongside of land that, %without any manure. yielded more than 60 bushels to the acre. I purpose, the next year, to plant all of this ground with corn, and carefully measure the product of each piece, with a view of learning the effects of this maturing for the second year. Geo. Geddes. W. C. Youngs method. Mr. Young is a Kentucky farmer, and raised 195 bushels of shelled corn to the acre. When this was first published, it quite staggered the faith of eastern farmers. This roused the zeal of Kentucky, and the Dollarfarmer sets forth the manner; and adds a series of explanations, all of which we give. We must say that such a depth, for seed on stiff soils on any soil except the lightest and mellow est, and on these in a cool or rainy spring would not be proper. Either could planting be done in March in In diana, unless in the southern pa it, and then only in early seasonsd. I nd. Arm. and Hard. That Mr. Young did produce 195 bushels to the acre, we feel just ascertain as that we now hold a pen in our hand. It was measured by as respectable gentlemen as any in Jessamine county ; gentlemen appointed for the purpose by the Jessamine Agricultural Society. And let it be remembered that this was no first experiment on a single acre. The corn was planted and cultivated according to the method long adopted by For. Young, and his whole crop was pronounced equal to the live acres measured. This extraordinary crop was produced in 1840, a year very favorable to corn; but we are told by Mr. Young that in the dry est years the does not get less than 100 bushels to the acre. M" My universal rule is to plough my corn land the fall preceding the spring when I plant; and as early in the spring as possible, I cross plough as deep as circumstances will permit; and as soon as this is done, I commence checking off: the first way with my large ploughs, and the second with my small ones the checks three feet by three, admitting of working the land both ways. And then I plant my corn from the 20th to the 5th of March a rule to which I adhere with scrupulous exactness; planting from 8 to 1& grains in each hill, covering the same from four t sxriichesdeepgreatly preferring the latter depth. To soon as my corn, is up of sufficient height, I start the large harrow directly over the rowsalcid127) wing a horse to walk each side; narrowing the way the corn was planted; and on land prepared as above and harrowed as directed, the hoping part will be so completely performed by this process, that it will satisfy the mostskeptical. When, allowing the corn thus narrowed i to: remain a few days, I start my small plough with the bar next the corn 1; and so nicely with is be done that, when a row is thus ploughed, so completely willtlheintermediate spaces, hills, &c, be tapped in by the loose earth occasioned by this system of close sloughing, as to render any other work us eh les few a time. I thin to four s talks upon a hill, never havigcid127) to trans plant, the, second sloughing being performed with the mouldbearilt o wards th rows f corn; and so rapid li as been the growth of the corns between ti ho fir to. 441 and second sloughings, that this is performed with ease; and when in this stage I consider my crop safe my general rule being, never to plough my corn more than four times, and harrow once. My practice is to put a field in corn two successive years, then grass it, and let it lie eight years; a rule from which I never deviate. Now, I do not pretend that the labor bestowed upon a so field to put it in a state of thorough cultivation does not meet with a fair equivalent from one crop; but I presume no farmer will doubt when I say the second years crop from sod land is better than the first, with not more than one half the labor. The best system of farming is to produce the greatest amount of profit from the smallest amount of labor Now, what are the essentials of this method ?FirstFertility of soil, kept up by his system of maturing and grass, of which we shall not speak. Secondearly planting. In consequence of this, the corn mature s before the dry season commences, and every farmer knows that plenty of rain will make a good crop of corn in almost any soil. They all know that the essential thing for corn is rain, and there is generally plenty of rain till about the 1st of July. Mr. Young might plant his corn considerably later, and have it come up as early, and grow off more rapidly, by soaking it in a solution of saltpeter. Thus would the effect of frost and chilly mornings be in a degree avoided; while we feel confident, from our, own experience, all injury from the cut worm would be avoided. Thirdclose planting. Very farmer must know that, to produce the heaviest possible crop, a certain number of s talks must be upon the ground. It is often observed that the great sin of American agriculture is too thin sowing. Grass is nearly always sowed too thin, and the same is true of small grain. In England they sow four and five, and sometimes six bushels of oats to the acre ; in this country generally not more than a bushel or a bushel and a half. Hence in England they yield three or four times as heavy as in this country; while in this country we never hear of an extraordinary crop where less than three or four bushels to the acre were sown. Now, we venture to affirm that no very large corn crop was ever grown unless it was planted more than usually thick. In the crop of George W. Williams, of Bourbon county, Kentucky, the corn was planted in rows two feet apart, with a stalk every foot in the rows. This crop produced 167 bushels to the acre. But there is another important advantage of close planting. The corn very soon becomes so dense that the ground is shaded, and the growth of the grass is prevented, and the moisture retained in the soil. By this method of cultivation, no grass is ever allowed tu absorb the moisture from the earth, or to take up the nutritiousases which ought to be appropriated exclusively to the corn. Fourthdeep planting. This probably operates favorably by giving the roots a bedding where the soil is always moist. Another advantage may be that the roots are thus not so liable to be broken by the plough in cultivation. But it must be here noted, that by Mr. Youngs method the corn is "laid by" before the roots are so extended as to be liable to much injury from the plough. Fifth and last t will be observed that, by Mr. Youngs method, the so li is kept very friable and loose, and that to a considerable depth. His may be considered the all essential point in husbandry. One of the chief advantages of all manures is, s, to divide the soil as to make it that the 442 atmosphere, from which plants derive their principal nutriment, may freely penetrate to tube roots of the plants. In such a loose soil, top, it is well known that much less rain is requisite than in the stiff cold, close soil. For this reason, gravel, sand, or sawdust, is often the best manure that can be put upon a stiff soil. In the fall of the year, Mr. Young turns down very deep a thick rooted sod of eight years' standing. The vegetable matter in the sod will obviously keep the soil very loose for a year or two by mechanical division, as well as by the slow ferment at ion of this matter in the soil. But this is not all. The soil is deeply broken up before planting; it is harrowed thoroughly as soon as the corn comes up, and then there is a rapid succession of sloughing, until the ground is shaded by the corn, and sloughing is no longer possible or necessary. To doubt the plough is preferable to the hand he or cultivate or in the case of Mr. Young, for it makes the soil loose to a greater depth ; and we have already explained that, according to his method, the roots of the corn are not exposed to injury from the plough. From the Cultivator. Professor vanuxems method. Of. Tuvceia : Of all the crops which are raised in the middle States of the Union, none are of so much importance to the farmer as the corn plant, not only for its valuable grain, b tit its leaves, husks, and stalls, for fodder and manure no plant which he cultivates being so well adapted to hold the valuable parts of the faces and urine of the barn yard, from the pithy structure of its interior. Worn, for success, requires a loose and rich soil, by which a rapid growth is obtained, and is thus enabled to overcome the changes incident to spring, and its two ordinary and most powerful enemies, the wire worm and the g rub. The ravages of the former are, as we all know, below the surface, and appear to be proportioned to the hardness and probable poverty of the soil, preying on the main root, effectually preventing all production of the grain, if not destroying the plant. The g rub, on the contrary, cuts off the stem near the surface; its range of destruction more general as regards soil, but evidently feeding from preference upon the more feeble plants; and therefore, by complying with the conditions .requisite for a vigorous growth, its action i is but feeble. To, also, when corn is planted upon a sod, recently turned in der, the g rub finding still its accustomed food. There is also another observation which I wish to have recorded; being important to prove, if true, or to set aside, if false. It is the belief that the tendency of the i on plant is to produce a greater yield of grain in northern climates, and less grain and more leaf and stalk in southern ones no State in the Union producing such prodigious crops per acre a slew Work, for example. Should this be the fact, it will lead the farmers here, and further south, not to force the plant after it has escaped its early enemies, but to reserve its Strength and that of the soil to near the time of setting merely giving a healthy growth by moderate, and not excessive cultivation, previous to that important state of its being. 1 For the first years of my farming, the manure was spread in the spring upon a sod for corn, finishing in time to plough for planting. His. 443 plan was changed, hauling out and spreading it the preceding autumn, sloughing as before. This latter method appeared to be preferable, giving not only a quicker growth to the young plants, but evidently a better stand. I also noticed that the effect of the manure from remaining upon the surface for so long a period, comparatively, was to make the soil loose or mellow, and to render the wire worm and g rub no longer causes of uneasiness. The good effects of covering the ground in the autumn for the corn crop were fully confirmed on an adjoining farm; and the knowledge thus obtained led to the plan which at present I pursue. My neighbor commenced by hauling out the manure which was left after preparing his wheat ground, which sufficed for only about one third of it. He then proceeded to cover the remainder with straw, but did not finish more than one half of the part which was left ; leaving, therefore, a third part uncovered. The whole was ploughed in the spring in time for planting. It may be satisfactory to state that the field was perfectly level, and the soil of uniform quality throughout its extent, but thin. From the time the corn appeared above the surface to its perfecting, a marked difference was manifest between the two parts which had been covered and the part left uncovered, having examined the corn at the beginning of the growth of the corn, and at its completion. The parts which had been covered with manure and straw stood well, being unaffected by worms.  The color was very good, and produced a fair crop; nor could any difference be perceived between them (as the owner informed me) in the quantity or quality of the grain when hushed, so far as the eye could determine. In the part which had been left without manure or straw, the wire worm was so destructive as to require more than once re planting. The color indicated less vigor, and the yield in grain inferior in every respect. To experiment could be more decisive or important as regards the corn plant than the one related. It established two important facts: the great advantage of covering the ground in the fall of the year for corn; the other, that no difference could be perceived in the crop between the part coveted with straw and the part with manure; consequently, that straw could be substituted for manure in its culture. It has been an object of no small importance with -me, in farming, to attain to certainty, quantity, and goodness of crops, with the least expense of labor, and to obtain from the farm all the food or man i ire required for the various crops to be grown' That the latter object was possible I did not doubt; but in no way could I accomplish it so long as manure was required for both corn and wheat. Had grazing been combined with tillage, there would have been a sufficiency for both these crops; but the farm being wholly arable, there was only enough for one of them. From being engaged in r another pursuit which occupied me some years, and other causes diverting my attention from farming, it is only within eighteen mouths that I have been able to make an application of straw. By experience, therefore, is too limited to satisfy those who; require comparative statistics, but sufficiently so to induce me to believe that I shall attain my object. The field which was planted with corn last year was a timothy sod, of about three years old. it was covered with straw the preceding fall. The grass at the time of breaking it up, which was just before planting 444 looked better than it had at any preceding spring better than I have known old sos when manured. The corn crop equalled my expectations The same autumn I also covered four acres of mixed grasses for pasture, d having about half an acre uncovered by the side of it, which had been i in <a name="potatoes276"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and highly manured. The grass next year upon the covered part was the best, and better understood the various spells of dry weather which prevailed last year. Slardner Vanuxem. Bri Stol, Of, January 6, 1846. From the Farmers: Cabinet. S, Egreat Crop Of Corn. He, the undersigned, two of the committee appointed by the Clesterand Delaware County Agricultural Society on crops, do report: That we have this day viewed the cornfield of Asch all Morris, Allerton farm, nearest chester; that we have Calculated the field to contain over ten acres, and that the average yield on the whole field is a hundred and one bushels and it hide pecks to the acre. (did 127) -the corn was planted in hill 4 41 by four feet apart, each way; four grains generally in a hill. The corn was cut up and put into shocks containing six hills each way. Several of these shocks were taken down from different parts of the field, being an average in size, as far as we were able to perceive, and upon being hushed, yielded nearly three bushels aid a peck of ears each. An average one was shelled in our presence, and yielded one bushel and a half and a pint of shelled corn. Each shock having occupied 648 square feet of ground; which, being divided into the number of square feet in an acre, will give the number f shocks in an acre; this multiplied by the amount in each shock, will give the result as above stated. A portion of this field yielded even half bushels of ears to the shock, which will give an amount of over one hundred and ten bus lies to the acre. The committee will further take occasion to observe; that the whole field was remarkably clean h and free from weeds, and the soil appeared to be in a mellow sand friable condition.

' -the society requiring, in case of an award of premium for crops, the details of culture, &c, it may be stated that the i field was an old green grass so, not having i been ploughed for probably twenty years: Even years ago it was limed on the surface at: the rate of fifty blisters to the acre since which it has been regularly pastured. It :was broken up last spring, with the Rout y plough, to the average depth of about seven inches narrowed over with tire common harrow, and marked out for plaiting, as stated in the report. The planting was done between the first and. 445 fifth of the fifth month, six grains being dropped into each hill, and afterwards thinned out to four. When the corn was up two or three inches, each hill received a sprinkle of plaster; no other manure was applied. The after culture was done with the common corn harrow, and one going over with the shovel plough and the hand he, where the weeds in the hill were too near the corn to be reached by the harrow. Such of the merit of this crop, its freedom from weeds, and continued growth and vigor from the start, are attribute able to the deep sloughing and use of the Rout y plough. This plough, by its peculiar mode of operation, breaking the texture of the sod at the same time that it lifts it up and throws it over, pulverizes and crumbles to a certain extent the furrow slice, and by opening it into seams or cracks, admits a passage for the sun and air to the particles of soil, melioratingthem, and preparing for the reception of the crop; and when the harrow is afterwards used, the whole is reduced to a finely pulverized state, highly favorable to the action of the atmosphere, and the absorption of its gases, and affording no harbor for weeds, in the shape of hard and impenetrable clouds of earth, not uncommon after the use of many other ploughs. This field, when the sloughing was finished, owing to the open andpulverized appearance of the sod, and the interstices between the furrows being all filled up, allowing no grass or weeds to be seen, resembled one already harrowed, and continued mellow through the season. Paschall Morri S. N. Y. Farmers' Club. The regular topic of discussion was announced the cultivation of corn and Dr. Field was called on. He stated that he had made close observations during the four or five years of his farming experience, and had become satisfied that the old system of cultivating corn was decidedly erroneous, although he would not deny that farmers were in the habit of producing very good crops in old times. During his first year he had followed the old system, and he did not obtain so much corn from ten acres as he now got from two. The old way was to begin by sloughing, then to he, then plough and he again; and this sometimes done three times instead of twice. This, he was fully convinced, was a most injurious practice. In the first place, sloughing disturbed the manure buried with the turf which had been turned over, and permitted the volatile and nourishing gases, the essence as it were of the manure, to escape; and the process of hilling brought the roots too much exposed to the sun, and permitted too much moisture to gather round their extremities. In the next, sloughing cut off a great many of the little roots, which were all important in the process of nutrition. His plan was to first prepare the ground well, manure it plentiful ly, plant the corn in hills about three feet apart and six or eight <a name="seeds59"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in each, not forgetting to manure the seed in each hill very powerfully. When it had fairly come up he put in hiscultivatoran excellent affair of his own invention then hold again pulled out all but three or four s talks in each hill, and again applied thecultivatorsometimes a third time. He always cut his corn close to the ground 446 a. Dr. Under hill agreed that the cultivate or was much better than the plough: too much sloughing and hilling was very injurious; Therecid127) was no danger of maturing corn too much. He stated that common bog swamp could be turned into excellent corn land by first divining, cutting down the bogs, and then applying a light coat of four or five inches ofsandsilek being a necessary constituent in the :production of corn especially in the stalk, enabling it to stand. From swamp land thus prepared, he had gathered 85 bushels of corn to the acre_ As to cutting up corn at te i roots, that had long been decided; Judge Duel had discovered, several years ago, that seven or eight per cent. was gained in the grain by this ; while the s talks were worth three times the money-six or seven tons of excellent fodder being produced from every acre new Yorktribune, June 1 6.

As soon as the tops or blossoms of the yellow corn protruded, they were cut off, in order that the early corn might be impregnated only by the sweet corn. The result this year was yellow corn, of the usual size and appearance, cd year.  Her last years product was planted by itself, at a distance from all other corn. The result was, a corn growing about five! feet in height, having ears seven to eight inches in length, with a mixture of yellow and white smooth corn and sweet or shrivelled corn on the same cob fit to eat about the middle of July. 3d year. I separated the corn into two parts, the smooth by itself, and the shrivelled by itself, and planted them apart, at a distance from other corn. The product this year corresponded mostly with the corn planted, only there was a slight mixture of the shrivelled upon the smooth corn, and of the smooth upon the shrivelled. The smooth was fit to eat about the middle of July. and the shrivelled about a week later 4 th year. I again planted the smooth and the shrivelled corn in separate patches. The smooth was fit to eat 1 the     i July, and; :the shrivelled the 4th. The height of the s talks averaged about five feet i The character of the two kinds seemed now to be permanently established. The smooth corn produced its like, as did the shrivelled. While latter has the disadvantage of being yellow, but is earlier than common. sweet corn, and equallypalatable.

Having separated the earliest of the white corn from the latest, I planted them apart, and thus procured two distinct varieties of white smooth corn-one fit for boiling 18th July, the other about a week later. Upon the ears of the earliest variety of last years growth, I noticed a few scattering kerseys of white sweet corn. These were carefully picked out and planted this year by themselves. The result is a white sweet corn, fit for boiling 18th of July, corresponding with the earliest smooth corn in size of stalk and ear. My object in instituting this experiment having been to obtain a corn suitable in color and early maturity for marketing, I discarded the yellow varieties, closing the experiment in possession 1st.

Of a similar corn, but somewhat larger in stalk and ear, and a week later sd. Of an eight bowed sweet corn, with ears six to seven inches long, and fit for boiling 18th July, (in 1844, 14th.)The last variety proving to be the precise art le that I was in pursuit of, I have for three years past kept for cultivation that alone. It is that which I send you. A word upon the proper depth of planting I indian corn. A small patch of the early sweet corn above mentioned was planted last spring three inches deep. It came up well and grew thrifty ly till it was three or four inches high, but then came to a stand. It remained without increasing its height perceptibly, a full fortnight, while another patch of the same kind of corn grew rapidly. Ll examining the roots of the non growing corn, it was found that a joint had been formed about an inch and a half above thekernel, and that roots had sprouted out from the joint, leaving all below to perish. In other words, the plant had abandoned the lower roots at three inches depth, and formed a new set an inch and a half from the surface. While the process of changing the roots was going on, th e plant seems to have ceased to grow above the ground. The effect was to retard the maturity of the corn about a fortnight; but I do not know that its size and productive ness were ultimately impaired. The inference which I make is, that corn, to be early, should not be planted more than an inch and a half deep. Noyes Darli   Of. New Haven, Of, Aoveinber 18, 1844. From lie. New England Farmergreat Of Eld Of Cornfodderf We are indebted to Captain And all for the following detailed count of his extraordinary crop of corn, a paragraph respecting which was copied into our last from one of the city papersNEW Bedford, September 30, 1845. Mr. Bcid127eckdear Air: You requested me to give you an account of the product of a field of corn sow mt broadcast, that you saw when at this 448 place last summer. I should have done it ere this, but absence from home must be my excuse. Colonel A. D. Watch that man of all men for news has given some account of the crop in the Boston papers. I received a letter last evening from a friend, wishing me to give him all the particulars the amount of the yield, how the ground was prepared, quantity and kind of seed, &c. And, as I have been getting all the facts together, I will give them to you. I will first state to you the condition of the land when I took possession of it in March, 184.2, There were two acres and about thirty-two rods it was very full of, rocks and small stones, and had been cropped by antique farming, until it would not produce provender sufficient in one year to feed a pair of sheep during that space of time; and such was its condition in July, 1844. At that time, I put it out to clear up and wall by contract; and my specifications provided that every stone that a plough would hit, at a depth of ten inches below the surface, should be removed by men following the plough with iron bars, and that the ground should be g rubbed up to the walls to that depth. The contractor ploughed the land one foot deep, j narrowed it twice with a heavy jointed harrow, picked up and carted off all the stones, and finished his work as per contract, and to my satisfaction, about the middle of April. I then had the land ploughed across the old furrows by a heavy pair of oxen and one horse, followed by two pairs of oxen on a sub soil plough, that run on an average 16 inches deep, with men following with iron bars, to remove any stones hit by the sub soil plough. After thus sloughing, the ground was well harrowed by a heavy jointed harrow, the teeth of which are 61 inches long, and the stones all picked up and carted off. Thirty-five tons of manure were then put on to the acre, and uniformly spread. Said manure was the droppings of 20 head of cows and one horse, all well fed, and the manure was deposited in the barn cellar, where all the liquid manure was received and well com mingled by hogs. This manure was turned under about seven inches, and the ground again well harrowed by the harrow alluded to, and the small stones picked up. Men bushels of white flat Maryland corn were then sown broadcast on the piece, and once harrowed as above, and stones again picked up. Thecultivator was then run over the ground ; it was then rushed with a heavy bush harrow, and finished by rolling with a roller weighing 2,730 lbs. I find, by a bill of labor, that the work was finished May 15th. One rod square was carefully measured and cut where it was the smallest, and weighed, by a patent balance, 325 lbs. One rod square, where it was of middling quality, weighed 390 lbs. One rod square, where it was of best quality, weighed 450 lb s giving an average of 388 lbs. to the rod, and31St- tons to the acre. The corn was cut in the morning by a scythe, and one load carted to afield in the afternoon, where it was eaten by the stock. A load was carried to a small lot near the barn in the afternoon of the same day, and the stock were turned in the following morning after the cows were milked, where the fodder was eaten up clean. In this way it was all fed out greet, being a little wilted. The product of two acres and about thirty-two rods fed twenty cows in milk, or in calf dry, one he ifer over two years old, two stock bulls, grow and five spring calves, for seven weeks and five days. This was all the green food my stock had for that time, except what they could pick up Doc. To .40. 449 from a pasture burned up, in which they had run during the season. In five days after feeding on corn fodder, my cows increased their milk one can full, or ten quarts. I did not test the quality of my milk by my lactometer; but I presume it was equally as rich as from grass. I am a pretty god living lactometer, as I take about three tumblers full of milk, as a substitute for tea, every day, and I pronounce it as rich from corn fodder as from grass. I am satisfied, most fully, that the corn fodder, taken from 23 w acres, was equal to 15 tons of the very best of English hay. Excuse this tax on your patience, and believe me, dear sir, your obedient, servant, er tGEO. Randall29450
. Appendi X No. 4. From the Ciltivator, The Culture Of The Sweet Potato. The sweet potato (Convolvulus bat at as) was introduced into England previous to the I wish <a name="potato189"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and was in those days supposed to possess the qualities of restoring delayed vigor to the human frame ; and consequently more frequently found in the shop of the confectioner, than in the larger of the cook. It is a native both of Pain and the Angry islands, and was, a san ed able, in such bad repute that the renowned Evelyn, in his work on gardening, as early as the year 1699, recommends that <a name="potatoes277"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be planted in the worst ground. We are glad that we live in an age and country where we can say, plant sweet potatoes in your best land; though in all probability, in the days of the author above quoted, the promise of this root was such that it held forth no inducements to the cultivate or; and certainly time has shown that In glands climate and soil have proved uncongenial to its improvement. There are many, even in our southern country, at this day, who take his advice, and neglect this crop; from the sole fact, perhaps, that they themselves are not fond of <a name="potatoes278"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, not consulting the tastes of voracious hogs and cows, who, squealing and lowing for corn and hay, would be happily regaled with a satisfactory meal from the <a name="potato190"><mark>potato</mark></a> pile. In the south, we regard the successful cultivation of the sweet potato a san easy attainment. It delights in a sandy, rather light, deep, and well stirred soil, which must be located on a dry sub soil, though in some instances we have seen good <a name="potatoes279"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised on clay lands. A moist atmosphere, the temperature of which is warm, appears most conduct ve to the early growth and pleasant flavor of the sweet potato. From its great use in c urinary concerns, it deserves more attention at the hands of our southern planters than it has as yet received. The climate south of 36 degrees has been found admirably adapted to its growth and no crop can be planted which will yield more to the acre. The fine effect which they give when fed to much cows, should make it a favorite with all who delight in good milk and butter. When dried in a brick oven, they furnish the material for making a delightful and wholesome beverage in the shape of <a name="potato191"><mark>potato</mark></a> beer. The sweet potato also furnishes a large amount of the vegetable food of slaves in the southern States during the winter months and though they are generally cultivated as a provision crop by most planters on almost every plantation, the negroes cultivate them in the ground which is allotted to them for their own private use. Such is the partiality of the plantation negroes for <a name="potatoes280"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as an article of food, that, as soon as the season for digging arrives, they prefer an allowance of this root to any of the cereal grains. I need, it seems they were relished by our revolutionary ancestry; for when an embassy was sent, by the British commander at Charleston, to General Marion, in his swamp encampment, that chivalrous commander, with his characteristic hospitality, invited the royalist to dine with him. The table was arranged when he found "flesh, fish, and fowl to consist of sweet potatoes alone. He straight way returned to the British
451quarters, and expressed his opinion that it was hopeless to expect to conquer men who could fight for liberty on such fare as roasted <a name="potatoes281"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Mr. John B. White, a talented and gifted son of Carolina, has made this scene the subject of a national painting, which stands high in the world of art. In this picture the negro seems delighted more at the style in which his <a name="potatoes282"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were roasted, than at the amazed countenance of the tory officer. To the negro the <a name="potato192"><mark>potato</mark></a> is a blessing ; for, to the known improvidenceand carelessness of this race, it is particularly adapted, as it requires no c urinary skill to make it both ed able and pal a table, simple roasting in the ashes being the best preparation the cook can give them. It is frequently prepared for the table by baking, and makes good mustards, puddings, and pies the latter equaling rhubarb pies, and made much in the same manner. If the soil has been exhausted by previous culture, the land should be manured. My father, Mr. John Summer, who has always been successful in the culture of <a name="potatoes283"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, observes the rule to manure broadcast; and for this purpose, has prepared in the farm yard a com post, made by hauling in oak leaves, which, with the admixture of the manure of horses and cattle, furnishes the proper material; and this, when sufficiently rotted, is spread broadcast over the surface of the soil. The general plan, however, in the south, and that which is considered easiest, is to cow pen the ground intended for <a name="potatoes284"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, late in the summer. When the latter plan is followed, it should be continued during the early part of the winter, and followed with frequent sloughings, so that the manure deposited may not e vapor ate, or be washed away by rains. Slough up the land very deep in January, to which we would recommend a sub soiling to those who have the proper implement. Slough again in February, and in March repeat with a like sloughing; immediately after which bed up the land, with a suitable plough, four feet wide: upon these beds drop the <a name="potato193"><mark>potato</mark></a> slips, six or seven inches apart, covering them with a he, one and a half inch deep, with good mellow soil. It should be remembered that the proper preparation of the soil is of very great importance to the future crop. This mode of planting in beds is usually termed riding ; and simply to cross the beds into equal squares with their width, we can form <a name="potato194"><mark>potato</mark></a> hills by drawing up the corners of the q squares with a he. We have tried both hills and ridges, and have no preference; though the soil, when planted in hills, is most likely to be washed away by heavy rains. From three to four slips should be planted, in the hill. As soon as the slips begin to sprout, the ridges or hills should be scraped off with the he, which will enable the young plants to come up readily; and immediately after they have appeared above ground, the beds should be ploughed down carefully, and the sloughing to be performed as close to the plants as they will bear, so as not to disturb the parent slip. This will yield to the young plants that warmth which is so much desired in this culture, and <a name="potatoes285"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> thus cultivated will stand the summer drought s better than those which have been cultivated otherwise. Frequent sloughing, with a few times hoping, is all that is necessary, until the vines attain a length which interferes with the sloughing, at which period the ridges and hills should be drawn up with the he, fuller than they were originally, and in such a manner that they should be hollow at top. Great care should be taken not to draw any soil on the vines ; and therefore, whilst drawing up the beds, they should be gently raised by the hands. Must before the vines reach the bottom of the beds, a plough should be ran twice through the rows 42 in order to give them mellow earth to root in. This will serve to sustain th lines in extreme drought; and as the leaves are almost the only organs .which feed tube vous roots, I would earnestly recommend an abandonment of. the practice of stopping <a name="potatoes286"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, or of tearing the vines with a plough, and particularly the practice of n making a calf pasture of the <a name="potato195"><mark>potato</mark></a> patch late in summer. <a name="potatoes287"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> for planting should always be raised from cuttings, as they are generally more succulent, and ve get ate better in the spring than those which are raised from small <a name="potatoes288"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and hence large <a name="potatoes289"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, bringing stouter plants, are preferable to very small slips. The product per acre may be variously estimated. From two to three hundred bushes are commonly produced. My father has raised upwards of five hundred bushels of good <a name="potatoes290"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to the acre, and from two to three hundred bushels has been an average crop with him. They were of the dark mottled variety usually called the Spanish <a name="potato196"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which, for a general crop, we consider best, though any and every sort should be cultivated which are regarded of good quality; and, as there are perhaps more than twenty approved varieties, we are not advocates of any particular one. The y arms suit a sandy location, whilst the dark Spanish would succeed better on clay soils. There are several varieties with a red skin, which areiluch esteemed by some. The variety known as the " Bermuda" are perhaps the best early variety, and for this reason a portion of the crop should be planted of them, or some other favorite early variety. There appear to be only two distinct varieties of the y am, the yellow and white. Both should be cultivated by putting the slips in a bed, and drawing the sprout was they appear above the ground, and planting them in ridges. In this way, but a comparatively small number of slips are required of this variety. For all other varieties of the sweet potato, we would advise to plant the root itself 'the y am is easier preserved during winter, and late in spring is of better flavor than any of the other varieties1My friend, Colonel R. F. W. Ills ton, of Georgetown, during the past season, tried ant experiment, which, as it is new, and upon the whole has succeeded admirably, I will notice here. The land was laid off in beds four feet apart, and upon these the seed were planted, by laying them on the level ground eight inches apart, and covered over with " tail is" (the straw, &c, blown off in win no wing rice) to the depth of a foot. In consequence of the severe drought of the past spring, the stand proved a very bid one; the sprouts appearing at the distance of one, two, arid three feet apart. The prospect; he says, for a crop, was very meager until the month of Built, when the plants which were standing grew off with ar vigor quite remarkable. In consequence of the drought a little earth was drawn upon the beds once, and the grass which showed itself was once picked off. The <a name="potatoes291"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were taken up the second week in November, and they yielded 283 bushels of excellent roots to the acre, several of which were exhibited at the anniversary meeting of the State Agricultural Society, weighing from four to six pounds. They were dams. But r plan for preserving g <a name="potatoes292"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is simple. A circular bed is formed S or 10 feet in diameter ; this is raised a foot above the surrounding surface to ii sure its being dry; on which we place dry pine, straw, corns talks, or pie bark; in the center i of this we set upright a plank tube, with a greatnufitber of li o les bored in the sides; around this tube the <a name="potatoes293"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are piled up until the cone is completed within a few inches of the top of the tube, 
 45 when they are covered up with corns talks, pine, straw, &c. and lastlywithSearth fig or six inches thick. The tu be may be closed in frosty weather by a wisp of straw. During mild weather it should be opened in order to allow the heated air arising for n delayed or bruised pot toes to escape. With this, and the addition of a temporary shelter, we have always succeeded in saying <a name="potatoes294"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> during the winter. We unhesitatingly recommend. th, at the same land be. planted in pptatopeseach succeeding year, believing that the culture of this crop adapts the soil for the increased reproduction of the root, and that the covering of the vines, when <a name="potatoes295"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are gathered, restores to the soil a larger supply of nutrition a than is consumed by the production of the crop. Of. Summer. Pomari A, S. C., December 18, 1844. The sweet poatoOur plaiting friends will find in the following article, which we extract from the " Vicksburg Constitutional ist" much valuable information relative to the above named common and useful vegetable: " We do not know a more valuable ed able plant, root, or vegetable, than the sweet potato; its productive ness is really astonishing wonderful. an soil well adapted to its growth, we have heard of 1,560 bushels being housed from one acre; we have known over 0 saved to the acres     repeatedly ; and we have evidence of 1,200 bushels being carefully measured from one acre of a field of ten, to decide a bet, many years since. There is no difficulty in keeping, them now nearly all the year; there is no difficulty or extra labor in the cultivation. Plants are easily saved and kept, and one bushel is quite though to plant an acre." The best soil for sweet potatoes is rich, loose, and new: stiff clay does not suit them. Deep sloughing' is just as necessary as it is for every other agricultural production. Met the beds be made just four feet from the centre of the burrows between; throw the earth up with a heavy plough as high as possible, and then the he labor will be light; make the ridges eighteen inches high and do not make them before your plants are nearly ready to set, otherwise they n may become s odd or hardened. The plants are often placed immediately in the ridges; this plan may do very well when you have seed in abundance to plant and re plant; but we think it best to bed the plantings in rich mellow soil. elevated so as to keep the water off, and narrow enough to draw sprouts without trampling them. When they put forth a leaf or two they are ready to place in the ridges, which must be done in rainy or moist weather; and the earlier after there is no danger of frost, the better. In this State the plantings may be bedded in the latter part of February, or any time in March, and the ridges prepared as soon as the sprouts begin to appear handsomely. They must be kept clean to secure a good crop; carefully needed, and the grass and wells kept from the whole fig d. After the vines begin to ran, then draw the soil well upon the ridges again; first sloughing carefully between. Sweet potatoes sell readily in all cities, towns, and villages. There is no better for for man or beast. Tie best of the various descriptions is called, in His iss i pp i, your; in North Carolivia it is well known as the pump kin Spanish.

With the. least attention properly given, 400 bushels to the acre can be produced; value them at 40 cents, (less than they ever have been sold for) and you have                                                              $160 for one acre, which in cotton is not worth over                              $20. Sweet potatoes cannot be raised north; and our steamboats can find markets up the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri, for tens of thousands of bushelsVESTALS Method Of Culti   Vati   Of Sweet Potatoes. Directions for sprouting sweet potatoes First: In a bed of earth, make a box by setting boards or planks edge wise on the ground, and put in of good stable manure about a foot in depth, over which spread good rich earth to the depth of two inches; upon this lay the <a name="potatoes296"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> so near as almost to touch each other, and cover them from two to two and a half inches deep with good loose earth. If the nights are cold, this bed must be carefully and season ably covered with straw, or some other warm covering, to keep the <a name="potatoes297"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from chilling or freezing. Uncover the bed the next morning, or as soon as the weather is warm enough. If at any time the bed become too dry, water it in the evening with branch or rain water; but if well or spring water is used, it should have stood in the sun during the day preceding. The manure put in the box should be horse manure, fresh from the stable, and should not be more than half rotten ; for if wholly rotten it will contain no heat, and of course will not warm the bed. There is danger of making the bed too warm, and thereby spoiling the <a name="potatoes298"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. To find if the bed be too warm, put your hand into it some distance below the surface. If you find it to be too warm, cool it by watering it. If the man pre be kept very wet, it will not heat; nor will it heat if very dry. It ought to be kept moderately moist, in order that the heat may be regular, and of the proper temperature. It may be kept tolerably wet after the plants begin to come up, if the weather is warm. When the plant is three inches high, it will do to set in the ridge or hill. Directions for planting and raising sweet potatoes but two plants in a hill; set them two or three inches apart, and make the top of the hill sufficiently hollow to hold about a pint of water. Met the plant a little deeper in the hill than it was in the hot bed. To not wait for rain in order to plant. If the weather be dry, plant them in the evening, and put about a pint of water to each hill; if spring or well water is used, it should have stood in the sun the day preceding, as before remarked. It is better to plant in a dry time and water them, than when the ground is too wet; for when the weather becomes dry, the ground will bake and retard the growth of the plant. The ground should be prepared when it is dry, and the planing done when there is a prospect of rain ; but if it should not rain, the plant should be watered. The plants may be planted in ridges; and when they are thus planted, place them from eight to ten inches apart. When planted in hills, put two sprouts in a common sized hill-one is better than three; if the hill is small, one is better than two. When the patch is large enough, they should be ploughed, for they do the best when thus cultivated. I plough mine each way once, and sometimes oftener. At the first sloughing, I scrape the weeds and grass from the hills and draw a little loose dirt round the plants; draw up but little dirt the first time you work them, for the hills will warm through better when small, When ploughed the last time, hill them up; do this the last of July or first of August. If the vines have grown across the furrows, turn them to the opposite side of the hill; he the side thus left bare; then turn them back and he the other side; never wind the vines upon the top of the hill it will prevent the sun from warming it as much as requisite to the full growth of the <a name="potato197"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The vines should not be cut off; if they grow very rank, I pull them loose from the ground and drop them down again this is to prevent the little sprouts from growing and encumbering the hill with a brood of small string y <a name="potatoes299"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I prefer this mode to cutting them off. The <a name="potatoes300"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not hurt by a light frost or two ; they should be dug as soon as the frost kills the vines, as the growth of the <a name="potato198"><mark>potato</mark></a> will then cease. If dug before much rain they will not be injured. If any person is desirous of further information respecting the proper culture of the sweet potato, if they will call on me at my residence, I will show them my <a name="potato199"><mark>potato</mark></a> ground, and give all further information. I am aware that the opinion prevails to a very considerable extent that the sweet potato can only be cultivated to advantage in the southern States; but I am satisfied, from thorough observation and experience, that this opinion is erroneous. Any quality of soil that will produce good corn will produce good sweet potatoes; and they will mature in any climate that the common yellow or flint corn will. If the weather will permit, I usually commence planting about the first of May, and I have raised good <a name="potatoes301"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from a planting the last of June. The mode of sprouting the <a name="potato200"><mark>potato</mark></a> in a warm bed possesses many advantages over that of planting them in the hill. If the <a name="potato201"><mark>potato</mark></a> is planted in the hill before the earth becomes warmed by the sun, they will rot; and at best, it will take some three or four times the length of time for them to sprout in the hill that it would in the warm bed, and the plant can be ready to trans plant from the warm bed to the hill as early as it would do to plant the <a name="potato202"><mark>potato</mark></a>, by which some three or four weeks' (at least) saving of time will be had in the early part of the season, which is a desideratum that is all important in a climate where the season is short; and furthermore, by this means a peck of seed may be made to plant at least ten times as much ground as it would if originally planted in the hill. Some persons, when they take the plant from the warm bed, cut off a portion of the <a name="potato203"><mark>potato</mark></a> with the plant. This I am satisfied is an improper mode, as the portion of the <a name="potato204"><mark>potato</mark></a> set in the hill with the plant is liable to sprout, thereby producing in the same hill too many plants, and of different growths; in consequence of which, a great many small and string <a name="potatoes302"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are produced, and none of the <a name="potatoes303"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will be so large and fine as if the pan t alone is set in the hill. The best mode to remove the plants from the warm bed, when they become large enough, is to take the plant between the thumb and finger, close to the ground, pressing on the ground with the other hand, so as to prevent the <a name="potato205"><mark>potato</mark></a> from being moved in its bed ; then pull the plant directly up : by this means the bed will continue to produce plants for five or six weeks. It has been contended that sweet potatoes will only grow in sandy ground, but I have proved this opinion to be fallacious. Round that is 456 1 c. No. 140.clayey, and even hard, will produce good crops of them, but it should be manured The best way to manure the ground, after it has been ploughed, and iflioddy harrowed, is to furrow it off is you would to plant corn thin take' and put a good shovel full of horse manure In the furrows where they cross, then make your hill over it; it keeps the ground loose andrew ai :and greatly promotes the growth of the <a name="potato206"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Good crops of <a name="potatoes304"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be raised for a succession of years off of the same piece of ground. I intend to keep on hand a large quantity of seed, with which It can supply orders from almost any section of the Union. Persons living at any great distance had better procure seed and sprout them at home; but from the last of April to the last of June, I expect to keep on hand, at my residence in Cambridge city, Cry ne county, In diana, a supply of sprouts, or plan its, sufficient to supply all demands. They can be sent a hundred miles or more, and grow well. Persons sending for plants should send a box or basket; a half bushel basket will hold a thousand or more. In order that the public may be enabled to form some idea as it regards the quantity of <a name="potatoes305"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that may be raised on a given piece of ground, I havbtakensome trouble to have some of my neighbors, to whom 1 had sold plants to measure their crops and the ground they grew on.

Henry Lbjlman, From the In diana Farmer and Gardenerpotato Crop. The, <a name="potato209"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop i has never been as much attended to in this region as in New York and New, England. We believe, however, that its value is becoming apparent, and that <a name="potatoes312"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will be produced to a much greater extent than hitherto, Reserving some remarks of our own to a future. number, we insert the methods of cultivation employed by eminent cultivates. Spurriers method of cultivation" e careful" says he, "to prpcuresomegood sets; that is, to pick a quantity of the best kind of <a name="potatoes313"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> perfectly sound and of a tolerable large size; these are to be prepared for planting by cutting each root into two, three, and more pieces, minding particularly that each piece be furnished with at least one or two eyes, which is sufficient. 1 being thus prepared, they are to be planted in rows not less than eighteen inches distance; if they are to be ploughed between, they met: not be less than three feet, and if four feet apart the more eligible" The best method I have found by experience is to make; a trench ,either with the spade or plough, about five inches deep, and putting long dungprstracid127at the bottom, and laying the sets on it at their proper distances, which is from nine to twelve inches apart, covering them with monqldThey must he kept clean from weeds. I. Koighos plan l in recommends the planting of whole <a name="potatoes314"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and those only which are of fine medium size none to be of less weight than four ou n ces. The early sorts, and, indeed, all which seldom attain a greater height than two feet, are to be planted about four or five inghteapart in the rows, centre from centre, the crown ends upwards, the rows the from to feet six inches to three feet as na der The late <a name="potatoes315"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, Whichprodiuwp haul m above thee: feet; in height, are to. be pladtedfiwe or six 458 inches apart, centre from centre, in rows four or five feet asunder. The <a name="potatoes316"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to point north and south, and to be well manuredMakenziesplan" Work the ground until it is completely reduced and free from root weeds. Three sloughings, with frequent narrowings and rollings, are necessary in both cases, before the land is in a suitable condition. When this is accomplished, form the drills; place the manure in the drills, plant above it, reverse the drills for covering it and the seed, then harrow the drills in length< It is not advantageous to cut the seed into small slips; for the strength of the stem at the outset depends in direct proportion to the vigor and power of the seed plant. The seed plant, therefore, ought to be large rarely smaller than the fourth part of the <a name="potato210"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and if the seed is of small size, one half of the <a name="potato211"><mark>potato</mark></a> may be profit ably used. At all events, rather err in giving over large seed than in making it too small; because, by the first error, no great loss can ever be sustained ; whereas, by the other, a feeble and late crop may be the consequence. When the seed is properly cut, it requires from ten to twelve hundred weight of <a name="potatoes317"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, from twelve and a half to fifteen bushels, where the rows are at twenty-seven inches distance; but this generally depends greatly upon the size of the <a name="potatoes318"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> used. If they are large, a greater weight may be required; but the extra quantity will be abundantly repaid by the superiority of the crop, which large seed usually produces. Plant early in Maybarnums plan, Slough deep and pulverize well by thoroughly narrowing; manure with com post, de composed vegetables, or barn yard manure; the latter is preferable. When coarse or raw manure is used, it must be spread and ploughed in immediately. Stiff clay soil should always be ploughed the fall previous. May your land in drills twenty-seven inches apart, with a small plough, calculated for turning a deep narrow furrow, running north and south; lay on the bottom of the drills two inches of well rotted barn yard manure, or its equivalent, then drop your <a name="potatoes319"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, if of the common size, or what is more important, that they retain the usual quantity of eyes; if more, they should be cut to prevent too many s talks shooting a p together; put a single <a name="potato212"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the drills or trenches ten inches apart; the first should remain uncovered until the second one is deposited, to place them diagonal ly in the drills, which will afford more space between the <a name="potatoes320"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> one way than if laid at right angles in the rows, The covering may be performed with a he, first hauling in the furrow raised on each side of the drill; then carefully take from the centre of the space the soil to finish the covering to the depth of three and a half or four inches. By taking the earth from the centre of the space on either side to the width of three inches, it will leave a drain of six inches in the centre of the space, and a hill of fourteen inches in width gently descending from the drill to the drain ; the width and depth of the drill will be sufficient to protect the plant against any injurious effects of a scorching sun or wrenching rain. The drains in the centre will at all times be found sufficient to pass off the surplus water When the plant makes its appearance above the surface, the following mixture may be used : for each acre take one bushel of plaster and two bushels good ashes, and sow it broadcast as even as possible. A moist day is preferable for this operation; for want of it, a still evening will do." The operation of hilling should be performed once, and once only, during the season; if repeated after the <a name="potato213"><mark>potato</mark></a> is formed, it will cause young. 459 shoots to spring up, which retards the growth of the <a name="potato214"><mark>potato</mark></a> and diminishes its size. If weeds spring up at any time, they should be kept down by the hand or he; which can be done without disturbing the growth of the stalk." My manner of hoping or hilling is not to haul in the earth from the space between the hills or rows, but to bring on fresh earth sufficient to raise the hill around the plant one and a half or two inches; in a wet season, the lesser quantity will be sufficient; in a dry one, the larger will not be found too much. The substance for this purpose may consist of the scraping of ditches or filthy streets, or the earth from a barn yard that requires levelling. There convenient, it may be taken from swamps, marshes, or the beds and barks of rivers or small sluggish streams at low water. If planted on a clay soil, fresh loam taken at any depth from the surface, even if it partakes largely of fine sand, will be found an excellent top dressing. If planted on a loam y soil, the earth taken from clay pits, clay, or slay soil, will answer a valuable purpose; in fact, there are but few farms in the country but what may be furnished with some suitable substance for top dressing, if sought for. The hoping and hilling may be performed with facility by the aid of a horse and cart, the horse travelling in the centre of a space between the drills, the cart wheels occupying the two adjoining ones, thereby avoiding any disturbance or injury to the growing plants or. Barnums method attracted great attention at the east, from the fact that he actually raised from one thousand to fifteen hundred bushels of <a name="potatoes321"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to the acre! When this was first published, it was received with great incredulity; calls were made for the method 4 of cultivation, which drew forth an elaborate article from Mr. B., of which the above is but a morsel. It afterwards was stated, and the most authentic and unquestionable evidence a deduced in proof, that Mr. Magnum raised, upon experiment, at the rate of more than three thousand bushels to the acre. Now although the labor and the great amount of seed required Would prevent the cultivation of many acres of land thus, yet it is worth a trial in a small way; and if one acre can be made to produce one thousand bushels, it will be as much as is usually dug from five acres; and it is questionable whether the labor and seed for five acres are not more than that required by Mr. Is method for one. [d. I nd. Farmer and Gardener. For. A. Robinsons plane says: " If I plant low ground, I plough ty ground in beds in a different direction for the water to drain off, then harrow length wise of the furrows and small lands. Having a number of them, side and side, I take a light sharp horse harrow, and harrow cross wise of the beds, which pulverizes the ground and fits it well for planting, leaving a small space between the rows, which answers for two purposes, one for a guide for the rows for dropping: this is done by dropping in the middle of the tracks of the harrow, which is easily and correctly performed by any small boy. It also serves completely to fill up al cracks or holes, the seed lying fair and easy. I then drop my manure directly over the seed <a name="potatoes322"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and when covered up, the seed is safe from foundation, by being some inches above the surrounding surface; the seed lies warm under this manure; the rains drain into the middle furrows. I plant three feet distance. It takes the most of the surface that is pulverized to cover the <a name="potatoes323"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and by the time they are twice well hold, my hills are as I want them to be. They naturally rise high above the surface in the form of a sugar leaf; this hill is to turn off heavy rains, and it naturally keeps the <a name="potatoes324"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from being too moist, and they are often injured thereby. 1 have 460 found that three feet each way is the most proper distance to insure a good crop, I plant three common sized <a name="potatoes325"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the hill it is no i use to cut theft i; if ut small, the vines come up small and weak, grow fast, and fall down. The following method we take from an able writer in the Louisville Journal, signing hit i self Grazi Of :the ground selected for <a name="potatoes326"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be dry, where no surface water will rest. It should be rich; if not naturally so, it must be made so by a sufficient quantity of good manure. It should be ploughed twice, and at least twelve inches deep. And after the first sloughing, it should, be harrowed and cross harrowed; and, after the second sloughing, narrowed again; and if not very friable and free from clouds, it should then be rolled. The mould cannot be too fine, as on the depth of the sloughing and fine ness of the earth depends the retention) of that moisture so indispensable to the health and maturing of all bulbous roots in particular. The ground thus prepared, should then be opened off in drills, three feet from the centre of one to the centre of the other, and, if practicable, running north and south. When opened, if manure is to be applied, it must then be hauled in carts. The horse going down between the drills, the bed of the cart will cover two drills, where the i manure can be pulled out at intervals, in quantity sufficient not only for the two drills described, but for one on each side in addition; all of which one hand, following with a fork, can easily i tribute and spread in the four drills his don r, the ground is ready for the seed. I shall first describe the whole; of the cultivation and harvesting necessary, and then speak of the seed and its preparation separately. The seed should be dropped in the manure twelve inches apart; and as quickly as a drill is planted, the plough should follow and cover it in. The double mould board plough, which is the proper implement for the business, will cover two drills by going on ce up and once down the field; if the single mould board plough is used, it will of course cover but one drill by the same operation. When your ground is thus gone over, your land will all be in high drills, and can rest so for about one week, allen you must take a two horse harrow, and harrow your drills across, leaving your field as level as before your drills were opened. There is no danger, as some would suppose, of disturbing your seed. In a few days, when you can see your plants distinctly above ground, from: one end of your drills to the other, you must take your one horse plough, and go up and down each drill, running the land side of your plough as close to the plant on each side as you safely can, throwing the earth away ,from it, which operation will leave your field in raised drills between your plants. In a few days after this. you take your double mould board plough, and go down the centre of the blank drills, covering all your plants: nearly out of sight, observing, as you go along, that the weight of earth is thrown against and not on the plants. When, in some days after, when your plants are well over the top of your drills, take your scuffle an implement not unlike your cultivate or in this country, and for which the cultivate or can be substituted and go over your whole field betwseenthl drills, giving the earth a good stirring, and not be afraid of encroachinga little at each side on the drill. At this stage, a boy should follow the scuffle, and pull up any weeds that appear on the top or sides of the drills. I na few days after this, when your plants are strong and well up, you go down the centre between the drills, with your double mouldbawrd plan g, a. 461 the wings well apart, and throw the earth well up to the plants. His must sometimes finish the cultivation, if the vines have spread and are closed too n much, but generally the vines will allow it, and the crop bench benefited by one more shuffling; but this time take particular care not to disturb the drill at the bottom, as the bulbs, are now forming and spreading ; then gently run your double mould. board plough through the whole field again, narrowing the wings of it, which will have the effect of adding the earth, and compressing it to the bottom of the drill, where the bulb are forming, rather than throwing it up to the stalk at top, where there is sufficient already. This finished the cultivation To prepare the seed, you must select well shaped, even <a name="potatoes327"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, not too small nor too large. But them, leaving one good eye at least to every set prepare them from two to three weeks, at least, before you plant; and each day as you cut, roll your sets in pulverized lime, and spread them on the barn floor to dry; when dry, heap them in a corner till taken out to plant. If this plan is pursued, and the ground selected and prepared as directed, you may rest satisfied that so sure as the laws of feature are invariable, and that like effects follow like causes, as sure will a good and sound crop of <a name="potatoes328"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> be produced in this climate, with no variation in the result except what may be occasioned by the vicissitudes of the season men tons of <a name="potatoes329"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, two thousand two hundred and forty pounds to the ton, is considered a fair trop in I re land. Twelve tons an extra one equal to three hundred and seventy bushels the first, and four hundred and, forty-four bushels the second; allowing sixty pounds to the bushel, which     have found to be about the average weight of a bushel here. I have grown. four crops of <a name="potatoes330"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this country, in two different situations and latitudes, (six acres the smallest quantity cultivated any season) Each crop was treated in every particular as here described, and in three instances out of the four I got a little over four hundred measured bushels to the acre. The fourth crop was only about three hundred and fiery bushels to the acre, caused by the peculiarity of the season, which produced an. almost entire failure with my neighbors, under their management From the Culiivator of October, '145oULTTiRE Of The <a name="potato215"><mark>Potato</mark></a> In Scotland. To the Editor of the Albany Cultivator :1 shall now detail to you the most approved practice in regard to the cultivation of the different crops, and shall devote this letter to that of <a name="potatoes331"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which may be regarded as the commencement of the rotation in the district in which it is rearedrThe land, which the previous season had been under oats, is ploughed before the winter frosts set in, with a furrow varying in depth from eight to, nine or ten inches. In giving the first furrow for any of the i allow crops, it is considered good practice to c leave down the ridges, taking care, however, to preserve the original furrows, if the land is not thoroughly drained. The advantages of this plan are, the levelling of the field, thus rendering 462 To e: N, 140.the subsequent cross sloughing more perfect and more easily accomplished, It also aft o' ,s greater facilities for the escape of sudden and severe falls of rain on un drained or rete native soils, and more perfectly exposes all parts of the soil to the action of the frost during winter. The land having been ploughed in the manner already described, and that when it is not too much saturated with moisture, the furrows at the head lands and the water courses are cleaned out, so as to prevent any water from lodging. When the drying winds of March have fairly set in, and the land is relieved of that excess of moisture which usually prevails through the winter, the field is harrowed so as to pulverize the surface, and is then ploughed in a direction across the ridges. This furrow is generally eleven or twelve inches in depth, or as deep as the plough will work. It is then narrowed with four or five turns, and rolled if found necessary; after which, it again receives a double turn of the harrows, and the root weeds which have been brought to the surface, and freed of adhering soil by the different operations, are carefully collected into heaps by bands of women and boys, and removed from the field. Should these various operations not have rendered the soil clean, or of sufficiently time tilt h, it is either g rubbed withFinlaysons barrow, or again ploughed, harrowed, and rolled, and the weeds collected as before. If the land has been allowed to become foul, or is of a very stiff nature, it is sometimes ploughed a third time, so as to render the soil very fine and absolutely free from weeds. I have found it an excellent plan, in cleaning foul land, to give it (prior to the spring sloughing) a turn of the Finlayson harrow to the depth of four inches then to harrow, roll, and collect the weeds brought up. The advantage of this is, that a considerable portion of the weeds are removed before they are mixed through the large quantity of soil stirred by the deep spring furrow ; and that portion, too, which being then laid under most by the plough, is most difficult to be got rid of afterwards. In preparing clay land for green crops, I have tried the following plan with success: As soon as possible in autumn, I plough and otherwise work the land, then open the drills, and allow it to remain in this state till the time of planting. The plough is then passed along the drills, for the purpose of removing any soil which may have fallen from the sides of the ridge lets by the action of the frost; the manure and seed are then deposited, and the ridge lets split by the double mould plough. A fine " cry mb" is thus placed over the manure and seed, excluding the air and drought, and affording a suitable nidus for the young plants ; and this in a soil which any amount of labor, by the ordinary method in dry seasons, would hardly reduce finer than a mass of clouds the size of road metal. The saving of spring labor effected by this plan is also an important item in its favor. But to return from these dig sessions. The field having been properly worked, in the way which I have endeavored to explain, two ploughs, each drawn by two horses, proceed to open the drills, which are usually twenty-seven inches wide. The manure, which has been turned about eight days previously, and allowed to attain a slight degree of ferment at ion, is then carted out and deposited in heaps, commonly in every fifth drill. A person follows the cart, dividing the heaps equally among them, while five s p readers, with small forks or ' grapes" distribute the manure regularly along the drill. These are followed by an equal number of planters with the seed, which they drop seven inches apart. After the ploughs have opened fifteen drills, they return and cover two of those first. 63 opened, in which the manure and seed have been deposited; they then 1 two in going, and cover two in returning, and so on; thus there are in r more than fifteen drills open at once. By the method detailed, the see and manure are but a very short time exposed to the sun and air, while I am satisfied that there is no plan more economical of labor; for if there are a proper number of men at the dung hill, not an instant of the time of any individual in the field is lost. Thus, if the dung hills are conveniently placed, two ploughs, three carts, three men filling manure, one boy driving, and one man dragging out the heaps, in addition to the field workers already mentioned, will finish, in the best style, three Scots acres per day, supposing such were to receive forty tons of manure, about the average quantity allowed. The planting of each field is concluded by working and planting the head lands, cleaning the hedge roots or bottoms of walls, and planting, by the spade, the corners, as well as all other places not accessible to the ploughs. The beginning of May is as late as it is considered prudent to plant. The <a name="potatoes332"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> used for sets or seed, as they are termed, are for the most part brought from some of the high, cold districts, where the land has been lately reclaimed from a state of nature. Those from moss are most esteemed. Peebleshire and the upper ward of Lanarkshire furnish a large portion of those used in Midlothian. As the price generally exceeds the ordinary market rates, while the Lothman farmers themselves do the half of the cart age, the raising of <a name="potatoes333"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for seed has of late years added very much to the resources of the farmers in these bleak moor land districts. New subjects have attracted more attention in the agricultural world than the cause of the failure of the <a name="potato216"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, but it still seems hid in impenetrable mystery. It is now a well ascertained fact, that <a name="potatoes334"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grown in the <a name="potato217"><mark>potato</mark></a> districts of the Lothians will not reproduce themselves in a healthy manner. I observe in a late number of the " American Agriculturists" what I have heard also stated in this country, that the application of manure in the drill tends to increase the destructive effects of rot. His must take leave to doubt, as on the only farms in this parish, which have entirely escaped this scourge, the manure is never applied in any other manner. It is of the utmost consequence that the seed should not be kept in large heaps, neither before nor after cutting, as ferment at ion is easily induced, and I am aware has often taken place when little suspected. The quantity of seed used for an acre is four fifths of a ton. Soon after planting, the drills are rolled with a light roller; and when the stems are within a short distance of the surface, they are saddle narrowed. By this means the annual weeds which may have terminated are destroyed, and before another br aird can make its appearance the crop is ready for the he. Whenever the rows can be distinctly traced, a drill g rubber is passed down between them, being adjusted, by means of its screw, to go as close to the young plants as is consistent with their safety. They are then immediately hand hold, and in the course of ten days they are again horse and hand hold, and slightly moulded with the double mould plough. The growth is now very rapid, and just before the stems from the contiguous drills begin to meet, the g rubber is again passed between the rows this time narrowly set, and drawn by two horses, so as to loose n the soil to as great a depth as possible. They are now finally earthed up; and if the crop is good, the stems soon begin to inter lace, and in a week or two present ran u -broken surface of leaves and bloom 464 a. Early in October, the crop is raised either with the fork or plough, and stored partly in houses arid partly in long conical heaps on the surface of the gr out id, which are slightly covered with straw, and then with earth to the depth of six or eight inches. The earth for this purpose is obtained by digging a trench along the sides of the heap, thus forming a drain which prevents any water from lodging in the interior. These heaps or "t pits, "asbihey are termed, are i generally from five to five and a half fe t in width, and four feet in height, and are occasionally of great length, containingso0netimies 6,000 bushels. The yield of this crop varies from eight to fourteen tons, but there have been instances of eighteen and twenty tons per Scots acre of market able <a name="potatoes335"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being raised n the district around Edinburgh, the <a name="potato218"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is of the first importance. This will be readily understood, when I mention that here four contiguous farms have always 200 or 220 acres under it; and as the manure, when brought to the field, does not cost less than 7s. per ton, it will be seen that if to this we add rent, seed, and labor, a sum little short of 1 200 is involved in the growth of fifty acres, exclusive altogether of any profit. The price which has been obtained for these two years past was 45s. per ton, but some years it has reached 60s. and 80s. The moderate price of late years has been in a great measure owing to the low price of o at meal, and a considerable importation from I re land. The use of portable manures is gaining ground greatly as an auxiliaryto the ordinary manure. Pua no on any soil at the rate of three or four cut. per acre, and rape dust on strong soils, at the rate of six or eight cut, 'sow in n the drills above the dung, are found to yield a very remuneraiing profit. Mixtures, containing the elements of the stem and tubes, have also been applied with great success, and as chemistry advances they will no doubt be much more commonly used. As our scientific knowledge becomes more perfect, and more diffused, those unsuccessful attempts attheapplipation of principles to practice will be more rare; and when they do occur, instead of throwing discredit on science, and producing doubt and hesitation, they will be referred to the true cause the errors or what of knowledge of the operator.

Dear In As requested, and to aid you in your very land able and praiseworthy undertaking, in dissemination g over the country intelligence and improvement is in agriculture, I give you my experience and observations on the subject of the round or I wish <a name="potato219"><mark>potato</mark></a>, being fully satisfied that for my any years the demand for them would increase, and their importance for the use of man be more fully demonstrated; under such impressions, I turned my attention to the culture and best manner of preserving them for fairly use and for trans plan ti g 1st. I have formed a clay soil, well manured from the cow pen or horses table, in October or November, and ploughed in immediately from four to eight inches deep, (a cow pen or horse lot, ploughed in the spring, where. 465 cows, hogs, and horses have been penned during the season and again coughed in the fall, and lay over to be mellowed by the, frost, is better) to lay over until spring, then prepared, at the season for planting, in drills three feet apart. Have a com post prepared of reached ashes, burnt earth, chaff, or short straw, and scatter in the drill, on which drop your <a name="potato220"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Small or middle sized <a name="potatoes336"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should not be cut, and large <a name="potatoes337"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> not more than once, (making two pieces) commencing to cut at the stem end, and cutting them length wise. The <a name="potato221"><mark>potato</mark></a> should not be covered deep; and in dressing them, no additional earth should be drawn about, the stalk after it is above the ground. They should be kept clear of weeds or grass by hand wedding, if necessary. If your <a name="potato222"><mark>potato</mark></a> field be properly prepared before planting, but little labor is required for their cultivation the less the better. To soon as your <a name="potatoes338"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are ripe, (which may be known by the dying of the vines or stalk) have them taken up in dry weather, and put into boxes or barrels, in dry sand, which must be clear of any vegetable matter or earthy substance. Have your boxes or barrels then placed in some cool place, that is dry and airy, until winter or very cold weather; then remove them to a dry cellar, or other place, not too warm. Thus stored, they will keep a year without sprouting; when taken out for use, they will be found full, meal y, and the flavor much improved retaining all their original fullness. When planted, after being preserved in this way, they give nourishment to the young plant, and aid greatly in bringing forth good healthy new <a name="potatoes339"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Great care should be taken, when harvesting the <a name="potatoes340"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, to select none but the best and ripe st for seed and family use the small and unripe should be selected for the use of the stock. The round <a name="potatoes341"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are better and more profitable in high latitudes, and north of the thirty-sixth degree of north latitude in North America; south of that they degenerate after the. first year. Need taken from the north to the south does well for early <a name="potatoes342"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the first season, but will not do for transplanting. It is important that the growers of the <a name="potato223"><mark>potato</mark></a>, who desire a continuance of healthy, sound <a name="potatoes343"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, should look to their <a name="potato224"><mark>potato</mark></a> vines or s talks, and when the balls are fully ripe on the s talks, (which will be known by the s talks dying) gather them, wash the seed in clear water, and place them to dry, secure from insects; when dry, put them in a dry place until spring. Have prepared a bed in the garden, and put the seed in drills eighteen inches apart; cover them with earth well pulverized, not deep. Deep the weeds and grass from about the young s talks. They will show the time for gathering by; the dying of the vine ; then take them up and place them in clean sand until the next spring; then plant them in good soil with com post, as directed in the first part of this communication. When you take them up, you will discover perhaps a dozen varieties and colors. You should no was sort them, and put each kind to itself, in sand. They do not come to perfection for use until the third year. Plant each kind by itself, not together, the third year, as directed, and you will discover, when you take them up, the <a name="potatoes344"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that will be most productive, and useful for family purposes which may be preserved for use and planting. Those less productive maybe tried on other soils, and prove good. This done, and pursuing the directions here with, your <a name="potatoes345"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will continue perfect many years. You will hear of no failures of crops, or diseased <a name="potatoes346"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Haziness and want of at30466
tention to the proper culture of this invaluable vegetable are the causes of failure. I never had a far hire of crop; always plenty, and good, for myself and neighbors. Nothing but adversity and a scourge on man will make him show his energies : it is necessary, or the great Author of all good would not send it upon us. Your friend, U Jno. A. Rogers. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents, Washington, D. C. From the New England Farmer. Culture Of <a name="potatoes347"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. S. Kidney, of Piqua, Ohio, successfully cultivates <a name="potatoes348"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on the following plan : Plant in hills, and when the <a name="potatoes349"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are about an inch out of the ground, take a light plough and run it so close to them as to cover them lightly with earth. When they get through this an inch or so, cross plough them, covering up as before. This mode is stated to be equal to the best hoping, besides being a great saving of labor. Mr. W. states that he has practised this mode for several years, and has never lost a hill or had them at all injured by covering. From the New England Farmer. Culti   Vati   Of Of <a name="potatoes350"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Mr. Breckdear Air : I observed in the last number of the Farmer an account of the plan by which Mr. Kidney, of Ohio, successfully cultivated his <a name="potatoes351"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It augury well when even one person has the fortitude to step beyond the barriers of any ancient system, which may have nothing to recommend it but its antiquity; and it must be no small degree of pleasure to such person if his plan proves successful; for, besides the pecuniary advantage to himself, it saves him from the ridicule of the friends of " the good old way" and they are neither few nor far between. In reading Mr. Is account, a thought suggested itself to my mind to give you an account of a plan which I have practised with success; but I am not the patentee, nor do I know to whom the honor of originating it belongs. All I know is, that it was the common mode of cultivating <a name="potatoes352"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in Scotland twenty years ago, and I did not learn that it was new at that time. The plan is as follows: After the ground is properly prepared for planting, fir rows or trenches, or whatever you please to call them, are opened with the plough, into which the manure is put, and the <a name="potatoes353"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted either whole or cut. If cut, they may be planted from 4 to 10 or 12 inches apart in the furrow; if whole, from 12 to 18 inches apart. The distance should vary according to the fertility of the soil and the quantity and quality of the manure used, and also according to the kind of <a name="potato225"><mark>potato</mark></a> and the purposes for which they are intended to be raised. The distance between. 467 the. furrows or drills (as they are called) should not be less than 30 inches. Utter the <a name="potatoes354"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are planted, they are covered with the plough, and in a dry season it is a good plan to roll the drills, in order to prevent the moisture from escaping; but in a wet season rolling should be omitted. By compressing the earth about the seed it vegetables quicker, a thing of the utmost importance in the present diseased state of the <a name="potato226"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant. If any doubts are entertained of the vegetative powers of the seed, it should be planted when the land is in a moist state. In very dry weather the morning and the evening is the best time; or if a damp day occurs, it should be taken advantage of for that purpose, and in all cases the seed should be covered immediately after planting; for a <a name="potato227"><mark>potato</mark></a> with weak powers of vegetation, when planted i under such circumstances, and on well ferment ed manure, will grow well, when the same <a name="potato228"><mark>potato</mark></a>, if planted in dry weather, and on un fermented manure, and exposed for some time to the influence of a hot sun, would rot before it would ve get ate. And that is perhaps one reason why one portion of seed grows well, while another portion, in every respect the same, does not ve get ate at all, or comes up so weak- that the plants are entirely useless for producing a crop. (exposing <a name="potatoes355"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to the sun for a few weeks in the fall has a good effect in producing quick and powerful vegetation in spring. I have tried the experiment with perfect success) When the <a name="potato229"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants are about an inch above ground, the plough is run along the drills or ridges, and the plants are covered in the way that Mr. Kidney speaks of; and the deeper they are covered the better. After this operation is performed, a light harrow is passed over them but care should be taken to keep it moving lightly, by having the two ends of a rope fastened to the hind bar of the harrow, the ends of the rope being far enough to enable the person who attends it (he having the bend of the rope in his hand) to lift the harrow all off the ground at once, when it meets with any obstruction or becomes filled with weeds or any other material. I prefer a harrow so light, and the teeth so fine, as will allow of its being passed over then two or three times, as that will leave the ground in a morepulverized state, and the weeds (if any) will be better shaken and more exposed to the sun than if a heavy harrow had passed over only once. It should never be allowed to drag, but should be kept playing lightly on the surface of the drills or ridges; and, by using double reins on the horse, one person can easily manage both the horse and the harrow. The best kind of harrow for the purpose is one with curved bars, (after the form of the fellow of a cart wheel) with the teeth longer where they enter the side of the drill, near the bottom, than those which enter it on the top. After this operation has been properly performed, the ground is left in a fine pulverized state, and as clear of weeds as when the <a name="potatoes356"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted. When <a name="potatoes357"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are early planted, and weeds begin to show themselves at an earlier period than that mentioned above, the operation should be performed twice; but if it requires to be performed only once, I should defer it until the plants are above ground, as by so doing the weeds are destroyed, and before they can start again the <a name="potato230"><mark>potato</mark></a> tops will cover the ground, and the weeds will therefore only have a sickly growth. After the plants are three or four inches high, a small plough (a light sub soil plough answers best) should be run as near as possible to the plants, and the earth thrown from them. If a sub soil plough, or any plough without a mould, is used, (which are the kinds best adapted for the purpose for if the plough has a mould it cannot be let in deep, as it would throw the 468 earth on the opposite row) it should be let in as deep as possible, both on .account of the present and after crops. If the ground has been suffering by drought about the time the <a name="potatoes358"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are in this stage of their growth, I should prefer having them lying in the state last described just at the time the rain fell, as the moisture would get immediately to their roots; and if the earth is laid up to the plants in a damp state, it will retain the moisture about the roots for a considerable time, especially as the tops will shade the ground, and to a certain extent prevent evaporation. After the earth has been thrown away from the plant, the cultivatorshould be run in the space between the rows, to level the ground and to shake and expose the weeds. After this operation has been performed, the plough should be run along the centre of the space between the rows of plants, and the finely pulverized earth laid up to them; but care should be taken to keep the drill or ridge flat and wide on the top, for the purpose of receiving the moisture of dews and rains. When the <a name="potatoes359"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are further advanced, the plough may be run through the same track as before. It may not be necessary to lay up any earth this time, but only to renew the surface of that which has been previously laid up, in order that any weeds which were making their appearance might be destroyed, and also that, by breaking the crust, which had become hard on the surface, evaporation and absorption will go on more freely; and it may even be necessary to run the plough through a third time, for the above reasons. The above system is as applicable to the cultivation of <a name="potatoes360"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted in hills as to those planted in drills, rows, or ridges, or whatever you may please to call them. The plough can be run at right angles in the spaces between the hills, as practised by Mr. Kidney. The plan I have described is not so simple and easily comprehended or practised as that of Mr. W., and is therefore not so likely to be adopted ;but those who have fortitude enough to leave the ancient land of hoefieldand travel as far as Mr. Is system, and find it successful, may perhaps screw up courage enough to proceed a few steps further intothe depths and mysteries of cultivation, and perhaps find out a plan far surpassing any that has yet been discovered. By practicing such a system of cultivating <a name="potatoes361"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the ground is stirred deeper and is better pulverized, and lies loose r about the plant, and also kept cleaner and left in a superior state of cultivation for future crops than it could have been under the he system of culture, however well performed. And if the plan is properly executed, the he will not be required, except where the land, by previous mismanagement, has been well seemed down to weeds; and even in that case it will only be necessary to use it between the plants in the hills or drills. I have seen and heard of a great many methods for raising (or digging, as the term is here) <a name="potatoes362"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, but the best which I know of is to run a double mould board plough through the centre of the drill or hills, after the tops have been thrown aside, and have one or two wrongs, like harrow teeth, attached behind the mould, to harrow the furrow which the mould s throw out. By this operation, and by narrowing the ground afterwards the <a name="potatoes363"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> can be taken tolerably clean out. Another plan is to run thecultivator between the drills or hills, and take part of the earth away on each side, and then take out the middle portion with a pronged he. The latter plan will probably take the <a name="potatoes364"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> out cleanest. But such implements can only be successfully used on land that has been kept clear of weeds, or has had the long ones pulled before the commencement of the operation; for the plough or cultivate or would be choked in such fields as are not un frequently met with, in which weeds are so prominent objects that it would be difficult for a stranger to determine whether anything else than weeds is to be found. Respectfully, yours, Alexr Of Ckett. Lowell, December 1, 1845. From the Cultivator. Sculture Of <a name="potatoes365"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. L. Tucker, esq: In the last number of the Cultivator, you expressed a' wish that I should give a particular account of the process of culture by which I have succeeded in raising the unusually large crops of <a name="potatoes366"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which I mentioned to you in a former communication. There is nothing in my plan either difficult or original, and I am only surprised that greater crops are not generally raised; knowing as I do, from experience, that to produce 800 bushels per acre is, in this vicinity, an easy. and simple process; provided the season is moderately favorable. For <a name="potatoes367"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> I prefer a soil composed of sand and clay in about equal proportions, resting upon a clay sub soil. In such a piece of land, which has been in grass a few years, I haul out in February or March six four horse wagon loads of good stable manure to the acre, (about 80 bushels to the load) The manure is immediately spread and turned under by investing the sod to the depth often inches at least. About the last of April spread on the inverted sod about three additional wagon loads of manure to the acre. Marrow the ground well length wise with the furrow. Cross plough to the depth of four or five inches, and harrow again. By this time the last manure applied is well mixed with the soil, and the land is in a fine state of tilt h. The first of May, mark out the ground in rows three feet apart each way, with a large two horse plough, to run as deep as the first sloughing. A good plan is also to let the bull tongue plough follow in the furrows after the bar share plough. This breaks up and loose is the sub soil under the rows. A sub soil plough would, I suppose, do the work better, but we have none, and the bull tongue answers very well, as it loose is the sub soil and does not throw it up. We plant the " long reds" using large <a name="potatoes368"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for seed, cut into pieces with about four eyes each, and put four pieces in a hill; which takes about twenty bushels of seed to the acre. The seed is thus planted deep, on a loose mellow bed, and the ground, after the planting is completed, has a perfectly level appearance. The after culture is quite easy and simple. As soon as the plants are two inches above the ground, plough with the bull tongue as near to the hills as possible; if most of the plants a recovered up, so much the better. In two or three weeks plough again both ways; by this cross sloughing the earth is well loosened and thrown up around the hills, in a sort of hollow square, a little depressed in the centre, presenting a broad surface to receive the rains, and convey the moisture to the roots of the plants. The he is used to destroy such weeds as have escaped the plough, and to give the hills the proper form. Are is taken not to make those conical shaped hills which used to be the fashion, so admit 70 or ably calculated to carry off all moisture from the roots of the plants. I have found the long red to be the most productive of any kind of <a name="potatoes369"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have ever cultivated. I tried the Rohans two years, but found them to yield at least 30 per cent. less than the long reds. I have never tried planting in drills, and prefer hills on account of cross sloughing, which 1 consider very important. I know that 800 bushels per acre can be raised by my plan, for 1 have done it three years in succession, in 1842, '43, and '44. In the year 1844, the rot made its appearance in my <a name="potatoes370"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and I supposed that about 200 bushels were destroyed. Last spring, in addition to the other manure, I applied about 40 bushels of wood ashes and 4 bushels of refuse salt per acre to my <a name="potato231"><mark>potato</mark></a> ground. The ashes were spread with the last application of manure, and the salt sown broadcast after planting the seed. I think that the ashes and salt had some tendency to prevent the disease, as it was less destructive to my crop than it had been in 1844,while the crops of many of my neighbors suffered much more than in any previous year. Respectfully, yours, &can. Mccoy. Frankli   N, Pendleton To, A, January 10, 1846. From the Albany Cultivator. The <a name="potato232"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. Of. Edi Tor: In almost every number of your Cultivator I find something in relation to the rot in the <a name="potato233"><mark>potato</mark></a>, both as regards the cause and the mode of prevention. His, with us, is a disease of comparatively rare occurrence; and may, I think, be justly attributed to our peculiar method of cultivation ; and indeed, so far as I can understand: where this plan has been adopted no case of the disease has ever made its appearance. In the selection of our land we prefer a light sandy soil, without great regard to the richness of quality; this having been well pulverized, is drilled to the depth of from five to six inches, and from one and a half to two feet apart. At the bottom of these furrows, and at the distance of eight inches, are laid the <a name="potatoes371"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which we prefer being cut with from two to three eyes to a piece; the drills are then filled nearly to the top with the best well littered stable manure ; a small portion of dirt is thrown on this, so as to level the whole. The entire surface of the ground is then covered with leaves, (we prefer pine straw) to the depth of from three to six inches. It is to the adoption of this last method I particularly allude. The advantages of the straw are obvious; by its use is produced a more uniform moisture, as well as temperature of soil, which is kept perfectly free form grass and weeds, although no further attention is required either from the plough or he, until the maturity of the <a name="potatoes372"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; which, for their size and number, I have never seen surpassed or equalled by any other method. This plan, with us, although not universal, is becoming much more general, and will, I think, in a short time supersede that of any other. Thomas C. I Of Nes. Nandemond, A, July 12, 1845.oc. To' 140 o. 471 roth the Southern Planter. New Mode Of Planti   Of I Of Of <a name="potatoes373"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. We would call the attention of our readers particularly to the following communication. Dr. A mm, the author, is represented to us as a gentleman of great observation and of the highest respectability. In the course of a hurried conversation, he informed us that the pieces of <a name="potato234"><mark>potato</mark></a> were to be put three or four inches apart in the hot bed, and that the plants, or shoots, were to be separated by insinuating the finger and thumb as deep as necessary into the earth and plucking them off as close as possible to the old <a name="potato235"><mark>potato</mark></a>, exactly as has been heretofore recommended for the sweet potato. These plants are more hardy and certain of living than either sweet potato, cabbage, or tomato plants. There was another circumstance that the Doctor mentioned to us, which is not recorded in the communication; it was this that the rot made its appearance amongst those <a name="potatoes374"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that grew from the sets, whilst those raised from the plants were entirely free from any marks of this disease or. C. T. Motts: Since the great improvement in the culture of the sweet potato, by forcing and setting the plants, I have been disappointed in finding no account in our agricultural journals, on the like treatment of the     wish <a name="potato236"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Having tested it for three years, I the last season cultivated them altogether in this way, and had six crops to succeed well, all of which were drawn from the same bed in the 30th of March, 1844, I had a piece of ground prepared in the usual way, and furrowed with a seed plough at six feet distances. Twelve and a half furrows were planted with a bushel of Verser <a name="potatoes375"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, two eyes to a set, and eight inches apart in the row. In the same day, I had half a bushel of the same kind cut across the middle, and the larger, or stem ends, put on one side, and the smaller, or seed ends, put on the other side of the same hot bed. The pieces were placed so as not to touch, and covered with three inches of garden mould April 27th, harrowed the land, gave the planted <a name="potatoes376"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the first working, and had enough furrows made between the planted rows to set three and a half rows of plants drawn from the small ends of the <a name="potatoes377"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and one and a half from the large ends. May 22d, set one and a half rows from small ends, and two and a half rows from large ends." June 4th, set one and a half rows drawn about equally from each side of the bed." One 22d, set one row, and some few were set afterwards; so that nearly all the ground between the planted <a name="potatoes378"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was filled up. The planted <a name="potatoes379"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, owing partly to the drought, came up so badly that but for the experiment I should not have cultivated them; and I had peas planted where they were missing, to make the advantage in ground room about equal with those from the bed, which were set at the same distance in the row, and gave me the finest stand I ever saw." In the 26th of July, the planted <a name="potatoes380"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as well as those first set, were in condition to be dug. Of the planted <a name="potatoes381"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, twenty-four hills, taken together, and putting in all sizes, filled a peck, weighing fifteen pounds. Of the small ends sixteen hills, and of the large ends eighteen hills, filled the same measure, weighing sixteen pounds each. Of the peck of planted <a name="potatoes382"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the small refuse <a name="potatoes383"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were considerable, and about 472 twice the quantity contained in those from the small or seed ends; whereas, among those set from the large ends were none of consequence. The largest raised from the small ends weighed eleven ounces, (larger than any from the planted) and the largest from the stem ends weighed one pound and three quarters full weight larger by eleven ounces than any 1 could hear of in my neighborhood." I have been thus particular in the above detail, that you may judge of the leg intimacy of the following, among other inferences: 1st. Half the quantity of seed will answer for the same ground a saving of six to eight bushels (Bridge man) per acre 2d ly. Less than half the labor of cultivating will be sufficient, as the planted <a name="potatoes384"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> required two, while those set required butt one working, and it is easier to work plants of some size than those that are smaller( 3d ly. Of those that stood, the quantity harvested were nearly twice as great from the se set as from those that were planted 4th ly. There was no perceive able difference in the time of maturing of plants drawn from different ends of the <a name="potatoes385"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and set at the same time, although you will observe that the number of plants first thrown up were more than two to one in favor of the seed ends; and, in the second crop, this ratio is nearly reversed in favor of the stem ends( 5th ly. A considerable difference in size of the set over the planted <a name="potatoes386"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and a more marked difference, in this respect, of the larger over the smaller ends of the <a name="potatoes387"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which confirms the general impression in this particular. 6th ly. This experiment shows an increase in size and quality, which we might very rationally expect, from having each plant separate, and those of the same age planted in the same ground and at the same time Such as may be skeptics l can readily test this method by setting the missing hills of their next croropom those that have more than one plant. As the I wish <a name="potato237"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop now engrossed considerable attention, I hope the foregoing may not be without interest to your readers." Your obedient servant, "EDWARD Camm." York County, January, 1846."From the American Agriculturists. Culture Of <a name="potatoes388"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. The December number of the Agriculturists contained a short article upon the <a name="potato238"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, and an invitation to its readers to contribute facts relating to the cultivation of the <a name="potato239"><mark>potato</mark></a>. My farm is upon the banks of the Connecticut, and the soil is of alluvial formation. Such soils are not favorable to the production of <a name="potatoes389"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as they are too close, and hard en from the. influence of the sun after rain. The porous, moist, upland, is congenial to the <a name="potato240"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Upon our intervals meadows or bottoms skirting the river] we prepare the <a name="potato241"><mark>potato</mark></a> ground precisely as we do for corn, by spreading upon the green s ward coarse and un rotted manure from the barn yard, and turn under as early as we can. After rolling and narrowing we plant upon the surface, in hills about three
473feet apart in the rows, and make the hill as large as we can. We do not home i ore than once, except in wet seasons, when the weeds flourish. I planted one piece in the usual manner as early as the middle of April, and on the last day of May I planted another piece upon the same swell of land, turning under a good coat of grass to the depth of five inches. I then sharpened a stake, (not very sharp) which was about three inches in diameter, and put an inch pin through it about ten inches from the bottom, so that by stepping upon the pin I could easily perforate the sod. I then began making my holes between the two first furrows, about 18 inches apart, and continued to do so in every fourth lap through the field. I then put one medium sized <a name="potato242"><mark>potato</mark></a> in each hole, forcing it down to the bottom of the sod, and covering it with my heel. After planting the whole field in this manner, I went over it with the roller, which left the surface perfectly smooth. After the tops were three or four inches high I plastered them, and covered the plaster an inch or two with my he. Before the tops got to be too large     went between the rows with a cultivate or, and pulled the weeds out between the hills. The result of the experiment was very gratifying. The crop from this piece was almost twice as large as from the other. The <a name="potatoes390"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were larger, and much finer for the table, and cost me not more than half the usual labor. I would observe that this experiment was made upon dry soil, and in a very dry season. The process of decomposition underneath the sod concentrated the moisture, and the unbroken surface prevented evaporation. When I harvested (which I think should be as late as possible, and avoid the freezing) I found that the tops came from below the sod, but the <a name="potatoes391"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were upon the surface, some of them out of the ground. [shall try this mode again, and place the <a name="potatoes392"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> twelve inches apart in the rows. I have escaped the rot, although all my neighbors have suffered from it the two past years. I cannot account for it; but, reasoning from analogy, I have formed the following opinion: that is, the disease is caused by an insect. The plant may be too mature, or not sufficiently so, when the insect appears, to suffer from such attack; therefore we succeed best when we plant early or late. This same theory would apply equally well to the supposition that the disease is the effect of the damp, hot weather of August. In sowing wheat in the spring we know that we escape both the weevil and rust, either by late or early sowing; and I have noticed that the blast in the <a name="potato243"><mark>potato</mark></a> and the rust in the wheat come together. Of. Bellows. Walpole, N. H., January 13, 1846. From the Boston Cultivator. <a name="potato244"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Culture. I noticed a method of treating <a name="potatoes393"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which struck me as very good, especially on old ground. First, furrow the field both ways, and then plant in the check or cross of the two furrows; cover them lightly, yet deep enough to have them ve get ate quick. As soon as the sprouts begin to crack the ground, go into the field, and from the cart put a fork orshovelful of coarse or green manure on top of the hill; then plough between, turning the furrows together, and cover the manure. Always follow with a he, and see that the manure is well covered. As the rows 474 grin both ways, when time to he, plough contrary from the first t iii~ and very little labor is required to hill sufficiently and keep the weeds down. The manure is as safe in this manner as heaped up in the yard or field to wait the fall crop. It is not exposed to the sun, not is it as likely to heat and throw off the ammonia and other properties essential to vegetation, as it would be in larger quanties or heaps. In digging the <a name="potatoes394"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and sloughing again for the grain crop, the manure is completely mixed with the earth. I go heart and hand for putting all manure into the earth as soon as it can be got from the farm, whether coarse or fine, especially in the spring of the year, instead of heaping it up to rot and waste throw th the summer or.

From the London Gardeners' Chronicle. Pulli   Of Off <a name="potato245"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Flowers. We observe that a letter has been addressed to the editor of the Herefordtimes, by Mr. W. Rods all, strongly recommending all persons interested in the <a name="potato246"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop to pull off the flowers diligently as they appear. We beg to second that wish. All experience shows that flowers of the <a name="potato247"><mark>potato</mark></a> a reproduced at the expense of that organic able matter which gives its value to the tube r, and which is diminished in quantity in proportion to the number of flowers that have been fed ; for flowers must exist and feed on something, and that something is what would, if not removed by the flowers, descend beneath the ground and collect itself in tubes. The mere production of flowers is a loss; but the mischief is infinitely increased if the flowers are succeeded, as they almost always are, by the ferries. The actual amount of loss produced by each truss of flowers is not ascertained; but it is probable that if the flowers extract one ounce oforganizable matter, the ferries consume at least twice as much. Now, as <a name="potatoes397"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not grown for the sake of either the flowers or the ferries, every particle of matter which is consumed by the plant in producing them is a dead loss to the grower. The man who makes his <a name="potato248"><mark>potato</mark></a> ground feed flowers, prevents its feeding his children. Very ounce of matter consumed by the flowers is so much taken from the consumption of the family. We cannot just now lay our hands on any precise evidence of how much is lost in this way. Mr. Rods all assumes it to amount to many hundredweight, or even a ton an acre; but he is in all probability under the mark. A bunch of <a name="potato249"><mark>potato</mark></a> ferries weighs, we will say, half a pound. Suppose that each <a name="potato250"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant bears half a dozen bunches; that makes three pounds of worthless produce. An acre of <a name="potato251"><mark>potato</mark></a> ground carries about 20,000plants on an average; this gives 60,000 pounds of waste. But of this 54 324 pounds will be water, according to Mr. Edward Folly S experiments, and only 5,322 pounds organic matter. The latter, however, or two tons seven hundred weight fifty-eight pounds, would, according to this calculation, be the amount of loss sustained per acre by allowing the <a name="potatoes398"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to flower and fruit. a. 47 Admitting, however, that this is an excessive statement; supposing it to be wrong by even one half and it cannot hardly be so much as that still there is the most ample evidence to show the immense importance of preventing the <a name="potato252"><mark>potato</mark></a> extending its energy in the wasteful production of parts which are of no sort of use for food The above suggestions, coming (as we presume they do) from the pen of Prof. Kindly, the celebrated botanist, are entitled to great consideration. E. Farmer. From the Boston Cultivator. Of Removi Of <a name="potato253"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Blossoms. We have seen accounts of several experiments in removing <a name="potato254"><mark>potato</mark></a> blossoms, in which it appears that by this process the crops were considerably increased; and this seems reasonable in theory, as some kinds of <a name="potatoes399"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> produce a crop of balls equal to one fifth the crop of <a name="potatoes400"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as we have learned by experiment; yet all experiments do not give uniform results. Some cultivates say that they find, from their experience, that the crop is no larger for removing the blossoms; others say that it is less. A writer in the Ayrshire Agriculturists (scotland) states that he made a small experiment; and according to the result, he had one ton less to the acre on that part where the blossoms were removed. His experiment was on the cup <a name="potato255"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which flowers, but produces no apples or seed. It is stated in the Hereford Journal (england) that a farmer in West Lothman pulled the blossoms from one row of his <a name="potatoes401"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, 23 yards long, and that row produced 131 lbs. more than any of the adjacent rows, on which the bloom was left. We wish for our correspondents to make exact experiments this season, on this subject, and let us have the result. Letter remove the buds before the blossom forms. Take the experiment by removing the buds from alternate rows, and weigh the produce. As the qualities of the <a name="potato256"><mark>potato</mark></a> ball or apple differ considerably from the root or tube r, it may be that the juices destined to nourish the balls will not, on removing the blossoms, go to increase the roots. This view is not unreasonable. But it seems strange to us that the removal of the buds or blossoms will reduce the crop. And we think that there is some mistake as to this. We should think it more likely that in one case of the kind the experimenter made a mistake in weighing or measuring, than that nature played so singular a part; yet the ways of nature in some respects seem mysterious, and this is only because they are imperfectly understood. He are astonished at the lighting of a candle by the application of a piece of ice, or the production of ice in a red hot crucial e; but this is as must l in accordance to natures laws as igni t ion from a friction match, which, by the way, was one time a wonder. From the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, Kept. 13, 1845. Culture Of <a name="potatoes402"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. A great deal has been published respecting the culture of the <a name="potato257"><mark>potato</mark></a> ;but as I have seen nothing which agrees either with my practice or theory 476 6 c. No. 140. I will detail my plan: My own family well know: we can f buy none equal to those which I grow: and that on a stiff surface soil, over brick clay, at the depth of 12 to 16 inches. In every other kind of propagation we are careful in the selection of the parents so am I with my <a name="potatoes403"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I instead of planting, as too many do, just those which, in the spring, may happen to be left, my plan is this: When my <a name="potatoes404"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are dug in autumn, in picking them off the ground, the best, of a middling size, (or perhaps I might say of a size just larger than the small) are put aside for next years planting. It is not necessary to cook <a name="potatoes405"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to know the best. They are those which are true st to the proper shape of the sort, with a rough skin, but no cancer or other bluish. Such as has been said to the contrary, I am very careful that they should be quite ripe. The sorts I chiefly use are, as heaved for early, golden red or golden dun both most excellent) for second, and the pineapple kidney for late. The two former I always plant whole, at 2 feet apart in the rows, and one foot between the sets. The last I give three feet between the rows. The ground of course cannot be too light and friable before planting; and I always think it better to have been well manured for the previous crop; but if I use any manure for the <a name="potatoes406"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I put it over the sets. These I put in very shallow, (just covered with the earth) in fact, theoretical ly, I believe they would be just as well placed, on the top of the ground. When they are six or eight inches high, I draw the earth to them from the middle space, which, being tolerably wide, gives them a bank sufficiently wide to grow and mature their tubes in. I never think of having curl or mildew, or any other evil; nor have I any blight this year. I have today (August 29) been digging some as heaved, grown under the shade of large apple trees, but quite sound and good. Corylus. From the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, Dec. 27, 1845. Of The Producti   Veness And Of Tali   Of Of <a name="potato258"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Sets. I send you two papers of mine, which have appeared in the " I wish Farmers' Journal." They are perhaps too much I wish to be of any use in England; yet you may find something in them to serve the holders of allot cents. You will find that I allude, in them, to some curious facts, by which it appears that plants are productive rather from the space they obtain over ground than below it ; and that, on rich ground, which we might suppose better able to sustain a close crop, if its nourishment proceeds from the root, grain sown at very wide distances gives an acreage return equal to that sown at much narrower intervals. I s it that the ammonia, light, and electricity of the air are not in sufficient quantity for plants at these intervals? The strength and length of the straw would indicate a greater action of light on the carbonic acid. To plants, instead of absorbing by their roots their particular food, throw off by their leaves the peculiar matters they do not assimilate, and thus plants of different assimilating powers thrive together ?a? And where they do not exist together, may not the soil absorb them, and in part retain ?J. M. Goodi Of, Granary. a. 477 The following are the papers, B and C, alluded to by Mr. Gbon The Producti   Veness Of <a name="potato259"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Setsthere is, perhaps, nothing more worthy of inquiry than the differences which exist in the productive ness of plants under the same treatment, in the same soil, and in close continuity with each other, and without any discernible cause for these differences; and, with a view rather to draw attention to the subject than to the conclusiveness of results, I beg leave to detail an experiment made with <a name="potatoes407"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It occurred to me that the very great variations of productive ness of <a name="potato260"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants of the same kind of <a name="potato261"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and in the same drills and ridges, and in immediate proximity to each other, were not likely to arise from any peculiar property of the contiguous soil, or any gaseous influence in the air, but rather from either the manner of cutting the sets, their more or less exhausted state from previous growths, or from some internal construction indicated by the form of the <a name="potato262"><mark>potato</mark></a>, or the eye, from which the shoot proceeds. I submit this experiment with some hesitation, as from a mistake in over maturing the ground it is not so decisive as it might otherwise have been. I had it manured on the surface after the <a name="potatoes408"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> came up, not re collecting that it had been previously dunged, and. the consequence was that the plants grew with almost equal and very great luxuriant e. The rows were seven yards long and two feet asunder, and planted on the 30 th of May. This late planting allowed the first growing eyes of the <a name="potato263"><mark>potato</mark></a> to have made and lost some previous shoots. 1 say the first growing eyes, for it must have been observed by others as well as myself, that some eyes of the <a name="potato264"><mark>potato</mark></a> shoot earlier than others, and that some of the late shooting eyes (though generally nearer the stem of the <a name="potato265"><mark>potato</mark></a>) do not shoot a tall when a whole <a name="potato266"><mark>potato</mark></a> is planted. I have, by cutting out the eyes of the <a name="potato267"><mark>potato</mark></a> as they successively grew, not only induced every eye to shoot, but have even got a shoot near the stalk, from where there was no perceptible eye till the shoot came forth. From this property in the <a name="potato268"><mark>potato</mark></a> we may see how wasteful it is to plant it whole, as also the cutting it down in two parts, from the rose buds to the stalk, recommended by some. The first row was of the rose eyes, (three top eyes) s cooped out with a tea spoon in the form and about the size of the top of a mans thumb; the second row was of the bottom, or stalk eye the third, of the stronger eyes that had previously sprouted and lost their shoots; the fourth, of the later and weaker looking eyes that had not sprouted; the fifth, the scoops taken downwards, so as to take in the protuberance under the eye, and which, I think, may possibly contain sap channels of the eye; the sixth, s cooped upwards, so as to exclude the protuberance; the seventh, those projecting or nipple eyes, which appear to be the result of a later growth, and are generally an aggregation of small eyes ;the eighth, s cooped downwards as the fifth row; the ninth, as the sixth the tenth, as the seventh; the eleventh, deep eyed <a name="potatoes409"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; the twelfth, shallow eyed, having a disposition to appear as the sixth; the thirteenth and fourteenth, deep eyed, with a very deep eyed red <a name="potato269"><mark>potato</mark></a> among them: the plants of this red <a name="potato270"><mark>potato</mark></a> all had the curl, and were un productive. All the eyes were stooped the direction of the scoop being towards the stalk in all, except those otherwise stated, as either upwards or more decidedly including the protuberance beneath the eye 478 a.

I did not expect to have found the early sprouting eyes, so late in the season, producing more than the eyes that had not previously sprouted; and this is contrary to an opinion that has lately gained ground, of the advantages attending early planting, previous to the <a name="potatoes410"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> sprouting. The experiment is in favor of cutting the sets downwards ; but not very decidedly so, for in 5 and 6 there exists no difference, yet there is a decided one in 8 and 9. The deep eyes do not appear to have an advantage over the shallow ones, even where they appear disposed to nipple while the decidedly nipple formed eyes are very un productive. But the most extraordinary difference is between 13 and 14, in which 1 am not aware there was any difference in treatment or seed ; they both had equally intermixed sets of a red <a name="potato273"><mark>potato</mark></a>, that produced none but curled plants, with a few small <a name="potatoes411"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> under them. Had it not been so, they would, I think, have produced at least half as many more <a name="potatoes412"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and number 14 would at least have equalled number 1; and these are so much more productive from their being the outside rows in the experiment, I feel assured. They are a further confirmation of what I have frequently observed before, that the produce of a crop depends much on its having a free space above the surface of the earth and not below it. *a* *a* *a* *a* *now, 1 stated some time ago, in the I wish Farmers' Journal, an unexpected result in an experiment made, with other views, of a great return in two rows of barley, at a wide interval of three feet six inches, and in a part of another row, where a wide space was afforded it, these two rows giving three pounds 94 ounces, and three pounds 61 ounces; while none other of the rows, at 21 inches apart, gave more than two pounds 54 ounces, with the exception of the part of another drill mentioned above. These two rows, therefore, though at so wide a distance, would, in an acreage calculation, have produced as much as the closer rows of 21 inches. A crop of grain, then, might be grown in drills, at this distance, as weighty as in any other way, and a crop of turn is, par ships, or other low growing herbaceousplants, at the same time produced. This is found also to be the case In  beans. In the case mentioned in the earlier part of this paper, of my <a name="potato274"><mark>potato</mark></a> experiment, <a name="potatoes413"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> appear to follow the same rule of increasing productions at increasing distances. In the probable scarcity of seed in the ensuing season, this may be an Doc. No. :14 479 object worth attending to; on equal crop of <a name="potatoes414"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may probably be obtained 'with one-fourth the usual quantity of seed, and a very fair crop ofparsnips also got an excellent substitute for <a name="potatoes415"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should a diseasecid127similar to that of this year, which very probably may, visit. them in the next In drills drawn at 16 inches asunder, one row of <a name="potatoes416"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and two of par ships should te sown successively; this would give a distance of four feet for the <a name="potatoes417"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In beds made three feet wide, with a furrow of 11 foot, in like manner a row of <a name="potatoes418"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be planted a log the middle 'f the ridge, and a row of par ships near each edge. These operations s hold take place as early as possible in the spring, not only as the parsnipis a slow grower, and therefore requires early planting, it that the <a name="potatoes419"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be got into the ground before they begin to decay in the spring, which, I fear, is not improbable; for, in the rot which commenced in the neighborhood of Killybegs, in the county of One gal, about fourteen years ago, and which brought on famine and desolation to many, and for many years ravaged the country, the disease did not show itself till the spring, and it increased with the increasing warmth of the season; and this present disease, although differing in mode and in appearance, bears, as far as my recollection goes, the sam a perfume, and Communicates the same taste to the <a name="potato275"><mark>potato</mark></a> affected with it. I cannot too strenuously press these remarks on the I wish public, nor can I urge too strongly the absurdity of a nation trusting to one sort of vegetable for its food, and that one that has for these fourteen years been a failing one. We have a warning afforded to us this year. If we neglect it, the most dreadful affliction may fall on us and our children. What has been partial this year may be total next. It is a blasphemous neglect of the warnings of the Most High, bearing a false semblance of faith; to say, God is good" and refuse to listen to his voice, spoken in the pestilence. I know of no crop that can equal the par s nip as a substitute for the <a name="potato276"><mark>potato</mark></a>, nor one that the I wish palate can so soon reconcile itself to. I call for exertion. Humble as I am, let he not call in vain. Con Procuri Of Early <a name="potatoes420"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. It has been recommended to plant <a name="potatoes421"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> before the end of January, and my experience tells me it may be safely done; but I think an earlier crop may be insured by promoting the vegetation of the <a name="potatoes422"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a warm house; and I am told that early vegetation is assisted by mixing them with turf mould. I would scoop out the growing sets in succession as vegetation appeared. Thus, in time, the whole of the eyes would be planted, and a single failure could scarcely ensue. By planting sprouted sets I obtained in One gal a crop of well grown <a name="potatoes423"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by the middle of June. Last spring, out of 18 large cup <a name="potatoes424"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, weighing 7- pounds, I took 176 fine scoop, one inch in diameter and one inch deep; they weighed 4- pounds, and -I had 31 pounds of refuse, capable of being used as food. A statute acres, plan ted in rows four feet asunder, the sets being nine inches apart, would take only 1.4,520 sets, weighing only three cut. one stone, with a refuse of two cut. and three stones altogether 5. cut; but this refuse fit for food. It has also been recommended to plant the sets nearly in contact, but not 480 touching, on a head land, to preserve them till the regular time of planting out. When the rot first appeared in One gal, I secured, in a similar way, a crop of <a name="potatoes425"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on two acres of ground, where I should, in the common way of planting, have lost all. I made a hot bed early in the spring it could hardly be called a hot bed, for it scarcely heated covered it with about two inches of earth, and laid s cooped sets (which are more convenient for transplanting than cut ones, as they drop more rapidly into the holes made by the diable) within an inch of each other on it, covering them with about three inches of earth, and commenced transplanting them as soon as they generally appeared above ground. They appeared, though, when three or four inches high, to sustain no check, even when planted out in hot, dry weather, so that they were kept covered from the sun, when taken up, until they were planted. 1 planted them as deep as I could, even to the covering them when they were not much above the ground in the bed. Although the sets were in many cases completely rotten so much so indeed as to fall off when removing from the bed yet there was no failure among them; but of a quarter of an acre that I planted in the common way, not one set succeeded. The early growth in the bed is, I think, accelerated by laying a little loose straw on the top of it.

It is to be remarked, that it i some varieties the eyes are not abundant. Piti regard to such, the above number of sets will not be obtained from the corresponding weights, but in general it will be practicable, provided sound eyed tubes can be employed.

In order to learn more closely the proportion of constituent parts of the <a name="potatoes428"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> here cultivated, they were subjected to the following chemical examination, and gave the following results :cid127The examination of these <a name="potatoes429"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was made in the month of November of the previous year. At the same lime was determined the specific weight, in this manner A <a name="potato277"><mark>potato</mark></a> of middle size, after having been carefully cleaned, was accurately weighed, then fastened by a fine thread under the scales, and dipped into a wide vessel of water. Afterwards, before the air bubbles appearing in the water on the <a name="potato278"><mark>potato</mark></a> had passed off, the scales were again brought to an equilibrium, and the loss of weight which the <a name="potato279"><mark>potato</mark></a> had suffered by being dipped in the water ascertained. The first ascertained absolute weight of the <a name="potato280"><mark>potato</mark></a>, divided by this loss of weight, gave its specific gravity. Larger and smaller <a name="potatoes430"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the same kind exhibit, for the most part, somewhat less specific weight than those of the middle size which usually weigh from 1,000t0 1,500 grains* The contents in starch, fibre' album men, extract, and slime, were determined in the following manner : 6,010 grains of clean <a name="potatoes431"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were grated on a grate ri made of tin, with perforated holes.

This residue m appears to consist in part of unripe starch, with some impure ties. The remaining starch, after repeated washings with pure water i is dried at a temperature of 25 to 30 Beaume R, as long as any loss of weight can be perceived. This is very different in different kinds, in reference to fine ness and color, on which account attention should be paid in further experiments for this purpose on the same kinds of <a name="potatoes433"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The liquid filtered from the residue m was immediately elaborated to one third of its volume for the separation of the albumen, and the coagulated albumen separated by felt ration.

Appendi X No. 5POTATO Rot In The Uni Ted States. From the Albany Cultivator. Of Sease Of The <a name="potato285"><mark>Potato</mark></a>. Of. Tucker: The subject of the disease which last year prevailed so universally among <a name="potatoes440"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is one which has very naturally and properly called out the inquiries and conjectures of many investigators, and as yet no particular cause for its existence seems to have been concluded upon by the mass of cultivates. Some suppose that the membranes of the leaf are destroyed by an insect, and that the work of decay originates in this cause. But of this theory for it is theory, and nothing mere we are prepared to say that we saw (and so did every observing farmer, we must think) hosts of small black flies infecting <a name="potato286"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields in years long before we ever heard of the disease in <a name="potatoes441"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and the usual consequence was that the membrane of the leaf was eaten out, as somebody, in some particular instance, saw it last fall. When, again, in proof of the innocence of the poor insect (who is certainly driven to rather hard fare, even for a mischievous fellow) in this matter, we must say that we saw with our own eyes, and no mistake about it, leaves of <a name="potatoes442"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> after they had become dry by the disease, as perfect in all their parts as any <a name="potato287"><mark>potato</mark></a> leaves we ever saw. Others are of opinion that the cause of the disease is owing to the " influence of a v worm in the root ;" but we have seen no statement of such animals being found in such locations until the disease had made some progress; so there must be some doubt in the case as to whether the worm does the mischief, or is attracted by the consequences of its having been done to feast on the corruption that ensues. Last fall we ventured an opinion on the cause of the disease, which as yet we have found no cause to relinquish ; but, on the contrary, from the facts we have collected and observations we have made, we have become o pre tenacious of its correctness. It was simply this that, from some cause which we did not then and cannot now define to our own satisfaction, thevpdtato vine was attacked with a rust similar to that we frequently see on the straw of rye and wheat; that, in the case of the <a name="potato288"><mark>potato</mark></a>, it first showed itself in a very small blotch on the side of the stalk, which continued to spread until it had gone round and through the stalk, 'when the latter, at the particular point of disease, became dry and hard, as though it had reached its maturity. The death of the top of the stalk of course soon follows, but the lower part remains green for a while. The conjecture (it wast more conjecture) we threw out was this: whether the sap which was now stopped by the dryness of the stalk in its usual channel of circulation, and of course prevented from passing into the leaf, its natural laboratory for preparation to return to the tube r and fulfil its accustomed service in giving it nourishment, did not necessarily return premature ly, and, either from excess of quantity or by bringing back some quality which had better been given to the winds, induce the disease in the tubes? Our own <a name="potatoes443"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were too far gone to experiment much upon, when we, surprised with the novelty of the action, hit upon a single plan to adopt. It appeared to us however, as soon as we saw how the mischief was progressing, that mowing doc. No. 140. 485 the tops was the best and perhaps only efficient method to pursue. Neighbor, whose crop was smitten long after our own, tried this experiment by mowing about half a field as soon as the tops exhibited symptoms of the disorder, and the result was satisfactory and cheering. There the tops were so mown, no appearance of the rot was ever discovered, and the <a name="potatoes444"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> gave all the evidence of maturity which the circumstances of the case could possibly admit of, while the other part of the field suffered as much from the rot as any in the vicinity. Were, then, is one instance in favor of our theory. Other experiments were tried, of which we shall cite but one or two. I none case, a farmer dug a very few hills when the vines first showed symptoms of disease, and carefully buried them and let them remain until the usual time of digging, when they were taken out all sound, while the most of his crop had suffered essentially. There can be no doubt, we think, that when <a name="potatoes445"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are dug so early as the rot came last year, they must be put in small bodies and kept cool, and excluded from the atmosphere. Their tendency to heat, and thus become heavy and in sip id, warrants us in that conclusion; and so we infer that the letting them remain in hills with the tops taken off until the usual time of digging is a much cheaper and better way than to dig and put them in cellars, or on floors in piles. Another course of proceeding which has come under our observation was adopted by some I irishmen, who had known this enemy to their favorite esch lent " in the old country" and which it may not be useless to mention. When they saw the crop smitten, they dug it immediately, and piled the <a name="potatoes446"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on the surface of the ground, taking care to guard them from sunshine until the job was completed, when they covered the pile entirely with clay. The result was probably as they had known it to be aforetimeTheir crop was saved, and their <a name="potatoes447"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of good quality. The clay undoubtedly acted as a twofold agent kept them cool, and excluded the atmosphere and storms. We have only to say, in conclusion, that if any one can confuted any point we have advanced, we shall be happy to have him do it. Truth and light are what we are looking after in this matter, and if we have advanced an error, the public good requires that it should be set right. And especially does the agricultural interest of our country require that this pestilence, which ii a de such rapid strides in its advancement the last year, should meet with hot pursuit by every philanthropist, until its progress is stayed, if not effectually stopped. Hours, truly, W. Bacon. P. There have been many experiments in planting <a name="potatoes448"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> tried in this region this spring, with reference to preventing the disease. If anything of importance results from them, I shall give due notice. Mount Osceola, Pass, June 22, 1845. From the Albany Cultivator, <a name="potato289"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rotwe give the following from a letter from On. John Mary, of Salem, in this State. His suggestions are worthy the consideration of our farmers 48 l In. No. 140." The case of rot in the p ~it to and the way to -prevent it The rot in the <a name="potato290"><mark>potato</mark></a> occurs in hot, dry seasons, i and the heat and drought prevent theripenling of the <a name="potato291"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and disease and decomposition follow. I observed, during the last sum river, a difference in the <a name="potato292"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop on the same land. Those <a name="potatoes449"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that were covered deep were good as usual; those the covering of which was shallow, were useless, particularly for the table. The first symptom of failure is in the s talks of the <a name="potato293"><mark>potato</mark></a>; the become dry, and the leaves turn black; the growth then ceases, and the <a name="potato294"><mark>potato</mark></a> becomes rotten before it is ripe.

Ri. He roy Patillo, Monroe, Georgia, writes us that he thinks the rot is caused by small insects, and advises rolling the seed <a name="potatoes452"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in sulphur before planting them. He inform is s that he has u ed sulphur with good effects around plum trees i which insects had perforated the bark, and from which the gum 'ooed 'out. From a letter received from Misha Hammond, of Bones ville, New Work, we extract the folio king facts in relation n to the rot in <a name="potatoes453"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> :1.

From the Worcester Spy. <a name="potato297"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Bli   Ght. It grieves us to state that the blight, which caused such destruction to the <a name="potato298"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop last year, has thus early commenced its ravages the present season. We have examined a field belonging to Goierhcid127r Lihcolh, which we are assured, exhibited a perfectly healthy appearance on the 3d instant. In the 5th, portions of the vines showed indications of disease, and on the 7th about one half of them were 'more or less shrivelled, many of them shrunk to one half of their former dimension, and some of the leaves already turned brown and nearly dry.

They were sound, and left separated from the :i stems or tops. Bysthis separation these, hills wholly escaped the rot, while the <a name="potatoes460"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in all the adjoining hills Were rotten at the time of had vest. From the Albany Cultivator. There are two facts which I observed in my field, which I have not seen noticed in your paper. The first is, that the disease was confined to the tubes nearest to the surface ; those lying deep were unaffected. The second ;i, that the rotten <a name="potatoes461"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were full of long white worms. I saw nothing which looked like hung i, with the naked eye; but it did not occur to me to examine them with a microscope. The odor was intolerably foetid. N N.  D. For the In diana Farmer and Gardener. <a name="potato300"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Bli   Ght. Of. Edstor : I have just returned from an examination of my friend Robert Morrisons <a name="potato301"><mark>potato</mark></a> patches. A disease not heretofore noticed in this section of the country i has attackedcid127) many of his vines; and, that the readers of this paper ray b e fade acqituirited with its character, I proceed to give the results of -or researches. In all cases of inquiry into cases, I conceive it to be important to right deductions that we should first lay abroad foundation of accurate observations. When these observations areucietntly nur heroes and rightly arranged, a correct theory springs almost spontaneously ,out of them. My present purpose is merely to aid in accumulation g data, and to distinguish this from any other affection to which our <a name="potatoes462"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be liable 1. There are three different lots of <a name="potatoes463"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which we examined. One patch was planted so early as to have been prostrated by two successive frosts. The other two patches were planted about nine weeks ago 2. One patch of the late planting is in a well manured sod ground; the others in a poorer soil 48 a. All these lots are affected with the disease; but the frosted <a name="potatoes464"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the least, i. The disease, in every instance, was found to be confined to the vines. These were affected generally near their entrance into; the earth a few inches below it, and a few inches above it 5. A person, in a general review of the field, would perceive nothing but a luxuriant crop of <a name="potatoes465"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; on passing watch fully along the rows, he would discover here, and there some prostrated vines with wiiteceaves. Enclose inspection he, would find, at the points named, a perfectly i dy dec a of the stem: the with is entirely gone; the cut ice is also re moved, or dried to imperceptible thinness; and nothing remains but the ligneousfibres, white ned by disease, and sometimes separated laterally. The is the worst stage of the disease yet observed. The parts below this point are perfectly sound at present. In turning to other stems indiscriminately, whose leaves and vines are apparently in the full vigor of health, we perceive the earliest eneroachments of visible disease; Were we see a little dis colored patch of cuticledried .up and sunikenoi to the -ligne out fibres below; the parenchymatousmatter- among the :circular tissue having disappeared. Met us gently scrape away this dead cut ice, and we shall find the ligrious t texture yet living ; but in the next plant this is also delayed; and in still another we witness the destruction of half the with ; and in another the with is all gone ;and then we arrive at the last stage, or total rotten ness. In most instances there are several such patches of cut ocular decay, of irregular features; but there is a e well defined pirie of separation between the dead and living parts. Met us slice, longitudinally e, one of the vines in which these spots of decay have penetrated into or through the with, and we shall find portions of solid and apparently sound with in the intervening portions of the stem 6. In several instances the returning sap, being interrupted in its descent by. the cut ocular decay, formed small tubes (perfect <a name="potatoes466"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>) just above the diseased point 7. In a very few cases the blight had affected the branches of the vines and in as few eases the delayed with was found in a s bushy state. There is no apparent erosion of the cut ice; but the idea is suggested of all the pulp y matter in it being abstracted, and the cut ocular film collapsing upon, the parts beneath. The may safely say, upon these observations, that the disease undoubtedly commences on the exterior of the vines; and that the upward circulation is continued long after the down ward current is partially, if not wholly, intercepted ; that the disease teds to penetrate -i to, and not to pass along the vines; i the tops perishing oily when no nourishment cap be obtained fro below. If i the u be irs should become affected, I will endeavor to report the facts unless anticipated by others. J T. :a. .a. j. B .a. From the Boston Cultivator, 1: The <a name="potato302"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Bli   Ght. The Bennington Gazette says that Hilton Burri ll, of Stock bridge, has been investigation g very fully the subject of the disease, and is now fully cone. 48 evinced that he has discovered the true cause in the shape of an insect, He showed us a sample of the insect, which, through a strong magnifying glass, looks formidable, though so small. He is convinced that every <a name="potato303"><mark>potato</mark></a> field in that vicinity is destined to fall as last year. He has visited many gardens and fields around us, and finds them all giving evidence of disease. If the cause is discovered, we hope the scientific in our laboratories will soon make known some practical way of getting rid of the enemy though we fear the remedy, if discovered, will be too late to save the present crop. We have understood that house ashes, spread on the hills around the vines, after they have grown a few inches from the ground, is not only a remedy for the blight, but greatly facilitates the growth of the <a name="potato304"><mark>potato</mark></a> on some soils. It is very easy to make the trial. The editor of the Genesee Farmer, Dr. See, has made extensive examination of the <a name="potato305"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop throughout central Now Work, and finds in all cases that the curling and blight of the vines is attended by an insect. The parent is probably the beetles. It punctures the vine just above the ground, an. deposites its egg in the with of the stalk, where it patches. The larvae as off all the stalk but the outer bark, when the vine withers and dies. Dr. See thinks that this prevents the ripe king of the tubes and dispose s them to decay. The blight, it is found, will be even more destructive than last year\ . From the Sort hampton Courier. Of Sease In <a name="potatoes467"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. The were this morning shown, by Dr. D. Stebbins, a <a name="potato306"><mark>potato</mark></a> leaf taken from vines in his garden, upon which insects or worms had commenced their ravages, which proved so disastrous last year. The leaf was nearly consumed, and the insects were yet busily at work. Dr. Stebbins is sprinkling his <a name="potato307"><mark>potato</mark></a> vines with tobacco liquid, and. finds it to be an effectual remedy. Will others try this method of ex terminating these destructivesFrom the Massachusetts Slough man. <a name="potato308"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Bli   Ght In Mai Nemr. Edi Tor : Hastily I drop a few lines in relation to the "<a name="potato309"><mark>potato</mark></a> blights called) in our place and vicinity. I am sorry to say, in the opinion of many here, from present appearances, our crop will be shortened more than one half. There is, however, some uncertainty how this may turn out. Certainly, appearances are bad enough. I have examined one or two pieces affected, and find the blight, if so it may be called, caused by an insect of the species a his or plant louse; and so rapid is the ravage in some fields, that the tops bear somewhat the appearance of having been touched by the frost. Probably, wherever the insect attacks, the tops will premature ly die. We would caution farmers not to be, in too much haste; to harvest their <a name="potatoes468"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, though the tops may be i dead. The bottoms, by remaining the usual time in the ground, will be in t No. N6140likely to improve. Besides, I am ind lined o the opinion, by letting the <a name="potato310"><mark>potato</mark></a> remain in the grbbthd till the proper time to dig may tend to make it keep better after it is dug. We hear the same coinplairit made in many other places. We hope farmers will be observing on the subject, and note as mi any facts as possible. For one, I intend to watch carefully the progress of this blight, (or perhaps more prop felt termed insect ravage) and note the result. Perhaps I may find occasion hereafter to add more on the subject. For the present I conclude by saying this insect, most likely, is the cause of the rot in the root. We shall soon see. Respectfully, Of. F. Of Lbur. Butters Vale, August 26, 1845. We approve of the practice of letting <a name="potatoes469"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> remain in the ground till they are to   ll y ripe. As to the cause of the rot, we are uncertain. -EDI rTOR. From the Massachusetts Slough man, September 20. Plantl1ce Of <a name="potato311"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Nes. Of. Edi Tor: Since my letter, hastily written the other day, I have observed and thought more upon the subject the substance of which I beg leave to lay before your readers. Naturalists have described numerous parasitic al insects; but among the mall 1 do not find a single description in the books which exactly answers to the a his of the <a name="potato312"><mark>potato</mark></a> for so I shall term it. It is, however, so like heap his of other plants, it cannot be mistaken as to its class. I never have seen anything of the kind on <a name="potatoes470"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> before; others perhaps have. Perhaps it may be a matter of interest to some to have a brief outline of the insect. It is of a transparent green color, varying in size from that of a tobacco seed to that of a ducks hot; the largest sized have wings. They are generally found on the under side of the leaf; wherever they feed, the blight shows itself; the probability is, they extract the vegetable juice or sap, the loss of which to the plant causes the mischief. If only the stem of the leaf be attacked, the whole leaf withers and dies. I remember, when the blight struck my <a name="potato313"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in 1838, the tops looked at that time very much as now. The bottoms also were then affected. But I did not think, at that time, to look and see whether any insect preyed upon them, as now. I think i, however, most likely they did. Last year I did not notice much that appeared like blight in my <a name="potato314"><mark>potato</mark></a> field though the bottoms, in spots, were some affected with the rot at harivesttime1 know no remedy to. apply as a preventive, or that will stay the work of mischief after it is once commenced. Whether any peculiarity of the present season ,can be said to give rise to this past or blight, is perhaps difficult to detirhin e ; (the season he e, flrtnthe middle of July up to the present time, has been uncommonly .war r n and wet) or whether this blight will 'be followed with disease in the root, similar to that of last year, is a n matter as yet alike undeterminable.

Edi Tor : I have just returned from Over, the s hire town of Piscataquis -on ty; in passing to and from which my way lay through several of the best farming towns in the countySanogeersville, Foxcroft, and Guilford. The farmers in these towns tell 'me their <a name="potato318"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop this season is nearly or quite a failure some will hardly get the return of their seed at harvest. 1 was at the trouble of examining several fields, and in every instance found the apt his preying more or less on the tops. The rot, as apprehension was expressed in a former communication, has set in. Boone can tell how r far the disease will :x tend. Deafs are entertained that the crop will be entirely lost, Whether harvested array of late. I think, of the tire, late harvesting the safest. Fly reasons could be given if necessary. Some have essayed to save their crop by immediate harvesting and selling to shippers; but shippers are afraid to buy, fearing the mass Would rot before it could be ti ain sported to a foreign h market and iisp6sd of  shall not attempt to theorise oh the subject of this <a name="potato319"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, (for so, I suppose, everybody is agreed to call it) though I am strongly of the opinion the like on the tops are the sole cause of it. It is v by natural to suppose a premature decay y of the tops will have a corresponding effect upon the bottoms* Since writing the above, I learn in by thePltghian of August ,3, that the drought is so Severe in Of  massachusetts the <a name="potato320"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop will be likely to be very light, and th'atthe people there will be obliged to :depend on Paine for a supply.

Dear the city of Sang or, I understand, some of the farmers are already engaged in sloughing in their <a name="potato321"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, not being considered worth the harvesting. .a. The failure of the <a name="potato322"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is regarded here in Paine (as well it maybe) as one of the greatest calamities to the farmers interest. It is to be hoped this trouble will prove to be of temporary standing that another year it will not reappear. Respectfully, yours, B. F. Of Lbur. From the Massachusetts Slough man. We presume the following communication is from the per of the On. Dorr ill Allen. It is copied from the Old Colony Memorial' -<a name="potatoes472"><mark>POTATOES</mark></a>. The, disease in <a name="potatoes473"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which in some sections of the country nearly destroyed the crop of last year, has not yet progressed to any very alarming extent in the county of Plymouth. But there have been sufficient indications of its existence and advances to justify some general attention to the subject, and the employment of such preventive, or re medial means, as may seem to cultivates the most likely to prove efficacious. Until the causes of the malady shall be more satisfactorily investigated, no rules can, with implicit confidence, be given for the treatment. The farmers must do as physicians are sometimes obliged to do, in cases of undefined bodily disease prescribe to the symptoms. This practice is attended with great uncertainty, yet the results of it in experience sometimes prove highly valuable. The different causes to which the disease in <a name="potatoes474"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> has been ascribed, lead writers to suggest a great variety of remedies in accordance with their views of the probable origin. Met farmers select and apply such as their reason and judgment best approve, and it may be that merely practical men will, in the course of their experience, clearly prove what theory has hitherto failed of doing the moving cause of the difficulty. I f, as supposed by some, it be of insect origin, then salt and lime would seem proper applications; and these are also strongly recommended by persons who think that fungus is the producing cause of the disease. Those who suppose it arises from atmospheric influence may properly apply the same means which would be recommended by those who believe it the result of excessive growth. Preparation of the soil, and a course in the cultivation likely to produce an even growth, are unquestionably important in this and other crops. Some persons seem confident that the rot in <a name="potatoes475"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> results wholly from deter i oration in the seed. If this be true, we may not expect to avoid the evil merely by sending to another place for seed <a name="potatoes476"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; we should renew them from the balls. This is a process requiring some patience, but we know of no easier method of entire renovation. We suppose renewal can be approached in successive plantings of un matured <a name="potatoes477"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. These have often been strongly recommended for seed, not only for the purpose of avoiding disease, but as a means of increasing the crop. It is manifestly contrary to what we regard as a general law in vegetation, that the most perfect seed produces the wealthiest and i most fruitful plants. There are, however, several reasons for believing that the <a name="potato323"><mark>potato</mark></a>: may be an exception to the general law. The vegetative principle is not so con central. 493 ted in the <a name="potato324"><mark>potato</mark></a> as in most other articles. It can be Produced from the balls, the bulbs, or from sprouts which have grown in the cellar, or the earth. The vegetative principal e being so ' widely diffused, it may be reasonable to suppose that the perfect ripe king of the <a name="potato325"><mark>potato</mark></a> to some extent Weakens its power of reproduction. That power, after the complete maturity of the bulbs, may be more perfectly concentrated in the balls. The experiment is easily made, and it is hoped that many farmers will this year plant <a name="potatoes478"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for the next years seeing as late as the 25th of June. M. A. Pembroke, May, 1845. From the Farmers' Monthly Sister. We have not yet, in all the speculations of the curious and the scientific on the subject of the recent disease in <a name="potatoes479"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, seen anything to throw light enough to enable us to take a single step towards a remedy. In raising thirteen hundred bushels of <a name="potatoes480"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> last year, we had congratulated ourselves on an entire escape from the disease complained of by the most if not al of our neighbors. We had disposed, to good advantage, of something like. half of our crop; and we thought we should do better to save the remainder until the opening of spring, by then sending them to the Bdstonmarket. As the most safe kind, we had planted half the ground withlongreds the two last years. In the fall of 1843 our long red <a name="potatoes481"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were laid in the ground, in a bed, not over two :fe t deep, covered with a coating of green them lock boughs, and thes overed with the surroundingcid127: soil that the winter frost could not reach through. The <a name="potatoes482"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the following spring came out as fresh and fair as they were on the day they were covered. Precisely the same way and near the same spot did we, in October last, dispose of about five hilt indeed bushels of the long reds, the kind that were supposed to be proof against the rot, and near them, in a continued bed, about one hundred bushels of the round pink eyed <a name="potatoes483"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, an earlier kind. The pink eyes came out as good as they were when they were covered; the l on g reds were a mass of rotten ness, so general that, of the while quantity, not a bushel was t ak n but to be saved. We believe the <a name="potatoes484"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> suffered from the diese se, because, a few days before they were dug, their growth was arrested by the sudden dying of the tops, Which seemed to be stricken an is with the blight, which frequently takes place at the earlier season The vines being thus killed, we dug them perhaps a fortnight earl i r than we might otherwise have done ; and it was observed, when they were disposed of i their bed, t that the skin 'pe led off easily, The top of the bed was kept open, as far as it could be done safely, until the approach of severe frost. We are inclined to think th the the <a name="potatoes485"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> perished in consequence of being take an ut of the air perhaps a fortnight too soon. Only apart of the same <a name="potatoes486"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, dug at a the same time, and laid in a bin of the cellar, above ground, adjoining to "a basement kitchen, where a fire is keptcontitnallry, suffered from i the t r the <a name="potatoes487"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> remaining of these are soie of the best We have ever seen at this season of the year. 'the <a name="potatoes488"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> o last year, disposed of in the same position, were greatly improved from the exposure to the air and heat from the kitchen ; the long reds of the present spring seem to have been benefited from the same exposure; so that in the494Dop. No. 140.two positions of the years 1843 and 1844 the case was exactly reversed. W se saved the pp tapes where they were before lost, and we lost the <a name="potatoes489"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> where they were before preserved. For belief is that the effects of the disease, which appeared on the Filling of the vines, might have been avoided by keeping the <a name="potatoes490"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the ground until they were perfectly ripened. Most strange and unaccountable is this <a name="potato326"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease. Sometimes we have seen one kind of <a name="potatoes491"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> (the Chenangoes, for instance) half rotten at the time of digging, and some of them indicating the rot by specks on the end; while alongside, in the same field, other kinds of <a name="potatoes492"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were entirely free from rot, or from all indications of disease, Other fields of the same kind of <a name="potatoes493"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> escaped the rot entirely. The richest soil seems to have been most liable to the rot. The high grounds of this State, the latest broken up pasture grounds, have commonly produced the best <a name="potatoes494"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Of last years production it is believed that in these grounds the greater portion of the crop was lost; more than in the grounds where the blight had informer years been more common. From the Massachusetts Slough man. Of Sease In <a name="potatoes495"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Of. Edi Torp: Any various, and often contradictory reasons have been given for the disease in <a name="potatoes496"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the last season. S e have said it was cases by wet weather; others, in a different section, by dry; others by warm, Some have laid it to manure in the hill; others say, when therwacid127) none i the hi they ere equally diseased. Some think li pe, ashes, or plaster, has prevented the disease others' <a name="potatoes497"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, where the, e articles were used: have been as badly diseased as any. Hope he laid it to the <a name="potatoes498"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having been so long plan ted without reproducing from the seed. I have several kinds produced from the seed within a few years, an, they were as badly diseased as any. Up oe May it to a pqrtimplar dew; others to a particular atmosphere. To, it i is evident that these are not the causes of the dis a ape.

T , July 14, 14 845. Of, I S -F 0,RP, a. 4,Erog the American Farmer. <a name="potato327"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Bli   Ght. To the Editor of the Tribuneknowing that you feel a deep interest in the welfare of the farmer, 1 send you a few observations on the disease of <a name="potatoes500"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, so prevalent last year, which I think I have discovered, and perhaps a remedy. This morning, for the first time, I observed a few tops of the <a name="potatoes501"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in my garden beginning to wither and curl up. Supposing that the cause might be near at hand, I commenced a critical examination of several withered tops, to discover it if possible. I soon found a green fly, about one-fourth of an inch in length, upon every top that had begun to wither, and on most of them two; some had four, a few six. In one top I found four young flies, about one half the size of the adult, and on three others one each, about one-fourth grown. The insect, I thought, must be the cause of the disease commonly called the curl top, or <a name="potato328"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, since I found it on every diseased top in 30 or 40 cases, and usually on that part of the plant which had begun to with er near the healthy part of the stem. In the stem of one where the fly was, there was a small global e of viscid transparent liquid. This stem had begun to droop, but only so that it would scarcely be observed. Anotherglobule on the upper side of the curled leaf, on which a fly was sitting, was find to be sweet. Any of the leaves that were much wilted felt as if aglutinous liquid had been spread upon the upper surface. These questions, then, naturally arose Does this liquid exude from the plant and attract the fly which is innocently sipping his new tar? or, does he perforate the stem and cause the exudation, that, like a malicious parasite, he may extract the life from this use fit l root? It t appears to me that tie insect must be the cause of the l exudation, for this reason tat it was found on no plant that did not have a fly upon it n almost every case two flies were found upon the same plant, differing a little i size and color; the less being of a darker green, and the larger containing many eggs, which it appeared to be depositing. Only one egg was found in he stem of the plant; yet there were many places apparently stung upon the diseased stem, and the effect of this reached down in some cases three or four inches in the heart of the stem; otherwise were hollowed down as far as the healthy part From the above observations these conclusions appear to be evident that it sting of this fly causes the curl top; that it breeds upon the stem, and the numerous progeny live upon the plant, sucking up its juices and des trying its vitality. As a remedy, I amputated the diseased part, and destroyd all the flies I could. About ten o clock I sprinkled soap sums upon one is mall patch, and none were found upon it at night, though many were find, upon another piece that was not showered, An hour before sunset   $ prisikld the sums left from washing upon the whole he flies cain perhaps b be driven out of the field with a brush, where it is not convenient to shower them. Hours, &c. E. Bompey, N. Y:, july 14, 1845. Of. Tuesday morning another o examination was ;me, and one y one fly was i to be of and .o the pie e. Editorial remark he readily conclude that the green fly found on .the <a name="potato329"><mark>potato</mark></a> v mines above described would affect the quality of the <a name="potatoes502"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 496 preventing their maturing and, if left for any considerable time in the ground after the tops had begun to decay, would produce a second growth, by which the tubes would be rendered useless for cooking ; but we doubt whether the fly here spoken of is the cause of the general rot which has been so prevalent of late years. We incline to the belief that rot is to be attributed generally to atmospheric influence an undue or premature spring like weather in early fall, causing the <a name="potatoes503"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are at a vigorous growth, though not fill y matured or perfected, to begin to shoot or to grow in manner as though they had been planted for the purpose. His premature process ferments the tubes to an incident state of decomposition, and hence the withering of the vines and the consequent deteriorationof the crop. We are strengthened in the opinion by the same idea thrown out by Mr. Owen, of Count Airy good authority, as all will allow in his Report of Drops in 1843, as published 29th May, 1844, in the Americanfarmer, to which we would refer our readers. For the To 'ton Cultivator. The, <a name="potato330"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Malady. Messrs. Edi Torrs: Your extracts from Arthur (se Cultivator for June 28) are interesting and deserving regard. There is reason in the belief that the <a name="potato331"><mark>potato</mark></a> would be found to bleed less on cutting in the autumn than when cut at the time of planting; but to suppose that by such an arrangement the plague is to be stayed is "al a humhundredspf acres, the past years, having been planted with whole <a name="potatoes504"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which ought, therefore, to have been thus preserved from disease; but these crops, as well as those produced from every "variety of seed, culture, soil, times of planting, different modes of maturing" &c, &c, have suffered alike and in the same degree. What need, then, of father witness Since writing the above, I have examined a field of ten acres of <a name="potatoes505"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, about one half of which were planted with uncut <a name="potatoes506"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of small size the remaining portion of the field being planted with cut seed, the operation of cutting having been performed at the time of planting, one eye in :a piece and it is but common honesty to confess, judging from present appearance the crop is now in bloom) the uncut seed "have it." But 'this isa a remarkably genial season, and there will, therefore, be no general complaint of : plague "so the premiums offered by the "american Association for the best essay, &c, might as well stand over for the present. War late crops of <a name="potatoes507"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, those planted after peas, look finely; the ate rains and very warm and growing weather having rendered thempnlagueproof. But let me relate a very curious fact for the consideratiocid127i .f e learned. The day of planting my crop was excessively hot; but, except one row and a half across the field, the sets came- up very regularly, which put me to a no a plus to account for such a singular and very perceptibleifilure; after a minutes reflection and investigation, I found that thgisow1and a half had been left uncovered; the sets all the i while exposed to a burning s u on a sandy soil, during the time the men were at dinner say about two hours; and on calling on a neighbor who had complained of- having just such a galled spot on his <a name="potato332"><mark>potato</mark></a> field, I found the very same effect following precisely the same cause the exposure of the cut sets to the hot. 497 sun at noon : so that drawing the burning sand over these sets after two hours' exposure may be considered as somewhat like making a <a name="potato333"><mark>potato</mark></a> pie of them, and they were no doubt well cooked by the process; sufficiently so, at least, to prevent them from ve getting. C. Gloucester Of, N. J. "from the Sort land Bullet ri.  Of Sease In <a name="potatoes508"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. ' ;it the farmers' national convention, held in New York city, the disease among <a name="potatoes509"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was the subject' of considerable discussion and remark. Mr. Robinson submitted an address to the people of the United States, urging the importance of investigations into the cause of this singular disease, which has hitherto baffled the efforts of science and experiehcetowiihstanid its progress. The farmers in Paine are particularly interested in this matter; during the past season, three quarters of the <a name="potato334"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of our State has been destroyed by this singular epidemic. The consistency and quality of the soil where the disease proves most destructive should be carefully noted experiments should be tried of planting in new places and in different kinds of soil, with manure of every description now in use, and without any kind of manure whatever, and cognizance of any and every other circumstance calculated to throw the least light on the matter should be taken- . Men. Tallmadge seemed to think the origin of the disease might be ' in the natural course of vegetable decay and extinction of genera, so oftenobservable in botany cal history. He alluded to the extinction i of the mi ami moth species of animals long ages ago to the disappearance of] the weed known as It. Johns work, which but a few years since was the greatest enemy of the farmer, and is now so scarce as to be almost unattainable even for purposes of curiosity. He suggested that our farmers raise <a name="potatoes510"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the seed instead of the root, and also seek new kinds of potattescid127) in Mexico and Central Americawe think the suggestion of Men. Tallmadge, of growing <a name="potatoes511"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the seed, an excellent one ; hope our farmers will improve upon it, and will take all the other precautions calculated in any way to elucidate the subject Remarks by the editor of the Boston Cultivator. Too much dependence is placed on obtaining new varieties of <a name="potatoes512"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the seed, with a view to prevent the rot. If the seed be selected from hardy, varieties, that are known to resist the disease better than other kinds, some advantage may be gained. But the idea that the seed from a very tender variety will produce a hardy kind, is as absurd as it is to suppose that the offspring of a feeble, degenerate race of animals will be strong and healthy. The general law of nature is, that like produces like. Therefore it is important to select seed from a hardy race; and it would be well to plant several hardy sorts together, and then select from them, as in this way an improvement might be made by crossing* *a* *a* ' m -a' :a' *a* : " ' ' ' ^a^ !498 a. For the Farmers' Cabinet. Of Sease Of The <a name="potato335"><mark>Potato</mark></a>. Of. Edi Tor: I have recently read a number of articles upon the "disease of the <a name="potato336"><mark>potato</mark></a>" and have been struck with what seems to me a deficiency in the reasoning on the subject. I formed an opinion in relation to the matter more than a year ago, in consequence of some investigations I then made, and subsequent readings and examinations have confirmed that opinion. 1 will give it to you for what it is worth. If it is not correct, perhaps it will lead to the truth in which ease I shall be abundantly repaid for my trouble. Of  t is well known that the substance forming the cells of all plants is a compound of nitrogenous matter with one or more of the alkalies, together with s il ex, &c. It is also well known, that if the cellular matter is deficient in alkaline substances, &c, it is comparatively weak, and unable to contain the matters' deposited in it. It is well known, too, that the al, ka lies regulate the formation of the acids in the healthy vegetable, and that when there is not a sufficient supply of alkaline bases, the vegetable either contains a superabundance of acid or its growth is impeded. In the former case the vegetable is not fit for c urinary purposes: Now, I believe that in the case of the disease of the <a name="potato337"><mark>potato</mark></a> the cause isa deficiency of alkaline bases. This is manifest in the want of power intercellular substance to perform its office, and it is also manifest in the presence of acid in the <a name="potato338"><mark>potato</mark></a>. In consequence of this deficiency of alkaline substances, the <a name="potato339"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant forms an all ali peculiar to itself, which is very poisonous in its nature and which, I doubt not, produces the fatal effect sometimes consequent upon eating the diseased <a name="potato340"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I ft his theory be correct, the proper remedy is to supply the alkaline substances, such as lime, good strong ashes or soda, one or more of them; and not use quite so much or so rich manure as is commonly used. Schemi  Of. Honesdale, Labor the Farmers' Cabinet. The <a name="potato341"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. Of. Edi Tor: Any information on the subject of the rot in the <a name="potato342"><mark>potato</mark></a> that even approximates to the truth is much needed at present. I hope you will not consider a column of your paper un worthily filled which containscid127) communication devoted to that object. I stated in your May number that the rot in the <a name="potato343"><mark>potato</mark></a> was caused by a deficiency of alkaline substances, It is found, by burning the tops of the <a name="potato344"><mark>potato</mark></a>, that 10,000 parts yield 1,500 parts of ashes, while oak wood in equal quantity yields only 250 parts. This will serve to show the great quantity of all ali contained in <a name="potatoes513"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> over other vegetable matter7The cellular tissue of all vegetables is composed partly of alkalies. They exist therein in a variety of forms; sometimes as carbonate of lime, at others as delicate of potash, at others in the form of phosphates of lime c, .c. a. 499 t is plain that if a plant has not sufficient all ali for the formation of the cellular tissue, its growth will be impeded, or the cellular substance will be so weak and thin as not to be able to perform its function of holding the starch and other matter contained in the <a name="potato345"><mark>potato</mark></a>. When the plant has not enough all ali, therefore, we may look for the cellular tissue to be broken and otherwise injured. This is actually the case with the <a name="potato346"><mark>potato</mark></a> that is affected with the rot. Mr. Teschemacher, a scientific gentleman of Boston, who has examined the rotten <a name="potato347"><mark>potato</mark></a> with a microscope, says "the cells appeared lacerated." This is what we would expect, especially when the substance contained in the cells is swollen by wet or heat, and the tissue is thin. In another place he says: " I need, it appears to me that the injury takes place by the rupturing of the cellular parts of the <a name="potato348"><mark>potato</mark></a> When the cells are ruptured the health of the <a name="potato349"><mark>potato</mark></a> is destroyed, and death and decay follow in the parts so ruptured. The delayed matter gives food to hung i and insects, and thus gives rise to the theory that the disease is caused by the hung i, or insects, instead of the want of all ali. Again, when there is sufficient all ali to neutralise an acid, the acid is not to be found as such. It has entered into a chemical combination with thealkali, and assists in forming a salt. There is carbonic acid in a rotten <a name="potato350"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which is evidence that there is not all ali enough to operate upon it. If an all ali is placed upon some of the rotten <a name="potato351"><mark>potato</mark></a>, it instantly changes. Mr. Teschemacher says, in his letter to the New England Farmer, dated Boston, October, 1844, while speaking about his experiments" A portion of the dark substance was placed upon a piece of glass on the microscope stand, in a drop of distilled water, and then thoroughly examined. A little salt on the fine point of a pen knife was then added. A nearly instantaneous change took place. The dark colored masses separated; much of them seemed to pass away; and instead, there appeared numerous dark, slate colored globular bodies, which I easily recognised as the spores or reproducing bodies of the fungus. With the gray, shiny substance, the effect was still more striking. All the indistinct slime disappeared the mass became clear and transparent, and left nothing but these innumerable dark g lobules floating: about in the drop of water Salt is well known to be a m urate of soda. It appears evident, from or. Teschemachers experiment, that the soda of the salt left the muriaticacid and entered into combination with the carbonic acid of the rotten mass, forming a carbonate of soda, and setting the m uratic acid free. This carbonic acid is highly infectious, and hence the reason that a <a name="potato352"><mark>potato</mark></a> slightly rotten soon becomes wholly to, and infects those with which it is in contact. Any all ali will neutralise it, forming with it a carbonate, Consequently any all ali will cure the rot in the <a name="potato353"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Tihisit will effect in two ways : First, by strengthening the cellular tissue, thus preventing the rupturing and consequent disorganization of the <a name="potato354"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which would result in death and decay; and, secondly, by neutralising the carbonic acid, and thus destroying its infectious principle. [the writer here considers, and illustrates his views by, instances in the last report of the Commissioner of Patents. See T. Grafts letter t is well known that poudrette, bone dust, delicate of potash, and go ohio contain one or more of the alkalies. I am disposed to think, Mr. Editor, that the above extracts prove conclusively the theory that the rot in the <a name="potato355"><mark>potato</mark></a> is caused by a want of the alkalies. At any rate, I should strongly 500 recommend their use. They can do no harm, unless ab ungainly used, and they may do an immense amount of good. Hours, &cCOHEMI  Of. Of Onesdale, Of, Lane 6, 1845. The foregoing we consider a valuable communication. Partly in corroboration of the views expressed, the editor recollects that in the use of lime on his farm there was no crop, unless perhaps it was the o at crop, on which that material had so uniformly a beneficial effect as that of <a name="potatoes514"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The hints may easily be made use of, and at little expenseEDI Tor. For the Farmers' Cabinet. Of Sease Of The <a name="potato356"><mark>Potato</mark></a>. Smr. Edi Tor: In per using the last number of your paper, I noticed are article over the signature of Chemico, purporting to give a correct reason for the cause of the disease in <a name="potatoes515"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and also proposing a remedy. It is a well known fact, that the disease in <a name="potatoes516"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is of recent origin and it is also well know i that the soil in which they grow contains the same quantity of all ali, and no less nitrogen than formerly. If a want of the alkalies, or a redundant supply of " nitrogenous matter" can be the only cause, then the disease might be confined to one district alone; but, observation, reports, and evidences, from wellauthenticated sources, affirm that the whole continent is alike affected: even in Europe the <a name="potatoes517"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have not escaped the contagion. Hands which now yield but a poor and sickly crop of <a name="potatoes518"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, a few years ago brought an abundant harvest. It has, furthermore, been ascertained by men of high professional repute, that <a name="potatoes519"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> contain properties capable of accumulation g the alkalies, and repelling a redundancy of nitrogen. Hence, it is easy to be seen that they are formed in such a particular way as to reject and throw off every substance detrimental to a vi go ous and healthy growth. There, then, lies the true cause ?a? It must be some un investigated agent, so powerful in its nature as to destroy the capability of the repulsive properties, and so poisonous in its effects as to paralyze the cellular organs, so as to prevent their performing their allotted task. Now, whatever may be the cause of the disease, it certainly cannot be the want or the redundancy of the above mentioned properties, to which Chemico attributes it. I have noticed, particularly, that the first indications of the disease commence in the stalk; and, by an examination, I have found that the <a name="potatoes520"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are fit for all c urinary purposes, even when the stalk assumes a dark rotten color, and emits a putrid odor. As the disease follows down the stalk, the <a name="potato357"><mark>potato</mark></a> is at length affected, its health destroyed, and it becomes a useless vegetable. I have heard learned men say it is caused by an unusually large quantity of calorie coming in collision with a sudden and severe shower of rain; thereby creating a large quantity of hydrogen and sulph e recent origin of this disease is, we think, doubtful he the translation of a paper in the 7th No. of current vol. of Cabinet, page 212.-ED. a. 501phuric acid gas. Now far these doctrines are correct, I will not touch but suffice it to say, they seem to me plausible. A Fatarmehonesdale, Of, June 2. For the Farmers' Cabinet. Of Sease Of The <a name="potato358"><mark>Potato</mark></a>. Of. Edi Tor: In your last number I noticed a communication on the above subject, from this place, signed "' Farmerthe author of said communication seems to differ with me in to to in regard to the cause of the disease in question. He objects to my reasoning* in the matter, and substitutes the opinion of some learned men. After stating that the disease of the <a name="potato359"><mark>potato</mark></a> was of recent origin by the way, Mr. Editor, your hint that this was doubtful was timely and proper as we hear of the disease as far back at least as 1815, some thirty yeaisagoyour correspondent, ' Farmer" says " it is also well known that the sirin which <a name="potatoes521"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grow contains the same quantity of all ali, and no less nitrogen than formerly. If a want of the alkalies or a redundant supply of nitrogenous matter can be the only cause t then the disease might be confined to one district alone." I may be shortsighted, Mr. Editor, but 1 must confess I cannot see the rational e of this. I cannot for the life of me understand why "the disease might be confined to one district alone, "unless that district should comprise nearly the whole earth, when the want f a alkaline matter is so general." Farmer" lays it down as a well known" fact, that " the soil in which <a name="potatoes522"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grow contains the same quantity of all ali, and no less nitrogen than formerly." Now, however much I might be disposed to differ with' Farmer' in this matter, and say that when a soil has been deprived of a portion of its alkaline matter by taking off it large crops of hay, fodder c, and none or but little has been returned to it, it has less than it had before, I will, for the sake of making the subject clearer, omit doing so for the present. It is a " well known" fact, that all salts have a relative proportion of acids and alkalies. Therefore, notwithstanding the soil may have as much all ali now as it had formerly, still it does not follow, as a, matter of course, that it has now a sufficiency. The soil formerly may have had enough all ali for the acid it contained at that time, but in consequence of the farmer supplying large quantities of manure, which produce an abundant supply of carbonic acid, the soil needs a greater supply of alkaline matter than it before contained, to form a salt by union with the extra quantum of carbonic acid. This is the main reason, in my opinion, that the rot in the <a name="potato360"><mark>potato</mark></a> is more general now than it was a few years ago. It has been the practice until recently to skin the soil as closely as possible, and supply but little manure; but since 1836, "a great change See page 316, current vol. of Cabinet. [see page 500. ante in did not say, Mr. Editor, that " a redundant supply of nitrogenous matter" was the cause of the disease of the <a name="potato361"><mark>potato</mark></a>; I said that " the substance forming the cells of all plants is a compound of nitrogenous (should have said carboniferous) matter, with one or more of thealkahles, together with s il ex" &c. This has nothing to do with the cause of the disease of the    <a name="potato362"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which, as 1 said before; was owing to a want of the alkalies 502 has come over" agriculture, and farmers have been brought to think that they must give the soil something, while they are constantly taking away from it. They have since that time been throwing on large quantities of manure; and, not supplying proper proportions of alkaline matters, they find that diseases infect their plants, such as the rust in wheat, and the rot in the <a name="potato363"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I must plead guilty to the charge that I ar ignorant of the fact that" <a name="potatoes523"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> contain properties capable of accumulation g the alkalies." The sentence in "1 Farmers" communication containing this idea is very ambiguous to me ; Do not understand it. Again, he says, it is easy to be seen that <a name="potatoes524"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are formed in such a peculiar way as to reject and throw off every substance detrimental to a vigorous and healthy growth." Not so easy to be seen, after all, Mr. Farmer." If this was the case, how is it that the <a name="potato364"><mark>potato</mark></a> does not expel the ' hydrogen and sulphuric acid gas" that "farmer" seems to think is the cause of the disease? If they possess the power. to reject and throw off every substance detrimental to a vigorous and healthy growth, how is it that they suffer the " hydrogen and sulphuric acid gas" to destroy their organism ?a? It cannot be supposed that such destruction is one of the indicatives of a "healthy growth n regard to this matter of ' hydrogen and sulphuric acid gas" being the cause of the disease of the <a name="potato365"><mark>potato</mark></a>, I have a few words to say. It strikes me that hydrogen cannot have anything to do with the disease; for if hydrogen. be in contact with oxygen, the gas that must be present where decay is, they will unite and form water, and consequently the oxygen could not carry on the work of decay, and therefore the decay must stop. It seems more likely to me, after a few minutes' consideration of the subject, that the presence of hydrogen, so far from causing the decay of the <a name="potato366"><mark>potato</mark></a>, would have, the effect of preventing it. Respecting the other part of the theory of the "learned men" alluded to by Farmer" that "sulphuric acid gas" thrown to the earth by those "sudden and severe showers of rain" is the cause of the widespread injury sustained by the <a name="potato367"><mark>potato</mark></a>, I would ask, what is there in the whole formula of chemicals that will destroy the effect of sulphuric acid in a more effectual, manner than the very substances I propose for the prevention and cure of the rot in <a name="potatoes525"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> ?I am sorry that my communication is of so great length. I find that it requires fewer words to raise objections, than it does to answer them in a plain and explicit manner. Of  should like to say more about the communication of" Farmer" particularly on the subject of the appearance of the s talks of the diseased <a name="potato368"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Their appearance justified my idea of the cause of the rot, but I shall have to postpone it for the present. C- Emi  Cooopnesdale, Of, June 19, 1845. Of Lkesbarre, Luzerne County, Pas November 22, 1845.  Dear Of  R : The immense injury sustained from the " rot" by the <a name="potato369"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of the United States, during this and former years, and the distress and alarm in Europe, at this' time, caused principally o by itiwouldseem to call upon every one who could say anything that seems at. all reasonable of the cause and cure of that: disease, to let; (cid127himself be` heard. With this conviction I address you this letter, wishing i you to excuse the familiarity, and urging as my apology, if such apology be needed, the importance of the case. Did if you think 1 sustain my position, or establish, so far as a treatise of this kind could, the theory which I advance, you can so use this communication as to make it of service to the world at large, and thereby fulfil the intention of its author much better than he himself could. i in have abundant reason to believe that the "polaltoa it' is .caused by a want of alkalies. It would make this letter too lengthy were I to introduce all the evidence     have of the correctness of the: theory I advance, and therefore I hope Icid127shall be excused for omitting a part of it' If however, more is wanted, I Am ready at any time to furnish it. I will first speak of the theory of the disease . All plants, for a healthy growth, need certain elements in certain proportions. If more of one of these elements be given, by man or by nature, to the plant, than is proper to form a compound with the other elements, then the elements furnished are useless, if not injurious. Take some extracts from Dr. Liebigs great work on agricultural chemistry-one of the best works of the age on that science; the author of which is certainly entitled to full credit in his opinions, particularly when we have no evidences to the contrary. The extracts are taken from the chapter on "the in organic constituents of plants" and are as follows: "carbonic acid, water, and ammonia are necessary for the existence of plants, because they contain the elements from which their organs are formed; but other substances are likewise requisite for the formation of certain organs, destined for special functions peculiar to each family of plants. Plants obtain these substances from in organic nature. In the ashes left after theincineration of plants, the same substances are fbundalthungh in a changed condition. Any of these in organic constituents vary according to the soil in which the plants grow, but a certain number of them are indispensable to their development." " Any plants, perhaps all of them, contain organic acids of very different composition and property, all of which are in combination with bases, such as potash, soda, lime, or magnetic." But if these acids constantly exist in vegetables, and are necessary to their life, which is incontestable, it is equal y certain that son me alkaline base is also indispensable in order to enter into combination with the acids, which are always found in the state of salts." " The perfect development of a plant is depend ant on the presence of alkalies or alkaline earths ; for when these substances are totally wanting, its growth will be arrested; and when they are only deficient, it must be impeded These extracts serve to show that alkaline matters are necessary for a healthy plant. Without stepping beyond the bounds of reason, we may well suppose that a plant which had not a proper supply of alkalies would be unhealthy; and when we consider the; fact that carbonic acid is absorbed by all vegetable matter, and that it is highly infectious when notneutrlized, causing decay where decay has not commenced, and assisting it after it .has commenced, it appears to me the cause of the <a name="potato370"><mark>potato</mark></a> diseaseZ04 may be very clearly seen. The cellular it issue of all vegetables is composed partly of alkalies. Hence, if the <a name="potato371"><mark>potato</mark></a>, for instance, has not sufficientialkali for a healthy growth, or, in other words, has not sufficient to enable it to assimilate all the carbonic; acid it has absorbed, and thus form a strong cellular tissue, we may very r naturally expect that such cellular tissue, if formed at all, will be very weak, and not able always properly to perform its functions. Such tissue, if anything occurs calculated to test its strength, will, we would suppose, be found, on examination with a good microscope, to be torn and ruptured. This it appears is actually the case with the diseased <a name="potato372"><mark>potato</mark></a>. For. J. E. Teschemacher, a scientific gentleman of Boston, in a communication copied in your last report, on page 233, says, after examining the diseased <a name="potato373"><mark>potato</mark></a> with a microscope, that 6 many of these cells appeared lacerated." It is well known that water will cause vegetable matter to swell, and that heat will cause water to expand ; hence, if the cellular tissue bweak and therefore not able to bear a strain, and the starch contained in the cells, becomes swollen by water, disorganization must inevitably follow, more particularly so when that water is assisted by heat. As death and decay are the consequences of disorganization, the facts will explain why <a name="potatoes526"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are so apt to rot during hot and wet weather. The cellular tissue may be weak; and yet if the weather be cool and dry, and as a consequence no strain comes upon it, that weakness may not essentially injure the <a name="potato374"><mark>potato</mark></a>; but if the weather becomes hot and wet, the cellular tissue must give way: and allow disease to do its work. This decay, however, maybe stopped by the aid of the alkalies, even after disorganization has taken place. For evidence of this fact I refer you to the communication of Mr. John S. Letter ville, published on page 229, in your last report, where he says: "but about the middle of December my family complained of the bad smell in the cellar ; upon which I examined, and found the <a name="potatoes527"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a bad condition, and I took them out of the bin and picked them rover again, and when returning them into the bin, in every layer I put about half a peck of s lacked lime and mixed it well through them, and so, on all till was in, which I do believe stopped the rot and bad smell, as there were but very few found affected afterwards t would seem from the above statement that the carbonic acid, which is the product of decay, and which is, as I have before said, highly infectious, loses this power when lime is present; this is occasioned by the neutralising effect of the lime, which forms with the carbonic acid a carbonate of lime, which is a salt. Berthier, in his " Anna les de Chime et de Physique, "to me Xxx, page 248, says: " 10,000 parts of oak wood yield 250 parts of, ashes; the same quantity of fir wood only 83; of linen wood, 500 ; of rye, 440; and of the herb of the <a name="potato375"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant, l 50." It will thus be seen that the herb of: the <a name="potato376"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant contains six times as much ashes as oak wood. Dr. See, a scientific gentleman of New Work, who is at present, I believe, engaged: by the New York State Agricultural Society to visit every county in that State and deliver lectures on agricultural chemistry, in a letter to the editor of the- Albany Cultivator, from " Smith ville, <a name="chenango0"><mark>Chenango</mark></a> county, New Work" dated July 15, 1845, and published in the August number of the: Albany Cultivator, says: " More than one half of the ashes of <a name="potatoes528"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is pure potash." As everything contained in a plant must be furnished by man or by nature, this will serve to show the necessity of' 505usingmnore potash in the culture -f <a name="potatoes529"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> than on any other crop; particularly if there be none of it already in the soil. Dr. See, in the letter already referred to, says: "A sugar map le, a grape vine, an apple tree, and a .<a name="potato377"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant, need a soil that Abounds In Potash "a: Take from your fields 200 bushels of <a name="potatoes530"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> this fall, and you will remove from it sixty-three pounds of this mineral. One bushel of ashes is said, by, those who have used them, to make ten extra bushels of <a name="potatoes531"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> if therefore, potash be not present in sufficient quantities, we may reasonably expect that the <a name="potato378"><mark>potato</mark></a> will be impeded in its growth, if indeed that growth is not totally arrested. I f, while the growth is impeded, the supply of carbonic acid be great, and the <a name="potato379"><mark>potato</mark></a> has an opportunity of absorbing it: stud carbonic acid will, by its infectious properties, (even if there be a comparative drought at the time) disease the <a name="potato380"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and if such disease be not checked, it will totally destroy the <a name="potato381"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Carbonic acid loses this infectious property when it becomes a salt, by union with an all ali, and is then rather beneficial than injurious; for, if that all ali be potash, the <a name="potato382"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant will assimilate both the potash and the carbonic acid ; and other conditions being equal, the result will be a large and healthy growth. The foregoing remarks would lead us to suppose that by supplying the alkalies in sufficient quantities we would at least save our <a name="potatoes532"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the rot." Met us see if we can find any evidence to sustain us in that theory. If we cannot, but on the contrary find evidence against it, we should abandon it at once; but if we cannot find anything against it, and all the evidence upon it is in its favor, it is certainly worthy of our attention. Of  f I had time, (unfortunately Am a poor man, and therefore have very little of that to spare) and would take the trouble, I could give you the written certificates of several hundred men, who, when they have used alkaline substances in sufficient quantities upon their <a name="potato383"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops, have never yet lost a crop by rot' but, as such: certificates would not be so satisfactory as some other evidence I am about to give, I will save myself the time and trouble of procuring them. The first evidence I will offer is that of Dr. See, before mentioned. In the letter of this gentleman, from which I have already taken two extracts, I find the. following: "more than one half of the ash of <a name="potatoes533"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is pure potash. Acting .on this hint, 1 have found in my tour scientific farmers, who, by the use of unleashed ashes, lime, and plaster, mixed in equal parts, and placed in the hill with the seed, and on the hill as soon as the tops have well grown, have wholly escaped the <a name="potato384"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, and harvested for several years from 500 to 600 bushels per acre." This would seem to be evidence enough to prove that experience sustains my theory. ut I have more to offer: In the 88th- page of your last report as Commissioner of Patents, it -is stated, as coming under your own observation, that a composition containing an all ali (lime) had prevented the rot. It is also stated on the same page, that to prevent the disease, "salt, lime, and plaster " (all conaipinig alkalies) 'have i been respectively. recommended by their advocates, g and in some instances with diverse success" but, after several close examinations of your report, I can find nothing there which will go to show that substances contain in al allies, when properly applied, have ever failed ofHAVI Ngfull And Complete _SUCCESS In Preventi   Of The Rot. In the other hand, I find considerable evidence going to sustain an opposite view of the case, Permit me to mention son me fit. In the 224th page you ;will find the following, being a part of a letter from a for. S. F. Perley06 a correspondent of the Massachusetts Slough man, who dates his letter October 17, 1844. He says: -a' The rot has prevailed most in ground highly dressed with barn yard manure, especially if placed in the hill. When <a name="potatoes534"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted without any ma are, they have rotted very little. Two pieces on similar ground, (rather wet) the one manured from the barn, the other with hair, lime, flushings, &c, from the tanneryboth applied in the hill the first rotted badly, the other very little. Two pieces the first dressed broadcast, and in the hill, from the barn; the other broadcast, with a com post of barn manure and swamp much, mutdWkilndashes, and clear manure both dry; the first was planted early, th latter late the first rotted in the field; and, being dug in the hot weeks in e September, rotted after being put into the cellar; while the latter, dug at odd jobs, from the middle of September to the middle of October, suffered very little. This piece had plaster put on at the time of planting, and after the <a name="potatoes535"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were up t would appear from the above that the manure which had been applied had been the principal cause of the rot, as (cid127when the <a name="potatoes536"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted without any manure tit by had rotted very little his is accounted for by the fact that the manure finished the destroying agent, the infectious carbonic acid. In pages 230 and 231, it is related that a Mr. Minor, of New Work, stated to the New York Farmers' Club, at their meeting on November 12, 1844, that Mr. James May, of West chester, had informed him "that his <a name="potatoes537"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised with farm yard manure this season were diseased, so that he threw away 20,per cent. of them; that on land where he had used concentrated manure, he had good <a name="potatoes538"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> or. Minor states that this concentrated manure is poudrette, which, you are no doubt aware, contains one or more of the alkalies. Ta page 237, Dr. Jackson, in a letter written to the Albany Cultivator, dated September 23, 1844, says: "I learned that where lime had been used in a preparation of about a table spoonfuls to a Still, there no disease has appeared ;" and on page 244, a 1)r. Gardener is represented to say that" Mr. Anderson has tried lime broadcast; his crop is good." I could refer you to more evidence of this kind, but it might be urged as an objection that these were coincidences that it merely " happened" that where these alkalies were applied the crop ' happened" to be good; or that the soils were different, or something of that sort. To silence such objections as these, I will now show that in the same field of the same soil during the same season with the same heat the same draughts the same wet weather the same seed the same exposure: to, fig i and to insects, (see an article oniFungi and In sects" over the signature of " Chemico" in the October number of the Farmers' Cabinet, Philadelphia' Pennsylvania) with the same culture, and with all other circumstances similar where the <a name="potato385"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was supplied with substances containing alkalies, it was saved from the rot; and where it was not, it sign ally failed. Before doing so, however, allow me to introduce a few statements going to show the truth of part of the foregoing premises, although they do not sustain all, as some others do that I will, before concluding this article, call your attention to. The first case I will refer to is that related by the president of the Newyork Farmers' Club, at the: meeting I have before mentioned, which you will find recorded on page 232 of your report. It is as follows : "in or farm last year we tried <a name="potatoes539"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> wlherlime had been put the war before, at the rate of sixty bu iris to the are; it was on a part of 'our garden, a. -507 which was also well manured at that time. Another trial was made on afield which had been well manured; sheep had run upon it; both the field and the garden are old, high and loam y land' To lime was put on the field. The: <a name="potatoes540"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the garden were planted in April, and' dug u i pin August; they were perfect, In the sheep field the <a name="potatoes541"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted in the last of May or begin king of June, and we hardly had our seed <a name="potatoes542"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> restored to us. The next case I will mention is that of Mr. J. S. Nettervime, who writes from Calamine bridge, Montgomery county, New Jersey, to the editors of the Boston Cultivator, and whose letter is copied into your last report, page 229, where he says: "a< His spring, when I began to plant my <a name="potatoes543"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I took about a table spoonfuls of s lacked lime and put it into each hill; and when they were up, and before they were hold, I made a mixture of eight bushels of reached ashes, two bushels of lime, and three bushels of ground plaster, and stirred them well together. I made a scoop that held about on eg ill, and I put this full of the mixture on each hill, close to the s talks, aindSfbund, when I began to use them in the summer, that they were all sound and continued iso ; and 1 had not one rotten <a name="potato386"><mark>potato</mark></a> when 1 took them spina October, although my neighbors on both sides of the farm had scarce any sound ones to get in; so 1 must think that what I did to my <a name="potatoes544"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was the cause of my being so successfulThdeabove is somewhat conclusive, but the following is still more so. In page 264, a Mr. Joseph Alton, writing to the editor of the Albanycultivator from It. Andrews, New Brunswick, and whose letter is dated November 20, 1844, says: " Mr. Editor : I notice in the November number of the Cultivator complaints made about the 'rot' in <a name="potatoes545"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I was troubled with it for many years, and, having found a remedy, give it for the benefit of your readers. The rot in <a name="potatoes546"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this section of the country commenced about ten years ago; one third of a crop was frequently lost by it, and often in the spring hundreds of bushels have been thrown from i the cellar quite useless. For some years past I have usedslackedlime, which I sprinkle on the <a name="potatoes547"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as soon as they are cut for seed, and shovel the mi over in it, and plant them immediately. Since have adopted this plan I have not lost a <a name="potato387"><mark>potato</mark></a>, either in the ground or after they were put in the cellar ; and such of my neighbors as follow my example are alike fortunate, and in no way troubled with the rot But the most conclusive experiment, and the one that demonstrates the truth of what I said in my promise (given in this article) beyond all doubt or qui able, is one made by, Mr. R. L. Well, of El ham farm, Ulster county, New Work; a statement which is made in a letter written by him to yourself, dated December 18, 1844, and published on pages 241, 242, and 243,of your last report. In that letter he says: 'a( In the year 1843, I planted afield of several acres in drills, harrowed the ground level, and top dressed it with 200 bushels of oystershell lime and charcoal dust to the acre. The yield was 432 bushels per acre.

All that will be necessary is, for each <a name="potato390"><mark>potato</mark></a> raised to gather a few stones from off his farm, and make him a snug little ash house, that will not be liable to take fire, and that will keep out the wet, and then let him require his family to put all their ashes in there ; and when he plants his <a name="potatoes557"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, put those ashes on them, and manure them with rotten straw, hay, sawdust, or swamp much, and not with stable or animal manure. And if he finds in the fall, or the latter part of summer, that he has not put enough on that, in consequence, his <a name="potatoes558"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are diseased let him lose no time, but take a bag full of the best ashes he has, and, throwing it on his shoulder, go over his <a name="potato391"><mark>potato</mark></a> patch and sow it on them till they look light withthedustf; it is better that this should be done in the morning before the dew is off, or during a slight shower, but any time is better than neglecting it altogether. By so doing, his crop will be large, and the <a name="potatoes559"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will be healthy and in no wise affected with the rot, If you desire other information on this subject, see several communications, over the signature of " Chemico" in the May, June, and October numbers of the " Farmers' Cabinet" an agricultural journal published at Philadelphia, in this State.

Edi Tors: The common disease of last year has again made its appearance among the <a name="potatoes564"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this section of the country; to what extent the malady is prevailing, is not exactly known. Now, I am inclined to believe that the disease in chiefly caused by the atmosphere operating upon the stalk in such a manner as to obstruct its natural circulation of sap, which prevents the regular excavations of the plant, and de ranges natures perfect operations by preventing the escape of the excess of ammonia which accumulates in the hill, and is held there in a state of unnatural confinement by the disease of the stalk and the crust which forms upon the surface of the ground, which makes the hill nearly air tight. When, the ammonia in the hill en renders disease, which usually, under these circumstances, makes its appearance in the form of a blister upon the skin, and soon makes progress towards the heart or middle of the <a name="potato396"><mark>potato</mark></a>, forming, as the disease progresses, a kind of fungus upon the surface of the tube r, In other cases the ground appears to crack near the rest of the vine, so that the ammonia escapes so rapid that the vine is killed at once; in which case, it is not uncommon to trace the disease directly down from the stalk, in black streaks, to the middle of the tube r. The reasons which have led me to the foregoing conclusions are many and various; a few only of which will be here suggested, with the hope that others more close in observation, and more philosophical in thought, will show my mistake (if am in error) by tracing out the true, cause of the malady, and prescribe a remedy. In the first place, then, my own observations, corroborated by the testimony of hundreds of others, -show very clearly that when the land is manured with that kind of manure that is highly charged with ammonia, the malady is most fatal. 2d: There the same land, side by side, is manured with manure so rotted as to, have lost all its smell, very little disease is found. 3d. The hardest varieties of <a name="potatoes565"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not as liable to the disease as those which are more tender and feeble. 4th. That kind of comes t possessing no smell of ammonia will. 511invigorate the stalk and elude the disease: for instance, poudrette, salt, lime, house. ashes, plaster, &c. It is believed that an entire revolution in the mode of cultivation must take place, before the farmer will be as certain of success as formerly. Manure that is in a state of ferment at ion when applied to the <a name="potato397"><mark>potato</mark></a> hill, or manure that will ferment so as to ex hale ammonia to any considerable extent during the growth of the plant, will be likely to en gender disease, unless some com post or other substance is used which will so strengthen and in vigor ate the stalk as to enable it to elaborate the sap, and convey back from the air to the root those nutrition elements so necessary to the hill, in order to preserve the health of the family of tubes contained therein. Unless some substitute is used for manure that will not promote ammonia in the hill, what must the cultivate or expect? Disease or disappointment; or he must select poor land for raising his <a name="potatoes566"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and be content with small crops. We suffered greatly by the malady last year, and at that time had no precious experience in the matter. This season we have taken a different course in the preparation of our <a name="potato398"><mark>potato</mark></a> lands. I instead of using any manure, we selected land that was highly dunged last year from the sheep pens and cattle stables, and was in corn. Sloughed twice, as usual, and planted early in May, three feet apart both ways; we cut the <a name="potatoes567"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and used as much lime as would stick without water. As soon as the plants were out of the ground sufficiently to live, we made a com post of salt, unleashed ashes, line, and plaster; incorporated the whole together, and top dressed every hill with a table spoonfuls of the com post, and covered it in the hill at hoeinghoed twice. After the <a name="potatoes568"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had gone out of blossom and the hot weather set in, in July we sowed broadcast over the field two bushels of sal: to the acre. These <a name="potatoes569"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been in eating three or four weeks, and not a diseased <a name="potato399"><mark>potato</mark></a> can be found in the whole field.

The <a name="potato400"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, which, for two or three years, has been so destructive in the middle States, and last year in Massachusetts, and to some extent in New Hampshire and Paine, appears to spread this year over all New England, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Some few locations may escape with little damage, but the destruction is very widely spread. In Somerset and Franklin thousands of acres have been planted in <a name="potatoes570"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for the starch factories. For the Boston Cultivator. The <a name="potato401"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Crop In Mai Of. Miesrs. Edi Tors : From what can be learned, this staple article, in this State, will, in consequence of the rot, fall short one half or two thirds of a usual yield. 2 a. It will be a severe calamity to us, and to citizens of other States who have it heir supply of this useful and necessary article of food from this State. -I n 1844 the farmers of this State raised 12,304,000 bushels of <a name="potatoes571"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and no State in the Union exceeded her in the business, excepting the great State of New Work, with her three millions of inhabitants. The raised 1770 3000 bushels about six bushels to every person in the State ; whilst paine averaged about twenty-four bushels to every person in the State. If we base our calculations upon last years yield in Paine, the loss in consequence of the rot cannot be less than                                                         $1,230,400; more than two dollars to every person in the State. The rot prevails generally throughout the State; last year it prevailed in some sections only. It then seized the <a name="potatoes572"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> about the last of August. It will te remembered that we had in this section of the State very warts weather, with frequent though not heavy rains, about that time, and it invariably cleared off very warm, when formerly it generally came off cooper immediately after rains. This season i has been the warmest for many years. The rains in this section commenced one month earlier than last year say the last of July and first of August; consequently the most of <a name="potatoes573"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, excepting those planted very early, and of an early kind, were young and tea der when these rains commenced. The soil being heated by many days and nights of sultry weather, actually scalded them, and but few, if any, escaped, excepting early planted, and not even these when planted on iunfermentedmfranureit will be remembered that though we had frequent rains, they were not heavy ones barely enough to wet the manure in the hill; which doubtless caused the r ri to rot more rapidly than if the rains had wet down deeper. It will be remembered, also, that the sun came out very hot after these rains, killing the vines of the <a name="potato402"><mark>potato</mark></a>, whilst the heat and wet under the surface were doing their work of destruction to the young and tender tube r. The first appearance of the rot is dirty, yellowish spots, similar in appearance to iron rust; it penetrates the <a name="potato403"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and in a short time turns to a dark color, and the work of destruction is soon finished. They appear to smellbarditaste similar to a frost bitten <a name="potato404"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The State of Massachusetts will probably be exempt from this <a name="potato405"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, if disease it may be called, as she was not visited by rains about the time it was so extremely hot; but her crop of <a name="potatoes574"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> must necessarily be light. Geo. M. Freeman. York, Of, September 25, 1845. Editorial remarks The rot in the <a name="potato406"><mark>potato</mark></a> has prevailed in this State to, a very small extent, compared to its effects in Paine and on the sea coast of New Hampshire, where in many cases no more than a tenth part of a usual crop will be obtained. In some sections in this State the rot has not prevailed at all this year; yet owing to hot, dry weather, the crop is very light and the quality poor. Vol. Held on, of Wilmington, informs us that he usually gets about 200 bushels of <a name="potatoes575"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to the acre ; that this season he had only about 700 bushels on 14 acres. <a name="potatoes576"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> in general are of a poor quality this year. They are brought into this market from different States. 513 and from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and they are most all poor watery, heavy, and of poor flavor. From the Newark Daily Advertise r.

Mr. To well thinks the rot is owing to the sound seed having all run out, and that too little new seed has been produced. He has himself produced a fine crop of new <a name="potatoes577"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from tubes of the Polite variety, and out of nearly fifty bushels not a single <a name="potato409"><mark>potato</mark></a> is diseased.

I planted them as soon as the ground would admit of it manured them in the hill, with well rotted manure. In planting, I selected the largest, and was careful not to get any but those that were perfectly sound; kept the ground free from weeds till autumn, and dug them about the middle of October, although the tops were dead a month sooner. I thought it best to let them remain, and I can truly say that my expectations were more than realized, inasmuch as I had about three hundred bushels to the acre, and have not seen one <a name="potato412"><mark>potato</mark></a> rotten, or in the least affected. At the same time my neighbors complain of their <a name="potatoes578"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> trotting, and many have had to carry them from their cellars. Hours, &c. S. Sanderson.

Of  R: Please to inform your readers that, in my opinion, the failure of the <a name="potato414"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop by rot and rust is caused by cutting the seed. I think the whole trouble may be 'safely attributed to the unfortunate use of the knife among the seed designed for planting. I do earnestly entreat my agricultural friends to pause and take into consideration this hint before they complete the destruction of that valuable root. That beautiful skin 33 514 which God has put over the <a name="potato415"><mark>potato</mark></a> should not be cut, nor in any way wounded, if a perfect crop is wanted. The reasons, if reasons are wanted to establish a self evident fact, together with the remedy, can be made the subject of another communication, if desired. B. Shaw. Oldtown, September 11, 1845. Natewe publish friend Shawls remarks on the <a name="potato416"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, although we cannot agree with him.

To the Editor of the New England Farmer :I observe in European newspapers, recently arrived, that the Frenchacademy of Arts and Sciences reputed Mr. Charles Dorr en, of Siege, toexatmihe into the cause of the <a name="potato418"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot. That the French should have selected a foreigner for this purpose, says more for the high esteem in which his talents are held, than anything which can emanated from me. This gentleman has stated the result of his investigation to be, that the r otis caused by a fungus, the spores or <a name="seeds60"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of which exist in vast quantitiqsiin the atmosphere ; and this opinion has been generally received as true by the best informed circles in Europe. I have not seen the paper by Professor Dorr en, and therefore do not know whether he suggests any remedy or not. You well remember that the result of my observations onthisjdisease, published in your paper last year, perfectly accords with that of Professor Dorr en, and that the remedy I proposed of salt was founded on 44~ power of this substance to dissolve and destroy most of the fungus family hence, where there was salt, the spores could not ve get ate. I alsoregwetjted (and much more regret now, as the disease has caused such extent, g devastation) that I did not possess a microscope of sufficient perfection to enable me to pursue my examinations both into the disease and its remedy; the want of this alone made me drop all further investigations on the subject. But previous to this, I repeated and considerably extended my experiments with various chemical salts, and drew up a paper of several closely written pages, containing the details, with all my views on the subject; which paper, by request, I sent to the New York State Agricultural Society, last December. Of this communication, as well as of one accompanied by eight or nine samples of various qualities of gun no, with the analysis of each, they did me the honor not to take the slightest notice. I am very sorry that I did not keep a copy of this paper, which, of course, is now amongst things lost or forgotten. I have no doubt that this disease is completely under the dominion of science, and that a perfect remedy for it exists. Hours, truly, Of. Teschemacher. Bsq. October 4, 1845. a. 515 From the New England Farmer, The <a name="potato419"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Seasesalt Of A Remedy. Of. Joseph Breck: I think the public must have reason to be satisfied with the indefatigable spirit you evince in collecting information on the subject of the <a name="potato420"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, which is more universal in this country than most people think. I hear, every day, of instances of parcels stored in cellars, apparently sound when put in, which are now totally worthless. Depend upon it, unless some remedy be found, it will hardly be worth while to plant <a name="potatoes581"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> another year. In order that I may not be misunderstood, I will now succinct ly state my opinions on this subject. I think that salt, lime, and several chemical compounds, will destroy the disease. I prefer salt, because, when mixed in the soil, it may get into the juices, and circulate through the whole plant. Time, or lime water, would do the same, to a certain extent, but it is far less so ruble than salt. The fungus I have seen vegetables upon and thickens the sides of the cells of which the <a name="potato421"><mark>potato</mark></a> is composed, which cells contain the grains of starch. The starch is not injured until the sides of the cells rotted by the fungus burst; the worms or maggots breed, and the whole finally becomes a mass of putrid it y, with an offensive, fungus like smell. I saw in your last weeks paper several cases of the disease occurring where sea weed has been used, and also near the sea shore. These cases would seem to military against the idea of salt being a cure. But they are very far from convincing me, for the following reasons: the salt atmosphere near the sea may not have contained one tenth enough salt to destroy the rot, or the prevailing winds there may not have spread the spray insufficient quantity. And with respect to sea weed in a late London journal there are analyses of four different kinds of sea weed, performed by burning the weed and analyzing the ashes. Ashes. Saltlaminaria sac charing gave to 100 lbs. about -10 lbs. 3 lbs. Mucus vesiculosus ' 100 " " -20 it 6 "mucus serratus t" 100 "2 " -26 " 10 "mucus crisp us, or Honoria crisp a " 100 " " -255 1" 4 "they varied also considerably in the other ingredients. Now, when this great difference exists in the quantity of salt in different sea weeds just taken from the sea, and when it is considered that the sea weed is often made into a com post, turned over and exposed to all kinds of weather, by which salt may be washed out, it must be obvious that no true judgment can be formed of its effects on the <a name="potato422"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, unless the kind of sea weed, and all the attendant circumstances, be taken into account. The spores of the fungus, in the cases alluded to, might have been, and most probably were, so numerous, that the salt thus adventitious ly obtained was not sufficient to destroy them. In a paper transmitted to the New York State Agricultural Society, (alluded to in a former communication) I recommended an analysis of sound <a name="potatoes582"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and a parallel one of those just contaminated by the rot; and this to be done not in the usual way, by reducing to ashes, but by expressing the juices and analyzing them. This would show whether there was any difference in the ingredients that might be considered as offering favorable circumstances for fungus vegetation. The analysis by incline ration should 516 also be tried; for, if salt destroys the fungus, as my own eyes as well as, those of others have seen, it is a fair presumption that if we can get a solution of salt into the juices of the plant, in any shape, it will be unfavorable to the vegetation of the spores. Until I see a number of experiments fairly tried with salt, lime, &c, and they have failed, I shall not be persuaded that the views I have taken of these, as remedies for the <a name="potato423"><mark>potato</mark></a> evil, are erroneous ; and should they prove of no value, I am quite ready to give them up and try again. Hours, truly, J. E. Teschemacher. Boston, November 15, 1845. In our next, we shall, by request, give a translation of the opinions of. Dorr en, Professor of Agriculture in the University of Siege, Brussels whose investigations have led him to believe, with Mr. Teschemacher, that fungus is the cause of the <a name="potato424"><mark>potato</mark></a> evil an opinion which is now attracting more attention from the intelligent classes in Europe, than any other yet advanced concerning the origin of the rot or murrairEDI Tor. For Prof. Torrent, see appendix No. 6.]BosToN, December 8, 1845. Dear Of  R: The steamer Cambric, just arrived, has put us in possession, of the report to the British government, by Professors Lane, Lay fair, andLindley, on the <a name="potato425"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease. We have now the reports, on this subject, of scientific men in three European countries: Professor Putting, in Germany, Professor Oh. Dorr en, in Belgium and France, and the above report in Great Britain. Having interested myself in this disease, by about three months' study last autumn, I have read these with some attention; and thinking a short review of them may lead to some useful conclusions, I address you according to promise promising, however, that I shall leave nearly untouched the subject of saving <a name="potatoes583"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for this years consumption, or the more intricate process of starch making. All these reports appear to coincide in the opinion, that a minute fungus is the first visible cause of the disease; that this fungus spreads rapidly through the tube r by means of its s pawn, mycelium, or spores, causing rotten ness. Professor Dorr en states that he has traced it from the leaf, where it commences, downwards, causing thereby the death of the haul m, from which it finally enters the <a name="potato426"><mark>potato</mark></a>. This is also my opinion, published in 1844. I had traced it through the place where the stem joins the tube r, not having commenced my investigation with the green haul m. But had also seen it pass through the skin of the tube r, and work its way to the centre and all around. The British professors, doubting whether this fungus is the true cause of the disease, state, that it seems to be connected with the cold, cloudy, un genial weather which has characterized the present year over the north of Europe; conditions highly unsuited to the constitution of a plant which, like the <a name="potato427"><mark>potato</mark></a>, is a native of a warm sunny country, and insufficient for the ripe king of the tubes. But quite decisive objections to this view are First. That we have had a warm, dry sun per on this side of the Atlantic, with more than a usual proportion of i sunshine, and yet the disease has spread with equal fatal it here; and, Second. That they have had many such cloudy, wet, and cold summers. 517 before in Europe, without the appearance of this peculiar disease in the <a name="potato428"><mark>potato</mark></a>. It is clear, therefore, that this so called atmospheric influence is merely a name, without a distinct tangible meaning, and the evil of accounting for the disease by a mere name, such as an epidemic or atmospheric influence, is to stop all further inquiry and investigation, either into cause or remedy for if the nature of the cause be not known, the attempts at remedy are mere guesses. If the seed of the hung i were not there, the atmospheric influence could not cause them to ve get ate; and if, knowing the nature of thisfungi, we can destroy them or prevent them from ve getting, there is an end of the disease. Again : that' the disease has increased immensely since 1844.gives a very strong natural presumption that it arises from the rapid and more widely diffused propagation of a vegetable fungus, whose seed, (spores according to Professor Dorr en, are quickly generated in inconceivable numbers. The British professors practically feel, however, that the disease is caused by this fungus, for they recommend " that <a name="potatoes584"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should not be planted in the same soil from which the diseased ones are taken this year, as it is in 11 probability filled with the <a name="seeds61"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of hung i, in countless myriads, which must have been scattered over the painted fields, and, although they have been probably borne by the winds to every part of the country, are in great profusion there They must therefore clearly think that the spores of the fig i will again attack the <a name="potato429"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Any one with a good microscope can clearly trace the propagation of this fungus inside the sound <a name="potato430"><mark>potato</mark></a>, from cell to cell. It is on the sides (walls) of the cell that it vegetables; but they cannot trace any previous rotten ness in the cells, although the juices therein may be favorable to this fungus propagation. A careful analysis of these juices, compared with those of perfectly sound <a name="potatoes585"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, might throw light upon this subject. The increase and propagation of other vegetables as well as hung i, under peculiar and favorable circumstances, on which science has as yet but little knowledge, is not. uncommon. A few years since, about 1! mile square of salt marsh in Last Boston, close to my residence, was one season entirely and thickly covered with gnaphalium polycephalum, scenting all around with its peculiar odor, where, for years previously, only a few spikes had been known, and to which state the spot has now reverted. It would be difficult to find a hundred spikes, where, that year, there were millions. That there are peculiar circumstances which favor the rapid propagation of particular hung i is certain, and equally certain that there must also be circumstances unfavorable to it, and it is to the study and production of these unfavorable circumstances that we have to look for remedies. A careful perusal of these reports will, I think, satisfy any one that a minute fungus, propagation g profusely under favorable circumstances, is the cause of the disease; and that salt, lime, and various chemical salts, will probably if not certainly prove the most effectual remedies; and this is precisely the opinion I formed after about three months' investigation, during the autumn of 1844, and which I embodied in a paper I then sent to the New York State Agriculture- City. Respecting these remedies professor C. Dorr en (no mean authority on these subjects) states that salt; lime, and blue stone, (sulphate of copper strewed over the land, will destroy the disease ; but he does not give, or I have not seen, the experiments by which he substantiates this fact. I found 518 that these remedies destroyed the mycelium, and all other propagated parts of the fungus, except the spores; but if they are destructive to the vegetation, where they are found the spores cannot ve get ate. My object in recommending the application of salt to the soil, was, that it might be taken up in a liquid state by the roots, and circulate throughout, thus preventing the beginning of the disease, which Professor Dorr en states to originate with the vegetation of the fungus spores in the leaf. The British professors, in their first report, de cry the use of salt to the <a name="potato431"><mark>potato</mark></a> when dug up, as accelerateing the progress of the disease; but in their last report they recommend strongly to steep the sets, previous to planting, in a solution of salt and blue stone. The truth as respects the application to <a name="potatoes586"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> dug is, probably, that if the disease is already under the skin, the salt cannot penetrate, and then, unless the bring were very strong, the moisture of the solution may accelerate the progress ; but I do not believe that an entirelyuntainted <a name="potato432"><mark>potato</mark></a>, if covered with a strong bring solution, will ever receive the disease. The instances where salt has been used in the soil, and the <a name="potatoes587"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have escaped, are not un frequent; after numerous inquiries, I have heard but one solitary exception ; where six bushels to the acre had been harrowedzpn, the <a name="potatoes588"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had the rot the same as those without salt. I admit that this alone would be fatal to the virtue of the remedy, were it not for one circumstance. I found, on inquiry, that the soil was the stiff est and most unyielding clay. In to this water cannot freely penetrate, much less water thickened with salt; the experiment, therefore, does not prove the use of salt, for in every probability it was washed from the surface, or never penetrated to the roots of the <a name="potato433"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I have not the slightest objection to surrender my opinion, when it is found not just. There are several instances in which the application of chlorine gas has clearly destroyed the disease ; but this application is impossible on a large scale, and is, besides, liable to very dangerous and fatal accidents; but salt is a mixture of chlorine and soda. Unslacked lime will also destroy this fungus, and must therefore be a most excellent addition to the soil with salt; but lime is not so easily caused to circulate in the juices, except as lime water, and then the acids in the plant would quickly sat urate it and change its nature ; in addition to which, it soon attracts carbonic acid from the atmosphere, and becomes carbonate of lime, in which state its powers on hung i are very questionable. The most important object is now to provide for the .next years crop both <a name="potatoes589"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to plant and soil in such a state as to offer the fairest hopes of obtaining it free from this dreadful disease ; for if it occur the ensuing season with the virulence of the present, we may bid adieu to the <a name="potato434"><mark>potato</mark></a> nay, for aught we know, it may attack some other vegetable of equal importance i have studied and reflected much on the subject; the result is the following recommendation met the <a name="potatoes590"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> intended to be planted be selected with the greatest care, with the fairest and cleanest skins, rejecting all such as have small, dark, soft pustule us looking spots, which are of te, jot larger than the head of a pin; powder them over very liberally wh i to' in quick lime, and keep them as warm and as dry as possible; it is itlspensablk, however, that the warmth be a dry heat.

To not use any manure; put ing u ano if so minded, as it is not possible that the seed of the fungus can exist in it, whereas manure may be a fertile source of them. Must before planting, plough both lime and salt into the land, then steep the tubes in a strong solution of bring, to which a little blue stone (sulphate of copper) may be added, and commit them to the soil. I have not said anything respecting quantity; this must depend on the soil. An addition to the report of the British professors gives a favorable opinion of pe at, bog ashes, and the water from pe at bogs, I notice this, to warn the farmer that the bogs here do not quite resemble those in I re land, and, in my opinion, would not be equally efficacious, for reasons which would be too long to detail; but their idea appears to me to be well founded, and worth extensive trial with the English and I wish pe at, in which all kinds of vegetable and even animal substances have been found in a perfect state of preservation, although they have lain there imbedded for centuries. Hours, most respectfully, J.  Teschemagher. Edimund Burke, Esq, Washington. New York, November 17, 1845. Dear, Of  R: I promised you the result of some experiments which I made on some diseased <a name="potatoes591"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and it is as follows selected a quantity of these roots from a lot which had been rejected as in fit for use. They all were affected. I divided them into three parcels. The first subjected, for twelve hours, to a weak solution of chloride of lime in water. The second was, in like manner, subjected to the action of a saturated solution of recently burnt lime in water. The third lot was freely sprinkled over with recently burnt lime water, s lacked to dryness. The two first lots were, after being so treated, placed on a brick pavement under cover, and the third lot was suffered to remain partially covered with dry caustic lime, and all of them so suffered to remain for six weeks; when they were examined, and the disease found to have been wholly arrested. The <a name="potatoes592"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, however, in the first and last lots, had somewhat shrunk, owing probably to the too caustic treatment which they had received; but the second lot, or that which had been stepped twelve hours in lime water, were plump and good; and, when boiled, the diseased portions or blotches came off with the mind. The parcel from which I took the <a name="potatoes593"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on which I experimented continued to perish, and were finally thrown away as worthless. Exposure to the atmosphere in a dry place may have had a beneficial effect; but the disease is, beyond a doubt, occasioned by hung i of a very delicate texture, which were destroyed or de composed by the acrid substances to which they were exposed. If mistaken in the character of the disease, and it should ultimately be found to result from the depredations of animalculae, the cure maybe ascribed to the same cause. The results of my ex per ni ist- induce me to believe that the absence of a sufficient quantity of limeisonle (carbonate or phosphates of lime) in soils is the cause of the disease in the <a name="potato435"><mark>potato</mark></a>. If it be owing to other cause or causes, the remedy indicated, it seems to me, is the fro use of lime, water 5 20 is lacked to dryness, or of unleashed ashes at the planting or first dressing season of the <a name="potato436"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and I suggest to farmers, who have suffered from this widespread pestilence in their crops, to try whether a judicious use of these materials may not prove a corrective for, or preventive of, this disease. With great respect, your friend and obedient servant, Edward Clark. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. Calai S, Of, January, 1846. Of  R: The <a name="potato437"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease prevailed the past year in the whole State of paine, in the Province of New Brunswick, and to some extent in Novascotia. In the eastern part of Paine, where there was no disease the year before, it was the most destructive the past year. I cannot give you its cause, nor a remedy; but will give some incidents relative to its character Some of my seed <a name="potatoes594"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> I cut, and put lime in the hill with them when planted. Some I planted whole, with lime. Some cut and some whole ones, without lime. Some seed I procured from a distance, and which was grown upon a different soil entirely. Of  n some of my com post manure I used a large quantity of potash. In all these cases the disease upon the <a name="potato438"><mark>potato</mark></a> was apparently the same, nor did the quantity or quality of the yield vary. The greatest difference was found in <a name="potatoes595"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted upon different soils. In that soil which was stimulated most by manure, (and especially by manure in the hill) the rot" was the greatest. In dry loam y soil the disease did not affect the <a name="potato439"><mark>potato</mark></a> so much. In wet land, and especially on wet clay land, the disease was most fatal. It was observed, that where lumps of clay lay so near to the new grown <a name="potato440"><mark>potato</mark></a> as to touch it, the <a name="potato441"><mark>potato</mark></a> would be rotten on that side touched by the clay. The <a name="potatoes596"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which grew nearest the surface, and nearest the stalk, were also observed to be most rotten. Those soils on which the salt rock weed was used as a manure in great abundance, and where the influence of the salt water fogs was felt, were equally if not worse affected by the disease. One experiment I made, the result of which I think important. As the <a name="potatoes597"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were dug, a part of them were put into barns, and a part were put in heaps of fifty bushels each, on a dry part of the field, and covered, first with straw and then with dirt, four or six inches deep. I left them here as long as it was safe, on account of the frost. We found, in taking those from the barns to the cellar late in the fall, many of them had rotted, and others looked sickly. But those we took from the heaps in the field to the cellar (being the latest removed) were as bright and sound as when dug, except a few which had entirely rotted, and which we supposed had commenced rotating before put into the heap. I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant, Geo. M. Chase. On. Edmund Burke, Commissider of Patents. a. 521ARE They All Of  Staken Ppotato Rot. To the Editor of the Paine Farmerdear Of  R: As one of the many who are particularly interested in the <a name="potato442"><mark>potato</mark></a> malady, I have watched narrowly the thousand and one plausible and un plausible conjectures about the cause of the <a name="potato443"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, so universally prevalent in the <a name="potato444"><mark>potato</mark></a> kingdom of all Up Last. I find as great a diversity of opinion upon this subject as there generally is on all others that call forth the expression of the multitude. The <a name="potato445"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot will seriously affect the deposites of thousands in our State; but let us bear in mind that all the rotten ness in the body politic is not confined to the <a name="potato446"><mark>potato</mark></a> tribe. That the <a name="potato447"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot is caused by the drought, or moisture, cold or heat of this or the past year, or that it is caused by cutting the seed, or by an insect wounding the tops, or the premature killing of the <a name="potatoes598"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by mildew, rust, or frost, I cannot believe; and I will give you the reason. Last spring, the thought struck me that <a name="potatoes599"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> would, if left in a cellar through the summer, produce new <a name="potatoes600"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and accordingly, to try the experiment, I laid a few (say half a bushel) on some dry t an bark, in a dark dry place in my cellar. Yesterday I took some of them out, and on examining them I find quite a number of new <a name="potatoes601"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, from the size of a hens egg down to a mine, as you will see by the samples I send you ; and on examining the new <a name="potatoes602"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I find among and upon some of them precisely the same appearances of the disease and rot, that I did in diseased and rotten <a name="potatoes603"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the field in its first stages. Of course you will bear in mind that the disease on those I send you must be in its first stage. Now, Mr. Editor, by this you will see, that if the disease in the <a name="potatoes604"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that I send you is the same as that confined to those grown in the open air, it is all folly to talk about rust, the heat, cutting the seed, &c for none of these, I presume, caused the rot among those grown in my cellar. My opinion is, that the cause is in the <a name="potato448"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and in the <a name="potato449"><mark>potato</mark></a> alone. It is universally the case with us, that the richer the soil is in which <a name="potatoes605"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are grown, the more and faster do they rot when in the ground. You may hear from me again upon this subject, but my engagements at this time will not allow of more at present. Truly yours, E. G. Buxton. North Yarmouth\ Centre, October 9, 1845. Notewe have examined the <a name="potatoes606"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which friend Buxton has sent us, and can see no difference at all in the disease that affects them from the disease in the field. They can be seen at our officeEDI Tor. For the Boston Cultivator. The <a name="potato450"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. Messrs. Edi Tors : Such has been said and written on the rot in <a name="potatoes607"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. With your permission, without pretending to solve the question, I will make a few remarks upon the subject, which may or i a ty not cast some light upon the cause and remedy. Perhaps no subject has perplexed and 522 baffled every one more than this. Some have supposed it to be the electrical influence upon the tops. Others have held it to be something peculiar in the soil. I am inclined to suppose that the leading cause is in the soil. If so, the remedy must there be sought. From all that I can gather from what 1 have seen and heard, it appears to me that it is mostly from mismanagement in the husbandry; the air and electricity have probably much to do in the case. As far as. I can learn from inquiry, I am satisfied that the <a name="potatoes608"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rot most where they come most in contact with manure, especially sea dressing. The immediate cause of rot is probably a blight of some kind rust, or some other on the tops. This more or less diseases the stalk, root, and tube r. In proportion to the violence of this blight, the rot probably progresses. Manure coming in immediate contact with the growing crop, by being put in the hill or spread upon the ground, forces the growth, especially of tops, too fast. This renders the substance of the tops too loose and too much inclined to fungus matter. Therefore, whenever a suddevlchange has come, from a hot day to a cold night, and then to a hot sun again the tops have not had stain a of constitution sufficient to stand and withstand this change. The consequence has been diseased tops, which, in the end, has diseased the whole system. I am disposed also to think that the latent cause is a good deal in not sloughing the land sufficiently deep. I am apprehensive that maturing on the top of the ground and in the hill induces too much growth in the early part of the season; the roots, which seek moisture, coming in contact with the hard ground below the ploughed stratum, are resisted in their progress, and become unable to supply the plant with sufficient moisture from the earth. In the meantime, the roots which were near the surface to collect the solar influences for the plant, and the leaves of the plant which collect from the atmosphere having their full operation, supply more of their relative proportion of matter towards the general growth, than the descending roots can an over stock comes to the plant, and produces disease. The natural inquiry here comes, what can be the remedy? I candidly confess I do not know; but I will suggest my opinion. I am inclined to think that <a name="potatoes609"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> would do better, all things considered, without any manure in the land. But should manure be applied, let it be ploughed in to the depth of 15 or 16 inches more if possible. The depth of earth would be sufficient for the descending roots to gather moisture through the season, to act in concert with other roots and the leaves, thereby preserving a healthy state of the plant. This disease, whatever it is, comes from an over action in some part of the plant, and a minor action in some other part. And it is very evident that the roots cannot penetrate the hard an broken ground below the ploughed stratum, to obtain moisture. It is very evident, too, that no plant can grow and be healthy when deprived of proper moisture. I would also suggest one other thing concerning the cultivation of <a name="potatoes610"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the planting in drills. After sloughing the land as deep as possible, just make a mark (not a furrow) for the rows ; then, after dropping the seed, turn back furrows upon the seed, putting on all the earth that the future crop will require. Afterwards, to subdue the weeds, run a light fine harrow over the ground, as often as necessary. When the crop will all set at once, and all will bgsizeable; having no small, worthless <a name="potatoes611"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It is well. 523 known that by adding earth about the tops of <a name="potatoes612"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> sets a new crop every time that the addition is made. It is also well known, I believe, that these successive crops are of very little, if any, value to the owner. My notion about the growth of vegetables from the three causes the united effects of the watery roots, the solar roots, and the leaves may or may not be novel to others; but I am strongly persuaded that these three are the main causes of growth, health, and disease in all vegetables. Other causes undoubtedly operate, to wit: the electrical; but these are so subtle and fine, that we cannot go much into a definition of them. We can do but little more than talk about them; but whatever agency and effect electricity may have and it is undoubtedly very great am inclined to suppose that that agency depends very much upon the due and proper management of the three causes which I have noticed above. I will say one word more upon the subject, and close. To far as I can learn, the long red <a name="potato451"><mark>potato</mark></a> does not rot so bad as the other kinds. If this is true, that variety should be sought and planted the next season, in preference to any other. It is also undoubtedly the richest and most productive of any kind that we have. The <a name="potato452"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is now almost the standard of life on the face of the earth, and no labor, research, nor investigation should be spared to prevent it, and protect it from loss. To far as we know now, we have no substitute for it. Or    To. Portland, October, 1845. The <a name="potato453"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. To the Editor of the Sang or Whig and Courierwith your permission, I propose to review some of the opinions put forth and entertained on the subject of the death and rot of the <a name="potato454"><mark>potato</mark></a>. And, first, of disease. Very learned professors have asserted, and continue to repeat, that the <a name="potato455"><mark>potato</mark></a> is diseased dying out; and most persons believe it; and the question is often asked, what shall be substituted for the <a name="potato456"><mark>potato</mark></a>? The sudden death of the <a name="potato457"><mark>potato</mark></a> top, and the subsequent rotating of the tubes, are said to result from disease in the seed planted. But what are the facts offered to demonstrate the soundness of this theory? Simply that the tops die and the tubes rot. And what does this prove? Nothing. In the other hand, the <a name="potato458"><mark>potato</mark></a> tops the present season were seldom if evermore thrifty, or gave greater promise of an abundant yield. Up to the hour of their death, the <a name="potato459"><mark>potato</mark></a> tops of every variety, to all appearance, were never more healthy or vigorous, If this fact affords any evidence of decay in the plant, the advocates of disease may have all the benefit to be derived from it. It is said by others that the <a name="potato460"><mark>potato</mark></a> top is killed by a worm eating into the stalk near the ground, and making his abode there. This is true every year to a greater or less extent; but the effect is, not to rust or rot the stalk, but it merely dries up, as it would do if cut off. Plants killed by the <a name="potato461"><mark>potato</mark></a> worm emit no unpleasant smell; and, therefore, the rust of the present season is not caused by a worm. Others, again, assert that it is a little black bug that has killed the <a name="potato462"><mark>potato</mark></a> tops. I have examined a number of fields with I articular reference to this 524 bug. This bug is about the size, ships as nimble, and will jump as many times his length, as a flea; and, as near as I am able to estimate, would number about as many to a hill of <a name="potatoes613"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as there are fleas in a well instructed family of flea catchers. To much for the " little black bug." Now to the remedy. Doctor Jackson says: " I learn that where lime has been used in the proportion of about a table spoonfuls to a hill, there no disease has appeared." In the same paper he asserts: " To peculiarities of soil or of manures appear to afford any explanation, for the plant appears to have been affected in one as much as the other." This last is true. But how is the common farmer to be instructed by the above statements ?a? Dr. Jackson is a strong advocate for the use of lime as a manure; and, by putting about a table spoonfuls in a hill, does the lime cease to act as a manure, and operate as medicine to a diseased plant ?a. Again, he says, "that after vines had become affected, the best remedy was to cut the stems off close to the ground." This was intended, doubtless, for the instruction of farmers; but before adopting it, I would inquire if it is based upon scientific principles ?a? If we would kill bushes, root and branch, science has told us to cut the stems off close to the ground, in August. Whistles and weeds are killed by the same process. The roots of whistles and bushes are killed more certainly in August than in any other month, because the hot weather of that month is more sure to produce ferment at ion, or, in other words, to rot the roots. But Dr. Jackson says that when the vines of the <a name="potato463"><mark>potato</mark></a> become " affected "that is, dead the best remedy to keep it alive, to prevent the tubes rotating, is to cut its head of fee says, again : ' I observed that the <a name="potato464"><mark>potato</mark></a> began to rot next to the skin, and the disease penetrated inward in many cases to the depth of half an inch." This description is true, and applies to Paine as well as New Work, and proves to my mind that the <a name="potato465"><mark>potato</mark></a> had no internal disease, but was made to rot by an external influence. This external influence was ferment at ion. But the <a name="potatoes614"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, it is said, rotted principally after they were dug and in the cellar.  Very true; and what was the cause ?a? The month of August was extremely dry and warm in New Work, and the month of September in Paine; and although the vines were killed some time before digging, there was not moisture enough in the tube r, or in the soil, to produce ferment at ion. The ferment at ion being partial or incomplete, produced a dry rot. When put in the cellar in large piles, moisture collected and caused rot. This has been a wet season, and the rot is not altogether external, or dry. The doctors would call this difference in the rot, I presume, a new type of the old disease. A Glenburn Farmer. From the Boston Cultivator. Dryi Of Potatoesa Len burn Farmer" says, in a letter to the editor of the Sang or Courier, " keep <a name="potatoes615"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> dry, and they will not rot." We copy the following extract from his letter: "I assume it to be a fact that the <a name="potato466"><mark>potato</mark></a> is not diseased. The tops of the <a name="potato467"><mark>potato</mark></a> have been killed, extensively, the two past seasons, and, as a very natural consequence, the unripe, half grown tubes have rotted. The cause of the rot is ferment at ion. Prevent ferment at ion, and the frightful ' <a name="potato468"><mark>potato</mark></a>. 525 plague' is cured. This must be done by drying. Any farmer who has trotting field of <a name="potatoes616"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may save them by digging and spreading them so thin as to dry the surface, and keep them dry until cold weather, and he can then safely s tow them away in the cellar. Trying any substance, as every one should know, will prevent ferment at ion. Fermentation in vegetable matter produces decomposition, and decomposition is rot Remarks by the editor of the Boston Cultivatordrying <a name="potatoes617"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> maybe a good method to save them from rot, and it may be well to save the min this way; yet by exposure to the air they will lose much of their good quality. If <a name="potatoes618"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> lay in a box or barrel, open to the air, and in a room, shed, or other place out of the cellar, they will lose much of their good qualities in five or six weeks. To preserve <a name="potatoes619"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in good condition they should be dug with as little exposure to the air as possible, and put in a cellar, in a close bin, case, or box, and the cellar should be closed so as to exclude light and air. Met it may be better to save them with the loss of apart of their good properties, than to let them decay ; but we would caution the lovers of good <a name="potatoes620"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> against too much exposure, as it will cause a great depreciation in their value. From the Ohio Cultivator. A Few Facts About <a name="potatoes621"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Mr. John M. Puffy, of Neuro, in this county, (franklin) informs us that he planted, on the 28th of May last, two patches of <a name="potatoes622"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, of about one-sixth to one-fourth of an acre each. One of them was on land on which cattle were fed (fattened) with corn the fall previous, by which means it was highly manured. In this land one bushel of seed was planted, of the Mershannock variety, cut into small pieces, and three or four pieces dropped in a hill; the hills four feet apart, and the ground well cultivated during summer. The tops grew with great vigor, covering the whole ground; and owing to the fine rains of the latter part of summer, they continued to grow until destroyed by frost in autumn. In digging, the product was found to be 77. bushels, (from the one bushel of seed) and the appearance of the <a name="potatoes623"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was very fine. The other piece of land, of somewhat less extent, was planted with three packs of the same kind of seed, but no manure had been applied, and less labor was bestowed in cultivation. The weeds were allowed to grow after wheat harvest, and the tops, which were much less luxuriant than of the other piece, were all ripe and dead before frosts came. The yield of this patch was only 241 bushels. Both these lots of <a name="potatoes624"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were dug at the same time and buried in the same manner, in trenches in the ground. In a few weeks it was discovered that those from the rich ground, and which had the tops destroyed by frost were beginning to rot. They were soon taken out of the trenches, sorted and dried, but the disease continues to spread among them to such an extent that it is doubtful whether any will be saved. But those from the ground which had no manure, and where the tops ripened before the appearance of frost, have not shown any symptoms of decay. Mr. Thompson, on a neighboring farm, also had a patch of <a name="potatoes625"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which were ripe before the frosts appeared, and his have shown no disposition to rot; while another neighbor, Mr. Miller, had a patch that was green until killed by the frost, and his <a name="potatoes626"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have nearly all rotted. These facts have induced the farmers in that township to suppose that the disease is caused by the killing of the tops before they were done growing. This, we believe, has in many cases appeared to induce the disease, but many facts have been found to prove that it is not generally, if ever, the ultimate cause of the evil. From the Boston Cultivator. Cause Of The <a name="potato469"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. E. G. Buxton, in the Paine Farmer, states an experiment which he made in growing some <a name="potatoes627"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the cellar, in a dark place, and they were affected with rot, like those raised in the field. From this he infers that the disease is not caused by rust, heat, cutting the seed, &c, but that the cause is in the <a name="potato470"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Some person, commenting on this, attributes the cause to disease in the previous crop, which was not perceptible, and was transmitted to the new produce. We do not believe in either of these causes. We do not think the <a name="potato471"><mark>potato</mark></a> is running out or generally declining, and will finally become extinct, as is said to be the case with some species of animals and vegetables; which is the view, as we suppose, that Mr. Buxton takes of the subject. And though the disease may in some cases be transmitted by planting infected seed, this is not the general cause; for, on this principle, how did it originate, and why does it prevail to a vast extent this year where it was unknown before ?when, what is the cause ?a? is a question that will naturally be suggested in the minds of our readers. We expressed our opinion when this subject was first agitated, and the hundreds of causes assigned, and the numerous arguments offered in favor of one supposed cause and another, have only tended to confirm us in our opinion, which is, that the disease is caused by an unfavorable atmospheric influence. This is rather indefinite, but we would rather be indefinitely correct than definitely wrong. Now, as no cellar is air tight, and probably no cellar is kept shut during the whole year, the same air that generally prevails around a cellar must in some measure pervade it. Our object now is not to defend the position we have taken ; we have before given some reasons for it, and we may give more at another time, but we wish to show that the causes above assigned are not correct, and that the case named does not in the least military against the view which we have taken, and frequently expressed. For the In diana Farmer and Gardener. The <a name="potato472"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Bli   Ght. A. Edi Tor : Something like ten days ago, and after the late rains had commenced, I discovered that the leaves on the tops (of one patch) of my <a name="potatoes628"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which extended horizontally, were dead. They had the appearance. 527 of having been frost bitten, and, were of a dark brown color. I attributed it to too much wet, as they were situated in a low piece of ground, where theater (when it falls as copious ly as it has of late) stands for some time after falling. I took no further notice of it till two days after, when I found the entire tops were in the same fix" though they always had kept their erect position. It occurred to me then that the disease so much spoken of in the east had extended to this region. What are the symptoms of that disease? Does it show itself this early in the season? I have examined another lot growing on high ground, which is yet entirely free from this defect. I send you by the bearer a sample of the affected <a name="potato473"><mark>potato</mark></a> tops, that you may examine them for yourself, and give your numerous readers your opinion upon the subject.

Sdr: Lee- Dear Air: The writer of an article copied into your Decemberniumber says: "he very careful not to plant <a name="potatoes629"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> infected with the disease. Avoid planting <a name="potatoes630"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in places where they grew this year The following facts illustrate the respective value of these two directions. Upon a farm I have in Bradford county, A, there grew in 1844 three fields of <a name="potatoes631"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. They were planted before I came into possession ; but I believe the seed was all sound, and from the same stock. One field was new land, very high and dry. The other two were older land, lower and moister. Very <a name="potato475"><mark>potato</mark></a> grown in the first field was sound. In the others some were diseased. The next season, (1845) one of the lower fields was again planted, using seed from the high ground. The summer was driver than in 1844, and the produce was all sound: as was also that on some adjacentgreensward planted with the same seed. Further to prosecute the experiment, I had some infected seed planted on a part of the green s ward, and there the crop was more than half lost. There was no communication of the disease, though the sound and diseased hills were but three feet apart. In my professional rides over the mountains and valleys of Bradford andChemung counties, I have observed the farmers in the valleys suffering so much the more from this scourge, that I have often advised them to procure seed from their high land neighbors the inferences from my observations are, that the disease is not contains; :that it is perpetuated by infected seed, and not through contamliStion of the soil; and that low, moist localities are most obnoxious to its influence.

Edi Tors: For some years past a great deal has been written on farming, and I have read much on the subject, and I think it has been a 528 great benefit to me. I find much in your paper on the <a name="potato477"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, and I will add a fact from my own experience. My <a name="potatoes632"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> first rotted in 1844,though not so much as my neighbors. I dug and put them in the cellar as usual, where they rotted badly. This year I planted in several places, and some of them were badly cracked and very poor, but on one piece a part of the land descended to the north, where the influence of the sun was less, and on this part I had as good <a name="potatoes633"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as I ever raised. For twenty-five years past, the <a name="potato478"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop has generally succeeded well among us, and I intend to continue to improve the seed time, expecting to gather a good crop. Edmund L. Lane. Of Lli   Ngworth, Connecti   Cut. From the Worcester Spy, One of our subscribers informs us of a fact which may be of some practical importance, in relation to the rot in <a name="potatoes634"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. He says that he raised in his garden, the last season, six or eight bushels of the " Schaghticoke" orpeachblow <a name="potatoes635"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. A part of them were carried directly to the cellar, and put in a barrel; the remainder were put upon the wood house floor, where they remained two or three days, till they were well dried, after which they were put into the cellar. Those which were first put into the cellar, in a barrel, delayed entirely, while the others remained sound through the winter, and were good <a name="potatoes636"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for cooking. If a short airing and drying, after <a name="potatoes637"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are dug, will have the effect which it appears to have had in this instance, it is a very important fact, and ought to be generally known. From the Ohio Cultivator. The <a name="potato479"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. The editor of the Sanidusky County Democrat says: " We hear almost a general complaint, among the farmers of this county, of the <a name="potato480"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop being affected with the rot. The crop has turned out better than any one expected three months ago; but since it has been gathered, and the existence of the disease known, doubts are expressed as to there being enough for home consumption for the year to come. Some attribute the rot to the drought; others to a particular soil. We should like to have the opinion of the editor of the Cultivator, or any of our experienced farmers, upon this subject From the Boston Cultivator. It seems that the prevalent disease has not long existed in the <a name="potatoes638"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that there has been a gradual increase; which demonstrates it to be something more than mere casual. But I notice several combined causes which promote this rot in the <a name="potato481"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which I think can be obviated in a great measure. In the first place, we know the <a name="potato482"><mark>potato</mark></a> is a tender plant, and cannot withstand a great deal of hardship; we know, too, that the past season has been one of great extremes of heat, dryness, and moistureconsequentlyunpropitious for the <a name="potatoes639"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I. speak particularly f f oar vii pity, where the war th was so severely parched, wet, and dry, that we had nearly! gietiupall hopes of a crop. After a very heavy rain it rermained4hot, while we had alternate extremes of heat and rain, which set the earth In a great ferment at ion, a state very injurious to some sorts of -vgetajon. From notes I have taken the present and last season, it appears to have had, great effect, and almost exclusively on rich moist soils, or moist spas highly matured. In my observations and inquiries I have found a failure of more or less by rot, and often a total loss. War crops comma o ty are 0 to 2,000bushels. 1 have heard of instances of good crops from new s ward, with ou t manure, but in this mode there are failures. I have takenrsoPme pains to go on different fields to ascertain facts, and nowhere have I found any rot on light soils lightly manured. I can give no better account of a successful culture than to name my or of last year 1844. The planted pink eyed <a name="potatoes640"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> some early, on high ground manure spread. We ploughed in June a piece of rich clay loam, manured in the hill, (a common quantity) and planted the same kind, Thleyyjlded well. We harvested about 400 bushels; put them in the cellar without~ ,any suspicion of cot, but soon found, by close examination, that they in er decaying, The whole were. overhauled in season, and were nearly all jsaivggd: -I, planted a small path of long reds on very rich moist soil found .them considerably rotten From these circumstances, and looking a little further among ;i my neighbors, I this year was so wary as to plant all light ground, so ame ,ward. andpsomne old ground all planted early all manured in the hill :lightly with compose manure, made from rich low ground, hauled into the ,yard after having, to mix: with cattle manure, and hauled out in the fall. This kind of manure will- no t ferment. My crop this year is tolerably good and (all sound. will observe, that I planted several pieces and many i varieties, of <a name="potatoes641"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It is found that the early planted better escape the rot t had: the late. From what I have seen and heard, I may presume to, say, .that if we have just such another season as the last, (which was a very uncommon-one) by pursuing my practice, with my advice, farmers may raise a crop of good <a name="potatoes642"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, although not so abundant as usual on rich soil. There is a diversity of opinion as to the cause of this rot, and its various operations. It is certainly new; and I fear it will continue, in some degree, in more temperate seasons than the last. We have, however, great reason to expect more congenial seasons for the <a name="potato483"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop; less extremnesilightand frequent rains never .so heavy as to wet through all the hill, espcpilHlyafter the <a name="potato484"><mark>potato</mark></a> is half, grown. They will not live long in a quay i :e, or in earth full of water. ,the rust and specks in the s talks, and calling, of leaves, all proceed from' the affected roots. Reduce either of th.e cases named, that combine to effcththis rot, to a medium, and the' rot will not be produced. o For instance plant rich moist ground, the temper after low, and, with- the other etre mr is, there is no rot; light, even- rates, swilqtoherextrecms, no to t. -in et a ll these causes combined will surely effect, a cot that is i, while ,in t a certain stage of growth not, as some have it, in one, era in day or hour. But to escape all these: evils combined i, plant light ground, manured as I have observed, or without any. Right soils aresopporous that they do not retain the abundance of wet; nor are there to 345 30 be found the other materials, richness, &c, to cooperate to produce this disease. Numerous causes: assigned for this rot seem to be without proper grounds. Amie suppose it to be the effects of electricity. I know not why vegetables should be affected any more now than heretofore, by that component of the atmosphere, which has always existed, and is always necessary, and is no more abundant than  usual. Some impute the cause to the " old, long, worn out" <a name="potato485"><mark>potato</mark></a> as gone down ; others to defects in the tops, from rust, and speaks of rust the tops sickening and the disease passing down to the tube r; others, to atmospheric disorders, &c. Are these correct, when, in the same field, side by side, the rich highly manured soils are the only soils where the disease is found, and when on light soils they never have been found with this new peculiar diseascid127e :a_ Are not the tops as much exposed on light soils as elsewhere? A. Robi Nson. From the Sort hampton Gazette. The <a name="potato486"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease is noticed in many places. We have seen it stated that those 'localities which were visited last year have escaped this. His may be true to a certain extent; but that the disease has appeared of a more or less aggravated character in the same localities both years, is unquestionable. The It. Plans (vermont) Messenger states that the rot is quite extensive in that vicinity. Any fields do not yield as much as the seed planted, and all fields are more or less affected. The disease prevailed to some extent there last year. We had supposed that <a name="potatoes643"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this vicinity were quite free from the rot but we learn that many of them are rotating since they were harvested. We are informed that a farmer in Ash field barrelled and sent to Bostont600 bushels. Soon after their arrival he received a letter requesting him to come and remove his rotten <a name="potatoes644"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. in immediately went to Boston, picked them over, and out of the 600 bushels obtained only one hundred bushels of sound <a name="potatoes645"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> !a!

From the Paine Arm err 'a; : Extent Of The Rust In <a name="potatoes647"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. The disease which infects the <a name="potatoes648"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, we hear, is very prevalent in the eastern sections of the State, especially in the vicinity of Last port, and it also extends into the province of New Brunswick. We have not heard from Nova Scotia. It is a great calamity, not only to us, but to the citizens f other States, who have been in the habit of depending on Paine for their supply of this useful and necessary article of food. What the real extent of the disease is, cannot be told until the digging season is over. People ;ho dig their <a name="potatoes649"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be careful where and how they put them away, for they will need watching and overhauling, lest a few delayed ones may ruin the whole.

Messrs. Edtroas: Such has been said and written with regard to the failure of the <a name="potato488"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, and yet there is much diversity of opinion with i respect to the true causes. My theory is, that the <a name="potato489"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot cannot betrayed to any single cause, but to a combination of causes, all operating to produce a failure ; all of which may be termed atmospheric influences. The failure last year was comparatively slight, and was caused by the <a name="potatoes651"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being absolutely baked by the hot days and nights of September. The failure this year may be attributed to other extremes. From the latter part of May until the 7th of July, the season was very cold, dry, and backward, accompanied with high winds, which seriously retarded the growth of the plants, if it could be said they grew at all. Arm rains then set in, with an extremely high temperature, the thermometer ranging, through July and August, from 80 to 90 degrees. His forced the plants to a rapidity of growth never before known, especially on rich soils, where the <a name="potato490"><mark>potato</mark></a> has been most affected by rot. The tender plants, thus quickened into a premature existence, by almost the growth of a day, soon yielded to the influences of the intense heat of the sun, with constant excavations from the saturated earth. Fermentation followed as a consequence to the tops, and the tubes fell victims as a matter of course. At the time of this process a strong effluvia arose from the <a name="potato491"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields, and i. was only necessary to pass to the lee ward of them to be convinced of the work of destruction by a sense of the of factories. Now, as concur ring proof, as I have remarked, the <a name="potato492"><mark>potato</mark></a> has suffered most on rich soils and why ?a? because the tops were more forced in their growth were more delicate in their fibre were more susceptible, and more easily affected by atmospheric action. That we have been visited by unusual atmospheric influences, and that the whole vegetable kingdom has been powerfully affected, is further evident from the sickly hue of the march, and all the evergreens; in fact, most of our forest trees commenced shedding their leafy tributes without the usual aid of frosts, giving token that they were obeying some new law of atmospheric phenomena. Extremes under different phases, or unlike the foregoing, may have produced the same effect upon the <a name="potato493"><mark>potato</mark></a> in other parts of the world. That they have had an extraordinary season in Europe, all accounts agree. It is therefore that I consider the failure of the <a name="potato494"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in Paine, partially in 1844 and almost wholly in 1845, as caused by extremes of atmospheric action, such as have never visited us before, and probably never will again 1 would take this occasion to caution all brother farmers (and there war many) who have imputed the rot to a disease of the <a name="potato495"><mark>potato</mark></a>, (which will probably continue) and have determined to plant less, to entertain to such impressions, but to plant the next season with as much confidence ad they would, had we never been visited by the calamity. Any have supposed that the rot was caused by insects attacking the tops; but, wherever they have been noticed, they have appeared more as a consequence than i a cause, for it is well known that all vegetable matter in a state of decotnpositionattracts insects, or animilculmas.

Last year they were generally diseased, but this year they are perfect. I planted some and did not till them, to see what that would do; a small crop from that experiment. Those that   tilled with the greatest care were the best. Line have no disease this year in any way or shape. I generally bring to this market from three to five thousand bushels of <a name="potatoes655"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> per annum. This year my early ones were a good crop; but my late ones, owing to severe drought, a small crop but all good and sound. I have spent, in experiments, more than my <a name="potatoes656"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> this year are worth. Judge An Wyckclimate and season no doubt aggravate the disease. I found it existing three years ago on my farm in Jersey, in a wet season and next season, which was dry, worse still. This last season, which was very dry, the rot was worse yet. Townsendi planted from the diseased crop of last year, yet I have good <a name="potatoes657"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> this season; and I have been offered a dollar a bushel for those of my early crop, but have no more to spare. Dr. Fieldlast year my early crop was good, and the late were diseased. They were all of the Verser kind. This year my late crop is good. I think, with Mr. Bridge man, that those planted quite early or quite late are good having avoided our great midsummer heat. The red merinopotato (a long one) I found best for planting. The disease is fungus, I have no doubt. Mr. Legs remarked that many persons uttered impatient observations relative to this hitherto fruitless investigation, but he trusted there would be no relaxation in one so important; that, by assiduous inquiry, mere accident might reveal the causes which no theory could unravel. Mr. Fleet must say that, notwithstanding all that has been said about the <a name="potato497"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, hardly a single fact has been made known, which can govern us for the future.

To the Editor of the Farmer and Mechanicsi  R: In your paper of the 20th November, 1845, under the caution of" American I institute -farmers' Club" I have been reported to have said, in respect to some experiment which I had made, corrective of the disease in the <a name="potato503"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which is in a greater or less. degree prevalent throughout the civilized world, that the first application to the <a name="potato504"><mark>potato</mark></a> " was a weak solution of the chloride of lime; 2d.

This representation is incorrect, and calculated, to mislead and produce injury, inasmuch as the adoption of such treatment in detail, as set forth in the report, would be productive of real mischief at least, so far as a saturated solution of the chloride of lime is concerned.

. 535 From the N. Y. Farmer and Mechanics. Morri Sni s, December 16, 1845. Dear S I: I have paid some attention to. them many complaints thahathaebone the rounds of the papers relating to the disease in the <a name="potato509"><mark>potato</mark></a>. And truly it may be so called, as in all instances where lands are not tilled properly to carry out the work nature requires, disease will more or less follow; and here I beg leave to remark that ever since the so labium tuberosumwas introduced into Europe; which is now only two hundred and forty-eight years, it has been improving in quantity arid quality, and is invariably best where most labor has been bc stoved upon the land. Our seasons vary sometimes very hot and dry, followed by heavy fresh its and floods. Hands thus drenched, and not drained by proper deepening and breaking through the hard pan, must suffer, and will inevitably cause curl in the leaf; premature its growth, and stop the progress of the tube r, and in this tender state disease will follow. Some persons will say, " my land lies high and dry" and therefore does not require draining, but moisture. When I say, deepen your land, that it may receive rain when it comes and by continually working the crop you will retain it. This vegetable should be kept in constant growth until it is matured, or the crop will fall short. To do this work properly, turn your <a name="potato510"><mark>potato</mark></a> land in the fall; again as early in spring as possible ; cross plough with the sub soil, or trench. Manure broadcast com post is best charcoal, animal and street manure, ashes, sea sand, lime, soot, &c; add to this as much vegetable and barn yard manure, and put fifty ox cart loads to the acre, and well attend your crops while growing, and you may expect to receive a full reward and no disease. Some will say, " my land is worn out ; this is oft times a fact. When, again, I say, till and dress; for when the lands have been longest under cultivation, and most labor bestowed, with good judgment, there are best <a name="potatoes667"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and best crops. If our laborers are high, and cannot work quite so close as in Europe, we can take the broad field culture and the advantage of two hundred and forty eight years of experience, and, with one or two yoke of cattle and sub soil plough, equal any of our wishes. I will refer our farmers to last summers dry weather, where lands were not tilled. It was as dry as though rain had not been upon it for years and when the plough was kept constantly at work, the moisture was retained, the lungs, fibres, and tubes fed, and a full crop obtained; and here     do not wish to leave you, for all esculents and roots naturally require their soils tilled deep, to allow the frost, sun, wind, air, and all other natural elements, with summer and winter following, to cause a wholesome, good, and full crop; and by strict adherence to labor and nature, you may raise any qu anti ty a reasonable man may desire. And as crops of the above are invaluable for all farming purposes, particularly in wintering cattle, as you will bring them out in the spring to fill the pail, or bring down the scale, your yard will be filled with manure, ready for any crops you may apply it to.

Nathaniel Hands, Esq, of New Windsor, Range county will state my experiments in raising <a name="potatoes673"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I have found that in planting them as early as possible I have good crop. The tops perished in August. I let the <a name="potatoes674"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> lie in their hills till September, and had perfectly sound ones. I have seen some disposed to decay, upon which I put lime, and these were saved from further rot. A neighbor of mine had a pond, from which he let the water flow upon his <a name="potato511"><mark>potato</mark></a> field in dry weather. For ten years past he has had always sound <a name="potatoes675"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. They are of a fine quality. To prove the efficacy of this watering of his <a name="potatoes676"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, he had another field which was left dry, and there his <a name="potatoes677"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted. There are many fields which may be selected for <a name="potato512"><mark>potato</mark></a> planting, so situated as to admit of such watering. Mr. Vwakemanfrom the examination which I have made of this subject, early planting cannot be altogether relied upon. Some late planted crops were good, while the early ones were rotted. A good crop seems to demand all the benefits of a favorable season. Mr. Shaping have examined the proceedings of the Entomologicalsociety, and will present at the next meeting of this club their conclusions relative to the insect theory as affecting the <a name="potato513"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Mr. Wakemanthe opinion that the <a name="potato514"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease is owing to the length of time which the <a name="potato515"><mark>potato</mark></a> has been domestic a ted, seems to be the better one. The <a name="potatoes678"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which we now have are all descended from those first carried to England by Air Alter Raleigh. Mr. 8arndsln 1843 1 first noticed this disease. I took pains to procure tubes from sound crops. I placed them very early; they grew well and kept sound, Those which I planted in April were good. Those I planted on the 25th of May proved nearly all diseased. By may, mode, we seldom now have a diseased <a name="potato516"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and, generally speaking, those planted late proved to be good.

From the Albany Cultivator of December. <a name="potato517"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. In this section we have heard but little complaint in reference to the disease or rot in the <a name="potato518"><mark>potato</mark></a>, this year, till since the crop was harvested. In some other neighborhoods, too, we have heard that heavy losses have been sustained by the <a name="potatoes684"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having rotted since they were dug, though while the crop was growing it exhibited generally a healthy appearance. Theboston papers make complaints of <a name="potatoes685"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotating much in the cellars and within a few days we have heard of many having rotted in this vicinity. Some kinds seem to have suffered more than others; the very excellent kind called Garters appears, from statements we have heard, to be more inclined to rot than others. A gentleman in this vicinity, who raised this kind quite largely, has lost half his crop since they were put in the cellar. The Makers, located at Watervliet, also raise the Garters largely. They informed us a few days since that they had lost from        $600 to                                                         $1,00 worth of this kind since they were dug. As to preventives, it is agreed that they should be carefully sorted over, rejecting all that show the least un soundness, as soon as they are discovered to be rotating. The Makers inform us that the best remedy which they have discovered, (and they have tried many) is to dry them thoroughly by spreading them exposed to the air. This, they say, will stop the progress of decay, and it is the only way they know by which it can be stopped. From the Ohio Cultivator. Use Of Salt And Of   Of. The Akron (ohio) Democrat states that the Rev. Mr. White, of that place, in removing some <a name="potatoes686"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, filled two barrels, one of which had been used for flour, and the other for salt, from the same heap, and put them side by side, covered with the same boards. After some time, those in the salt barrel were found perfectly sound, while those in the flour barrel were all, or nearly all, rotten. This would go to prove, what has before been asserted that salt is, in some cases at least, beneficial in preserving <a name="potatoes687"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the rot after harvesting. Time, also, has been found useful for this purpose ; but more experiments are needed with both, before the question of their utility can be fully settled 538 a. From the Albany C altivator. The <a name="potato519"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. Of. Edi Tor: Although a farmer on rather a limited scale, it has fallen to my lot to make a few observations relative to the disease called the rot in <a name="potatoes688"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which, were they published, I have thought might be of service to some of the agricultural community. In 1844, I planted <a name="potatoes689"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on three different parts of the farm on which     am situated. From part of one small field, consisting chiefly of a loose gravely soil, I obtained about eighty bushels of <a name="potatoes690"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and among these eighty bushels there was probably near a peck of rotten ones, and almost all of these grew on apart of the field which was lower than the rest of it, and where the soil consists, to a considerable extent, of loam and clay. The field I have been describing was ploughed twice before planting; and in that, as well as in the subsequent work among the <a name="potatoes691"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, it was my aim to work when the land was in a sufficiently dry state to pulverize well. In another part of the farm, which is nearly level, and where the soil consists, to a much greater extent, of loam and clay than the field I have just described. I obtained nearly thirty bushels of <a name="potatoes692"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and out of thirty bushels there were probably as many as one bushel of rotten ones. The land for these <a name="potatoes693"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was also ploughed twice; and care was also taken to work the land when dry enough to pulverize. From a part of the farm, which consists chiefly of a side hill, of a loose gravely soil, I obtained as many as seventy-five bushels of <a name="potatoes694"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and out of these seventy five bushels there were probably not to exceed four, quarts of rotten ones; and what rotten ones there were, were almost wholly on a part of the field which is nearer level than the rest, and where the soil consists, to a greater extent, of loam and clay than the other parts of it. The seed <a name="potatoes695"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted on the last mentioned piece- were many of them of the same sorts as those which rotted so badly in the small and nearly level piece I have before described. A part of the growing season of 1844 was unusually hot and wet. And these are probably among the causes why so many <a name="potatoes696"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted that season. From my own experience, and from observations I made that season, (1844) 1 came to the conclusion that light loose soils, and thoroughploughings, are among the best means of obtaining <a name="potatoes697"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> free from the rot. And at the same time it may be said, that rich soils with such management are well adapted to withstand any ordinary drought. This season, (1845) the disease among <a name="potatoes698"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> has assumed a somewhat different aspect in this region of country from what it presented in 1844. I nm any cases, the <a name="potatoes699"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which at digging time appeared to be sound, have rotted after being buried in the field or put in cellars. And while I do not dispute that this result is in some degree attribute able to the varieties of <a name="potatoes700"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> used for seed, yet my observation leads me to believe that much of it is to be charged to the wet, heavy state of the lands on which the crops were raised. And the following is one of my reasons for believing so. This season I planted near one acre of <a name="potatoes701"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on land which consists almost wholly of a light loose soil. The ground was ploughed three times before planting, which rendered it so finely pulverized that the heavy rains of the latter part of the summer had an opportunity to l each down so as not to remain in a superabunduit quantity near the top of the ground. But of this acre of <a name="potatoes702"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> there were probably not to exceed two quarts of rotten. 539enies; while some of my neighbors, who planted their <a name="potatoes703"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on partiallypulverized and wet, heavy land, had many of theirs rot, although they had, in part, the same kind of seed that I planteds. s, S G. Sandlake, N. Y., November, 1845. From the Albany Cultivator. Of. Edi Tor: The <a name="potato520"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease occupies so much of the public attention everywhere, that the experience and observation of individuals may lead to a solution of this mystery. Last year we lost but few by the rot. This year but few have escaped. We have lost upwards of 1,000 bushels already. I have examined the various fields about us, and find there is little or no perceptible difference as to soil. The disease has shown itself in every variety of soil in western New York where the <a name="potato521"><mark>potato</mark></a> grows. Still I am not discouraged, nor do I believe there is any more danger of the extinction of the species than of wheat. My own impression is, that it is caused by the peculiar state of the atmosphere, and that the evil maybe cured in two ways 1. By early planting, and by using only the early varieties 2. By cutting the stems or vines as soon as the blight or rust shows itself. To far as my observation extends, the disease is analogous to the rust in wheat. It has been shown in a great number of cases, by actual experiment, that if wheat be cut as soon as the rust strikes the stalk, the loss is much less than when suffered to stand until it is ripe. If allowed to stand, thekernel becomes light and shrunk en, yielding but little beyond br an. The disease appears in both instances in the stalk first, and the destruction of marina in the tube r and the merry is but the result of the destruction of the stalk by the disease. It is a species of gangrene, which can only be arrested by severing the limb as soon as it appears. The remedy has been quite successful in wheat, and I have no doubt will be equally so with roots. I am the more inclined to this belief from an occurrence in my immediate vicinity. A neighbor had some <a name="potatoes704"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted in a very lucky piece of land, a reclaimed swamp; being in low ground, an early frost killed the vines. Some of his <a name="potatoes705"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have rotted, while those near by, but upon driver ground, and where the vines were not injured by the frost, have been seriously injured. It was not the soil, for others in like soil, but not reached by the frost, have been destroyed. Again, our early <a name="potatoes706"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which we grow in the market garden have not been affected; and generally the early Varieties have suffered the least. I can hear of none that have been diseased where the vines died before the blight struck them. It may be that ours is only an exception ; I mention the facts for the purpose of drawing out others on the same subject. My facts are truth; my inferences may go for what they are worth. Sincerely yours, T.  C. Petersda I Of, N. Y., December 12, 1845.540 a. From the Albany Cultivator. The <a name="potato522"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease, L. Tvcker, Isa: Acts being the very foundation of science, it has struck me that the following might assist some inquirer into the causes of the <a name="potato523"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease. In 1843, the disease among the <a name="potatoes707"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> showed itself in this country. That year, in many parts of the country, the <a name="potatoes708"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted in their bins, and it was found necessary to remove them. In 1844 the disease was more prevalent; while in 1845 it was much less extensive. In my own case, very little of the disease appeared among the <a name="potatoes709"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised in either year. Still, there was a little of it among the, pink eyes in particular. Having observed that <a name="potato524"><mark>potato</mark></a> balls were very scarce in my own fields, and indeed in all this region, and being confident that the <a name="potatoes710"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> now raised in this country are much inferior to those raised five and thirty years since, I sent to England for seed. A friend was kind enough to obtain for me twenty four hampers of fine Lancashire <a name="potatoes711"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, last spring, which reached the just in time for planting. I had them placed in new ground, on the side of a field in which were planted pink eyes, trout, and orange <a name="potatoes712"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The yield of all the <a name="potatoes713"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was light, on account of the drought, but the Lancashire did as well as could be expected. Your and twenty bushels of English <a name="potatoes714"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were put away for seed in a cellar, under a hay now, where the temperature is hardly above freezing; as good a place for the preservation of vegetables as could be selected. A quantity of the trout and orange <a name="potatoes715"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were put in another corner of the same cellar. Fearful that the weather was getting too severe for my seed <a name="potatoes716"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as the now grew thinner, I ordered them to be removed last week to another cellar. In opening the straw that covered the heap, more than half of the <a name="potatoes717"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, were found to be far gone with the disease. As the rot has appeared in none of the other sorts that were grown in the same field, including pink eyes, I am left to infer that the English <a name="potatoes718"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were infected, while the others were not. I merely state the fact. The disease existing so extensively last year in England may possibly have some connection with this loss; though, to correct the circumstances, it is necessary to believe that two seasons are required to develop the rot 1 will only add, that I had brought into my house some of the varieties that were grown, the English excepted, and I cannot find that a single <a name="potato525"><mark>potato</mark></a> has been affected. I know of no difference in the culture or land that should have produced this result. To manure was carted on any part of the field, though plaster was used throughout. As piles of logs and stumps had recently been burnt on the land, it is possible these ashes may have reached to these English <a name="potatoes719"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, though not more so than to the others, as the log heaps extended over all parts of the field. I do not think, moreover, that the vines ever looked thrifty. Hours, &c. J. Fenni More Cooper. P. Of t may be well to say that the English <a name="potatoes720"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, diseased as they are, have been fed to store hogs, with perfect impunity. What is left of them seems to be as nourishing as the sound <a name="potato526"><mark>potato</mark></a>. They are affected with the black, cholera looking disease, and appear to moulder away, rather. 541 than turn into a semi liquid, putrid substance, as was the case with some grown in my garden in 1844.

From the Cultivator. Preventi   Of Of The <a name="potato529"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. Of. Edi Tor: It appears to me that the attention of your correspondent s has been directed more to the cause or nature of the <a name="potato530"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease than to any specific remedy. Some have ascribed the cause to unusual dews, fogs, heat of the sun, small insects, or parasite mushrooms. We may, I think, safely conclude that the disease is entirely atmospheric al, and as inexplicable as epidemics that affect the human or animal system. If so, then the only object would be to place the vines in a state in which they would not receive the disease. Thus the ravages of the wheat fly are avoided by sowing earlier than usual, and also rust in wheat by sowing early on elevated lands. As it respects the numerous preventives that have been suggested, none of them appear to be of any general utility. The screwing on ashes, lime, or plaster; the cutting off of the tops; the drying them in the sun, before putting them into the cellar, are only laborious, and, at best, partial remedies, The suggestions of a gentleman from Virginia to plant early, and at a certain depth, on light, elevated soil, and to cover the vines two or three inches with leaves, would be, I think, of no general utility, except the early planting; for I find, by observation and extensive inquiries among farmers, that <a name="potatoes722"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are affected in every variety of soil, and that every kind of <a name="potato531"><mark>potato</mark></a> is subject to the disease ; that is, the same kind will be affected one year and not another, and on all varieties of soil. From these facts, I have concluded that it is not in the kind of <a name="potato532"><mark>potato</mark></a> or state of soil, but in the time of planting, or rather state of the vines when the epidemic appears. Therefore, assuming that the disease is in the air, and that vegetables derive by far the greater part of their nourishment and substance from this element, I conclude that the disease is absorbed by the vines, wen they are in a state to receive it, and by them conveyed to the <a name="potato533"><mark>potato</mark></a> among nutritions properties. a. 543 is to the time the disease appears, much will depend upon the temperature of the climate where the <a name="potato534"><mark>potato</mark></a> is planted, and the period of the maturity of the vines. In Vermont, I conclude that the disease appears from the middle of August to the middle of September, or when we begin to have heavy dews and damp, chilly nights. When the leaves become slightly struck with rust or blight. This kind of weather produces rust in wheat. But the common <a name="potato535"><mark>potato</mark></a> rust, which comes in July or August, must not be taken for the disease, for rust of <a name="potato536"><mark>potato</mark></a> tops is not a new thing. Now, in this region the tops of early planted <a name="potatoes723"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> generally become so far matured in the fore part of September that they cease to absorb the atmospheric al properties. Hence, if this transition takes place before the disease has been conveyed to the roots, the <a name="potato537"><mark>potato</mark></a> is safe. I have been led to thus fix the time of the appearance of the disease from practical observation. I planted six kinds of <a name="potatoes724"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on separate plats in 1844, all on good warm soil. Three of the kinds were planted about the last of April, and the others about the last of May. The tops of the first three plants were partially dry by the first of September; the others not until the first of October. The first plantings were free from the disease; the last were greatly affected by it. I tried the same experiment on six kinds last year, and the result was precisely as the preceding year. A neighbor planted the early kidneys in April last; the tops were dead in August. Some of the <a name="potatoes725"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> remained in the ground until November. They were perfectly healthy. He planted, from the same lot of seed, about the first of June, a small patch near his barn, the tops of which grew rank, and were green until killed by the frost in October. The <a name="potatoes726"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were greatly diseased. Since then, I have ascertained that the tops of those <a name="potatoes727"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that have proved to be diseased were generally green in September, or at least at the time of digging. It does not, however, follow that every field will be affected where the tops are thus immature. I have found two exceptions in fifty cases. In one case the <a name="potatoes728"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted in July, and were so thrifty in September that the disease did not affect them. In like manner, human constitutions are it equally in a condition to take at one time the same disease. In the other case, the <a name="potatoes729"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, being planted in a high, frosty region, were killed by a frost in the fore part of September, before the disease reached the roots. Hence very early or very late planting will escape the disease. But early planted <a name="potatoes730"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are decidedly better for the table or for stock than late planted, unripe ones. Therefore let all kinds of <a name="potatoes731"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, except those that are very long in coming to maturity, be planted early, (for the climate where they are planted) that the vines may partially ripe n be before the time of the appearance of the disease. It is no matter what the kind of soil is, or the kind of <a name="potato538"><mark>potato</mark></a>, if neither will greatly prolong the maturity of the vines. But avoid planting near barns, where the soil is exceedingly rich, or in low, wet places. Observe these rules, and we think that, in usual seasons, from 200 to 300 bushels of good healthy <a name="potatoes732"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> per acre will be obtained. This process may also save the <a name="potato539"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in I re land. I am assured by emigrants that <a name="potatoes733"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for the summer market are planted early, and are ripened in a pleasant. genial season, while those for winter use are not planted until May or June, for the sake of a long growth and a larger yield, which expose them to the disease.

Experimental report to the Maryland Farmers' Club, on the <a name="potato540"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease : by Daniel Fowler, Corresponding Secretary. Numerous and conflicting as are the arguments which have been recently held in the various attempts to discover the nature of the disease in the <a name="potato541"><mark>potato</mark></a> now prevalent t, and, if detected, what remedy could be effectually applied, the majority, both as regards authority and number, have satisfactorily established the fact that it is a fungus of an ex crescent or parasitic character. Equally well sustained have been the numerous assertions that a remedy has been successfully applied. The most authentic paper on the subject which has fallen under my observation, among some hundreds, is the report by C. Dorr en, Professor of Agriculture in the University of Siege. I m perfect in idiot, as is every translation from the German into the ver macular, it covers the whole ground, exhausts the controversy, and, in accordance with my own experience, establishes the main practical facts essential to the producers safety. Before departing from my allusion to Professor Torrent able report, I think it necessary to contest an error into which certain late writers on the subject have unwittingly fallen. This peculiar dis temper, like all other important facts, has its history. In Mexico and South America, where the tube r is indigenous, it has always been known as an epidemic, recurring at irregular periods, and eccentric in its progress. The terms epidemic al, contagious, and infectious, are often confused in their application, even by the medical profession. In the report alluded to, the word ansteckung is rendered infection, being literally "1 stuck on? 1 or extraneous, from the verb anstecken; while the German equivalent for epidemic al is ansteckkend, and contagious is expressed by ansteckend ; so that this word, as used by Professor Dorr en, embraces the whole sense of the three words, in their widest construction, and he pronounces the <a name="potato542"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, after the most skillful and patient examination, to be of this character. : 'I n our own language, we understand that whatever is prevalent, is, where it is so, epidemic a ly. Certainly no i one at this advanced stage of the :discussion will assert that the <a name="potato543"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease )is not prevalent! t I fe titus and contagious convey almost precisely one meaning, commonly called " catching" My own observation; as regards the tubes after housing, is, that this disease is all of these, in their fullest sense. Relying upon the usual supply from the east for my seed <a name="potatoes734"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, 1 had. 545 disposed of my own crop, and purchased thirty bushels for early planting, of blue Paine mergers, at the wharf. This was the middle of February last; but before planting time arrived, nearly one third of that quantity had delayed, although they had frequently been picked over. When purchased, a scarcely perceptible scurvy gangrene, in spots, had made its appearance on them. Men bushels were cut and planted on the seventh of March, in strong alluvial soil, in drills, under fermenting stable manure; the pieces immediately on being cut, were dried or healed in a com post of two parts each of plaster (sulphate of lime) and reached ashes, to one part old s lacked carbonate of) lime. The memorandum in my diary reads thus 1845, March 7. : Planted early <a name="potatoes735"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> across run; pieces cut large dried in plaster, ashes, and lime, and planted under horse manure March 25. " Planted i ve bushels <a name="potatoes736"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> near poultry yard ; the eighth row from the east side without manure, to be glanced when up; the rest planted on long green manure; all in drills; pieces six inches asunder The yield of this first planting was very good, notwithstanding the drought, but, being very early, were sold in market; the latter not so well, the' glanced row excepted, which yielded equal to the first planting, or one-fourth more than he second There was also another small planting, besides the "crop ;" a sample of the last I now hand for the inspection of the club, which they will perceive are in a perfectly sound cond ion. I have cited from my diary thus minutely, to correct two errors almost as much prevalent as the disease. The first, that the kind of manure produces the fun gain; the second, that it is the nature of the soil, combined with or arising from the humidity of the atmosphere. Now my several plantations were in all the varieties of soil, except stiff clay, and in all manner of exposures, from the hill top to the ditch level. Undoubted authority overthrows a third error that is, that the witness of the season, combined with a sultry dense ness and other atmospheric phenomena, generates the mushroom. A friend of mine, a member of this club, lost his whole crop of last summers growth, whose place is but five miles distant from mine, inland, and some hundreds of yards higher above the marine level, the seed being of his own growth, and apparently perfectly sound. In fine, gentlemen, not one diseased <a name="potato544"><mark>potato</mark></a> have I yet seen in my crop, although the seed from which they were grown was corrupted, and the old fashioned stimulants, except in the one instance, were used as manures so that, in the absence of any antagonist principle, I must consider this chemical com post not only a remedy, but a preventive of the epidemic al <a name="potato545"><mark>potato</mark></a> fungus.

British consul at Philadelphia, and or, Owen, of Moutairy, on the subject of the <a name="potato547"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot or. To wens replySMOUNT Of Of, December 29, 1845.-MY Dear Of  R: Your note on the subject of i' the <a name="potato548"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot" dated Saturday, did not reach me at Count Airy (sunday intervening) till this morning, Monday. It would give me pleasure to oblige, you fully in this matter, did time permit to go more into detail; but the brief space allotted for a reply will compel me to be as concise as possible. I hold that atmospheric influence is the sole cause of the late pervadingrot in .the <a name="potato549"><mark>potato</mark></a> ; that neither manures nor condition of soils could have produced the calamity; that animalculwe and hung i are as remote from it the latter may in a partial manner injure a <a name="potato550"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant) as they would, under peculiar circumstances, be likely to injure other plants; that the rot is not epidemic; and I have reason to believe that sound or partially sound, <a name="potatoes737"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, taken from a diseased crop or heap, will, if planted, produce healthy, sound <a name="potatoes738"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, in the absence of the cause which injured them the previous season. I would, therefore, encourage the farmers to cultivate their <a name="potatoes739"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as formerly, choosing the soils and applying the manures which hitherto were found best adapted to their culture; forgetting or overlooking the rot altogether. and disregarding the no serums recommended for its prevention the <a name="potato551"><mark>potato</mark></a> wont bear doctoring. The weather, which produces rot is either a severe, continuous drought of some weeks' standing, thereby preventing the natural growth and maturity of the <a name="potato552"><mark>potato</mark></a>, for the want of moisture, or very hot weather, bringing the <a name="potato553"><mark>potato</mark></a> to a premature ripe ness, succeeded by wet, sultry weather, unnaturally spring like, which provokes the tubes to perform the functions of seed, thereby dissolving the connection between them and their vines: the vines: die ; the roots undergo an incident ferment at ion preparatory to decomposition; the operation of budding or growing is checked by the natural autumnal temperature that at length prevails, which arrests the <a name="potato554"><mark>potato</mark></a> in its work of producing; and hence its deter i oration. The latter condition, of the weather is the prevailing cause of the rot is to a severe and continuous drought, my own experience points to that of 1838. That season I had a five acre patch in with <a name="potatoes740"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which did not pay for the trouble of taking them out of the ground. They weren mall, ill shaped; bad tasted, poisonous, spotted, and black hearted, and rotted in the cellar. <a name="potatoes741"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> that season sold as high as                                                         $1.25 and                                                         $1.50 per bushel; not a bushel of good <a name="potatoes742"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> at market except those imported. When as to dry, hot weather, succeeded by wet, close, over spring like temperature, the season of 1843 is in point. I took more than common pains that year to produce a surpassing yield equal, at least, to my famous crop of the preceding year, which was over 440 bushels to the acre, field culture. My seed was in part from those fine <a name="potatoes743"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and in part from some very large, sound <a name="potatoes744"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> imported from the State of Paine. In taking, out the crop in October, the whole was found to be very badly diseased. The weather, from the latter part of June till the beginning of September, a. -47 was mainly hot occasionally very hot and dry. September set in with warm rains, thunder storms and gusts; the moisture and closeness unprecedented. Fruit trees blossomed, as well as many flowering trees and shrub. I recollect making a large collection of flowers from the magnolias, some of which I sent to the editor of the " Pennsylvania I nquirerMy <a name="potato555"><mark>potato</mark></a> vines looked green and healthy; when, all of a sudden, they changed color, drooped, and died. I think if I had taken out the <a name="potatoes745"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> at that juncture they would have proved comparatively good; but they were p emitted to remain quite a month after, when they were found badly rotted, painted, and almost worthless. Now, then, as to the epidemic. In 1844, I planted some four to five acres of <a name="potatoes746"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the seed of which was principally called from the diseased crop of 1843. I planted, also, at the same time, in the same field, other seed of very sound <a name="potatoes747"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> brought from Paine. They all did equally well. I could discover no difference. The crop was a very fair one, and the quality un exception able in every respect. I do not mean by this to encourage the i plaiting of -diseased or doubtful <a name="potatoes748"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It is safer to plant so ind and perfect ones; but I am strong in the opinion that there is no danger of a diseased or painted <a name="potato556"><mark>potato</mark></a> producing a diseased or painted <a name="potato557"><mark>potato</mark></a>. It may, from its want of vitality, be very un productive, make feeble shoots, the same as delayed <a name="potatoes749"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from on shipboard, after a long voyage; the heat and moisture of the vessels hold having caused them to send out enormous shoots, impairing their vigor, and producing rot. Such <a name="potatoes750"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, when planted, never produce well as to size and quality; but I have yet to learn that they ever t produced a diseased <a name="potato558"><mark>potato</mark></a> i Such has been said of <a name="potatoes751"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> becoming feeble and sickly from long and constant plant i a g. There may be something in this; time will not permit me to examine it now. I have, however, numerous sorts of seedlingsproduced from the apples of my very fine crop of 1842 I shall take occasion to- present you with a few to send to some of your friends a broadly this you will see that I can offer no remedy or preventive for the rot. He that tempers the winds to: the shorn lamb can only control it. Shoulditgaincid127) visit us, we can only exercise our best judgment by taking out the <a name="potatoes752"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> early as soon, as they exhibit signs of decay ; laying them in thin layer spin dry, cool situations, or otherwise, as circumstances may justify. Met the farmers go on and plant in confidence, as their best experience may teach, trusting, for the abundant yield, to that Providence who sendethitheeariyland the latter rain.

Appendi X No. 6. <a name="potato559"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot In Europe. From the (london) Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, of August 16, 1845. <a name="potato560"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Bli   Ght. A blight of unusual character, which almost invariably affects the <a name="potatoes753"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this island, having been the last few days brought to my notice by several gardeners, I am induced at once to lay before the readers of the Chronicle such observations as I have yet been able to make on the subject, being desirous to know whether this plague be in reality, as it is here supposed, an entirely new one; whether it be local or general in other parts of the Kingdom; and principally, and lastly, what is the best course to pursue where it has made its appearance. The first appearance is a dark spot on the margin of the leaf, which withers the leaf, and spreads rapidly to the stem: The discoloration soon extends along the stem n in the course of the vessels, and the whole plant rapidly becomes black, so that within three days a fit r a plant is attacked it has become totally destroyed. With this appearance in the upper part, there coexists a fatal change in the tubes they become likewise spotted, at first, near the eyes on the upper surface the cut ice separates, the substance becomes friable, and the change soon spreads throughout the whole <a name="potato561"><mark>potato</mark></a>. All situations, whether high or low and whatever the nature of the soil, appear to be equally visited.  The attack on the plant appears invariably to commence in the leaf, and not in the stem; and the spot commences at the margin, corrupting the leaf a sit spreads.  It is black on the upper surface, but on the lower surface, though black in the centre, it is whitish or gray in the margin, but neither minute insects nor hung i can be seen with a strong lens. That, as regards the green portion, the leaf is affected before the stem, I am quite clear; but the question arises, is the disease in the root and tube r the cause or consequence of the above change ?a? I believe the latter to be the case, from all the instances I have examined; and in one instance in particular, where from ripe ness the greens were on the point of withering when attacked, the affection did not at all extend to the roots. The change which takes place in the tube r is as follows : The first appearance resembles a severe burn ;the root turning gray or ash colored, and the cut ice coming off. When the change has become considerable, I am told that the vegetable has a pungent and nausea us taste, and it is reported to have been injurious to pigs; but on this point I have no certain information. To universal is the evil that the consequences are likely to be very serious, as, in a long journey on horseback, I have this day carefully watched every <a name="potato562"><mark>potato</mark></a> ground as I passed along, and not one could I see uninjured. T. Bell Salter, M. D. I Sle Of Of Ght. From the Dark Lane Express.

In one night the mischief was done ; the whole of the stall, and leaf turned as black as your hat, and the <a name="potatoes754"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted in the ground. This is a sad state of things; and the general opinion is, that sufficient will not be saved of the crop for seed. A friend of mine has just returned from a visit in France. He says, in the whole" of 'normandy andBrittany the crop is a total failure the damage done in one night. They attribute it there to frost.

From the Gardeners' Chronicle, August 23 1845. A fatal malady has broken out among the <a name="potato565"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. In all sides we hear of the destruction that has overtaken this valuable product, excepting in the north of England. In Belgium, the fields are said to have been entirely desolated. There is hardly a sound sample in Covent Garden market. In fact, the murray in seems to have been transferred from cattle to <a name="potatoes755"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Dr. Well Alter last week called attention to the symptoms of the disorder as manifested in the I s le of Right, and we this week print many other communications on the subject, concerning which we have very numerous letters. The disease consists in a gradual decay of the leaves and stem, which become a putrid mass, and the tubes are affected by degrees in a similar way. The first obvious sign is the appearance, on the edge of the leaf, of a black spot, which gradually spreads; then gangrene attacks thelhaulm, and in a few days the latter is delayed, emitting a peculiar and rather offensive odor. When it is severe, the tubes also decay; in other cases they are comparatively uninjured. The cause of this calamity is, we think, clearly traceable to the season. During all the first week of August, the temperature has been cold, from two to three degrees below the average; we have had incessant rain, and no sunshine. It is hardly possible to conceive that such a continuation of circumstances should have produced any other result, all things considered. The <a name="potato566"><mark>potato</mark></a> absorbs a very large quantity of water. I to whole construction is framed with a view to its doing so; and its broad succulent leaves are provided in order to enable it to part with this water. But a low temperature is unfavorable to the motion of the fluids, or to the action of the cells of the plant; and, moreover, sunlight is required in order to enable the. ater sent into the leaves to be perspired. In feeble light, the amount of perspiration from a plant is comparatively small; in bright sunshine, it is copious; in fact, the amount of perspiration is in exact proportion to the quantity of light that falls upon a leaf. At night, or in darkness, there is no appreciable action of. this kind. Firing the present season, all this important class of functions has been deranged. The <a name="potatoes756"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been compelled to absorb an unusual quantity of water; the low ness of temperature has prevented their digesting it, and the absence of sunlight has rendered it impossible for them to get rid of it by perspiration. Under these circumstances, it necessarily stag named in their interior ; and the inevitable 550 result of that was rot, for a reason to be presently explained l. If the first days ,f July had not been r suddenly hot, it would not have happened ; if we lad had sunlight i with rain, it would not have happened ; and perhaps it would riot have occurred had the temperature been high, instead ofcid127lw, even although the sun did not shine, and rain fell incessantly. I tistiHcoribinationi of un toward circumstances that has produced the mischief. Althoughwe first see the symptoms of the disease in the leaves, and then in the haul n, yet we believe that it commences under ground, in that part of the haul m which is just above the old set. There, water collects the most; there, the temperature is lowest; and there, the old set itself, acting like a sponge, and itself decaying, feeds the live stem with semipitiridmatter. It may be urged, perhaps, in opposition to this explanation, that <a name="potatoes757"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> thrive very well in districts whose suffers are usually as unfavorable as this has been; as, for example, the cold parts of Scotland. And that is doubtless true. But in those climates the <a name="potato567"><mark>potato</mark></a> grows slowly ;its tissue becomes thoroughly organized as it proceeds, i ad it is not liable to be acted on by accumulated moisture. There, no pie disposing cause exists. But in England, the <a name="potato568"><mark>potato</mark></a> was predisposed to take the disease which is destroying it, by the unusual warmth of the beginning of July suddenly succeeding a period of cold, ubigenial weather; at that time the temperature of the soil near I London was between 600 and 680; the <a name="potatoes758"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grew excessively fast, their tissue was soft and un consolidated, filled with azotizedmatter, as all such tissue always is, and peculiarly liable to run into a state of rotten ness. They have never had the means of consolidating their tissue, but the tendency to putrefaction has continued almost in checked ever since the sixteenth of July, when the cold and unfavorable weather first began to declare itself; the tendency has increased, and at last accumulated so far as to terminate in absolute decay. This is strikingly illustrate id in those cases where, in consequence Of the badness of the soil, the <a name="potatoes759"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> made no considerable progress in July, but continued stunted and unprotiising, notwithstanding the warm weather. In such places and we i have one beneath our eye not a trade of rot is to be found The mischief, although- very general, is not universal. It is, however, appearing in some of the gardens around London; and it has begun to attack a field near ourselves, on the London clay, which, as it offers what 'bethink a good illustration of the way in which the <a name="potato569"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is affected by such a season as this, we shall proceed to describe. The field is bounded on two sides by a deep ditch, newly cut, and on the others by a hard roadway. It was last year a pasture. During the autumn, it was trenched three spit deep, but in such a way that the turf was t turned down about a spit, -lo w the s u are. It was planted partly in December, and partly i id Up ri. Were, on this cold soil, lying on a dead level, with scarcely any means of effectual drainage, the <a name="potato570"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in might have been expected; and her git has made its appearance, but t to any great extent. Symptoms are discoverable here and there ; but only in one place has the haul m actually delayed. That place was a low part of the field, and had been made up With road sand and similar rubbish, very rete native of water. Elsewhere the leaves are yellow ai invariable symptom of an over cold and dan a ii pad. In situations better drained, as, for example, all along the ditch, the foliage is green, vigorous, and healthy. Were, alien, we find what we look upon as good evidence of the Sistice
. 55 of the opinion which We have ventured to express as to the cause of the pestilence in question. The whole crop is not attacked, because, althoiUgithe land is ill drained, yet the recent trenching, and the decaying turf fit below the <a name="potatoes760"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, have been sufficient to carry off the water. The te it was otherwise, (that is, where road sand was thrown down to some depth, and consequently the turf drainage annihilated) there, and there daily i th'idisease appears. We should be' much obliged to our correspondents if they would examine closely into the state of the ground where their <a name="potatoes761"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are growing ;fo t if water lodging in the ground is the cause, then thorough drainage will bathe preventive in future years. That excessive wet, in a cold soil, is the cause, connected with the other circumstances already alluded to, is, we think, conclusively proved by <a name="potatoes762"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from Bennenden, in Went, which are half rotten. Now these <a name="potatoes763"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had already burst, from the quantitycid127ofwater they contained; but the wounds so produced had healed up, and now they are perishing from murray in, We infer, from these examples, that at Bennenden, even in the warm and comparatively sunny days of July, the tubes were injured by excessive wet ; but, on that occasion, it did not end in putrefaction : that form of the disease did not i come on till the :old, gloomy, watery days of August, and after the forced growth of July. Since writing thus: far, the post has brought a fresh supply of information among which are letters from Dr. Well Alter and Mr. Gifford, a Jersey gentleman. The former states that the disease has become modified, and ceases to run its course so rapidly. During the last week we have had a little sunshine, and a cessation of rain. Mr. Giffords remarks coincide with the views above expressed. As to cure for this dis temper, there is none. One of our correspondents, is angry at our not telling the public how to stop it; but he ought to consider that man has no power to arrest the dispensations of Providence. He are visited by a great calamity, which we must bear. At the same time, although it is not within human means to alter the course of the seasons or to prevent the maladies attendant on them, yet prudence may perhaps suggest some alleviation of the evil. Should we have fine weather, the disease will probably disappear; should rain and cold continue, it will spread. In the latter case, the only thing to be done will be to dig up the crop immediately. Such loss will be thus sustained, and the quality of late <a name="potatoes764"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will be bad; but the loss will be less than to let the <a name="potatoes765"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> all rot in the cold ground ; and we conceive that some of the crop will bee a table, though not what could be wished. We find that, in some districts, the haul m has been mowed down by way of stopping the mischief, (and this may be judicious as a temporary expedient) but we fear that no real advantage can be expected from any other course than digging up i, drying, and sorting over the produce. Although the <a name="potatoes766"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> taken up thus early will suffer in quality i from their unripe ness, yet even this evil may be partially remedied by putting them in heaps consisting of alternate layers of dry earth and 'tubes, In such a situation it is probable that no further decay will take place; and it is certain the the ripe king process will continue to proceed, although less effectively than under natural circumstances, We may add, that such late <a name="potatoes767"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as we have examined are much more advanced towards ripe ness than might be supposed. They are already very full of starch; nd a their gumma matter is disappearing fast 552 a. We should be very glad to know how far the observations of others confirm or contradict our suggestion, that thorough drainage prevents the appearance of the <a name="potato571"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in. We should also wish to know whether it has appeared in the cold parts of the Kingdom. If not, the <a name="potato572"><mark>potato</mark></a> harvest in the north bids fair to be as profitable to the gardeners there, as it is ruinous to those in the south; and holders will do well to ascertain the value of their <a name="potatoes768"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in London before they sell. As to the fitness of delayed <a name="potatoes769"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for food, we doubt extremely the prudence of using them, if the disease is more than skin deep, so that it may be pared away. Putrid matter of any kind (or even matter approaching putrid it y) is unfit for being introduced into the stomach, and has very often proved fatal. The Belgian police, acting upon this well known fact, have been destroying the delayed <a name="potatoes770"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the public markets of Antwerp; and they have acted wiselyEditorialFrom the Gardeners' Chronicle, August 23, 1845. I am sorry to say that the pestilence mentioned by Dr. Alter, which has seized the <a name="potato573"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in the I s le of Right, has also done a deal of damage to our <a name="potato574"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops in the I s land of Jersey; but, thank Heaven, not as yet to the extent mentioned by your correspondents. About three weeks ago I first perceived the mischief in a <a name="potato575"><mark>potato</mark></a> field of mine, (about an acre) and I at once attributed it to the easterly winds, and took no more riot ice of it; but a few days after, seeing the fields of my neighbors in the same plight, and having taken notice that those parts of the fields which were most sheltered from these winds had not escaped the disease, I concluded that it must be attributed to other causes, as yet unknown. Having remarked that the places most affected were under the hedges and in the cold est parts of the fields, where the sun had less power, and that in those, parts where the surf had full play the crop had suffered less, I think that it will be found, after a serious investigation, that a great deal of the mischief must be attributed to the very wet season, and to the cold nights which we have had all through the summer. With us, the tubes have not yet suffered. I dug a few roots the other day, and though unripe, they were found very good. To far as the leaf and the stems go, the disease seems to be the same as mentioned by Dr. Alter, and it seems to be universal through our island. Of Chard Of Ffordjerseyo .:S .1 have <a name="potatoes771"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a field (hilly ground) where the sun strikes all day long, which shows no symptom of the disease; and this, according to my opinion, goes far to prove that the state of the atmosphere through the summer has had a great deal to do in bringing the dreadful calamity complained of. R.  The perusal of the article on <a name="potato576"><mark>potato</mark></a> blight induces me to trouble you with a few remarks on the subject. a. 558About ten i days ago, I first noticed a brown spot or mark on the margin of sopmTeof my <a name="potato577"><mark>potato</mark></a> leaves. In examination, I also found spots of a similar color on the stalk; but on trying the roots or tubes of several sorts, I could find no perceptible disease or injury. This morning I have been induced to examine a variety of sorts in different situations and soils: 1st, as heaved kidneys; 2d, Julys; 3d, Boxs or Boxs needling; 4th, peeled 5th, Lancashire red; 6th, Canada pine; 7th, a <a name="potato578"><mark>potato</mark></a> kindly sent me by or. Renders on; and, 8th, m angel wurtzel. All the sorts, in all the situations, appear to be similarly affected, except number 8, which has up to this day almost entirely escaped, though the fatal spot is occasionally perceptible on the leaf, the plant growing very luxuriantly. I may add that every plot in my allot men t field, under every variation of culture, is in the same sad condition, and the neighboring farmers make a similar report. I observe here that the centre of the plots has been first affected ; that haul m smells remarkably like new made hay, and the whole of the mischief above ground is i done in the course of three or four days. I cannot, however, ascertain that as yet any injury whatever has been done to the tubes in either of the sorts I have mentioned, whether early or late. It is true that I found a few of my Julys slightly diseased on the outside, but not more so than frequently happens, and certainly not sufficient, per se, to attract notice or remark. My gardener calls the disease the dry rot. Pet Worth. From the Gardeners' Chronicle, August 30, 1845. Another week has added little to what we know about the <a name="potato579"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in, but that little is important. In the first place, we appear to have been right in supposing the dis temper to have confined its attacks mainly to the southern parts of the country. We hear nothing about it in the north, and Mr. Berkeley writes that he cannot find a trace of it in his part of Nottinghamshire. As we anticipated, its virulence, too, seems to have a bated, and we feel warranted in the hope that the worst is over ; that is to say, that no more tubes will be attacked than those in which the dis temper has already manifested itself. But we fear that their number is far beyond "what is imagined, It is certainly greater in the places we have personally inspected than we anticipated. We have this morning been examining a field in which the pest has assumed a comparatively mild form, and we find that among bread fruits six in inn ne, among Jersey blues all or nearly so, and a monger. Tender sons black Scotch <a name="potato580"><mark>potato</mark></a> a large proportion; indicate unequivocal signs of its presence. It is not, however, easy to discover it in the dark colored <a name="potatoes772"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> without cutting them, and therefore we speak doubting ly as to them. In the bread fruits it appears in the form of dull, livid p aches or specks, looking much like contused flesh, or, to use familiar comparison, like the skin round a blackened eye when it is beginning to recover its natural color. This appearance is, however, not to be seen plainly, unless the <a name="potatoes773"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are washed. A little earth, or even the skin adhering to the <a name="potato581"><mark>potato</mark></a>, hides it; and this deceived us on our first inspection. W e fear that every potatovhrich is affected, in ever so small a degree, is dost; for we have too nm ch reason to believe that the disease is of the nature of a cancer, eating down into the flesh. At least, we find that pot a 554 toes which a week ago were taken out of the ground and placed in the dark, on the floor of a dry stable, are infinitely worse than they we; I tis this which leads us to suppose that every <a name="potato582"><mark>potato</mark></a>, in ever so small a degree touched, will rapidly decay. This is unfortunately rendered the more probable by the appearance of a kind of mould i ness, mentioned elsewhere by Mr. Berkeley, which appears on the can ke red spots, and which will no doubt add greatly to the mischief, though we are quite persuaded that it is the consequence and not the cause of it. The cause is, we think, beyond all doubt that which we last week suggested excessive wet, and a low temperature, acting upon the debilitated organization of a haul m, which sudden warmth had forced into peter natural vigor. Some of our correspondents think, indeed, that the spot in the leaf is the cause ; that it is cold, or some other thing, acting upon the foliage, which has caused a disease which spreads downwards. If we may be certain of anything, when considering the obscure phenomena connected with vegetable disease, we may be certain that this is 'it so' The evil always begins next to the old set, and under ground; then, the hand m becomes brown, and rots. The spots in the leaves are merely the symptoms of the underground malady. It is only necessary to take up a few patches of sound and unsound <a name="potatoes774"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be convinced of this. :I n fact, in some places it will be found that when the attack on the stem be ne at the ground has been slight, no indication of its presence is traceable in the foliage. We suspect, indeed, that in every case the <a name="potato583"><mark>potato</mark></a> straw has been damaged above the old set; for where <a name="potatoes775"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are perfectly sound they now seem to have little communication with. the parent to have ceased growing and the sound parts of the haul m are here and there throwing out a fresh crop of <a name="potatoes776"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, now about a week old. Of course the grand point to settle is, what can now be done ?a? When the mischief is severe nothing. We should abandon the crop to its fate, and plough up the field if time will permit. This is, however, not very important, because we do not apprehend that the rotten <a name="potatoes777"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will leave any contagion in the ground, unless it be for another crop of the same kind. We certainly should not like to grow <a name="potatoes778"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in such fields next year otherwise, we presume that the delayed tubes will act like any other delayed matter, and manure the land. I s there any gain in mowing off the haul m that remains, when the disease is less severe? If we thought that such haul m was at all in communication with the <a name="potatoes779"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> themselves, we should say, cut it off by all means. But the cords of union are apparently broken ; and if so, there seems at first to be no advantage in removing it. I f, however, what remains of the foliage is still in communication with the sound <a name="potatoes780"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, it will affect them, and therefore, perhaps, it is a wise precautionary measure to now the haul down. I to remaining can do no good; and at all events, cutting it off will do something towards enabling the ground to become dry. Upon the whole, we suspect that the <a name="potato584"><mark>potato</mark></a> growers will be compelled to leave their crops to their fate until harvest is more advanced. An the decay be arrested in those <a name="potatoes781"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in which it is now manifesting itself? That is another and most important inquiry, to which the novelty of the dis temper renders it impossible to give anything more than aconjectural answer. For ourselves, we fear that external applications, likeDPc. No. 140. 555 lime, white wash, or charcoal powder, will be in efficacious for this reason i, that the disease cuts into the core of the <a name="potato585"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and the action of all such substances, if of any advantage whatever, will be merely on the surface. Suppose that infected can ke red pieces were cut out, and the wound dressed in quick lime or white wash ; would that stop it? The plan may be tried. One thing, and one only, strikes us as a probable remedy, and that is, destroying the vitality of the <a name="potato586"><mark>potato</mark></a> by driving off its moisture. His maybe done by kill drying, and we fear by no other means. It might be worth the while of those who have the means to try this experiment, aid if it should produce any advantage this year, it may be useful to know of it in case we should again be, exposed to such a melancholy visitation. If it is any consolation to <a name="potato587"><mark>potato</mark></a> growers to know that they do not stand alone in their misfortune, we can add that acres of picking cucumbers have gone off in the same manner, from the same cause, and with the same symptoms. We have now before us a you rd, whose roots and main stern seem to have perished about a month since; but the plant has not died, because the such lent steins have thrown out fresh roots from the joints. The same thing is happening to <a name="potatoes782"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, but, from the lateness of the season, we fear to no practical purpose. *a* *a* *a* [EditorialWe find the <a name="potato588"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in this neighborhood (vacant) is also affected, but not to so great an extent as your columns describe the injury to have been ii the I s le of Right. In digging up the roots, the tubes nearest the surface of the ground are, in general, the only ones affected, though it some plants the injury extends throughout the <a name="potatoes783"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> belonging to that root; but where it does not so extend, the rest of the tubes appear perfectly well grown and healthy. It certainly is not a disease of the root, but appears to be the consequence of injury done to the i half and leaf. I s not the cause to be attributed to the severe winds and white frosts experienced a short time ago, injuring all above the ground, and preventing the vessels of the plant from drawing up the juices from the roots, and these tubes, full of stag named fluid, immediately decaying? Supposing this to be correct I; have practised the cutting off the haul m, with a reaping hook, about one inch between the earth, into where the frosts and winds might be supposed not to have injured the vessels of the plants, hoping by these means to induce them to bleed, and thereby relieve the tubes of their stagnatedfluids. This is not capable of curing the injured; but it might probably prevent other tubes from becoming affected. I also suppose that if nature form a leaf from this proceeding, the <a name="potato589"><mark>potato</mark></a> will certainly be saved; and if a leaf be not formed, then, lb! leaving the <a name="potato590"><mark>potato</mark></a> an extra time in the ground, the tubes not affected might ripe n and become wholesome food; which this cannot be if not allowed to fully ripe n. Y : -a' i .a- , : ' -a' n o 0. Of  have reason to believe that you are perfectly correct in ascribing the <a name="potato591"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease to excess of moisture in the plant, consequent on the late 556 continual rain and absence of sunlight, and that it has been greatly aggravated by a too rete native soil. Our garden is, from l its locality and the nature of its sub soil, so thoroughly drained, that in most summers we suffer excessively from drought; and though the haul m of the <a name="potatoes784"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grown in it is more or less affected, the tubes themselves are comparatively uninjured ; while in a piece of ground apart from the garden, having a stiff clay by sub soil, the disease has been much more violent. I am also inclined to agree with you in connecting with the disease the sudden heat of the end of June and beginning of July, as in a piece of Dutch <a name="potatoes785"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which was not planted before that time, scarcely a symptom of the disease is perceptible. I may also remark, that, in the garden, the disease originated in a part of the <a name="potato592"><mark>potato</mark></a> ground which is shaded by a large apple tree, so that for a time the outline of the blackened haul m exactly represented the shadow of the tree. X Ox. E. J., .a; , .a, .a; : .a. I have this morning received from Dr. Montague, of Paris, some leaves affected with the mildew, together with an admirable analysis of it, and it proves to be a minute mould of the genus Botrytis, very greatly resembling that which is so very common on the Shepherds Nurse, especially on those plants which are attacked by the white are do. It is also allied to Botrvtisdestructor, (neck) which is occasionally a perfect pest amongst the different species of a ilium. I have seen whole beds of shallows entirely destroyed by it, and it is occasionally very pre judicial to onions. The parasite of the <a name="potato593"><mark>potato</mark></a> does not appear to have been observed before by syqtematists, and differs in several particulars from those of the same genus which have been long, known as attacking the leaves of various plants. Dr. Montague purposes to call it Botrytis infestans, and will doubtless take an early opportunity of publishing his observations. He does not undertake to say that the spots on the tubes are owing to the ravages of the Botrytis, or whether two causes of disease coexist. The primary cause is doubtless the continued wet, combined with certain peculiarities of soil. It may be observed that the dry rot in <a name="potatoes786"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, so ably described by Martins, arose from the attack of a fungus of a very different structure from that by which the leaves and stems are attacked in the present instance. Ski Ngs Cli   Of, August 26. M. J. B. From the Gardeners' Chronicle, September 6, 1845. Since I last wrote to you, I am sorry to say that the <a name="potato594"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in has made its appearance in Northamptonshire and the neighboring parts ofHuntingdonshire, and is spreading very rapidly, and will, I fear, do great damage unless the improved state of the weather checks the evil, about which I am not very sanguine. I have seen it on various kinds of soil, and on both early and very late planted <a name="potatoes787"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; on some, indeed, which are now in full blossom. It is quite as virulent on well drained fields, whether the soil is bad or good, as on the cold, un drained clay of our forest land. The worst case that I have seen is in Huntingdonshire, on and. 557 excellent piece of well drained land, but lying within a few yards of the river; not, however, subject to be flooded. I do not find that the tubes are at present affected; but the haul m is decaying very rapidly, and in every case the b lighted spots are covered with Botrytis infestans, (wont) You will be interested to learn that the mould on the <a name="potatoes788"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which you sent me is identical with that upon the leaves, and the same with what I have received from Paris. In making a very fine vertical section through the less diseased portion of the tubes, I find incident plants of the mould in the more healthy cells. for, in general, the brown spots do not at first consist entirely of delayed cells, but still retain many in a tolerably healthy state. At a later period, probably, all the cells would be more or less altered. Those which are un colored exhibit their usual appearance ; but the walls of the diseased cells 'are thickened, and have a g ranula ted appearance. Both in colored and dis colored cells the grains of the feu la remain apparently unaltered, and are as sensible to the effect of iodine as ever. It is probable, therefore, that at least in an early stage of the disease the tubes would yield as good starch as those which are sound. There is not the slightest appearance of any processes upon the grains offecula, as in the disease so admirably illustrated by Martins. It is the cellular tissue alone which seems to by affected. The cells immediately beneath the cut ice, especially where there is a depressed spot externally, are often impregnated with mycelium to such a degree that the pure white of the mycelium predominates, and the brown tint in a great measure vanishes. :even in this case I find the grains of feu la healthy and abundant. It appears, then, that the decay of the tube his produced by the same cause which affects the leaves, viz: by the growth of a mould whose development has been promoted by the excessive wet. The parasite does not appear to have been observed before; but there is little doubt that it will now be found to be more or less prevalent in damp and ill drained spots, even in the dries t years. The excessive development of the mould, and its consequent injurious effects, depending entirely- t pon the season, it will, beyond doubt, be impose, bible to find a remedy ; nor does it seem, from what has been stated above, that even the best cultivation will insure exemption. It is greatly to be desired, that as such points are seldom if ever taken in hand by government, some of our agricultural societies would, from time to time, take proper steps to insure the best information possible as to the extent and circumstances of any plague like that which is at present so injurious. The most valuable facts are thus obtained upon the continent, when the commissions are properly instituted; and in some eases, as in that of the calamity by which the vines of France were for some time affected, such inquiries have been attended by the most beneficial results. It is impossible, from ri any number of independent documents, to arrive at the complete history of any disease like the present. A continued series of observations, conducted both by practical and scientific men, and thus embracing every possible point, and extending through remote districts, with the power of comparing individually the different .phases it exhibits, or the varied circumstances under which it appears, can alone lead to anything satisfactory. The expense, doubtless, would be considerable; but the utility whether immediate or more remote, would be fully commensurate with the expense. M. J. Jbinas Clwuff558 a; In reference to your remark, that the disease commences under ground, I must beg leave, though no physiology st, to doubt it. I have in very many instances split or divided the haul m from the blossom to the root; and iii oily two instances did I find any defect below the ground. Both these were in, the Julys ; the outside appearance was that of mildew; the stalk at the lower end, both above and below the surface of the ground, was dry, wiry, and scarcely flexible; but this occasionally happens in ordinary seasons. I have found only one instance of the disease having penetrated the haul more than skin deep, without destroying it; in this case, it assumed the appearance of a reddish brown cancer. My observations would not lead to tie inference that well drained land has in any material degree escaped the scourge, and I feel fully justified in making the remark, from the very porous character of the soil around me, and my knowledge of the manner in which a large portion of it has been cultivated. It is a somewhat remarkable circumstance, that on Friday, the 8th of August, we had an unusual quantity of electricity in the atmosphere, and lightning from all parts of the heavens. We had also-three nights consecutive frosts at that time and on Saturday, the 9th. the disease was first noticed in this neighborhood. I do not pretend, to infer that electricity has introduced this disease; but, as the coincidence occurred, I have thought right to mention it. I am disposed to attribute the mischief to the cold, wet, and generally un genial season, and perhaps to our want of sufficient knowledge of the habit of the <a name="potato595"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I s there anything in the nature of the mangelwurtzel <a name="potato596"><mark>potato</mark></a> different from that of other kinds, or is my observation in its favor a solitary testimony. H. Petworth. The other day my attention was arrested by a black looking patch in my garden, and on close examination I soon discovered all the symptoms so much complained of, and which seem to identify it with this almost universal disaster; and which I must, at once, pronounce to be neither more nor less than mildew. I may of course be wrong in my assumption : this 4 tie must prove; but mildew in general has such distinct features, that long experience in such matters can hardly be mistaken. I feel astonished assuming, for the moment, that I am right in the opinion) that this had not been discovered before. In the specimens which I have examined, in three distinct stages, the points all agree with those related from the southern parts of the country. In the first stage, the black spots look as though hot coals of small dimensions had been laid on given points. Had it not been for the un ambiguous character of the second stage, I Would have fancied that it was a parasite belonging to the genus are do. The second stage, if I may so divide the matter, appears to be the rolling t curling up of the leaves all over the plant, exhibiting thereby the backlofeie leaves; and the whole plant, at this period, appears white with mildew. His is soon succeeded by a general black ness and rotten ness; the leaves are totally perished, the stem denuded, and the rot proceeding so rapidlyitht portions of the stem soon become a pulp y mass. I cut into some tubersithis morning, which belonged to roots nearly in the third stage, and I found the end dis colored in a considerable degree, more especially at that point where the string forms a junction with the <a name="potato597"><mark>potato</mark></a>; this is just what I had. a. 559 expected. The, <a name="potato598"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant, abounding so much in watery matter, appears to furnish a better subject than most plants for such rapid and astonishing effects of destructive ferment at ion, or decay of the whole system. It is pretty clear to me, from the circumstance of its attacking the crop in the more southern parts of the island first, as also the earliest kinds in general, that this mildew requires a highly elaborated state of sap in the plant to facilitate its progress. Thus it is with the pea mildew. If the general e lab orations of the plant move, through the influence of heat and light, at a greater rapidity than can be sufficiently supplied by the ascending current, the mildew spreads with great rapidity. I think it likely that the incessant rains, accompanied with such low temperature, have been quite sufficient to warrant the assumption that the fibrous action of the root has been much paralyzed. It is certain that the atmospheric conditions have not been as in ordinary summers. I take it for granted, that whatever arrests the secretions of, the <a name="potato599"><mark>potato</mark></a> robs the tube r of a portion of accretivematter, and consequently of keeping as well as nutritions qualities. R. Erri Ngton. Olton, Or    Eshi Of. I have a piece of ground of about an acre and a half planted with <a name="potatoes789"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The soil is a fine hazel loam, and the field slopes toward the south. Most probably <a name="potatoes790"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were never grown here before. I had the ground trenched 18 inches deep, in the autumn, and thrown up in hacks. The <a name="potatoes791"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted in April, with more than a usual quantity of stable dung placed over the sets; so that they had every advantage of both drainage and manure. The plants were very promising until within the last three weeks, when an appearance of premature ripe ness became visible. At this time Monday, September 1st the early Shaw S have but little green remaining on their tops; the pink eyed kidneys not much more and the later kinds, though not withered, are as brown as they were last year at the end of October. I cannot find, in any case, that the stems have rotted, but they have turned black, and the foliage has quite disappeared. I dug up three rows of early Shaw S this morning, and the produce has proved better than I expected. The quantity is very small, when the expensive mode of culture is considered ; but the proportion of unsound tubes is not large. This un soundness appears most on the <a name="potatoes792"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> nearest the surface, and presents a dirty brown color, which extends, in various degrees, into the structure of the tube r. The most remarkable circumstance is, that this discoloration is not associated with rotten ness, since the part affected is as hard and as juice as that which is sound. 1 observed, also, that one <a name="potato600"><mark>potato</mark></a> which had received a wound in the dis colored part, was fast healing over, which, I presume, could not be the case if rotten ness had commenced, H. Burgess. The Bury, Lutrnr, Beds, A war ra aspect and a well drained soil seem to be no safeguard from the attacks of the <a name="potato601"><mark>potato</mark></a> plague, for I happen to know of an instance whereas heaved kidneys, from the same seed, were planted on a dry, sunny bore 60 der, in a private garden in this city, and on a cold, shady, damp border in the same garden ; yet the <a name="potatoes793"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the warm and dry aspect are destroyed, while the others, under the shade and drip of the trees, 'have shown n symptoms at present of being injured. In the case mentioned, however 1 cannot help suspecting that the latter will suffer by and by; the disease appearing to me to be in the nature of a ferment at ion or decomposition, which, when once induced, is encouraged and promoted by the presence of warmth. This view of the case also serves to explain the reason why the southern counties have been the first to suffer from this alarming desolation, and why the northern parts of the country may look out for its appearance amongst their crops before many days. W. Marshall. Sely Cambri Dgeshi Of, September 4. I cannot agree with you in attributing the disease which affects the <a name="potato602"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop to excessive moisture. In the first place, is it a fact that the earth has been saturated with moisture to an unusual degree ?a? Taking the deficiency of moisture during last year, I imagine not. But with respect to the <a name="potato603"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, as far as I can perceive, there is not the slightest difference between those grown in light and heavy soil. In the neighborhood of this place there are acres on the light ferruginous sand, on the edge of the cliffs, and consequently thoroughly drained, on which there is not at this moment a plant that is not infected. What the cause may be, I do not pretend to say but I do not think it can be traced to the excessive moisture of the summer. Had this been the case, would not the decay have been more gradual Would the destruction of the plant have been so very rapid ?a? It is not merely wet that has done this mischief; it is the combination of cold and wet, acting upon very tender tissue. About that we entertain no doubt. We inquired as to drainage, rather than asserted anything about it, as you will perceive if our remarks are again per used. W. E. H. Sandoun18le Of Of Ght. I or the description given by Dr. Alter I have nothing to add, as I consider it very correct; but I confess that my observations differ from that gentleman as to the part in which the disease first takes its origin. Methinks it a kind of blight, beginning in the leaves and stems, extending downwards, and finally affecting the tube r. I confess my inability to explain satisfactorily what the real nature of this disease may be. Dr. S. seems to think that we must trust the microscopical observations to discover a parasite on the plant. I am not aware that the disease which, when occurring in the animal world, is termed gangrene, or mortification, can be correctly applied to the vegetable kingdom, otherwise I should consider these brown spots to be incident mortification, and that, as the effect of this condition, the death of the leaves and stem follows. A circumstance, accidentally discovered, seems to support this view. Previous to the appearance of this disease in any of the <a name="potatoes794"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this neighborhood, I was using at table some as heaved kidneys, of excellent quality; and so ripe that from natural decay the hall m was withered. A s real quantity. 561 of them, intended for seed, were left, and in a few days more, upon digging them up, great was my disappointment in finding them all more or less affected with this disease. Now, in this case there was not any portion of the plant above ground which could be at all affected by blight, or any i other state of the atmosphere. I am, therefore, disposed to suggest whether the disease is not one primarily affecting the tubes, and probably the effect of continued wet and cold, together with an absence of solar heat and light, whereby the chemical changes necessary for the formation of starch, albumen, and other in organic products, have not been produced in the proportions necessary for assimilation. Chemical analyses of the tubes, thus affected, can alone prove how far this view may be a correct one* M. D. Eastbourne. From the Gardeners' Chronicle of 13th September. Having examined the tubes infected with the prevailing disease, I have scarcely a doubt left upon my mind that it is that moist ulceration (gangrene sanious a) to which all bulbs and tubes are liable, if exposed to un genial circumstances at the time when their ripe king process should commence. At such time they require increased degrees of heat and dryness, and if subjected to the opposite extremes, as the <a name="potato604"><mark>potato</mark></a> has been this year, they for the most part ulcerate and decay. Take the tu lip and hyacinthfor example. In confirmation or refutation of this opinion, I have instituted researches, which I hope to conclude in time for publication in the, Gardeners' Almanacs in November next; but they have extended sufficiently already to remove almost every doubt from my mind. If the July and August of next year are dry and warm, I do not hesitate to prophesy that there will be no <a name="potato605"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in, and I think no preventive measures necessary beyond avoiding planting on plats of ground which have borne infected <a name="potatoes795"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> this year. G. W. Johnson. I learn, by letters from several foreign friends, that the disease which now affects the <a name="potato606"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops in the channel islands, and in several parts of England, is universal in Belgium, and almost all through France; and as Professor Dorr en, of the University of Siege, has described the malady and the remedy to be immediately applied, I have seized the first moment of leisure to translate part of a letter which he has inserted in the I independence, of Brussels, for the benefit of those whom it may concern. The real cause of the disease is a mildew fungus, which scientific men class under the head of bory tis, but which the farmers will easily distinguish, and will name a spot, scotch, or burn. Some will attribute it to humidity, others to dry winds, to insects, &c. Nevertheless, it is of consequence to know the real cause of this phenomena; for the knowledge of it puts the farmers on the road to diminish or destroy, if it is possible, the evil. The professor has for several days followed the progress of the disease in several <a name="potato607"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields, and has come to the following results r The malady decidedly commences by the upper part of the leaves; in 36 562 Doc. my. 140.sevWrai instances he has seen the flowers and the seed vessels first attacked. A part of the green tissue loses its color, and becomes yellow; the spotsgoditafter become: gray, and it is always on. the under part of the leaf, t on: the seed vessel; that the next day, or two days after the leaf has turned yellow, you perceive the formation of a white do win The microscope shows that this down is formed by a fungus which fructifies between the nut hero is hairs garniihintg the under parts of the <a name="potato608"><mark>potato</mark></a> leaf. This fungus is extremely thin; but fit fructifies immensely, and reproduces itself by 7 millions. The professor, after having given a minute detail of the size, ce of this fungus, corfcludes this part of his letter by saying: Farmers will tell me that this is a very small body to cause such immense ravages; but I will answer, that the it ch is not a malady less to be feared, because theaecid127iarus which causes it is a microscopic object. It is after the leaves have turned yellow, and the bory tis has made its appearance, that the stem is affected. Were and there the epidermis turns brown or black; and when you follow, with the use of the microscope, the infection, you soon perceive that it is by the skin that the stem is attacked. The morbid agent carries its action from the skin to the epidermis; and though you do not perceiveftingus' 6 i this last part, it is not the less struck with death. For those who have a few nations of vegetable physiology, these effects are easily explained: The sap modified in living juice, in vegetable blood, forms itslfinthe leaf, and descends through the skin' in the stem and' roots. 'there the sap, being sickly i deadly, carries the poison from the east intothe stem it and kills -it. The fact is, that as soon as the black spots are seen on the stem, the leave dry and diet and, struck with death by a poisonous mushroom, they fall, uhfortulfately, to deposit e in the ground the germs of the poison. The unction so ion descends ilio the <a name="potato609"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and, if the malady follows its na tidal course, it is soon affected with the gangrene ; it turns brown 'or y :tow, sometimes gray and dark, is soon spoiled, and the smelt his so disagteeabletht the animals refuse to eat of them. The disease being now known, the 'attention t of agriculturists ought to be turned' to diminish, as: wChspossible, the evil; because it is well known that all diseases: whichaffbectthe "or k crops, &c, once introduced into the country, remain and prop agate more and more. This year the epidemic seems to be universal ; the germ is everywhere; and if a remedy is not immediately applied, the crops will be affected next year, and then it will become more difficult to extirpate the evil. First, when i the <a name="potato610"><mark>potato</mark></a> haul m is infected with the diseaseimow it do wh, and immediately burn it. Second, act in- the same way in <a name="potato611"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields that seem to have escaped the infection ; for, though they may appear so to the eye, yet the ay may not have escaped the disease. Third, the <a name="potatoes796"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> diseased ought also to be burnt. Fourth, 'the seed for the next year oughfttobe* stepped, like corn &c, with lime, sulphate of copper, and common salt, diluted in watery in order to kill the fungus, if any: on th. <a name="potato612"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Fifth, the <a name="potato613"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields ought to be next year as far off as possible from those of this year. Sixth, a mixture of lime, common salt i, and sulphate of copper, to be powdered on the <a name="potato614"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields infected this mixture having the power of destroying the poison left in the ground by the infected plants. Fbrmny part, I still hold to the opinion by me emitted -and I have seen nothing as yet to make me alter it that the disease, in the first place i has taken its origin by the dampness and cold air which has been so prevalent during. 563 the summer season. Since the warm weather has set in, (about three weeks) the disease seems to have made but little progress; the tube r has been but partially affected and, though swelling but little, seems to be sound and good. Nevertheless, the crop is a failure; averaging about half a crop. Of Chard Of Fford. Of. Peters, Jersey. I important to <a name="potato615"><mark>potato</mark></a> growers by attention has been given to the disease which has shown itself so extensively amongst growing <a name="potatoes797"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I find, in almost every instance, that the epidermis of the stalk, below the surface of the ground, is more or less in a state of decay, often disintegrated, and completely rotten. The leaves and branches accord with the state of that part. below the ground The tube r beneath the outer skin is first spotted brown, (like a bruised apple) these spots, extend and penetrate towards the centre, quite changing the nature of the <a name="potato616"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Those near the surface are most injured. In some cases the lowest on the root are not at all affected, while the upper ones are useless. I should therefore expect that the longer the crop remains in the ground the greater the injury will be. It seems from the microscopic appearances, that the starch escapes injury for a long time after the skin and cellular parts are gone; and, as the whole of the nutrition powers of the <a name="potato617"><mark>potato</mark></a> reside in the starch, I should recommend that, wherever the disease has shown itself to any extent, the crop should be dug, whether ripe or not, and the starch extracted by the following simple process: After washing the roots, let them be grasped fine and thrown into. a large tub or other vessel; pour a considerable quantity of water, and well agitated and rub the pulp with the hands; all the starch orfecula will, from its great weight, fall to the bottom, while the skin arid fibrous matter will be carried away by the water; wash the starch with one or two more waters, allowing it to fall after each washing ; spread it upon cloths in a warm room, to dry. In this way about twenty pounds or twenty-one pounds will be obtained from every one hundred pounds of <a name="potatoes798"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and it contains as much nourishment as the original roots. It will, keep any length of time, and might be used with flour to make bread, pies, pudding, &was well as farinaceous spoon meal. This is much better than throwing away the diseased roots; and will furnish food for tens of thousands who might otherwise want it. Of Lli   Of Herapath. From the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, Kept. 20, 1845. The attention of: everybody is so absorbed by the <a name="potato618"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in, that we should be wanting in our duty towards the public if we did not continue to avert to the melancholy subject. Not that we have much to add, either by way of advice or consolation; for the topics connected with the disease have all been -already touched upon, more or less amply, by ourselves or our correspondents; and every weeks experience satisfies us that there is little, if anything, to modify in the opinions we have ourselves already expressed 564 a. The mischief is undoubtedly extensive to a most alarming degree. If we estimate the amount of loss at five-sixths, we shall hardly exceed the fact. In many places the crop is hardly worth digging; in others it is totally putrid ; in many more, it seems to be spreading fast; and, as we mentioned last week, it has certainly broken out in I re land." All my <a name="potatoes799"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>" says a correspondent near Dublin, " as well as those of the poor people here, are destroyed by murray in. Two days ago twelve acres were still safe ; they are now gone Germany, Holland, and Belgium are in the same state as England. Dysentery, which has already appeared at Erfurt, is said, by the Gazette de: Cologne, to be traceable to the use of bad <a name="potatoes800"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The Belgium papers speak of cholera at Ghent, produced in the same way. Poland, according to the same journals, is so threatened by famine that the Russian authorities, on the frontiers, have been obliged to take precautionary measures for keeping the starving population out of the Russian territory ; and finally, the authorities of some districts in France and Germany have either prohibited, or threatened to prohibit, the exportation of <a name="potatoes801"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, lest there should be no seed for another year. Such is the state of the case. It is useless now to speck late on the first cause of this murray in. Our original opinion was, we believe, correct at least we have not at present seen anything to shake our confidence in it; and we find that, with the single exception of Professor Dorr en, the universal opinion among the Belgian cultivates is the same as ours, except when mete ors, electricity, and other unknown forces are appealed to. I tis true that a minute fungus has made matters infinitely worse; but that is, we quite believe, a secondary cause. The consideration of this part of the question may, however, be very well deferred. What we have now to look to is an immediate remedy for the evil. From the very beginning we have pointed to dryness as the first means of arresting the progress of this disease. We even ventured to suggestkilndrying, where means are at hand to employ it. We now learn from the Belgium Moniteur that a Dr. Earle z, of Brussels, has proved experimentally the efficacy of this process. The following is his account of his manner of proceeding 4 caused an oven to be heated to the temperature of something less than 1800 Fahrenheit. I placed in it diseased <a name="potatoes802"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, both whole and cut, in order to be able to obtain an exact comparison between the parts baked and those not exposed to heat After having been exposed to this temperature for a few minutes, a copious blackish matter oozed out of the <a name="potatoes803"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and they emitted a nausea us foetid smell. The corrupted matter came out, and when the <a name="potatoes804"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were not too much diseased they became white again, and nothing remained of the re t except a slight brownish layer adhering to the skin, and easily removed by peeling. This layer is compact, and will permit nothing to pass through it into the interior. It loses, moreover, all power of injuring the sound parts that remain. As soon as <a name="potatoes805"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are quite dry on the surface, they may be removed from the oven. I found from 18 to 22 minutes long enough, when the temperature was such as I have described he are unable to say how long <a name="potatoes806"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> thus treated may be kept; but we imagine that there will be no difficulty on that head, if they are stored away in a perfectly dry place. a. The question is, how far the cost will render the process of, practical value. Others recommend a steep of some kind as a means of stopping the mischief. This, if it will produce the effect, is the simplest process; but we are not aware of any positive result having been obtained by it. For ourselves, we have no great expectation of advantage from it. The mould fungus, which is now working so much havoc upon a debilitated constitution, buried its s pawn in the tubes, far, we fear, beyond the reach of steep sand, as to its <a name="seeds65"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, why, they are finer than the notes in a sunbeam, and will in situate themselves everywhere. We shall, however, be much obliged to any one who has tried any of the plans that have been proposed, for some account of the result. Mr. Ride aux has recommended chloride of lime and salt. Professor Dorr en also directs attention to the importance of salt as a means of repelling the disease. He recommends the tubes to be plunged in a steep composed of 54 lbs. of lime, 1 lb. sulphate of copper, 7 lbs. of salt, and about 25 gallons of water. But, if the <a name="potatoes807"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are to be eaten, the sulphate of copper must be left out; in fact, he recommends the steep for seed <a name="potatoes808"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> only. There is one circumstance connected with the supposed action of salt, that deserves to be mentioned. In another column will be found a letter from a known correspondent, signing himself' Ambulatory, "who speaks of the healthy state of the <a name="potato619"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops on the coast of Somersetshire, although the murray in has committed its usual havoc beyond the reach of the sea influence. We also read in a Belgian newspaper the following statement: "A person who has been travelling through Belgium, and especially the two Glanders, has remarked that on the coast, as far as the air is impregnated with saline particles, the <a name="potatoes809"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are sound and perfectly healthy but elsewhere, more inland, the epidemic is raging, and the <a name="potatoes810"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> become more and more rotten every day Are these coincidences, or do they indicate any protecting influence on the part of salt ?a? The question is worth consideration. Was any one used salt in planting <a name="potatoes811"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> ?a? and, if so, with what effect ?he find, however, that public opinion is turned more to the extraction and preservation of the flour which lies in the <a name="potato620"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and which constitutes an important part of its nutrition quality, than to any processes for saving the tubes by heat or steeps, the first of which is expensive and the last uncertain. It is a fact, that in spite of the ravages of the mould fungus, or the progress of putrefaction, the internal flour is as yet uninjured, and that it is practicable to extract it by very simple and cheap processes. His course is recommended by the members of the Raleigh Farmers' Club, as will be seen from their resolutions, printed in another column; and we have received both from Mr. Berkeley and Professor Men slow excellent samples of fine <a name="potato621"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour, extracted from the delayed <a name="potatoes812"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The latter gentleman found, that while half a bushel of sound <a name="potatoes813"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> yielded 4 lbs. 10 ounces of flour, the same quantity of diseased and decaying tubes furnished 3 lbs. 1 ounce. We have also received from a farmer at Raleigh some good bread made by a laborers wife from gleaned corn, and rather more than half <a name="potato622"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour, roughly prepared from very bad <a name="potatoes814"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and some sponge cake, worthy of Hunter, made exclusively of such flour, by Mrs. Matters on, the mistress of Raleigh workhouse. In fact, the laborers' wives in Suffolkare setting in good earnest about the extraction of flour. This being so, we think it important to direct particular attention to this 566 practical point; and, in connection with it, we print the following valuable observations of Mr. Edward Folly, who is directing his attention to the chemical facts connected with the murrainAttention is now- generally being drawn to the manufacture of <a name="potato623"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour, with a view to save some portion, at least, of the u useful matter of the drop, instead of losing the whole, which appears to be the inevitable result if those tubes which are affected with the rot are left in the ground to risen, or even stored up with others which are sound. The putrid matter Which has been formed in certain parts of the plant, chiefly in the undergruivhd stem and roots, having been circulated through all parts of the plant, has induced decay or putrescence sometimes in the stem, sometimes in the leaves, and sometimes in the tubes. The putrid matter, or ferment, as it may be termed, contains nitrogen: it is, in fact, the glum ten and albumen of the plant in a state of decomposition; and wherever it has caused decay, it has done so by causing the glum ten and albumen of that part of the plant to enter into a similar state of decomposition. The next substance which begins to change is the cellular tissue, which, under the influence of the putrid azotised matter, up trifies also; and lastly, the granules of flourttndergo the same change. It is almost impossible to arrest this effect in the tubes; for, when once commenced, it proceeds rapidly and with increased power, not only causing the whole of the tube r itself to decay, but also spreading to the surrounding ones, the purifying juice being fully able to develop putrescence in sound tubes. The value of <a name="potatoes815"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as food depends on the flour and azetised matter which they contain: in the diseased tubes, the latter is already destroyed the former, however, remains sound, and therefore, by proper means, maybe separated from the other substances, which are already destroyed, as constituents of food. Later is essential to this species of decay, which would not proceed so rapidly if the <a name="potatoes816"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of this year did not contain an unusually large proportion of water; hence the decay may be checked, or altogether arrested, by drying the tubes: this prevents the further spread of putrefaction, but it does not at all remedy the mischief already done. The best plan, at present, appears to be that of separating the flour from the fibre, &c, of the diseased tubes. Those <a name="potatoes817"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the haul m of which is already dead should be taken up at once, and partially dried by exposure to the air; this will check the progress of decay, and not interfere with the subsequent extraction of the flour. The following is a brief outline of the process requisite for this purpose: " The tubes must be washed, and then grated or reduced to a pulp. Machines for this purpose may be obtained from agricultural machine makers, which will save a good deal of time when any quantity of <a name="potatoes818"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is to be operated upon' The pulp, as it falls from the greater, should be collected in a canvass bag, as then the juice, which contains the greater part of the azotisedmatter, will drain away from the flour and fibrous portion of the tube r. The pulp must then be washed: this may be done on a si eve, or in a coarsecanirass bag; the pulp being well stirred, whilst a small stream of water is suffered to run through it into a tub or other convenient vessel placedbeneathThe water comes through milky, carrying with it the flour, and leaving in the si eve or bag the fibrous matter of the tubes, which may probably. abused with advantage .in :feeding pigs; but, as this is a matter perhaps open to i doubt, it should be given with caution at first. The flour y water, after? standing about it en minutes, is to be poured off, when there will be found at the bottom of the vessel in which it stood a quantity of impure flour; it his must he washed by stirring it up again with a quantity of freshWaterand then allowed to settle; the lower part of the flour will then be found to be pure and white, whilst the upper part is dark colored and contains a good deal of delayed fibre; this should be separated from the cleanflouriwhich is to be drained and placed to dry in a warm room, but not dried by artificial application to fire, which, if incautiously used, would be very likely to spoil it by converting it into gum. By this process, good flour may be obtained from <a name="potatoes819"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are brown and perfectly unfit for anyother1use; but as it is difficult to separate the delayed fibre from the flour in these tubes, it will be as well to separate *as much as possible those which are quite rotten from those which are but slightly painted, before grating." The quantity of flour in different kinds of <a name="potatoes820"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> varies considerably on average, a cut. yields about 18 pounds of good starch; but some kinds yield considerably less. The quantity of flour in <a name="potatoes821"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> this year appears rather less than usual; but this is occasioned by their containing, for the most part, rather more than the usual proportion of water. The ,average proportion of water in good <a name="potatoes822"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is about 80 pounds per cwtThe great advantages of proceeding thus with the diseased <a name="potatoes823"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are, that, in the first place, the process is certain to succeed; and, in the second, that it costs nothing beyond a little labor of women and children, and such an apparatus as every cottage r must have, except a bread ras p; and for that na old coarse file, or even; a brick bat, or anything else having a rough and hard substance, may be substituted; or the <a name="potatoes824"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be crushed byiheay instrument. The arm of an old shirt, or the leg of, a pair of wornoutboanvass trousers, or a piece of an old flannel petticoat, will makestrainSersne or coarse, according to what is wanted, and no fuel is required to dry the material. All that the laborers have to attend to is not to allow the water and starch to stand for more than ten minutes at a time. It is true that a all the azotised matter will thus be lost, but what is saved will have considerable value; and. there is no sort of difficulty in the extraction of the flour, which, where cottages are concerned, will be best effected by the first of the Raleigh processes There is an additional point on which a word of advice might be given. Professor Dorr en recommends that the haul m should be removed and burnt, whenever it is quite withered. The practice of cutting it off and taking it in heaps has been followed by many persons from the first appearance of the disease, and, as we have before stated, there may be some advantage in doing so. This, at least, is certain that no advantage is gained by leaving delayed haul m on the field. We do not, however, attach much importance to the burning; it can do no harm, and that is all for would we. advise the haul m to be removed unless it is very bad because, as long as it is green and healthy, it- has a daily tendency to risen the tubes, and thus to keep off the evil. I f, however, the leaves are yellow, we should take up the cropSeihe above was all in type, when we received the following very important communication from r the Rev. Mr. Berkeley: "h have just received from Dr. Montague specimens of a very curious 568 parasite, which occurs in the intercellular passages of <a name="potatoes825"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> t during the process of germination, or just as it is completed. It was discovered in the course of some experiments by Dr. Layer, chief physician of the Hospital de la Charity, at Paris, who has been paying great attention to the disease with which <a name="potatoes826"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are now affected, and who purposes to publish an account of his observations, which I am assured are most interesting. Amongst other points, he finds that though the grains of feu la which are found in the cells of the diseased <a name="potatoes827"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not injured, they gradually diminish in number, as in the terminating sets, till in some cases all are completely absorbed. It will be important, then, to convert the diseased tubes into flour at as early a period as possible." Dr. Montague considers the parasite above mentioned to belong to a new genus, allied to sepedonium and asterophora. He has given the little mould the name of artotrogus hydnosporusThose who have had access to the late numbers of the Journal of the     institute, will find some interesting matter respecting the <a name="potato624"><mark>potato</mark></a> murrainThe importance of this communication consists in its revealing the fact, that the flour itself disappears, though not undergoing decay. It is therefore of the first consequence that those who mean i to operate upon their decaying crops should do so without a days delayEditorialDI Sease In <a name="potatoes828"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Notwithstanding the fine ness of the weather, the <a name="potato625"><mark>potato</mark></a> blight is makingTrpid progress. Patches which were perfectly green a week ago, are now blackened as if by frost. In every case I find the Botrytis infestans preceding the work of destruction. It appears while the leaves are yet green, or yellowish green, and the parts attached soon become brown and withered. The appearance exhibited by some smooth ash top <a name="potatoes829"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in my garden convinces me that the spots upon the tubes arise from the attack of the mould, and that the mould is not an after organization. The spots form the most distinct concentric circles, disposed in one or sometimes two systems, exactly as in Radium fructigenum, as figured by Ehrenberg, in hisMycetogenesis, and as it may be seen almost every autumn on fallen pear sand apples. In re examining specimens in which there was no external appearance of mould, I found the s pawn very evident in the diseased cells but, as I before observed, the grains of starch sound and unaffected. Some of the cells contained little cubic al color less or brownish crystals, which 1 had not previously met with. If the infected tubes are shut up for a day in a tin box, the mould appears externally in little white patches, and soonfructifies. The grains of starch being perfect, it was a matter of interest to ascertain whether the tubes would produce good <a name="potato626"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour. I accordingly chose six highly infected tubes, of a moderate size, some of which were strongly impregnated with s pawn, and others partially de composed, and I was pleased to find that they yielded about an ounce of flour, of which I send you a sample. You will perceive that it is very slightly dis colored, but otherwise it is apparently of good quality; and I doubt not that, if. 56 made on a large scale, very pure feu la might be obtained. My specimen, indeed, would have been of a purer white, but for a little accident. M. J. Bki Ngs Cli   Of. I remarked that whenever the crops were fully exposed to the influence of the sea breeze, especially on the sides of the hill sloping down to the shore, (facing north, northwest, and northeast) they were altogether free from any appearance of the disease. An interesting question may arise from this, as to what the effect of a saline atmosphere may be in preventing the attacks of the fungus. Ambulator. I s it not probable that one of the causes of the disease arose from the poisonous matter belonging to the fungus mould being rapidly thrown back into the plant in the cold weather in the early part of June, following, a sit did rapidly, the excessive heat of a few days previous ?a? In the 12th,13th, and 14th of June the thermometer, in the shade, marked 770; in the sun, 950; and on the 18th it was as low as 470; the average temperature being 690 on the first three days, with bright sunshine, and no more than 570 on the 18th and 19th, with cloudy weather. All the <a name="potatoes830"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> examined present a similar appearance, and first begin to show symptoms of disease where the tube r is attached to the fibre; it thence gradually appears round the rim, through a vein, whence it rapidly spreads through the whole <a name="potato627"><mark>potato</mark></a>. W. W. Chi Lders. Of. Helli   Of. In my attention being first drawn to this disease, I took up a few <a name="potatoes831"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which were just beginning to spot, and I must add, that in some places the black ness in the stem had just commenced; these looked, to all appearance, perfectly sound, but having been compelled to sort them over, (within a fortnight of their removal from the ground) about 10 per cent. were found delayed, with the usual symptoms. I have examined several of the neighboring fields, and the conclusion I have come to is, that, with regard to sorts, those of the gross est habit, and with regard to land, that which is richest and oldest tilled, are the most unfortunate under the attacks of this pest. In very poor soils, the disease would appear to merge itself finally into a sort of designation; the stems which on gross soils become pulp y, on weak and poor upland soils appear to wither and dry up.

My chief reason for hoping that itisinot identiealcid127) with the English disease 'is, that it could not have been caused in this county by cold and wet, having first appeared about a week ago, after a fortnight of dry and bright weather. As for as I can learn, it was first observed on the evening of the 8th instant, which was a very home day, succeeding a slight hoar frost. [he fear the disease is our English murrainWM. R. Meads. Of Nsale. From the Dark Lane Express. I am convinced the cold and rainy weather experienced in July s the cause. Long before the haul m showed any observe able sign of disease, the root was spotted. In examination, I found the stems damaged just below the surface of the soil, to that part attached to the old set. As the supply of sap was thus cut off, the tops soon afterwards began to show the effect some died down very rapidly, others threw out fresh roots, that prolonged the existence of the stems, which still retain a greenish hue. Some <a name="potatoes834"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> taken up in July for family use were so black that they were laid aside; the crown end was generally the worst. I h have since frequently examined these <a name="potatoes835"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and from their present appearance I conceive that exposure to the atmosphere will stay the disease from sinking intothe <a name="potatoes836"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. These <a name="potatoes837"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> soon became pitted, the diseased parts fell in, and became dry and hard, and now feel off with the skin, showing a sound and uninjured remnant beneath. This circumstance, I think, proves excess of moisture, aided by the cold state of the atmosphere, which prevented the usual excavations, to' e: the cause of the disease. S. C. ;BURROWS.

The <a name="potatoes838"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> exposed to the air in any part are painted more or less by the rot on their surface those only one inch under ground are perfectly safe. The haul m of all is withered, except in certain spots under trees, and there it is still erect, and the end leaves still green, although it generally withers first in those spots in ordinary seasons. I should here observe that my garden is on the north base of a hill 600 feet high; that it is so much shaded by trees as to have, in the height of summer, not much sun, and in the early spring the sun scarcely touches it, rising very little above the hill. Met, at such seasons, when my neighbors on more open spots (even on the south side of the hill) complain of sharp night frosts, r my garden scarcely, if at all, suffers ; and my crops are generally as good and very nearly as forward as theirs. Sic. No. 140. 571 From, these premises, I come to the conclusion that the cause of the mischief to the <a name="potatoes839"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is the cold, and nothing but the cold, which we hadincid127) t ly, after great heats. The <a name="potato628"><mark>potato</mark></a> (a native of Phil i) is always sensitive of cold the slightest frost in spring cutting off all above ground; and I conclude that when the tube r is in a state of rapid growth during the heats of July, a suddenajndgreat diminution of temperature, without amounting actually to frost, is enough to damage its surface. We see the effect here, in the corruption of such tubes as have grown in contact -with the outward air, as well as in the general withering of the ha ulm, while that which is protected by trees overhanging is preserved, and there seems to be hardly a reasonable doubt that the cold alone is the cause. Of course, in districts exposed to the colds, as <a name="potato629"><mark>potato</mark></a> grounds usually are, the effect will be much more severe; and the failures of the crop in Belgium, (a flat, open country) about which there has been so much learned speculation, seem to fall in with the theory. I find that my neighbors who have suffered most plant as shallow as possible.

To the Editor of the Gloucestershire Chroniclethe disease apparently attacks the plant in the fibrillated of the roots, and where the root passes into the tube r or solid bulb of the <a name="potato630"><mark>potato</mark></a>. An interruption having taken place between the supply and demand of the living plant, by the decay of the root and its fibrillated, its stalk quickly drops and Withers, in proportion to the progress of the malady. The thin outer coat of the <a name="potato631"><mark>potato</mark></a> may now be perceived roughened and thickened in one or more patches ; and these, when cut through, show that the internal structure of the tube r is altered the change commencing immediately beneath the cut ice or outer skin ; the pulp is changed to a rusty brown color, like a bruised apple, in thickness varying with the intensity and duration of the disease; eventually the structure of the whole <a name="potato632"><mark>potato</mark></a> is converted into a reddish brown, half rotten looking mass. When slices of the altered structure were examined through a microscope, many of the cells containing the marina or starch were thickened, enlarged, and emptied apparently of their contents, the appearance differing in many respects from the natural formation of the healthy tube r. Were and there could be seen small transparent g lobules: some of them, apparently becoming more opaque, and a few surrounded with opaque reddish colored fibres, might be considered to belong to some species of minute fungus perhaps the to rule, a species of which is found in the products of fermented liquors. This disease, whether produced by parasitic hung i, or by change of structure, induced by atmospheric :vicissitudes, rapidly destroys the <a name="potato633"><mark>potato</mark></a> affected with it, rendering it at once innutritious and unwholesomethefarina of the pulp being converted into sugar and the diseased fungoidlooking substance Having, as far as opportunity mundi leisure permitted, attempted to described the disease, I will now suggest the remedy: Chloride of lime, or chlorinatedlime, is a well known disinfecting and antiputiescent agent; :it will i prevent insects and parasitic hung i attacking <a name="seeds66"><mark>seeds</mark></a> and plants ; this remedy is a safe one, and free from poisonous effects, not being injurious to vegetable growth when properly diluted and judiciously applied. Therefore, to this active agent would I advise all those who wish either to prevent the ravages of the disease, or to check it before thoroughly developed in the plant, to have immediate recourse. The mode of applying it may be as follow six one ounce of the powder of chloride lime with a gallon of water, and well sprinkle the solution over the rows of the <a name="potato634"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops. I would also recommend the same solution to be sprinkled over the recently dug <a name="potatoes841"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, but they must afterwards be dried before laying them up in store. Very small portion of the powdered chloride lime might be mixed with the soup or gravel laid over the floor of the <a name="potato635"><mark>potato</mark></a> bury or cellar.

To the Editor of the Dark Lane Expressthe manufacture of marina by the farmers has been recommended at present only as a C" denied resort" but I would wish to show that it isa measure which should be adopted by all farmers who grow <a name="potatoes842"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> not alone as a protection from the rot of the present year, but from the loss which always ensues from storing large quantities. In addition to the general amount of loss by decay, another deteriorationtakes place, not generally known namely, loss by vegetation. From the moment that that commences in the <a name="potato639"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the quantity of nutrition matter decline; so much so, that I have found the produce of a given quantity of <a name="potatoes843"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, from the same crop, vary from 15 to 20 per cent. within a month in spring; in fact, the <a name="potato640"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which, if manufactured during winter, will yield one fifth of pure marina, (possessing every property of the best arrow root) will not give more than a tenth if held over till May or June; and the loss is equal to the farmer, whether he consumes or sells, for, in proportion as the vegetation proceeds, weight diminishes. It must be evident, therefore, that inasmuch as the true nutriment of the <a name="potato641"><mark>potato</mark></a> exists in the farinaceous particles, their preservation at the period they are most abundant should be the object of the farmer; the more particularly, as, thus preserved, marina becomes food for all classes of animals. For man, its benefits are most varied. Used, in the proportion of a fifth or fourth, with wheat en flour, it produces a much better and more wholesome bread than from wheat alone. For pas try, in the same or greater pro
573portions, it is infinitely preferable; and in all cases where flour is used forculinary purposes, it is in every way better and more nutritions. When once properly dried, it possesses the invaluable property of absolute resistance to damp or mould; and it has been proved that sea biscuit made in the proportions named, returned, after a voyage of three years in the tropics, perfectly free from weevil. In short, for household use it possesses the most singular advantages, (amongst others, being really a better starch than wheat en) and is sold now in large quantities, under the designation of patent so ruble starch For cattle (particularly for rearing calves) its value is also very great and, mixed with any coarse stuffs, it gives the most abundant advantages. In addition, the pulp or fibre of the <a name="potato642"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which should also be saved and dried as well as the marina, is an admirable food for pigs; resembling more, in its effects, barley feeding than anything else, and producing a very white meat, with a transparent fat. But, before I conclude what, as I fear, is already too long a letter, I must add, that even the smallest <a name="potato643"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the crop will yield its quota of marina, while, if sold, it brings but a third, perhaps, in price; and thus another advantage accrues, by enabling all inferior sized <a name="potatoes844"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be manufactured, while only the best ones are kept for household use. I am, sir, your most obedient servant, Jasper W. Rogers. Dubli   N, Kept. 26. From the Dark Lane Express, September 22. The <a name="potato644"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Crop. At a meeting of the Raleigh Farmers' Club, on Friday, September 13,the lamentable failure of the <a name="potato645"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop formed the principal subject of discussion. In the hope of allaying the alarm which prevails in the neighborhood respecting the use of <a name="potatoes845"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that have become partially injured, and also of suggesting a method by which a large amount of wholesome food may be saved from such as would otherwise be thrown away or given to pigs, it was resolved that a statement should be circulated, expressing the opinions of the club on these subjects. I. It appears to be certain, that the failure is entirely owing to the season having been unsuited to fully perfecting the tubes of most of the varieties of the <a name="potato646"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I I . Wherever the leaves and stems are dead, it is advisable to dig up the crop as speedily as possible, and to select the best tubes (to be kept apart from the rest) for seed <a name="potatoes846"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It is probable there will be a great scarcity, when sets will be wanted, unless precautions are pretty generally adopted for saving the best 11. The <a name="potatoes847"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> thus separated for sets should be preserved with more care than usual. They should be kept as dry as possible, and examined at intervals to see whether any of them are beginning to decay, and all such should be immediately removed 1. The spotted and delayed <a name="potatoes848"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be carefully picked out from among such as are to be preserved in store for winter and spring use. V. As there is great danger from a single decaying <a name="potato647"><mark>potato</mark></a> being left in contact with others in the same heap, lest it should tend to rot all around it574
care must be taken to s tack the store <a name="potatoes849"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in layers, with i sand ortdryearth between them, and so that each <a name="potato648"><mark>potato</mark></a> may be prevented: from touch, ing its neighbors. A trench might be advantageously dug around the storeandiif the whole were thatched, it would tend to keep them very dry. It will be advisable to delay the operation of clamping as long as possible, to allow the <a name="potatoes850"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to dry the more thoroughly. Of . The progress of decay in the spotted <a name="potatoes851"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be stopped (at least for some time) by exposing them in dry situations to the light, but their decay will proceed if they are placed in the dark, or on moist ground. 1. If the decaying parts are pared off, or cut out, the rest of the <a name="potato649"><mark>potato</mark></a> is perfectly wholesome. Any idle rumors have prevailed to the contrary, which are unworthy of credit. I I L. If the decaying <a name="potatoes852"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have not passed to a state of putrid it y, they may be safely given to pigs; but they would be improved :by beiagscalded, with the addition of a little salt. I X. It seems to be a presidential arrangement that, as yet, the really nutrition portion of the <a name="potato650"><mark>potato</mark></a> is very little injured, even in those tubes which have become partially delayed, and appear to be wholly unfit for food. The nutritions portion of the <a name="potato651"><mark>potato</mark></a> consists of delicate, white grains of starch like matter, which are enclosed in little cells. When the cells are broken, the grains fall out, and, collecting together, form a beautifully white flour. It is very easy to separate this flour from the rest of the substance of the <a name="potato652"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and if a few persons in different villages would undertake to make the method generally known among the poor, a vast amount of wholesome food may yet be secured to them, which otherwise they will suffer to perish. From an experiment that has been tried during the past week, it appears that where 12 lbs. of flour can be extracted from a bushel of sound <a name="potatoes853"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, 8 I is. can be procured from such as have become so far delayed as to be useless as an article of food. X. To obtain the flour separate from the decaying cells, the <a name="potato653"><mark>potato</mark></a> should be first very thoroughly washed so that not a particle of dirt remains upon them. They should then be finely grated with a bread greater into a tub of water, and. the pulp well stirred about to separate the particles of starch, as much as, possible, from. their cells. The whole should then be left to settle, and the heavier particles of starch will soon fall to the bottom, while the lighter skin and cells will continue floating in the water, and v may be poured off with it. The mass of flour formed by the settling of the particles should be washed two or three times more, by pouring water upon it and stirring; it about, and again i leaving it to settle as before. After the flour is considered to be sufficiently washed, it must be spread upon a cloth placed on a board in the sun, or in a warm room, to dry, or it may be dried in the oven after the bread has been removed. It may then be kept for any length of time, and, when wanted, used like wheat flour for making puddings, &c. This process will be sufficient for common purposes; but a more perfect method may be described, by which the <a name="potato654"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour can be procured in its purest state, in which it is frequently sold for arrow root, and by a variety of other names, as a delicate food for weak digestions, for children, and for the sick. Of . The more perfect process for obtaining the flour in the form of< British arrow root" is as follows 1. Thoroughly wash the <a name="potatoes854"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> i Feel away the skin, without cutting off much. a. 5753. Rate the peeled <a name="potatoes855"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> finely into: a pp 4. Place the pulp on a ha it si eve, pour water over it, stirring: it about well, till the: water ceases to pass through with a milky iappearanceS5. The pulp left :o the si eve may be thrown away, and the milky Later put aside to settle 6. When the particles ;of starch have all settled, the water should be poured off, and fresh water: added the whole stirred up afresh and allowed to settle again, .7. These washings may be repeated four or five times, when the starch will have assumed the character of arrow root, and will have become white as snow, while the water will now be perfectly clear 8. The prepared flour must be thoroughly dried, and may be kept for any length of time in jars or cases. Of I . When a dish of <a name="potatoes856"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is about to be obtained from the inside parts of such as are only partially delayed, instead of peeling them the delayed parts may be grated, and whatever starch can be extracted from these parts might be added to the boiled <a name="potatoes857"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Thus very little will be lost of the whole amount of nourishment which the <a name="potatoes858"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> would have contained if they had been quite sound. In many cases it may be more convenient to keep: s ch gratings for three or four days, till enough has been collected to make it better; worth while to complete the, process. Sxi I I. In times of scarcity, it may be useful for persons to be made aware of the fact that excellent starch like arrow root may be procured from certain wild plants. In the I s le of Sort land, some of the poor are in the habit of preparing it from the tubes of the plant commonly called lords and ladies" (a rum maculatum) The tubes are well washed and grated, and the pulp treated like that of the <a name="potato655"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The process gets rid of an acrid juice with which the fresh tube r a bounds. This sort of arrow root is sold in the neighborhood of Key mouth for about 8d. the pound. Ixi V. It was suggested that local companies or societies might be formed to buy up the decaying <a name="potatoes859"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and to employ some of the poor to prepare the starch, which could be sold at -little or no loss. It is the practice in Scotland, when the store <a name="potatoes860"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are found to be frozen, to: extract the starch from them in the manner described. From the Bristol Mercury, September 20. The <a name="potato656"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. The following correspondence has just taken place between Word' Potman, President of the Royal Agricultural Society, and William: Vera path, e squire, the eminent analytical chemist of this city, in reference to seed <a name="potatoes861"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for 1846. His lordship, in 1 a subsequent letter, requests that the correspondence may be made public, and it has been handed to us by for, Vera path for that purpose. The subject is of vital importance, and is worthy of the deepest attention" Bryanston, September 13, 1845," Of  R: I observe in :the newspapers that you have directed your attention to the <a name="potato657"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, and have advised as to the use of the starch, &c. Is am specially you rid, during this year of my holding the office of President of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, to promote inquiry and 576 to notify observations on subjects relative to the produce of the soil, I trouble you with this letter, and ask if any method has occurred to you by which the <a name="potato658"><mark>potato</mark></a> may be preserved for the planting of 1846 ?a? I have fond that <a name="potatoes862"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> apparently sound and free from the disease, though in a field or garden which has been partially diseased, have, after being stored away, shown signs of the disease, and have rotted off; and I fear that the greatest quantity of the <a name="potatoes863"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will thus perish, and so continue the distress of the poor into another season. I have directed some <a name="potatoes864"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be stored in s lacked lime, in the hope that it may preserve them, but have, of course, yet had no time to judge of the effect. I therefore ask for your opinion, as one of our most eminent chemists, upon this point, and would, ask leave to make known your reply, if you are able to offer an opinion sufficiently explicit to be useful remain your obedient servant' Portman' Of. Of Erapath, Esq l Bri Stol, September 17, 1845." Of Lord: In reply to your letter of the 13th instant, I must say that I do not think it would be either safe or prudent to depend upon the infected <a name="potatoes865"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the present season as seed for the next year; as, in all instances, I have found the diseased parts to extend when the <a name="potatoes866"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are kept in a damp situation. I should therefore expect that if any diseased seed was kept so dry as not to rot before setting time, yet, upon being planted and left in the damp soil, the rotating process would then begin, and the hopes of the husband man be disappointed. I have no doubt that some <a name="potatoes867"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, apparently sound, have (as stated by your lordship) been found to be affected after st owing away; but I do not consider this to have been an originationof it, but merely that which was unnoticed when dug has become apparent after storing. When a <a name="potato659"><mark>potato</mark></a> is first affected, the diseased parts are scarcely visible; but, upon keeping it in a dry place, the spots soon become dark, and consequently more apparent, but the spots do not extend ; if, however, the tube r has been kept in a damp place, the spots not only extend rapidly over the surface, but penetrate into the interior, and in a short time it will be completely rotten. As far as the s lacked lime, which you have used in your <a name="potato660"><mark>potato</mark></a> stores, has a tendency to prevent the tubes from touching each other, or, by its power of absorbing water, of keeping them dry, it will answer a good end ; but it must not be expected to have any chemical effect upon the diseased parts or their juices. Anything which, like dry sawdust or sand, would prevent contact, would prevent the propagation from one tube r to another; and any substance capable of absorbing the moisture of the air in which the <a name="potato661"><mark>potato</mark></a> is stored, would prevent the extension of the disease in each diseased root. Our best microscopists and cryptogamists are divided in opinion as to whether the cause of the calamity is a fungus or not. After all the examination I have given to the subject, and a careful review of all the evidence brought before me on the two sides, I believe that it is; and I am daily confirmed in the opinion originally expressed, that the only advantageous way of treating the diseased <a name="potatoes868"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is to obtain from them, by grasping and washing, the starch which they contain, by which process all their nutriment can be retained; and if it is well dried, it will keep for any. 577 length of time. The operations can be performed in the cottage or manufactory alike, as no apparatus beyond a tin ras p, (a nut meg greater) a tub, and clean water, are required; and I have ascertained that however far the disease might have extended, even if the root is rotten, yet the starch can be separated, and in a state fit to be eaten, if it shall be well washed, as all the bad parts come away with the water, while the great weight of the starch carries it to the bottom of the vessel. If it is required that the face la should have all the qualities of the best foreign arrow root, it is dry necessary to wash it last in water containing a little chlorine, when: it has unrivalledcolor and quality; and this I can speak of practically, having made many tons of the article." I will only add, that an opinion has been circulated that the disease is owing to the introduction of gun no as a manure; this I feel no hesitation in contradicting, as I have seen it in situations where no gun no has been used, and where every other variety of manure has been resorted to. S 1 am your lordships most obedient servant, Swi Lli   Of Herapath." To Lord Portman, President of the Agricultural Societyfrom the Dark Lane Express, Kept. 29. Stori Of And Preservi Of <a name="potatoes869"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>, To the Editor of the Peter Flyingpastsir: As the hope of saving the important <a name="potato662"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop precludes waiting the result of our experiments, I have again to offer suggestions for others also to consider, correct, or improve. The failure of the last, where the added moisture counteracted the benefit f the salts, has been a guide to my present experiments, which have not yet time to test their efficacy. It must, however, have fallen under the observation of others, that, of two parcels of the same <a name="potatoes870"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, whilst one, heaped together, will put rely, the other, spread out on a dry floor, will make no progress in decay, but rather lose their offensive smell. Hence, without staying at present to discuss the cause of the rot, drying appears to be one of the read i est means of checking it; and, accordingly, kill and oven drying have been recommended, both of which appear to me quite inadequate to the great quantity of the subject, with its large proportion of juice. Before suggesting another method, let me ask whether others have also observed three varieties of the rot, either different degrees or belonging to different kinds of <a name="potato663"><mark>potato</mark></a> ?1. The tube r not much dis colored inside or out, but having a pungent odor when cut, like putrid horse ravish, and decaying quickly; this chiefly in white <a name="potatoes871"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 2. Grown spots or patches more or less throughout the tube r, with little offensive smell, and much slower in progress than the first; this chiefly in red <a name="potatoes872"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 3. Coating limited to the compact outside layer, the inner side of which is often marked by a distinct brown outline, the heart remaining sound and sweet; this only in reds. This division is not taken as the basis of the classification below, being drawn from local and limited observation ; but, if found coincident with the appearances in other places, may assist in the selection 37 578 a. Dr. Kindly, (gardeners' Chronicle, August 30,) whilst recommendingkilndrying to such as have opportunity, seems to feel its inadequacy generally, and suggests pitting in dry earth, so as to prevent contact and communication by perspiration. But can we not, by using fire dried earth, which will absorb much moisture from the <a name="potato664"><mark>potato</mark></a>, effect the double purpose of drying and separation ?a? With this view, the <a name="potatoes873"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be divided into three classes or conditions 1. Apparently sound: to be pitted in fire dried earth entire 2. I infected, but not hopelessly decaying , to be cut and pitted as the first with or without salt 3. Outre scent, unfit for use or keeping: to be ground into starch, without delay. A brief explanation of each of these three methods may be sufficient for our present purpose 1. Apparently sound. However impracticable it may be to find oven or kill room for our <a name="potato665"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, there is no great difficulty in fire drying any requisite quantity of earth; which may be done in heaps, in the field, in some of the methods practised for clay or mary burning, only using small come, "b rise" or cinders; as the ashes of wood, or soot from coal, might excite vegetative action, and thus prevent the good keeping of the <a name="potatoes874"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Air dried earth contains much moisture, which may be driven off by a heat a little above boiling water, leaving the earth very greedy for damp, which it will suck from the air, or from any juice substance in contact with it; but if made red hot, it loses much of this attraction for moisture, and should therefore be rather dried than burnt. The sooner it is pitted with the <a name="potatoes875"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, after cooling, the better, that it may have the less time to draw moisture from the air. It should, however, be quite cold, because <a name="potatoes876"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> spread out in the sun are said to rot quickly. There should be earth enough to fill in between the <a name="potatoes877"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and keep them in separate layers and it is almost superfluous to add that they should be pitted in very dry ground, and covered from the rain. The poorer the earth in hum us the less smell it will acquire in fire drying; but sandy soil is very little absorbent. 2. Slightly infected. These may be cut in halves from stem to nose when such as appear past hope may be turned over to the third class, for starch. The less damaged may be pitted, with the dried earth, in separate pits from the sound ones ; when the earth in contact with the cut sides will suck out the diseased sap. It is a question whether the earth for these might not be mixed with some salt, (say one-sixth or one-eighth) which would not only help to suck out the sap, but would i more or less enter the substance of the <a name="potato666"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and probably contribute to its preservation. The salt might be tried in a pit or two only, at first; and extended in its use, afterward, if found to answer best, as the <a name="potatoes878"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> come to be taken out for sale or consumption. These two methods can be regarded only as experimental, with a view to preserve the <a name="potatoes879"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> at the least loss and expense. The following is more costly and wasteful, but certain :3. Those which are far gone, even half rotten and stinking, will still make good sweet potato starch, (see note) which will keep for years, and, with one third flour, make excellent bread, puddings, or pas try. For this purpose nothing more is required (as already stated in the pay. 579 pers) than a greater, a fine hair si eve, two or three pans, trays, or tubs, and plenty of clean water. The <a name="potatoes880"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> must be thoroughly washed, the very rotten parts cut out, and the clean part grated into the si eve. Were it must be continually stirred about, and watered with a watering po e, to wash the starch through the si eve, into a pan or tray, to settle. While the starch is settling, the pulp remaining in the si eve may be pressed in a cider press or otherwise, and, if well squeezed, will keep a few weeks, sprinkled with salt and vinegar. It may be boiled for pig feeding and as vinegar is the best preservation of vegetable substances, palliated the action of vegetable poisons, and has a particular tendency to fatten pigs, it is a very desirable addition. There, however, vinegar is wanting, other acids may answer, as the m uratic or sulphuric, in very small quantities perhaps even the apple up mice; or the <a name="potato667"><mark>potato</mark></a> pulp itself will often turns our by standing open in cold water twenty-four to thirty-six hours. When the starch is settled, the best and whites t will be at the bottom, covered with particles of feel and dis colored fibre; and a little management is necessary in washing off the upper part, from vessel to vessel, and letting it settle repeatedly, to get as much of the clean white as possible from the colored. The last colored residue may be thrown back with the pulp. After several washings, the water may be poured away, and the white starch laid out on a cloth, upon some bricks or dry earth, to absorb the moisture, and then very gradually dried. This is, however, a tiresome process, ill suited to the economy of a farm the grating is slow, the repeated washings tedious, and the drying much in the way. It would be better done at the Union Workhouses, where the cleaned <a name="potatoes881"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> could be ground in a mill, figured and described in Parnells Applied Chemistry, vol. ii. 133; and Tres Dictionary of Arts, &up. 1166. This mill is not costly, and will grate two or three tons in twelve hours. There must be, of course, several sieges and watering pots, and a drying room is easily contrived in such an establishment. Hours, &c. Pri Deaux. Note n the microscopic examination of a great number of <a name="potatoes882"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I have never found the starch damaged; it was either perfect and color less, even when the cells and fibrous matter were quite brown, or if affected a tall, it was completely dissolved, leaving the cells empty. From the Right on Gazette. Various causes of the disease have been assigned, one ascribing it to the wet rot; but we cannot go away from our opinion, that it is in a great measure owing to the luxuriant e of growth, induced by warm rains falling on the dry land after planting, and followed in June and July by hot, sunny weather, as it must be admitted that the ground has never been thoroughly saturated during the summer, although we have bad much shower y weather. The cause is ascribed by some to the tubes of last year having been allowed to get over ripe before they were dug up, and consequently unfit for planting. There is no doubt that over ripe plants are more subject, in their growth, to the curl than the unripe ones; but if that were the cause of the general rot we have amongst them this year, both on the 580 continent and in England, it is strange that the unaccountable disease has not shown itself generally before; for it is usual for farmers, in the south of England especially, to let their <a name="potatoes883"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> stand until the haul m dies before they take them up. The present summer is acknowledged not to have been so wet as the summer of 1843; and if so, why have we not seen the disease either in that year or in some former wet summer, when our <a name="potatoes884"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have perished in places from the wet rot, but without showing the extraordinary symptoms and general decay of this year? It no doubt arises from natural causes connected with the weather, and we hope never again to see so serious a calamity, in the failure of this useful root, From the Dark Lane Express. <a name="potatoes885"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Air John Maxwell Tilden has addressed the following communication to the editor of the Gardeners' Chronicle: " Having been particular in my examination of the plant, from the first appearance of the spot on the leaf, which attracted my attention in less than a week after its appearance, I feel confident that your explanation is quite correct, namely, that it is atmospheric al and not terrestrial; or, in other words, it is caused by the want of due ventilation, evaporation being stopped by the damp and cloudy weather of July and August. Previously the plants grew with almost unexampledrapidity and luxuriant e, so that the disease is more like apoplexy than anything else. I found that when the disease first showed itself on the leaf, thetlbers were sound to all appearance, but, when dug up for some time, some showed the plague spot; but if the <a name="potatoes886"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were forward enough to be dug up before the disease appeared on the leaf, they were still sound. The kinds 1 have examined are an early kidney, and an early round <a name="potato668"><mark>potato</mark></a>, having no particular name, and both having been grown on the spot for twelve years and of the later sorts the Each and the Red Rough are the only two I grow. These are but little affected, yet I find that every hill has one or more bad tubes. The diseased tubes of the early sorts are now shooting out in the ground where there is a sound eye in the root, and I have this day seen some with nearly half the tube r delayed, and from the other a shoot of two inches long, looking fresh and healthy. This has suggested to me the plan of endeavoring to save seed for next year by autumn planting; and I mean to proceed thus : Have all dug up as soon as I can, take out the sound ones, and leave those partially diseased on the ground to green, if they will, for about a week or ten days, and then to plant them as for a crop. Should they rot, nothing will be lost; for I consider they are more likely to rot above ground, and there will be time enough to plant again if seed can be procured; but I am convinced they will grow, as the very early sprouting of the diseased tube the healthy ones not having made the least shoot) shows that nature is taking her own course to preserve the plant. I shall not hesitate to plant in the same ground, but without fresh manure, as I do not wish to urge vegetation too fast, as I am quite convinced that the disease is only infectious by contact, and that it is not a tall in the ground, but solely caused by the absence of sun, and excess of cold and damp. 581* From the Dark Lane Express. After having read the many opinions given in your excellent journal, as to the malady and cure thereof, I have carefully watched the [potato] disease, and have come to the conclusion that the continued wet, without sun, is the whole and sole cause. I have also proved, beyond a doubt, that had we mown the haul m on its first visible appearance, we should have stopped the disease extending itself to the <a name="potato669"><mark>potato</mark></a>; that we should perhaps by that means have had our <a name="potatoes887"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> small and sound, instead of large and rotten. The above opinion I confirm, by having had worms in a field of wheat, and replaced the missing plants with <a name="potatoes888"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, after which the plant of wheat so improved as almost to produce a crop among the <a name="potatoes889"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; that in cutting the wheat about a month since, a quantity of the <a name="potato670"><mark>potato</mark></a> haul m was consequently cut or destroyed, and where that took place the plants have since been dry, and prove quite sound and good; since which I have had the whole of my <a name="potato671"><mark>potato</mark></a> haul m mown down, which should have been done a month sooner; but, " better late than never" therefore I concur with your correspondent as to their being benefited by being harrowed. A Kenti   Of Farmer. September 18, 1845. To the Editor of the Times :the real cause of the destructive changes at present taking place appears to be the unripe ness of the tube r, and the consequent imperfect ion of elaborate on of its juices. When examined with the microscope, the cells of the <a name="potato672"><mark>potato</mark></a> are found to be not more than half filled with starch cells, many of which are incomplete, the remaining portion of the cell being occupied by water. Hence the actual condition of the <a name="potato673"><mark>potato</mark></a> may be stated as follows: 1st, deficiency of starch; 2d, imperfect ion in the tissue of the cell walls; and, 3d, excess of water; to which may possibly be added, imperfectly elaborated starch. As a consequence of the imperfect ion of the tissue of the cell walls, and its state of maceration in a superabundance of water, it falls speedily into decay, the change beginning at the surface and proceeding inwards, and being indicated by a brown discoloration of the cells. The starch cells, which are at first unaffected, are soon enclosed in the delayed cellular tissue, and, becoming involved in the decay, are thereby destroyed. Taking this view of the state of the <a name="potato674"><mark>potato</mark></a>, two modes suggest themselves of preventing the loss which must necessarily result from the recurrence of the above described changes. The first is that recommended more than a week since in your journal by Mr. Vera path. viz: of separating the starch by reducing the <a name="potato675"><mark>potato</mark></a> to a state of pulp, and collecting the washed precipitate. When it is recollected that the starch em bodies the whole of thenutritive part of the <a name="potato676"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the importance of this plan will at once be perceived. But, practically, there exists a great obstacle to the prosecution of the plan in the inconvenience of employing it on a small scale. The second mode, that which I am now about to suggest, seems to me to be calculated to meet the ex agencies of the case, at the same time that it is free from the objection stated above : it is to dry the <a name="potatoes890"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in an oven or kill at a moderate temperature, and thus drive off the excess of water which they contain, the water being a chief agent in the decomposing process. In preparing the <a name="potato677"><mark>potato</mark></a> for table the dis colored parts should, of course 582 be cut away; the <a name="potatoes891"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be boiled in two waters, and salt should be mingled with both. I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant, Erasmus Of Lson, F. R. S. Upper Charlotte Of, Sitz roy square, Kept. 23. To the Editor of the Dublin Evening Most 1 am indebted to a gentleman who resides in the neighborhood of Clontarf for the result of an experiment which he tried with perfect success. About three weeks ago, the disease having reached the neighborhood ofClontarf, my informant became alarmed for the safety of his <a name="potato678"><mark>potato</mark></a> gardens, and having seen in the Evening Most that the disease had its origin in the stalk, he resolved on removing the cause of communication to the <a name="potato679"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and without delay employed a great number of hands, and pulled up every stalk in the field. He is now digging out the <a name="potatoes892"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and never had finer in his life. The stalk cannot, at this late period of the season, yield furtherripening sustenance to the <a name="potato680"><mark>potato</mark></a>; it might communicate the disease, and ought, on the latter account alone, to be removed. Not by the scythe, for the fibres would, as before, continue attached to the <a name="potato681"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and as much of the stem as would remain above the surface might be as pernicious as the entire stalk. The s talks ought to be, by the hand, one by one, carefully pulled up and removed from the field, lest, by heating in heaps in the first process of decomposition, the heat and effluvia might communicate with the <a name="potato682"><mark>potato</mark></a> near the surface, and perhaps diffuse the disease complained of, or some other equally destructive. The persons employed in the operation should be directed to place a foot each side of the stalk, by the compression of which it will come up freely, without disturbing the <a name="potato683"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the soil, in which it lies imbedded. W. From the Dark Lane Express. Peeblesshi Refrom the general nature of the disease, there can be no doubt whatever but that it is produced from some general cause; and that, without hesitation, we attribute to the cold, wet, un genial season. He find, in a field where a large proportion of the <a name="potatoes893"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were earthed up with more than ordinary care, being some inches deeper in the furrow than the tubes were planted, which had the effect of preventing any excessive moisture remaining in the drills, that when the <a name="potatoes894"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were lifted, so far as the un assisted eye could discover, they were perfectly free of any taint whatever, while in the other portion of the field, which had been less attended to, a large proportion of them was found diseased. We also find, by taking a <a name="potato684"><mark>potato</mark></a> of the sound est description, and allowing it to remain for two or three days amongst earth over saturated with water, that the same disease is produced as that which is now so prevalent all over Scotland. A single drill in the field alluded to was planted with <a name="potatoes895"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised from the apple three or four years ago, by a knight of the scuttle, on the banks of the It trick, which were found, upon examination at lifting time, to be much more diseased than any of the other kinds we had planted. And others, too, we find from inquiry, who had tried the new varieties, have. 583 met with a similar disappointment. In fact, until such time as we began to raise new varieties from the seed apples, such a thing as failure or disease was never once heard of; and to the result of this experiment we in no small degree attribute the ;deter i oration of the late <a name="potatoes896"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Of Fethe disease is still increasing; and great quantities, which seemed quite free from disease when lifted, have become quite mould y and rotten. We regret we have been so soon able to report that several modes, adopted with a view of stopping the malady, have proved fruitless. Some were pitted very thinly, and ventilated with drain times. The <a name="potatoes897"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being quite dry when put in, have been found on the decline. Others that were sprinkled over with lime, have been found even worse than some that have been kept in a dry, airy place, without being limed; while those left in the ground, and covered with an additional quantity of earth, intended to keep them all winter in the soil, are found with the rot still alarming ly increasing. The only remedy to prevent the disease from further increase in the tubes already affected, is, we are convinced, to keep them dry. For this purpose, we have seen some laid for some time above and over, and then stored by in a dry, airy place. When so treated, the disease, if increasing, goes on then very slowly. Any different opinions are prevailing as to the nature and cause of this disease ; but it seems to some very glaring ly to be the same dreadful epidemic that lately raged in spring the same visitor, only come at another season. In consequence of the frequency of the disease in spring, the <a name="potatoes898"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have become so weakened, that now, as soon as ripe, the disease appears; as it has been observed that in late situations it is longer in making its appearance than in early soils and situations. The vital juice of the <a name="potato685"><mark>potato</mark></a> seems lost; and this useful esch lent will, it is the opinion of many, soon be unknown in our isle. A similar disease has, by some farmers here, been discovered among the turn is. Roxburghshi Rethat sort de nominated the "old black <a name="potato686"><mark>potato</mark></a>" is universally the most affected, and seems to be threatened with extermination. They, however, are not now generally grown. Next in point of being affected are the blues" and " buffs." An endless variety of other sorts is grown in the county, the names of which often vary in different parts and these are all less affected than the three sorts above named. The soils in which I have observed the disease to prevail to a greater extent, area light, turf y soil, upon a moor land bottom, and a thin, adhesive clay, upon an imperious stratum of till. This disease, like everything else, will have its proper cause if it cap be ascertained ; and I am convinced that it has arisen from circumstances that can only again occur in such a season as the past. During almost the whole time that the young <a name="potato687"><mark>potato</mark></a> was swelling into size and advancing into ripe ness, the quantity of wet in the ground, and the absence of sunshine, were peculiar; and these operating upon the <a name="potato688"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant, in the tender stage of its growth, I am convinced, are the causes of the disease by which it has been affected. I am led to this conviction from the following circumstances: 1st. In narrowly watching the taking up of <a name="potatoes899"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grown in a dry, deep loam, upon a sandy sub soil, I observed that those which were placed in a horizontal circle round the stem, and near the surface, or partially bare, were not affected at all. 2d. There the plants had occasionally penetrated deeper into the soil, and had produced one or more <a name="potatoes900"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> at the depth of eight or ten inches from the sur 584 face, these, at that depth, were invariably affected, while those placed nearer to the surface, and attached to the same stem, were free of disease. 3d. In thin, turf y soils, or thin, adhesive clay, upon an imperious stratum, the <a name="potatoes901"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were necessarily placed in a position where the wet was lodged between the soil and sub soil; and these I invariably found to be affected 4th. In these soils, <a name="potatoes902"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> lying close by the surface, or uncovered, were generally sound. From the London Freemans Journal. Fai Lure Of The <a name="potato689"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Crop. Once more we repeat our thrice confirmed conviction, that to alternate frost and rain must be attributed the failure of the <a name="potato690"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop; and, of the soundness of our conclusion, we obtain abundant proof from the columns of some of our contemporaries who differ in opinion with us. Thus we find For. W. R. Heads, of In sale, stating in the " Gardeners' Chronicle of Saturday last, that " the disease was first observed there on the evening of the 8th instant, which was a very hot day, succeeding a slight hoar frost n the "united Gardeners" and And Stewards' Journal" too, Mr. J. Marnes, of Icon Gardens, Did mouth, He von, says: I never felt the cold more severely in the month of March than I have done this season, during the last two weeks in July and two first weeks in August, usually most severe from half past three to half past four, a. m; and I certainly never previously observed the morning frosts so severe at that season of the year." He could cite a mass of evidence to the same effect, but that would now be of little use; let us rather turn our thoughts to suggesting remedies for the evil. In the " Dusseldorf Gazette" it is stated that a farmer, living on one of the estates of the Duke dAremberg, near Dusseldorf, has discovered a mode of preventing the rotating of <a name="potatoes903"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and even of curing it when it has already commenced. The method is very simple ; it consists in merely narrowing deeply the earth in which the tubes are planted so as to produce an evaporation, which will diminish the ferment at ion caused by humidity ;and, it is added that the plan has proved completely successful. Met it be tried wherever it is not too late. In our publication of Monday we quoted from the " Moniteur" a proposition for preserving from decay <a name="potatoes904"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> partially painted, by a sort of semi baking in an oven heated to 64 or 65 degrees of Beaume R, (about 180 of Fahrenheit) and the plan, like that of converting them into face la, or arrow root, may answer very well on a small scale. We would recommends living, st ringing, and hanging them. in kitchens and outhouses, as apples are managed in America, as a means of saving a part of the crop, in addition to the two first described methods. From the Gardeners' Chronicle, September 27. <a name="potato691"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Murrai N, It appears to me of some importance that naturalists should be careful to distinguish effect from cause. That minute and rapidly prop a. 585 gazing hung i have been observed on the affected <a name="potato692"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants, there is no reason to doubt. But when we know, from other facts, that such appear on plants after they are dead or diseased, and not when they are alive and healthy, we are justified in affirming that we are yet ignorant of the cause of the malady in question. To prevent its recurrence is what is desired and it is worth while to try every thing that may suggest itself from the consideration of any theory of the disease. It has not been ascertained whether it commences in the roots or in the leaves; and to determine this may be a difficult matter. If in the latter, it is to be feared that prevention is impossible. But it may commence in the tubes; therefore, without pretending to know the nature of the disease, or its cause, I will assume it to commence in the tubes, and offer advice accordingly. It is a well known fact that some insects reappear, after long intervals of time, in various members of the vegetable kingdom. It is not too much to affirm that some of these insects may be too minute for observation, and that this has given rise to many very improbable explanations of disease. That the most minute, as well as the largest insects, pass through several stages of existence, maybe safely assumed ; and also that one or more, or all of these, are passed in the earth. It is also known that insects deposit e their eggs either on or near to that which is the food of the worm; and, in some cases, the worm may take up a position for its change into chrysalis, so that the fly may not have to go far for its first meal. These facts induce me to advise that it should be a constant yearly practice to wash all <a name="potatoes905"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be used for sets, when they are taken up, and to clear the eyes by means of a brush. His operation being done when the tubes are taken up, the eyes not having pushed, are not injured by the brush, which they would be were the operation deferred. This will clear the tubes of all eggs and chrysalids, and may be of service, while it can do no harm. G. S. Mackenzi E. Rose Bank, Rosli   N, N. B. Everything tends to confirm the opinion I previously expressed, that a certain degree of ripe ness or maturity is necessary to feed the disease. Early sorts, from all reports, fall the first victims. Those upon dry, rich, well drained soils follow; and late sorts, on cold wet soils, on hill tops, or with north aspects, that tend to retard growth, seem for a time safe, and flatter the possessor they have escaped; but such no sooner reach the apparently required condition, than they may literally be said to wither in an hour. As a case in point: A ambulatory" in the last number, mentions being delighted with a field in full bloom. According to my view of the matter, <a name="potatoes906"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in bloom are safe from attack. In my last communication I mentioned some of my own that passed that stage safely, within a few feet of earlier sorts reduced to a mass of putrefaction. Ambulatory" will, no doubt, also decay; when I hope he will report progress. Salt, in culture, is no preventive. Was not the seacoast been worse affected generally ?the allot men t field I mentioned as the first seat of disease was in many parts manured with fish and sea weed, and washed by the spray. This, and the fact that the scourge first appeared on the coast to an alarming extent last year, sets the supposed influence of salt at rest. The parts affected last season were the first, by a month, to exhibit its fatal symptoms this year; a circumstance worth the attention of investigators. James Of  Ckle586 a. From the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, Act. 4, 1845. We do not as yet propose to return to an inquiry into the cause of the <a name="potato693"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in, but shall continue to confine ourselves to a consideration of what can best be done under existing circumstances. It is stated in a daily paper that M. Bouchardat, a French gentleman, has discovered a simple and economical process by which <a name="potatoes907"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> already attacked may be rendered fit for every domestic purpose. They are to be cut into thin slices, to be placed for thirty hours in water slightly acid elated with m uratic acid, then to be washed in pure water, and soaked 12 hours; after which they are to be dried in the sun, when they will again become white, with a healthy savor, and will keep any length of time. We have tried this operation, and doubt its value. It is not said how much m uratic acid is to be employed; but, if making water just acid is all that is intended, then we have followed the directions exactly. The result is, that the slices become very white by the time they are taken out of the steep ; but soon after they have been washed and exposed to the air to be dried, they change color, become livid, and have so un inviting an appearance that no English peasant would eat them unless pressed by actual famine. In a few days, however, the livid appearance goes off, and some of the slices become of a glittering white. This appearance is caused by the sides of the empty bleached cells in which the starch is laid, and not by the starch itself. Beneath is found a thin brown crust, and below the crust the <a name="potato694"><mark>potato</mark></a> seems to be exactly what it was before being plunged intothe steep, or to be as livid as the surface was after the exposure to air took place. While, however, some of the slices dry in this manner, others refuse to do so, although laid on a dry board in a room heated by an Arnotts stove; and then, in fact, although placed next a window, speedily put rely, and are attacked by mould i ness. We have, therefore, nothing to allege in favor of M. Bouchardats process. It appears from Galignanis Messenger, that, at the sitting of the French     institute of September 22, an immense number of communications on the disease of the <a name="potato695"><mark>potato</mark></a> are announced. Amongst them, one in the name of M. Clerget, the inventor of a new process for making <a name="potato696"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour, was particularly mentioned. This flour is stated to be equal to nearly one third of the entire mass namely, 20 percent. of the starch principle, and 10 per cent. of the br an or fibre. " His process is a scientific application of the old womans process of mixing <a name="potatoes908"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the making of bread. This is well known. The <a name="potatoes909"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are first boiled, then dried before the fire, and rubbed up with the wheat flour. M. Clerget produces the same result in the form of flour, emitting all the extraneous and useless portions of the vegetable, and providing for commerce, on a large and improved scale, a means of subsistence as cheap as it is wholesome." We do not profess to understand this account, but give it as we find it. Hereafter we shall learn from the Comptez Rendusswhat it really means *a* *a* *a* /a/ *a* *I t is of far more importance to conduct the operation carefully. Professorhenslow obtained nearly six pounds of flour from a bushel of very bad <a name="potatoes910"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; others, however, complain of not getting more than half the quantity. This, probably, depends entirely upon the care that is given to the grasping or crushing process. It is to be borne in mind that a <a name="potato697"><mark>potato</mark></a> is a mass of bladders, held together by organic force, and tolerably. 5 87 tough. It is in the inside of these bladders that the starch is deposited by nature. If we could separate such bladders from one another, and could place them in a row, we should find that from 150 to 200 would come within the compass of an inch. Now it is necessary to burst or cut into all these bladder, if all the flour which the <a name="potato698"><mark>potato</mark></a> contains is to be extracted. But no machinery yet thought of is capable of doing that. I f, indeed, the <a name="potatoes911"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> could be placed between mill stones, yet the latter could not beset fine enough to crush every one of these extremely small bladders. There must, therefore, be some loss of flour in the operation of crushing, prepare it as we may; and of course the loss is great in proportion to the carelessness with which the grating or washing is performed. One man will throw away a third of his flour in the midst of the pulp separated by the s trainer; another, half; some more, some less ; and it is to be remembered that no amount of washing will of itself separate the flour ; crushing, washing, pounding, &c, must be trusted to. It is therefore worth the consideration of the public whether the pulp should not be subjected, after the first washing, to some other operation, such as rubbing between two stones, or grinding, whereby the bladders which escaped the first process may be broken in the second. But our space is more than exhausted, and we must for the present break off, with a renewal of our exhortation to <a name="potato699"><mark>potato</mark></a> growers to attend to dryness, above all things: dry days for taking up; dry places for storing them dry soil for pitting ; and every other precaution by which the dryness of the crop can be best secured against the dangerous months of winter. Amongst the many statements which have been made respecting the origin of the <a name="potato700"><mark>potato</mark></a> blight, there is perhaps not one which has been more widely spread than that which attributes its development to the use of highly azotised manure. A few words on this subject will not be unacceptable to those of our readers who are in the habit of using gun no and similar strong manures. The effect which azotised manures exert on growing plants is tolerably well understood ; it increases the growth of the plant, facilitating the formation of organized matter, and, provided the other constituents of vegetable food are also present, it causes a strong, vigorous, and healthy growth. Now, the substances required by plants are nearly all contained in gun no ; and, therefore, if light and heat are not wanting in fact, if the weather is favorable to vegetation there is every reason to expect that plants thus manured will become strong and healthy; there is no theoretical reason which should lead us to fear unhealthy or irregular growth. There is no doubt that large and quickly grown plants are more liable to be attacked by any disease than such as are smaller; but the rapid growth of the former never causes disease it only renders them more liable to suffer when other causes have combined to produce disease; at the same time, this tendency is much diminished by the superior vital energy of the larger and more vigorous plants. It is, therefore, not to be expected that plants supplied with azotised manures should be more liable to the influence of such rot as that at present common amongst <a name="potatoes912"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, than those manured with farm yard dung, or not manured at all; and this indeed is the truth, for so far from those plants only being attacked which were strongly manured, it appears that those which received no kind of manure at all are quite as much subject to the disease as those more highly manured with gun no. 588 a. In both kinds, the sound <a name="potatoes913"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were always at the most remote point from the haul m, the bad ones being invariably just at the bottom of it; and the ends of the tubes, which seemed to be the first affected, in very many instances were also those ends attached to the haul m, while the crowns remained sound and good. This seems to me to be pretty conclusive evidence that the disease has been first generated in the haul m, and not in the tube r, and has been invariably transmitted downwards by the elaborated sap1Many of the reds were quite rotten, the inside having become a brown pulp y semifluid mass. But in the bread fruits, this was seldom the case, the disease being confined either to the haul m end or to a circle running all round the outer edge of the whole <a name="potato701"><mark>potato</mark></a>, or merely to a few isolated patches, so that in most tubes there will be a sound heart, which will afford food for pigs, if good for nothing else. Our geological stratum is chalk, which insures of itself good drainage. Field <a name="potatoes914"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are said to be better than garden ones here generally. Leatherhead. W. -a. I first dug the as heaved and Shaw S about the 20th of June the former in black mould and the latter in stiff loam at which time there was no appearance of disease; but at the end of July, from the same places I found the <a name="potatoes915"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> diseased. The cause, therefore, whatever it may be, did not apparently exist till the middle of July; and that moisture is either the cause, or medium, is, I think, certain, for this has been, from early in June, a decidedly wet season. The red and pink eyed <a name="potatoes916"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are the least affected, which I attribute to their possessing a large portion of marina, which does not de compose readily, preserving its character even in frosted tubes. In these I have not more than one fiftieth bad, but in the early kinds one half are affected. The latter average from five to eight lbs. of marina to the half cut, but the former sorts yield fourteen or sixteen lbs; showing, as regards nutriment, their great superiority. In early sorts the marina is not fully developed, being fibrous and watery, and the tubes are not so wholesome as when two thirds grown. The affected <a name="potato702"><mark>potato</mark></a> cannot be cured; and 1 believe the soil is not capable, from having once grown them, of producing the disease next season and that the chlorides and other purifieds are so far useless. There is a great difference of opinion as to the cause of this calamity. I attribute it wholly to electrical agency. During the summer the atmosphere has been very much charged with electric fluid, and the moist state of the skin of the ha ulm, acting as a powerful conductor, conveyed the fluid to the roots, and in its passage over the surface, and from thence to the next best conductor probably another <a name="potato703"><mark>potato</mark></a> it has produced the appearances which we perceive. The skin and tissue at the surface of the <a name="potato704"><mark>potato</mark></a> (but not the marina loses vitality from the conducting power of the watery state, and is de composed by the electric fluid; and which effect is probably increased when a ready conductor is not at hand. Upon this principle, <a name="potatoes917"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> grown on stiff soil t on clay bottom, will turn out the worst; and on gravely or other porous soils, freer from disease. There first attacked, vitality is nearly destroyed by the sap being changed in character, and obstructed in its passage through the vessels; the leaves and haul m become, as is usual in autumn, yellow, but from a different cause, and fungus may or may not generate itself in consequence of this premature decay. Some of Professor Torrent observations I think are wrong. He ascribed the disease to dampness and cold air. A damp summer of itself is congenial to the growth of the <a name="potato705"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and when well moulded up, cold air cannot affect it. Besides, I find <a name="potatoes918"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> lying on the surface (and consequently green) not attacked at all, the air, as it were, "' case hardening them; and these <a name="potatoes919"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not attacked with insects, but the wire worms, if there are any, very much infect the diseased tubes. I should say the <a name="potatoes920"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> cease to grow, when first attacked, from the absorbent, which take up and afford them nutrition, being destroyed. I am told by a friend at Vantage, in Berks, that several old farmers spoke of seeing " white rain" fall during August, and expected unfavorable effects from it. What this white rain may have been I cannot tell, but blight has been very prevalent; and, as I before observed, an undue electric state of the atmosphere has also been prevalent. About 16 years ago I published, in the " Mechanics' Magazine" the method, as practised by me, of obtaining <a name="potato706"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour its valuable uses, particularly in fattening pigs and the valuable application of the residue of the root, when boiled, for previously feeding the store pigs with. Figs fed only upon <a name="potatoes921"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> thus managed will fatten fast, and make fine pork. Enfi Eld. G. L. Smart. <a name="potatoes922"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> In I Reland. The ravages of the <a name="potato707"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in have not appeared here yet; but there has been a disease in this locality for the last three or four years, which has done much mischief. I instead of commencing above ground, it seems to commence with the decay of the old set. The tubes, as soon as they are formed, are attacked wife dark colored ulcerated blotches, which soon spread over the whole tube r, and end in putrefaction; meanwhile the plant becomes languid, the leaves have a sickly yellow color, yet the plant still exists and forms more tubes, which are also attacked and carried off; the plant becoming more and more unhealthy, most frequently dies a month or six weeks before the healthy plants arrive at maturity. For does the evil rest here. Such tubes as escape the savages of the disease in summer are attacked, after they are dug, during the whole winter, so that before the planting season again arrives the stock is in many cases completely destroyed. The disease is quite local. It is not beyond six or eight miles from herein any direction. Various remedies have been tried, such as having sets from a great distance; planting in drills instead of beds, (which is the common mode of planting here) planting in ground which has not been broken up for along time; planting very thinly, &c; but almost all the trials have been attended with failure. One method, however, so far as it has been tried, seems to remedy the evil; that is, greening or running the sets. For the last two years those planted in the garden have undergone that process, and there has been no failure. Previously they were as much diseased in 590 the garden as in the field. The experiment has been tried this season in the field; and, from a partial examination, seems to have answered equally well. But the crop will be dug in a day or two, when you shall know the result. Enclosed are some diseased stems, with the late growth of tubes attached. T. P. Elli   Of.

From the observations I have made in this neighborhood, I am inclined to think that the saline properties of the sea air do not prevent the disease, as some fields in the immediate vicinity of the sea have partially, and some have completely, failed ; others are at the present time looking quite healthy in the haul m, and the tubes but little, if at all, affected. Now, does it not appear probable, that if the sea air had any influence on the prevailing malady, it would have been more general in its effects ; at any rate on those similarly situated ?a? The sea girt island of Jersey gives a strong proof of the non effect of the saline air on this malady. And again, with regard to the effect salt has had, when applied to the <a name="potato709"><mark>potato</mark></a> at the time of planting : a patch of ground in my garden was planted in the early part of May, in theNo123
. 591 following manner: The rows were opened with the spade about 4 inches deep; the sets were then placed in the bottom of the trench; the first lot was covered with refuse manure, the second with lime in a half s lacked state, the third had a moderate quantity of salt sprinkled over the sets, and the fourth was covered with long fresh cut grass. They all came up about the same time, and were very strong in the haul m till within the last fortnight, when the tops began to die away very rapidly, and they were all cut off about a week since. The tubes have just been lifted, and I find the result, with regard to the murray in, to be as follows: Those manured With refuse dung were affected, as near as I can judge, to about 5 per cent those with lime, 10 per cent; those with salt, about the same as the first and those covered with fresh cut grass, I do not think the loss amounts to one per cent.

I have about one acre of garden ground about half planted with <a name="potatoes927"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and it is situated within the reach of the spray of the sea, and abundantly manured with sea weed. The result is as follows: First, my ash kidneys, planted in November in very light soil, are very little affected; Furnish kidneys, planted in December in light soil, are more than half affected; pink frame, in clay soil, about one third affected; early Thaw, in clay soil, a total failure; Chapmans kidney, planted in June and July, (some in clay soil and some in very light soil) two parts out of three affected. All the above were planted after the spade, and covered with sea weed. I have a but two rods of Chapmans kidney, planted as late as, the 6th August, w which have been looking remarkably green and well until within the last fortnight, but they are now completely cut off with the disease; so sea weed has not given me any protection whatever. James Wood. Harwi Of, Essex. This parish extends along the shores of Counts bay, and consequently a constant deposit e of saline particles is going on, more especially when we have heavy gales from the south. Tea weed is also very extensively used as a manure for <a name="potatoes928"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and also the beach sand. The result of extensive inquiries has shown that no parish in our neighborhood has suffered to an equal extent with ourselves. We must, therefore, admit the conclusion that the application of salt, at least by nature has not proved any preventive of the terrible scourge. W. W. Of Ngfi Eld. Penzance. I have made a circuit of several miles around this place, (Teignoouth) and have found only one instance, wind the exception of my own 592 crop, where the <a name="potatoes929"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not affected with the tour rain inland, as well a sn the very top of the sea cliffs. In a field where I found they were not diseased, I inquired what manure had been used, and the reply was, fresh sea weed. My own crop is planted on a high exposed hill, in a light gravely soil, on a sub soil of sharp gravel. The manure I used was one load stable dung, two loads of ashes of burnt weeds, two cut. gun no, and two cut salt per acre, mixed together, and sown in the furrows 30 inches apart, before planting the sets, the greater number of which were whole <a name="potatoes930"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. I was informed that I should have very poor watery, close <a name="potatoes931"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, because always when salt or gun no was used they were sure to be so, and, as I had used both, they would be very bad; but, instead of being so, I never had better <a name="potatoes932"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> when dressed, they are like balls of flour. Courtenay M. Of Ngdon. From the Gardeners' Chronicle, Act. 11, 1845. <a name="potato710"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Bli   Ght. You have given us ample proof of the specific nature of the <a name="potato711"><mark>potato</mark></a> blight, and of its origin in obvious atmospheric causes, and every one must be struck with its analogy to the epidemic diseases of cattle, and the influenza like maladies of human beings. This analogy holds good in various aspects: its uniform character; its universal it y; its sudden invasion in various points at the same time; and its greater r less intensity, as modified by local circumstances. It seldom happens that any notable epidemic, in animal or vegetable organisms, is so clearly traceable to its causes as the <a name="potato712"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in. We see, nevertheless, that there is a diversity of opinion as to the share in the operation to be assigned to the several agencies. It cannot be wet alone for much letter summers have occurred within these few years without harm to the <a name="potato713"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. It cannot be cold only, because the average temperature has certainly not fallen below the rate of districts and counties where the vegetable is always successfully cultivated; nor has there been, as your correspondents observe, any remarkable development of sensible electricity. But of all the incentives to a healthy vegetation, what has been so much wanting, for the last two months of July and August, as light? not merely bright, sunshine, for of that there was hardly any; but even the ordinary quantity of daylight was wanting so dense and black was the overcast, day after day, through this long period, a time when the vegetable world is in expectation, and generally in the enjoyment, of its fullest share both of light and heat. You justly suppose that the transient warmth of June gave a predisposition to disease by imparting greater sensitiveness or excitability to the plant. Doubtless another ingredient in the mischief was the absence of the usual ground warmth that cherished the vegetation of a more favored season. There is every reason to believe that the cal orifice rays penetrate the clouds and impinges on the soil, where the general diffusion of sunlight is not correspondingly powerful. Very practical gardener will observe that, at the end of even a very dull day in the middle of summer, the temperature of the soil on the surface far exceeds the warmth of the air, and even surprises him by its excess over the temperature of the same soil in the morning. It will be said that in a dull day there is less radiation from the surface than in a clear one, and thence the accumulated warmth. It maybe doubted if the difference in the ratio of light and warmth, as transmitted through a cloudy atmosphere, can be so accounted for, and the subject requires further investigation. Were it not for this aptitude to receive the warmth of the sun, in the, absence of the strong light of that l urinary, it must be supposed that the soil must have been far below the average warmth during the past summer so far as to be productive of still more extensive mischief than has yet accrued from it. But this article has already extended beyond its proper limits. The intention of the writer was to point out the propriety of greater accuracy in the application: of the gen eric term ' blight" than is usually practised, and not to swell the already, voluminous discussion about the <a name="potato714"><mark>potato</mark></a> :murray in; and, although the extraordinary absence of sunlight has been spoken of, it i s not to be supposed that this has been the sole deficiency. 'there is abundant evidence of accumulated causes both of the prima tic and :relative kinds, and <a name="potatoes933"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> die as animals do, by cold and starvation ;some by decline and slow decay; others by mortification and sudden death. Of .SPOTATO Jellyi independently of any consideration of what may be the uses to which the .xtratiopin of starch from bad <a name="potatoes934"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be put by the poor, under present circumstances, :it seems to me not unlikely that your agitatioriof this question may lead to ,the general adoption f ft his substance in all .miles as a useful and important article of our domestic economy, The readiness with which a good sized basin full of thick jelly maybe procured from a single moderate sized <a name="potato715"><mark>potato</mark></a>, is a fact worth knowing. I he. several times repeated the experiment, and find that it does not requiiMemore than eight minutes to change a raw <a name="potato716"><mark>potato</mark></a>. into a basin full of most excellent jelly' which has only to be seasoned with a little sugar, nut me grand white wine, to please the most fastidious palate. To obtain this, jelly in perfection, let a <a name="potato717"><mark>potato</mark></a> be washed, peeled, and grated; throw the pulp thus, produced, into a jug of water, and stir it we l. Pass the mixture of pulp and water over a si eve, and collect the water which passes through into a basin.

Mr. Darwin has recorded an instance of some of his attendants being unable to boil <a name="potatoes935"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> above a certain height on the Cordilleras, owing; to' the diminutionpofpressTre not allowing the water to become sufficiently heated before it boiled. There may possibly be some connection between the conde, tons in der which <a name="potatoes936"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> can be boiled and their starch converted into jelly. Upon, comparing this jelly with that from the starch called arrow root, m and obtained direct from Bermuda, I find a difficulty in my own person ist discriminating between their flavor; though an invalid in the habit of eating arrow root at once detected which was which. The difference, 385 94 however, becomes more sensible when both bellies are made pal a table with sugar, e c; for then both the invalid, myself, and another person were equally decided in our preference of the jelly from the <a name="potato718"><mark>potato</mark></a> to that from the arrow root the latter possessing a rather mawkish flavor, as though it had been prepared with smoke water. J. S. Henslow. Of Tcham. From the Gardeners' Chronicle of October 18, 1845. <a name="potato719"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Murrai N. I have examined hundreds from affected fields, and I have not met with one for the last month in which I could not detect this evil; and in all I have discovered the same symptoms namely, the disease first established by means of the him on that end of the: <a name="potato720"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which henceforth assumes a darker color at first, for a week or two, merely on the surface. This by degrees spreads to the eye end of the <a name="potato721"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and it is when established there that the chief work of destruction occurs. Shortly after this, the character of bruised flesh appears; and I need scarcely add that when that takes place, total destruction follows with great rapidity. I have not a doubt on my mind that this mildew commences with the leaf, like other mildew; and breaking up the tissue there, which in the <a name="potato722"><mark>potato</mark></a> is extremely delicate and watery, as compared with other mildew subjects, (such as the white thorn, or the pea) induces the gangrene, which, finding a proper nidus all the way down the stem, descends as rapidly through the stem into the <a name="potato723"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the cellular tissues of the interior of which afford as ready a facility for the spread of it. I examined a bog or pit, a few hours since, in a neighbors field. I took thence 15 <a name="potatoes937"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the first I met with. Outofthe 15 I found only three sound, and these could not 'hold out a week. I had some of the same: age, and in the same stage of ripe ness; these I mowed down, and took up the mori tent I perceived the mildew beginning to descend by the stem. They have now been in a <a name="potato724"><mark>potato</mark></a> hole for nearly a n month, and I have lost probably about one twentieth. This I can readily account for. There were one or two patches in these in which the disease was further advanced than in the rest of the plot. It spreads by inoculation in the pits or bogs, just as mushroom or any other s pawn does. Wherever I find a suspicious patch there are three or four <a name="potatoes938"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> gone together never one alone. I turned the before named yesterday, arid shook among them a mixture composed of equal parts of quick lime, charcoal dust, and mere dry sand, the Weeping S of a shed. The result of this will announce in due time. If the disease is not far advanced, I should think the caustic it y of lime a most likely thing to stay its ravages, whilst charcoal dust, ;or any burnt refuse, perfectly dry, might be useful in regard to its antiseptic properties. R. Erri Ngton. Olvon Park' .i -a. -a- T .a.  In my former remarks I considered the vitality of diseased <a name="potatoes939"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> destroyed, and, as regards the power of reproducing tubes, this is probably. 595 the case; but I am surprised to find that many are making an effort to ve get ate, although the eyes are surrounded with the malady. I have eaten many of the diseased tubes boiled, with the affected parts removed, and do not find that they are different in flavor from sound <a name="potatoes940"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In storing reds and blues great care is required, for a casual inspection will not detect bad ones; but the disease in white sorts, if dry, is observed directly. Any sort, if sound and kept dry, will remain in good condition. Diseased <a name="potatoes941"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> over dried, or even baked, became softened; but I imagine if large diseased <a name="potatoes942"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are properly pared, warm air dried, and put into fully dried sand, they will keep sound and good for use for some months. This I intend trying with good sized ones. With me the disease is worse under orchard trees than in more open parts; but in a sixteen acre field in -this neighborhood, in which electro culture has been tried, a large proportion is affected, but net, in my opinion, so much from the conductors placed there as from the nature of the soil, which is a strong loam, holding much moisture. The disease now prevailing is distinct from scale or dry rot, the former arising from worn out soil or bad dressing, and the latter apparently from bad management in storing. This year the upper part of the haul m has been different from the usual appearance, having brown patches on it, and being inclined to wither, while the lower part is as yet not affected, and none of these are showing flower. I still entertain the opinion that electrical agency, acting through the medium of the watery stems has been the cause of the disease. L. S., Smartt. From the Gardeners' Chronicle of 25th October, 1815. We have to state that government has instituted an inquiry into the character and extent of the <a name="potato725"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease in I re land. Dr. Lyon Playfairand Professor Kindly have proceeded to I re land to assist in this inquiry, at the desire of Air, Robert Feel. Such an official recognition of that formidable visitation, which we had the melancholy duty of being the first to announce as having manifested itself in I re land, (page 623, Kept. 13,) renders all further details of its progress superfluous. It matters little now whether we were right in laying the loss of, the <a name="potato726"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop at five-sixths. It is, at least, certain that the injury is of the most extensive description. We believe our estimate to have been too low; but, at any rate, no question can be entertained of the mischief being such as to excite the seriousalarlg of the most powerful and sagacious European governments. Since our last, we have received all the numbers of the " Proceedings of the I institute" up to September 22 inclusive: a pamphlet on the <a name="potato727"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, by Professor Dorr en; some continental papers; and numerous private communications. From the mass of matter we extract what seems to be of most importance, promising that, in all practical points, we find our own views adopted by those whose opinions are more entitled to attention. In the first place, as to the fitness of delayed <a name="potatoes943"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for food. Upon that point there is the most positive information. That <a name="potatoes944"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> actually putrid are unfit for food, is certain. But the number of tubes at present in that state is inconsiderable; the large mass of the crop has the brown gangrene of the surface, which gradually pierces to the centre. A curious and sufficiently practical experiment as to the possibility of eating such per 96 states without danger, has been tried by M. On jean, of Chamber y, who states, in the Conde, a French newspaper, (for which we are indebted tour. Fig g, of Horse, near Hourwich) that he has been living almost exclusively, for three consecutive days, upon bad <a name="potatoes945"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which had been thrown aside as refuse. 1. On jean states as follows n order to determine the question with regard to the danger of eating the affected <a name="potatoes946"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I had none of the injured portions cut away from the tubes, on which I lived almost exclusively for three whole days; during which time I ate 8 pounds, with butter, in soup, or simply cooked in water, without experiencing any inconvenience except slight indigestion, a symptoms which probably would not have manifested itself if the spoiled portions had been previously removed. Further, I have drunk in the- morning, fasting, a glass (about 8 ounces) of water, in which 5 pounds of putridtubershad been boiled. It was a yellowish brown, turbid, and thick, but not viscous ; of a slightly disagreeable smell, and nausea us taste, leaving a bitterness, which remained on the palate for an hour. I found no other symptoms of indigestion from this liquid, except a disagreeable heat op pressing the chest for about two hours. My two clerks and servant, observing that   felt no repugnance in eating these <a name="potatoes947"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and that no inconvenience resulted, followed my example next day, and were nothing worse. After stating the above facts, I hope the diseased <a name="potatoes948"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will no longer be considered poisonous, nor in any degree dangerous when the delayed portions are removed. Anxious to know whether it was possible to save the sound portions of the tubes for use, 1 collected 100 pounds of such as were partially affected, from which I had the unsound portions completely removed. After this operation there remained 73 pounds of sound pieces, which I find as good to use as the finest of those exposed for sale. Hence, about three-fourths of the <a name="potatoes949"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that are thrown away may be turned to good account; and I shall be happy if my experiments and observations tend to preserve a considerable portion of aliment, so precious to the poor, and of which they are in danger of being deprived by fatal prejudices. Of. J. Bonjeande Chamberythe next point is the mode of storing the crop. -the universal opinion is, that the only practicable means of effecting this is by trusting to dryness, which is precisely what we have recommended from the beginning. The manner of securing a sufficient degree of dryness is different, but all agree in dryness being essential; and this must be so, when we consider that all the crop is more or less charged with water, which, in favorableseaspos, the plants would have lost in the ordinary course of growth. Trying in dark chambers, well ventilated by means of a sprinkling of lime, or by dry earth interspersed among the tubes, are methods that have their advocates. We hold to the latter as being, upon the whole, the best plan first because it is easiest, and more especially because the disease is certainly contagious ; that we have ascertained by the following direct experiment: -several sacks of apparently sound bread fruit <a name="potatoes950"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, ten days since, were placed in a dry stable and covered with mats, for the sake of seeing whether they could be so kept. In un covering them, a large proportion were already exhibiting the mould y appearance which invariably. 597 accompanies the disease. We have no doubt that the air is impregnated with the <a name="seeds67"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the fungus; that whenever it falls upon a decaying or injured surface it takes root, provided the vitality of the tube r is low; that the vitality of all <a name="potatoes951"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from diseased districts is low this year; that, more rover, they are all more or less injured (necessarily) in the operation of digging, and that, consequently, they all offer a favorable situation :i which the fungus can :prop agate itself. Now, if <a name="potatoes952"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are placed in did rooms, or packed in any other way so as to allow air to circulate among the mi, the r seed of the fungus will reach them. The last point to which we shall avert is the course to be taken with the seed next year to tis! clear i from the following very important communication from Mr. Grey, of Wilson, that autumn planting answers perfectly. We should, therefore, adopt that mode of cultivation at once. Comparati   Of Produce Of Autumn And Spri Of Planted <a name="potatoes953"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Your number for November last contained the detail of an experiment which I made last year on the growth and produce of <a name="potatoes954"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted in October and in April, the result of which was, that the plot planted I in April, oh the same land and with the same manure as the other planted in October, gave 86 loads per acre the seed having been from large <a name="potatoes955"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> cutihtwoand that planted in October, with the like seed, gave l11loadswhereas small <a name="potatoes956"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, planted whole in October, gave 100 loads. Of n October last I prepared my land, and planted my <a name="potatoes957"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in drill rows of 30 inches width, applying fold yard manure below the sets, but leaving three rows un planted for each intermediate month between October andApil, inclusive. The land is a strong loam, except at the upper end, where it touched for a few yards upon clay, in which the <a name="potatoes958"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> failed i to a great extent in all the plantings. At the low end of the rows, the land is good and perfectly uniform. The manure and treatment of all were alike in every respect, except as to the times of planting. This years    did not apply gun no is the spring, as detailed in the experiments of last year. One of the <a name="potatoes959"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been affected by disease; but the earliest planted showed the greatest strength and vigor in the sterns, although there were occasional vacancies in the rows. The land was all drilled up in October, :at which time the largest part was planted. Three rows more were dunged and planted in like manner in the end of November, and three in the end of December. In January and February the weather was so bad, and the frost so hard, that no planting could be accomplished. Three rows more were planted early in March, and the remainder of the land at usual time of planting in April. The <a name="potatoes960"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been taken up within the last three days; and, to test the comparative produce of the several plantings, my man began at the lowed of :the rows and dug onwards till he had filled a sack which contains ten stones weight. The contents, however, is in material, so long as :the same sack was used for all. The average length of the drill rows required t fill the sack Of October planting, was 30 yards, Of November do 32 do Of December do 32 do Of March do 44 do Of April do 45 do 598 which leaves to the October planting an increase of one third over that of April; a result not very different from that of last year, in which the quantities were 111 to 86. From this it would seem that it does not much signify at what period in the winter <a name="potatoes961"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are planted, provided the land be free and dry, and the weather suitable for working it; but it is evident that a loss of power is sustained by allowing the seed to remain in pits till the spring, under a slow process of vegetation, when, before being used i in the field, considerable shoots have already been put forth, wasting the nourishment which is requisite to sustain the plant in its early growth, and he fore it begins to derive its support from the soil. A few more such experiments may tend still further to elucidate this important subject. John Grey. Of Lston House, October 16. If shall sound <a name="potatoes962"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, or such as are very slightly affected, are now exposed to the light, they will rapidly become green, arid their vitality will be so t much raised as probably to enable them to resist all decay. If such greened tubes are cut into sets, they should be sprinkled with powdered lime, or otherwise dried by exposure to air for two or three days, and then planted. Of course, in 'a case of this kind, where everything is new, it would be un safe to affirm that this process will be effectual. But it holds out so good a prospect of success, that we do not hesitate to recommend its immediate adoption. It has, also, this advantage that if it should fail, <a name="potato728"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields can be again planted in the spring. It will be well to select for the crop new ground ; and, if possible, high, dry situations. But while we state this as a matter of prudence, we have i confidence in its necessity. Our own opinion is, that if sound seed a rested, no fear need be entertained of the mischief appearing another year. After giving this subject the most serious attention, we can arrive at3a6other conclusion than that the disease is to be traced to the peculiar circumstances of the season that is to say, to atmospheric causes and to nothing else; that the mischief produced by the mildew fungus is quite a secondary circumstance, although probably a serious aggravation of the original mischief, and that nothing is to be feared from it hereafter, unless the same atmospheric conditions should occur. Cause Of The <a name="potato729"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Murrai N. It appears to me that the disease primarily attacks the stem, and I think the view I take of the subject holds good in some cases, if not in all. I maintain that it is a disease of the fluids: the descending sap becomes poisoned by the generation of un wholesome gases in the stem; from the excessive moisture prevalent through this season, the proper exhaustion of the plant has not been carried on; thus, we find that the stem undergoes decomposition instead of gradual decay, and this deteriorates the descending sap, which, passing to the root, poisons, as it were, the tubes. My own <a name="potatoes963"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which were planted on new ground, on a very steep slope, are not in the least affected. There they were grown on higher ground, the. 5 99 ops died early, and l the tubes are as healthy as possible. Before the last rain I dug about a. room. both from the lower and higher ground, and all were equally sound. A few rows remained, which I was prevented by the rain from digging up: these I have since gathered, and they have shown symptoms of disease; the tops were fine; but after the rain, they were all matted together. During their growth I never saw tops have a more luxuriant appearance; clear and fresh, with nothing like specks on the leaves or stems. Another thing which causes .me to consider the sap as poisoned, is the great rapidity with which the tubes decay. They appear healthy, from all outward appearance; still, in many cases, if they are stored away, the speaks are manifest- first, of a dingy hue, then darker colored, and afterwards becoming soft and rotten. Had the leaves or stems of my <a name="potatoes964"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> shown any signs of specks, I would have pulled the stems out of the ground, leaving in the tubes awhile before I dug them up; this would have prevented any bad effect from a deteriorated sap. A proof might be obtainedbyicomparing the analysis of an unsound <a name="potato730"><mark>potato</mark></a> with that of a sound one. I think we should find, at any rate, the ultimate elements to be in different proportions to what is usual. A. B., M. R. C. s. The <a name="potato731"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease appears to be similar in nature to the smut and other diseases that affect wheat. I s it not, therefore; probable, that the same remedies that are found effective to preserve wheat may be advantageously employed in the case of <a name="potatoes965"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> ?a? Experience has shown that certain steep s blue vitriol, for instance) effectually prevent the ravages of smut. I would, therefore, suggest that the experiment should be made, whether soaking <a name="potatoes966"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> intended for seed in a solution of blue vitriol might not probably destroy the vegetative power of the fungus on; the <a name="potato732"><mark>potato</mark></a>, without affecting the vegetative power of the <a name="potato733"><mark>potato</mark></a> itself. Of course, the p poisonous nature of blue vitriol makes this suggestion inapplicable to <a name="potatoes967"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> intended for any other use except for seed. I cannot help being strongly of opinion that the disease is not of such recent origin as is commonly supposed. Any one who will examine the columns of ,the Chronicle many months before the harvest of 1845 was begun, will find numerous complaints of partial failures of the <a name="potato734"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and suggestions as to the cause. 1 think it is now scarcely possible to doubt that the same cause was then in operation which has since produced such terrible effects. I know two instances in 1844, in which nearly the whole crop was worthless; and, though I have had no particular description of the appearance of the <a name="potato735"><mark>potato</mark></a>, I do not doubt the disease was the same as has since become so prevalent. Of t is worthy of remark, that whereas Mr. Tax ton considers the disease to be "principally confined to what are called the early, <a name="potatoes968"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>: in thisiaeighborhood the early crops were as good, if not better, than usual. When attention was first called to th. existence of the disease, I thought it advisable (as a precautionary measure) to take up a considerable quantity of 600 the early kinds for seed, although they were scarcely ready; and after being properly dried and " greened: they were carefully stored, and ar still perfectly sound ad good.

It must be something more than excessive wet, or cold, humid atmosphere, which occasioned this evil, for they grew in a perfectly dry place. Hours, &cGEO. Juler. North Walsham, October 30. The Of Sease In The <a name="potato742"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Crop. To the Editor of the Morning Postsi  R.': A circumstance has occurred here, which may perhaps be useful to farmers if they should again be visited by this disease. In the first appearance of the complaint in the <a name="potato743"><mark>potato</mark></a> haul m, a small field field belonging to the Rev. Mr. Ferguson, of Luck field Dark, adjoining the churchyard, showed indubitable signs of being attacked. It was almost the first piece that was affected, and, as it had been planted with <a name="potatoes973"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for twenty-eight successive years, it was supposed to arise from the continuous cultivation r if one species of root. As the fence dividing it from an aadjoiingxmeadow 'was only a double post and rail, a quantity of two toothed sheep that i vere turned into it after mowing broke into the <a name="potatoes974"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and fed off the haul m, eating it off closely, with the exception of the upright or main his was 'up posed at first to have done some good in staying the disease but, as the s talks were closely shaved and shortly died, no more was thought of it until last week, when the <a name="potatoes975"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were lifted, and found, with the exception of a few that were rotten in the ground, and a few bushels that showed signs of having been attacked by the disease and were in a state of decay, to be perfectly sound, and in a fit state for storing. The ground in of dry soil, of a sandy loam, and the <a name="potatoes976"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted were of the Thaw variety. His goes far towards proving that the disease originates in the haul and demonstrates the utility of feeding off or cutting it when first attacked 602 a. It was the only piece of backward <a name="potatoes977"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that has escaped in the neighborhood. As I have long been a subscribe r to your entertaining, and useful paper, I have sent you the above, to insert or not, as you may think proper. Hours, &c. &c 8, Sergi Son. Scukfi Eld Park, Sussex, October 31. The <a name="potato744"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. To the Editor of the Timessi  R: I regret that further observation of the pared and sliced <a name="potatoes978"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> I mentioned in my speech at Birmingham, in which, for a few days after I had dried them in the sun and air, the growth of the fungus seemed stopped, has convinced me that the disease is again going on; so that unless the slices be made as dry as biscuits, in a slow oven, or on a fire or malt kill, at a heat sufficient to kill the fungus, its growth will go on, and destruction of the <a name="potato745"><mark>potato</mark></a> follow. I see it recommended to steam or boil all <a name="potatoes979"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in which the smallest speck of decay has appeared, and to ram them down air tight in cases, or large jars or pans, covered over at the top with a layer of fat, to be kept like posted meat, for use during winter, and stored in a dry place. His seems to be the easiest mode of preserving <a name="potatoes980"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in every stage of decay short of absolute rotten ness. I yesterday asked some eminent martinists to contrive a small and portable boiler, by which steam may be introduced to the bottom of cases seton end and filled with <a name="potatoes981"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. They suggested that a A pins digester, having a small lead pipe fixed in the centre of its lid may be inserted into cases of every size, in which a false bottom of wood should be placed under the <a name="potatoes982"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, at a few inches from the bottom, sufficient to allow free passage to the steam. A similar lead pipe may be fixed on the top of any large tea kettle or common boiler; and if this top be tied down with wire to prevent its being blown off by the steam, this steam will fill the case, and in the usual time boil or steam the <a name="potatoes983"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and, killing the fungus by heat, will stop its further progress. *the fungus matter thus boiled is wholesome and nutritions, being not a putrid substance, nor a murray in or gangrene, but only another kind of vegetable, formed from the substance of the <a name="potato746"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and, like eat able mushrooms, is good for food. It is only where the <a name="potatoes984"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are absolutely rotten that I would advise the preparation of starch, which alone remains after all the membranes and tissues of the <a name="potato747"><mark>potato</mark></a> are consumed by fungus. This may easily be done by crushing, stirring, and washing the pulp several times in tubs of cold water, in which, at the end of every stirring, the starch Will separate from the pulp and fall to the bottom of the tub. I think that steaming in large cases, or boiling in the common way, where there is no contrivance to make steam, is much better than grating the delayed <a name="potatoes985"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in any stage short of rotten ness; when they are rotten, the starch still remain r, and is all that can be saved. The <a name="potatoes986"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> thus steamed or boiled may be stored in cases of any size, a. 603 from sugar hogs heads to butter fir king, and a little salt should be sprinkled, on the <a name="potatoes987"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as they are put into the cases; but it is essential that they should be ram med quite close and air tight throughout, and that the top and bottom of the cases, and every joint and crack, should be rubbed over and filled with grease or pitch. If this be done, the <a name="potatoes988"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will keep like meat and vegetables posted in air tight tin cases, which are sent to I india and back quite fresh. There there is time to p are the <a name="potatoes989"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> before steaming or boiling, this should always be done, and the parings, boiled, given to hogs and cattle. As large <a name="potato748"><mark>potato</mark></a> steaming vessels exist, or may in a few days be placed in all the union houses in the country, the inmates may be most advantageously employed in steaming and ram mind <a name="potatoes990"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> into cases, while the inhabitants of each neighborhood are occupied in bringing their <a name="potatoes991"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and empty cases, and carrying them away full of food thus rescued from destruction. I am, sir, your obedient servant, W. Buckland. Oxford, November 7. P. Of t is essential that the cases or pots be kept in some place perfectly dry. There cottages have no such place, farmers and proprietors will assuredly lead t them lofty or barns, or stables or outhouses. From the Preston Pilot. The <a name="potato749"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Crop. An intelligent correspondent, who has bestowed considerable pains to, ascertain the state of the prevailing disease in <a name="potatoes992"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, has favored us with the following results of a promiscuous survey or inspection of the <a name="potato750"><mark>potato</mark></a>, crops in the townships of Woodplumpton, Brought on, Barton, In skin, &can rd gives the following cases 1.

Before either the wet weather or frost came, this farmer got up a quantity, thinking of their being seed next year. He had them dried, greened, and well hugged; and on examining them, he found every <a name="potato751"><mark>potato</mark></a> more or less affected 13. High, dry land, near a railway, commonly called "spoil Bankssound to appearance, but fully expected to go bad 14. Very old "fought en" land, well manured and attended to. Planted with early kinds, and many going rotten 15. [his gentleman is a scientific and practical agriculturists] Dug up part of an old meadow near to a brook; manured one part with his own ridden dung, and the other with night soil. The drills were made with the spade, and the mature put t in at the time. Planted many kinds amongst the rest, half a load of "end al flat reds." These he planted whole sets, excepting a few from which he cut a. small piece from the ha ulm or tail ends. He then shook them up in a sack containing gypsumand when he planted them in the drills, he put some more gypsy m upon them, previous to covering them up. He has not more than threescore pounds back from the half load, the remainder being rotten, The other kinds were also diseased. He also planted some new sort, raised by himself from crabs, two years ago; and finds the produce neither greater nor sounder than from old seed. He dug some " lemon kidneys' early in the season, for seed another year; and on examination, finds them going rotten. From the above cases, he makes the following remarks: It does not appear that the crops in old, hard worked soils are any worse than those in fresh broken up fields, although this is contrary to all precedent and experience. It also seems that the black, free, sandy, or; likely soils have not done any better than the stiff, clay by, or unlikely grounds: There does not appear to have been any want of care and attention on the part of the farmers, either as regards draining, maturing, or keeping weeds down. In some of the crops of early <a name="potatoes993"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the leaves dropped from the stems early in the season, the stems keeping their erect position, but assumed a yellowish appearance, an evident sign of the disease having commenced its ravages. This was not the case with the backward crops, which maintained their freshness and vigor until cut down by the frosts. 'a king the Fyldedistrict through, it may be safely asserted that fully one half are now completely rotten; and it is generally considered the remainder will not keep. a. 605ANSWERS Of Queri Of. To the Rev. A1im. Worcester, minister of the parish of West Lintonthe general crop has suffered to a certain extent in almost every instance from the prevailing disease, both by rotating in the ground and after being raised: It is worthy of particular remark, that in many instances, where lifted early in small quit i anti in for use and before the decay of the shaw, or foliage more particularly, the portion of the crop so lifted appeared, and prove don cooking, to be perfectly sound and healthy; whereas, on lifting the remaining portion, in the same field. some time after the shaws had delayed, they turned out to be painted, like the general crops of the country. However, by being housed, and frequently ai red by the door being left open, and in pits, care being taken to lift off the covering every good day, for awhile, to air and dry the mass, under both these plans of treatment the disease appears to have been at all events temporarily arrested. It is also worthy of remark, that on hanging land, looking north, and where the crop was late planted, and in vigorous growth till near the period of lifting, having thus enjoyed the protection of the shaws, a foliage cover in which aided materially in defending the tubes from the heavy rains, acting in some r measure as a natural roof, casting aside the wet into the furrows, they turned out, upon lifting, to be scarcely affected at all. In this instance, not only did the shaws cast off the rain into the furrows, but the land having a considerable inclination, the super abundant moisture escaped by the furrows to a lower level, leaving the surface and crops comparatively dry. But even here, wherever the super abundant moisture was collected in any slight depression, or hollow, the disease appeared to some extent. In ain other instance, on undulating land, the depressions forming natural cups, or basins, retaining the water as it fell, and affording no means of escaping, in the same field the <a name="potato752"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop was excessively damaged in these natural hollows, whilst the more elevated or shelling parts were comparatively unaffected. In one instance, however, the crop raised off dry land was stored in pits early, and, on opening the pits, the <a name="potatoes994"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were found to be a decaying mass. In this instance, however, the crop was raised in very wet weather, stored wet, and of course in bad order for keeping sound. In another instance, a portion was raised in a field soon after the decay of the shaws, when a very considerable number indeed appeared to be diseased; some time thereafter the number increased ; and within a week, and after the heavy October rains, when the crop had ceased growing, and had been for some time exposed without the protection of the shaws, more than a third of the crop was found to be damaged. After raising, too, the loss wa, considerable, although the diseased tubes were carefully separated. Oifdiry and level ground, with an open bottom, the loss was not so great as under less favorable circumstances. In level ground, with a retentivesubsoilthe loss was great. In inclined ground, where the crop was late planted, and particularly if inclining to moss, the loss was often inconsiderable. It would appear that the <a name="potato753"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop had this year suffered severely from the cloudy and extremely cold and wet season; the temperature, especially in high districts, frequently bordering on frost, so early as from the latter end of July to the end of August, and subsequently; and the white and most delicate kinds have suffered most. Such a season was ill adapted for bringing this crop to maturity (scarcely a seed apple having appeared in this local 606 city during the past season) and was undoubtedly eminently unsuited to the constitution of the <a name="potato754"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant, derived, as its original was, and acclimated, from a dry and sunny country. This is undoubtedly the cause of the prevalence and severity of the rot, which is the disease affecting the present crop. There is, therefore, no such cause for serious alarm; on the contrary, there is every reason to expect, if the tubes are planted next spring which shall have resisted decay during the ensuing winter, and if next spring, summer, and autumn should prove warm, sunny, and dry, and propitious to the ma duration and storing of the <a name="potato755"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, that the produce will, despite the present visitation upon us, prove sand and abundant. There is no rational reason for anticipating the contrary. 1 do not apprehend there will be the slightest danger from using tubes for seed, which shall have resisted decay during the winter. It has been ascertained that the <a name="potato756"><mark>potato</mark></a>, crop is not affected in the more warm and sunny countries of Europe, which is a pretty convincing proof that the cold and cloudy skies which have prevailed over great parts of Europe and America during the past season have been, along with any accidental constitutional weakness in the plant itself, the predisposing and active cause which has generated, extended, and aggravated the disease of rot, depending, or rather resulting, in a great measure, in active, followed by putrefactive ferment at ion, before lifting, or consequent on storing, more particularly where that operation has been carelessly or improperly performed. To doubt after decay of the shaw the chief damage has been received. It would then, at least, daily become more apparent; and may be, so far, familiar ly accounted for, as it has been found to operate thus. In the first place, so long as the <a name="potato757"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop retained the shaws, or haul m, it was in vigorous growth and was capable of resisting the unfavorable influence, and action of super abundant moisture during the late wet season. In the second place, the shaws acted as a protection from the rains, as I have already said, casting them aside into the furrows, leaving the a up, where perfectly earthed up, high and dry above. And, in the third place, it may be remarked, that on the decay of the foliage covering of the shaws, not only were the drills left exposed, but from the extraordinary prevalence and violent action of the high winds, accompanied by heavy rains during the late season, cups or small depressions were formed on the top of the drills, at the root of every shaw ; and the interstices or openings left, on the decay of the shaw, leading from the surface of the drills down to the tubes, and forming, in fact, natural pipes or conductors from the several cups formed on the surface down to the tubes, would act in this way. The cups would receive the rain water as it fell, and the pipes, left by the decay of the stems, would conduct the moisture received and collected in the cups directly down to the tubes, and keep them constantly wet; and they have thus been lying, since the decay of the shaws, in the very circumstances, and under the very conditions, and exposed to the very influences, most favorable for inducing rot, which is, without doubt, the only disease with which the <a name="potato758"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop has this year been so severely affected. To doubt, as I have already said, the sets might have been predisposed to disease; because, so to speak the constitution of the plant has been for some years deteriorateing in the country. But had the late season been a genial season, as it was the reverse, the probability is, that the injury would have an mounted to nothing more than has been usual in an average of past seasons. The progress of the disease has not ceased or a bated, where the tubersDoc. No. 140.607have been stored wet, or in bad order, or without reasonable precautions. New attempts at remedy have been ventured. But I would remark, generally, that when housed, where there is the necessary accommodation, the tubes should be examined frequently, picked carefully, and where obtainable with little trouble or cost, they may be beneficially sprinkled with gypsy m, s lacked lime, dry pe at ashes, or even with the roughly dried sand; and though exposed with the doors open for air during the day, they must be carefully covered with abundance of straw, and the doors shut during the night. The use of either of the first three substances will have a very excellent and health full effect in preventing the noxious gases arising from the mass injuriously affecting the individuals employed in picking, sorting, and turning the tubes. *a* *a* It would appear, from all experience, that perfect dryness and thorough ventilation are the only efficient attain able remedies or curatives, or preventives. *a* *a* *a* It has been remarked elsewhere, however, and observation in this locality seems to confirm it, that a soil of bog or pe at earth, very prevalent in this quarter in particular localities, seems to have a very decided and sensible effect in preserving the crop free from the prevalent disease. This may be of great importance next spring at seed time. I am, dear sir, yours truly, James Anderson22 Of Of Of, Edi Nburgh, Sov. 10, 1845. From the New York Farmer and Mcchran. New York Farmers' Club. In the County Work Agricultural Society, of which Word Harvard, a member of Parliament, is president, his subject [<a name="potato759"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot] was recently considered; Prof. All man spoke of the deep anxiety felt on the subject, and of his examinations made by powerful microscopes. He says that he was enabled to see the organic arrangements of the <a name="potato760"><mark>potato</mark></a> by cutting off a thin transparent portion, placing it on a bit of glass, laying a deep of water over it, with a small portion of the tincture of I o dine, covering it with another bit of glass, and using a microscope of three hundred line al magnitude. Quantity of starch would be detected lying on its cells, and the starch g lobules would be seen in their exact proportion, and would be colored by the     o dine. The starch would be seen distinct from every other substance in the <a name="potato761"><mark>potato</mark></a>. It would be seen that the healthy cells were full of starch, while the diseased <a name="potatoes995"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were very deficient. The disease appeared to prevent the formation of starch in the young <a name="potato762"><mark>potato</mark></a>; and when it attacked the old <a name="potatoes996"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the starch being already formed, might be extracted for food. He recommends grinding up the <a name="potatoes997"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and extracting the starch. John Billon Crokerhad examined disease in England, and was "horror stricken, on returning to I re land, to find that the angel of destruction had smitten the crop of this country." Some had said that the severe frost of the 7th of September had been the cause, but he had d alias, geraniums, and French beans, which were bright and green, while the <a name="potatoes998"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were gone; frost was out of the question. He had put some <a name="potatoes999"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> into scalding water by way of trying an experiment, but in these the plague spot showed i an hour, and the <a name="potatoes1000"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rotted rapidly. He said that we must get the starch out; that the starch in the diseased <a name="potato763"><mark>potato</mark></a> was just as good as in the sound ones. He said, " Met I re land from henceforth become a 608 6 c. No. 140.consumer of good wholesome brieacdstuf." He said the starch of the <a name="potato764"><mark>potato</mark></a> could be eaten as we eat arrow root, and what we get from the shops by that in ame is made generally of <a name="potato765"><mark>potato</mark></a> flour, and which is passed off under at dozen names as an important and nutritions diet or. &with, t of Layhanmhad extracted from five bushels of ,bad <a name="potatoes1001"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> thirty pounds of flour, and had refused to sell it at six pence a pound. A bushel of <a name="potatoes1002"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> would yield eleven or twelve pounds of flour. In Silken ny and Throne, <a name="potatoes1003"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were produced weighing from two and a half pounds to five ponds each, and there was no disease in them. A mode of preserving <a name="potatoes1004"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from disease after being dug, is recommended, viz: soft in lime over them, until every <a name="potato766"><mark>potato</mark></a> is coated. Some districts are free from the <a name="potato767"><mark>potato</mark></a> plague. It is said that the white eyed <a name="potatoes1005"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have escaped the disease almost entirely. It is stayed that the apple <a name="potatoes1006"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not the fifth: of them sound the dukes nearly as bad; the cups pretty safe; and that the only <a name="potatoes1007"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have escaped entirely are some early Scotchcid127; that the .kidneys are pretty free from disease; that the <a name="potato768"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease is contagious; that the healthy ones must be carefully separated from those diseased. Preservati   Of Of The <a name="potato769"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Crop. To the Editor of the Dark Lane Express first fix upon a piece of ground as high and dry as I can select. I then mark out five feet in width, and of any length that may be required, cutting a trench round the same and with the excavated earth still further advancing the ground where on the <a name="potatoes1008"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> .are to rest. Upon that bed I spread a thick layer of clean dry straw, on which is put .a thin layer of <a name="potatoes1009"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as free from dirt and loose moulds as I can. conveniently make them ; then another covering of straw, succeeded by a second layer of <a name="potatoes1010"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; on these I place rows of rough tiles, ti vo feet apart crosswisethatis, from n side to side by which flies are formed for the escape of the damp and thereon I advance the hill with <a name="potatoes1011"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to any height that may be found convenient. Such: being effected, I again resort to straw; but stubble, thin pared sons, or any similar material, would answer the p ii pose nearly as well, which I spread pretty thickly over the whole of the <a name="potatoes1012"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and then cover them down with earth for the winter. To prevent damage being done by the frost, I plug up the ends of the tiles every night with wisps of hay, removing them every morning, which should be attended to until the <a name="potatoes1013"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are found to be in perfectly dry condition. I lately opened a pie wherein I had put promiscuously, on the above plan, <a name="potatoes1014"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> damaged arid sound, wet and dry, which had been covered down with earth nine days. To my great satisfaction, I found the <a name="potatoes1015"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> quite free from heat, much dryer than when stored, and those which were diseased in a far ho are healthy condition, the damaged parts having changed into dust, the 'Wo0itids having become in a great measure in crusted over, and apparently, fair the d 9 t judgment I could form of them, likely to prove good and' Wiblesbifie i food for man, and fit for seed next spring. n reference to the tiles being placed upon, the second layer of <a name="potatoes1016"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I would observe that thy may be passed through any part of the pie which tight be thought likely to admit of a greater portion of atmospheric air ; for, in my opinion, it is the free circulation of air through the whole mass of <a name="potatoes1017"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which acts so beneficially. 
609Should no straw be at command to put at the floor of the pie, I would recommend tiles, as has already been described, being placed across he same at the top of the raised foundation. These. I h e no doubt, would be sufficient to prevent any damage being done to the <a name="potatoes1018"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by the damp of the natural earth. I am, sir, your faithful servant, Of.

From Rank & Of  millards Commercial Traveller. After making considerable allowance for the exaggeration which usually attends statements calculated to create alarm, it seems absolutely certain that a disease has very extensively shown itself among <a name="potatoes1025"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the present years growth, and that the effect of it will be to reduce the crop very far below an average, and in some districts to create considerable difficulty if not actual starvation and distress. It becomes, then, a matter of no ordinary importance to determine by what means such an evil may be prevented for the future, as well as mitigated in its present operation. The disease itself, in plain language, may be called the "rot" and is found to exist more or less at all times, but, of course, it only excites public attention when sufficiently extensive as to become a public evil. The existing cause of it, the writer believes to be an excess of cold and moisture. The <a name="potato771"><mark>potato</mark></a> is a vegetable which naturally absorbs a vast quantity of water, and, when supplied with this element in excess, it requires a proportionate degree of warmth to enable it so to assimilate the moisture it has imbibed as to convert it into a healthy substance; and in case of its wanting the degree of warmth necessary to stimulate its secreting organs into a due state of activity, it will become subject to morbid formations, and these, unless means are adopted to prevent their development, will sooner or later show themselves by that corruption, or rotten ness, which, during the present season, has been so prevalent. This disease, then, sustains to the <a name="potato772"><mark>potato</mark></a> a similar relationship to that of scrofula to the human body; and, like this scourge of the human species, it may be considered as partly resulting from constitutional defect, and partly from external causes. Among the various opinions which have been hazarded respecting the causes of the malady, some have supposed the existence of an external " blight" by which the tubes have become ultimately affected and others have talked about "hung i" upon the tubes, by which they have become diseased. The writer believes that the plant has become diseased through the unhealthy state of the roots or secreting organs, and that the" hung i" have resulted from the disease, and not been the occasion of it. That, then, are the liveliest means for preventing the malady in future ?a. 611 is far as weather is concerned, it is clear we can do nothing but to submit to whatever may happen. We can neither command the sun to shine, nor dispose of the drops of rain, nor order the courses of the winds. Still, much remains in our own power, and which may be all summed up in a few words: the true secret of success in growing <a name="potatoes1026"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as well as other vegetable productions, is to sow good seed in good ground; and whenever this simple and rational rule is neglected, there will most assuredly be more or less of loss and disappointment. With respect to soil, the <a name="potato773"><mark>potato</mark></a> delights in that which is moderately light and porous, which points out the necessity of draining all heavy and wet lands, if they are expected to grow <a name="potatoes1027"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In the next place, the <a name="potato774"><mark>potato</mark></a> requires a frequent change of soil, and on this account heavy crops are usually produced on newly broken up lands. In kitchen gardens and cottage allot cents, where the root is grown year after year on the same spot, this necessity is in some measure provided for by the large quantity of fresh manure which is commonly used. Extremely favorable seasons will counteract, to a great extent, the disadvantages of the soil; but no man has a right to expect a large and healthy crop who plants his seed inland exhausted by frequent dropping, which has not been well worked by the spade or plough, or which is rete native of cold and excess of moisture With regard to seed, common sense tells us it ought to be in the highest state of perfection in which it can be obtained, and to such perfection the writer considers the following items indispensable 1. It ought to be whole The practice of cutting <a name="potatoes1028"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> into pieces for seed, leaving one or two eyes in a piece, cannot be too strongly deprecated. The result of repeated experiments has unanswerable proved that the plan has nothing to recommend it but a penny wise and pound foolish economy. It is true that every eye possesses the germ of a perfect plant, the same as the eye of a dahlia; but every cultivate or of this flower knows that, although he may get a well formed plant, and handsome flowers, from a single eye, or the cutting of a dahlia, he only get- a good crop of roots from a perfect tube r. The grower of <a name="potatoes1029"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> wants roots, not flowers, and to secure these let him plant whole <a name="potatoes1030"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and for many reasons, into which the writer cannot. now enter, he will find it answers his purpose better than cutting them 2. It ought to be in a state of maturity Unripe seed is necessarily deficient of the vigor requisite to put forth and sustain a healthy giant; and, as we have already shown, whatever is a cause of weakness is a predisposing cause of disease. This is as true among vegetables as animals and in regard to the latter, no one ever thinks of disputing it. The <a name="potatoes1031"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for planting should, therefore, be selected when the s talks have delayed, and not sooner 3. It ought to be of medium size, and well formed The writer has found that, on the whole, <a name="potatoes1032"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the size of hens' eggs have produced the heaviest crop out of a given weight of seed. He would, however, prefer sets much smaller, if ripe, whole, and well formed, to pieces cut from large <a name="potatoes1033"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The overgrown tubes should always be rejected, as containing an excess of moisture; whereas the strength of the future plant re sides in the solid part of the root 4. The <a name="potato775"><mark>potato</mark></a> should frequently be raised direct from the seed contained in the <a name="potato776"><mark>potato</mark></a> apple very sort of vegetable propagated in the way <a name="potatoes1034"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are usually produced is liable to degenerate; and in proportion to61
their de genera cy, they become liable to disease. Any sorts of <a name="potatoes1035"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> once in common use, have become completely worn out, and their names are almost forgotten; and the writer has little doubt that much of the disease and failure which every year, and in unfavorable seasons in particular, attends the <a name="potato777"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, is owing to sets being planted which are too far removed from the original seed. The vegetative principle has become too feeble to give existence to a healthy and vigorous plant; and the consequence has been those diseases to which there has been a predisposition, or which the soil or season has been calculated to produce 5. I It ought to be well preserved The best of seed may be injured by bad manage meet t; and, although <a name="potatoes1036"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will stand much rough treatment, like all things possessing life, they cannot be injured with entire impunity. When taken up they should be exposed to the air for a few days to dry and hard en, by which means they will be less liable to shoot before the time of planting; they should then be stored away and effectually guarded against frost and damp. A worse plan cannot exist than allowing the <a name="potatoes1037"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to shoot, and, after pulling off the shoots, to plant the <a name="potatoes1038"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> foi seed. The man who is guilty of such folly deserves to lose his crop for his ains. Such more might be said on the growth of this valuable root, but the experience of the writer justified him in saying that, if the few rules he has here laid own were but generally observed, the same quantity of land which is now devoted to it would yield at least a third more produce, and that it would very rarely happen that the crop would fall far below ai average. From the Work (I re land) Advertise r, October 9. <a name="potatoes1039"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. A curious fact has been stated to us by a person in the neighborhood ofCarriagline. It is, that having planted <a name="potatoes1040"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in alternate beds of sea weed and farm manure, the <a name="potatoes1041"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the latter are entirely destroyed by the prevalent disease, while those planted in the beds covered with sea weed have escaped untouched. The proportion which the infected bear to the healthy roots varies. In some places the destruction seems almost complete, and the progress of the disease is so rapid that in many others it threatens to become so. Even after brought home and housed, the <a name="potatoes1042"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are attacked. Several people who purchased in the market last- week, and found them excellent for a few days, have since been obliged to throw the remainder out, so that it is impossible, from present appearances, even to guess at the quantity which may ultimately be secured for an acre or a field. From the New England farmer. The. Of Sfase Of The <a name="potato778"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Crop. From a paper recently read before the High land Agricultural Sp9ietyof ~act land, we extract the following, without, however, adopting the authorcid127s thlaoI  by the ca of the .disease : "the first symptom, of he de nerve cy of the <a name="potato779"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant in Scotfland
. #i3appeaed about the year 1780, when the dis temper called the curl first appeared in the crop; but it occurred so rarely that very little notice was taken of it; but the evil gradually and extensively increased; and, about the years 1784 85, the whole crops of the Lothians were seriously affected by it. A remedy, however, was accidentally discovered, by changing the seed for that from the high country; and this has been the only remedy for the curl, up to the present time. From 1835 i to the present year (1845) the seed has had to be changed yearly, as it was found a new disease appeared in the fields. This was called the wet and dry rot; and, in many instances, seed from n all situations, high and low, has now failed. These two kinds of disease are variously accounted for. Some ascribe the the cause to maggotcid127s and f les feeding upon and destroying the seed plants; but this is a consequence, and not a cause, for maggots and flies are only to be found on diseased or putrid vegetation. Plant a sound <a name="potato780"><mark>potato</mark></a> in a good soil, and, properly treated, it will find its way to the surface, and produce a good crop in defiance of all maggots and flies. The <a name="seeds68"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of disease, then, I must be in the constitution of the plant n examining a diseased <a name="potato781"><mark>potato</mark></a>, it is plain that there is cancer on the skin and plague spots all over it. This, if planted, will certainly be attacked by maggots and flies; but the plant is in a state of decay or putrefaction, and hence it belongs to them by right of inheritance. The great object, then, is to plant sound seed. As the crops on the high lands are early checked by frost, and the tops or haul m soon destroyed, they do not fully ripe n; and this circumstance has induced farmers in the low districts to t a ke up their crops for seed in a green: or unripe state, in order to imitate the operations of nature on the hill grounds. But this plan has also failed. Need has often been raised from the ball, but in two or three years it curls and degenerates in looking at the origin, general history, cultivation, and general management of the <a name="potato782"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant in this country, I have been led to the conclusion that there can be only one cause for the failure of the plant, viz :over cultivation. The crop too often repeated on the same soil, and too much stimulus applied to the plant, has weakened or destroyed its vital energies, and rendered it incapable of reproduction. In the cultivation and general management of the plant, we have entirely lost sight of nature which always follows the moderate or middle course; and, by a long train of mismanagement, we have nearly lost this most valuable root. Who can contemplate a luxuriant crop of growing <a name="potatoes1043"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in full bloom, but must reflect on the immense stimulus applied to produce such a mass of stem, foliage, and blossom, and, at the same time, how much the roots or tubes must be enfeebled and exhausted in producing it ?a" *a* *a* I would advise the experiment of stopping or cutting the <a name="potato783"><mark>potato</mark></a> tops with a sickle about the time of the decay of the blossoms, in case the tops are too luxuriant. This will not only prevent their seeing, but check the, luxuriant e of the stems, and save the tubes from exhaustion. It is well known that turniprot is produced by excessive maturing; and I have long entertained the idea that smut in wheat, barley, and oats has always arisen from over cultivation. Very farmer has gone upon the principle that too much stimulus could not be applied to his crops; but the de genera cy of the seed or root has not been thought of he observe that in this country neither the rot in <a name="potatoes1044"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> nor the smut in grain can be attributed to excessive manuringthats sure 614 a. From the London Gardeners' Chronicle, Sov. 15. The <a name="potato784"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Crop. I have sent you three <a name="potatoes1045"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are evidently nearly delayed by the prevailing disease, to show that it has in no way injured their vitality they are self sown at least were left in the ground when the crop was taken up last August and September, when I perceived them affected, but not ripe. I let them lie on the ground, exposed for a few days, and then pitted them quite dry, in the usual way, picking out all that appeared affected, examining them occasionally. Last week I thought it advisable to throw all out of the pit, and have now laid them out in heaps in a dry left, well covered with straw. But of about eighty bushels, about two bushels are bad, no doubt; but if they had remained in the pit, most of them would have been lost. Those decaying I found mostly breaking from the eye, and some producing, as would appear, a young <a name="potato785"><mark>potato</mark></a>, as you will see by one sent you. Those I had planted at the same time; and on examining them this morning, I find that they remain the same as when put into the ground, with no appearance of disease spreading. I have this week been planting about three-fourths of an acre. I in general dig the ground, and plant in each row as I go on. After planting the sets, I cover them with coal ashes : this answers two purposes it keeps them dry, and also prevents slums and wire worm from injuring them. I have posted some similar to the samples sent you, and have placed them in a cool house. It will, then, be seen before the planting season, whether a diseased <a name="potato786"><mark>potato</mark></a> will affect the succeeding crops a thing well worth ascertaining. I should say, instead of destroying the most injured tubes, if a seed bed is thrown out, and the <a name="potatoes1046"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted so as not to touch each other, all those that had grown would be fit next spring to be planted out in the usual way. This would be an experiment worth trying, for no doubt seed <a name="potatoes1047"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> next season will be expensive to buy, if it be possible to get them at all. T. Mallesen. Claremont. I have just thoroughly examined seven lots of <a name="potatoes1048"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of different varieties, which were stored away for seed on the 12th of September last, in charred earth, old t an, and sawdust, charred together, and I am happy to say that the result is most satisfactory ; not one tube r is to be found the least affected by the disease; and the putrid spots are so entirely dried up, that when rubbed they c rumble or fall out; the other portion of the tube r is quite sound and of good quality. A neighbor of mine purchased a load of dry turf ashes, among which he stored about 25 cut. <a name="potatoes1049"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> about a month ago, almost every <a name="potato787"><mark>potato</mark></a> at the time of storing being more or less affected with the disease; this day he turned them over, and brought me a sample, which is sound and dry, and the disease is entirely stayed not one delayed tube r is to be found amongst them; when cooked, they are meal and well tasted. Of a lot that I spread thinly on a dry floor for seed, I have been obliged to throw away above two thirds, and the remaining portion is good for nothing : those were apparently sound when they were stored, and had been exposed for some time on a dry pavement to hard en. The fungus which attacks the affected tubes uns over them very quickly indeed, like wild fire. Charred refuse, or well burnt dry earth, or turf, rope at ashes, will at once stop the progress of the disease. I have long been. 6 15 satisfied that any of these will prevent the progress of hung i; they even prevent mushroom s pawn from spreading. I this season planted a piece of ground which had never been manured nor cropped previously to my knowledge, with different kinds of <a name="potatoes1050"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, with a view to prove, if possible, which was the best and most valuable manure among several kinds, which I applied by weight, &c, and the result is very interesting. While the tubes produced from one particular com post were fine in quality, and not in the least diseased, others of the same variety, but manured with different material, were affected to a serious extent, though they were all growing on one piece of ground. A quantity of these tubes, free from disease, were stored in the usual way, viz : covered with straw and earth. I opened the pit and looked over them, and they are still perfectly sound. James Barnes. Of cTON. I premise that my opinion which, however, I state with some diffidence is, that the proximal e cause of the malady is the superabundance of juice or moisture in the tube r, in consequence of the excessive wet of the season, causing an accumulation of watery sap, and the concurrent f rigidity of the weather, which preventing the due development of the stem and leaves, and causing their premature decay, did not afford an abundance of healthy foliage for ex having that superfluous moisture. By <a name="potatoes1051"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were grown on very flat clay land, which, though recently thorough drained, had not yet been sub soiled so as to permit the free descent of the rain water to the drains; and the weather was very wet at the time of lifting, which was unduly accelerated by the prevailing panic from the supposed destructive progress of the " disease." "I n these circumstances, I had the <a name="potatoes1052"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> carted to a lea field, intended to be broken up next year, for the convenience of a clean surface to spread them on, and obtaining sod for temporary covering. There they were laid in long narrow heaps, the different kinds separately, and covered with straw slightly drawn" and put on thatch wise, the weather still continuing damp. His covering resisted both rain and moderate frost. In examination, a day or two afterwards, the wind ward side of the heaps appeared well dried, but the other side sweating and beginning to mould the interior still more so; they were then uncovered on a dry day, spread out on the grass on either side, and put up again at night as before. In a second examination, they were found still tending in a small degree to sweat. The same process of spreading out was repeated, after the tendency to sweat disappeared, and the progress (f the i disease" to all appearance arrested. The same was the case with some of the worst of the affected <a name="potatoes1053"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which were spread on a barn floor and turned till dry. We have been unable to find, on repeated examination, that the disease in the roots so treated has made any further progress. Among the variety of opinions that have been given as to the constitutional deter i oration of this valuable root, which seems to have rendered it more easily affected by atmospheric al observations, my idea is that it has been gradually brought into what the medicos call a plethoric state, by too much forcing with manure in high conditioned land. In former times the <a name="potatoes1054"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were taken from the field and stored in cellars and other places in vast mounds, reaching from the floor to the ceiling, without injury; and the winter work- was to cut the seed <a name="potatoes1055"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> months beforehand, which 616 at the time of planting were dry and shrivelled like corks. If this opinion b his, the rie4iedy would be to plough the manure (in very moderatenuantiy) inst& the ground before winter, and even to attempt to raise without ni a are, in Lie dry soil, a small, contact, hard tube r, as a in pains ofrebifb6iag its cone  aitdtibnal vigor. I mean to try both these plans myself. In edcid127ccid127lusion, I may mention the practice of Mr. Mcbride, a farmer in this qiilrte, who says 'he has followed it for many years, and has never yet had th h small st failure in his crop. He spreads the mi an ire on the surface of is s eitbble lid and ploughs the land, planting the <a name="potatoes1056"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in every third fair row, nd drawing in with the he a little of the manure above tests. s think that the <a name="potato788"><mark>potato</mark></a> suffers in the culture by the fibres being in j tied by over much :working in the drills while in i a growing state. J. Stewart. Hepbwrn.

That such conditions were in existence in the soil cannot be doubted and as there can be no question about moving sap being only living sap, it really would seem that the stem of the <a name="potato791"><mark>potato</mark></a> was dead to all intents and purposes ; so far at least as the tubes connection with it was concerned.

Now, supposing the ft fungus in question to be of American origin and 4 new to Europeir general, is it too much to suppose that, by the continuous action of the Atlantic gales, the sporuiiles of the fungus may have been precipitated by shower condensed from American mists ?a? Whatever the cause be, it is ton me tolerably plain that, from the breadth and uniformity of its character, a. 617 as well as the simultaneous ness of its operations, it must a tribute to a cause as girl ats either wind, or rain, or electricity itself.

R. Erri Ngton0 Oultonthe tubes from which the plants have been raised this year were ripened last year in a season of almost unparalleled drought; and it appears to me that, to a certain extent, those tubes must have been assimilated (if I may use the expression) with a state of soil and atmosphere belonging almost to a tropical climate. This year the plants raised from the mi have had to contend with a season exactly the reverse. We know that. under particular circumstances, seed will entirely alter the nature of the plant, as regards its hardihood and time of ripe king, according to the circumstances in which it is grown. Winter wheat, by being sown a few years in succession in the spring, becomes a spring wheat. Barley, on the contrary, by being sown before winter, is enabled to stand weather the most severe; the same with beans. May not the same result have taken place With the <a name="potato795"><mark>potato</mark></a> tubes of last years ripe king ?a? Would they not, in all probability, have succeeded in a hot summer better, perhaps, than those planted last summer? whereas having had to bear all the vicissitudes of a wet summer, they have constitutionally failed. A Subscri not, From the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, Sov. 29, 145. The <a name="potato796"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. Salt seems to have an injurious effect, and to accelerate the growth of the fungus, or at least the decomposition of the tubes. I immersed some in a solution of salt and chloride of lime, and found them grow worse most rapidly. The tendency of the bad <a name="potatoes1057"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to sprout is very remarkable. I have seen them lying on the ground with shoots four or five inches long, and with a healthy thickness which would make them very valuable in the spring season. In every way it is evident that the root has not degenerated, for some of the sort which the late Mr. Night raised from the seed were as much affected as the oldest sorts. I have found a sprinkling of quick lime arrest the growth of the fungus, except where the decomposition of its substance has penetrated deep into the interior of the tube r. I immersion in 618 water acid elated with sulphuric acid produced the same effect, and preserves in a remarkable way the white color of the cut surface of the <a name="potato797"><mark>potato</mark></a>; but, with this treatment, it does not boil well for the table. L. Vernon. Har Court. <a name="potato798"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease In Central Ame1ri Of. At the Academy of Sciences of Paris, November 17, 1845, Monsieurboussingault communicated an extract from a letter from M. Joachimacosta, of Bogota, relative to the <a name="potato799"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease. It appears from this letter that the malady is very common on the table land of Bogotathatit is destructive in wet seasons, or even every year, in damp spots. His does not prevent the tubes being used, when the affected part has been removed. It is known that <a name="potatoes1058"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are indigenous to this plain. M. Costa does not doubt that the malady has always been known there, since it excites no alarm in the I indians, who live principally on <a name="potatoes1059"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. M. Boussingault properly remarks that, in these countries, where cultivation continues without intermission during the year, and where the tubes are consumed without the necessity of storing them, there is no fear, as with us, of a bad harvest, because it may be immediately replaced by a good one. With us, where the culture is annual, and must be preserved through winter, it is natural that we should be more concerned in a malady which may destroy the resources of a whole year. M. J. B.

With me it has been a practice, for some years past, to lay such <a name="potatoes1062"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as were not fit for table out to green daily as they are dug; and this year, at the time the disease made its appearance, I had several bushels so exposed, and perfectly green. Some of these <a name="potatoes1063"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had been exposed two months, being the refuse of the frame forced ones, and had been severed from their parent stem long before the disease was heard of; so that those who assert that it commenced in the stem or ha ulm will see that it seized those which were stem less at the same time. The malady first made its appearance here on some as heaved kidneys, planted upon the " lazy bed" fashion; the beds, however, being filled with the refuse of the garden and pleasure ground, with sufficient hot dung to excite ferment at ion. This rubbish was put in in sufficient quantity to raise the beds considerably above the level of the surrounding soil; so that it was perfectly porous and dry, and the <a name="potatoes1064"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were of the finest qualityimaginable. Shortly afterwards it manifested itself on two other pieces of the same kind-one a piece well drained and trenched the autumn before planting; and the other a piece of ground newly taken in, well drained, and deeply dug, but not trenched. a. 619 in the latter piece of ground every <a name="potato800"><mark>potato</mark></a> was rotten, and the other about one half) was lost; so that, although they suffered the most in entrenched ground, where the water could pot. pass rapidly away, perfect drainage did not stop the disease. All these <a name="potatoes1065"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were dug on the same day, and laid out to dry and green ; and though they were exposed for two months, and perfectly greened, the disease is still spreading in them. At the time these were dug, (the end of July) a peck or so was found among them that had made young shoots, and were perfectly sound. These I immediately planted with some of Chapmans kidney, for winter use; and though the latter produced a tolerable crop of sound tubes, very few of the as heaved made their appearance above ground. I examined the sets today, and find most of them sound, and intend, as an experiment, to take them up, and re plant them deeper, to see if they will produce a crop in the spring. Swm. P. Ayres. From the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette of December 6, 1845. I am sorry to add, that I saw a self set <a name="potato801"><mark>potato</mark></a> the other day, from a nearly kind, about three inches high, or, in fact, as early <a name="potatoes1066"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are generally in the middle of May, which had the mildew fungus precisely similar to those of September last; the leaf had the same black rings or spots, and decay had already commenced: this augury badly for those of the spring planting. As to those planted in spring, I am much afraid that precautions will be vain, as I have no doubt the very hedges are full of the s po rules of this sad mildew. The oak and the black thorn, and the common settle, were premature ly destroyed around the <a name="potato802"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields in this neighborhood, at the period when the mildew was at its height; they also delayed in black patches in the leaf, as the <a name="potatoes1067"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, but whether the same, or a fungus at all, I cannot say; things looked very suspicious. The oak and the settle were generally affected. R. Erri Ngton. Oui. Ton Parkwe trust there is no real cause of alarm on this head. Experiments, conducted for the purpose of ascertaining whether the disease will appear in any other crops, seem, at present, to show that there is nothing to apprehend. There can, however, be no doubt that every possible means, should be taken to secure a healthy growth next year From the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette of December 20, 1845. Remarks Of The Edi Tor. These were the just views of Mr. Garden, of Ulnae, to which we alluded last week : " We may, for a time" says this gentleman, "' raise species of diseased plants, and employ these as seed (sets) of the next crop. Nothing can be more manifest than that the offspring of diseased parents will participate in the disease, and even be incapable of cure, or of becoming the seed of a health full crop on any soil. 3* It is evident that dis 620 ceased plants may be more easily cultivated on a helpful and fresh soil than on one which is diseased and run bout. Suit the abuindtnceand health fulness of the crop are two very differ e it things. 'I t is wedilscertained that seed <a name="potatoes1068"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> (sets) taken from the feels on the higher grounds, and where <a name="potatoes1069"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been much seidomiecultivated, a e less liable to fail than those raised on fields which l have produced many ta to crops. *a* The latter, forced in diseased or: exhausted fields, rise tiifitfor seed (sets) in any situation <a name="potato803"><mark>potato</mark></a>, forced in rich land, nursed In a v warm valley, 'and i unnaturally expanded into a monster of its kind by high and debilitating mal sure, becomes well suited to the table, but has an unco6rmpacted tissue and c a feableconstittition. A small matter makes it ill. I to tnhealthiness i' corlmmtilicated to its successors, and so the evil is ceaselessly augmented. Outheother hand, a <a name="potato804"><mark>potato</mark></a> raised in poor or rocky ground, small and compact thoroughly organized by the action of healthy foliage operating upon a small surface, will not answer, indeed, the purpose of the grower of a crop, but is admirably adapted for his sets. It is not in itself market able, but it forms the be sit of seed. Thus it was that the small green stem <a name="potatoes1070"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which high cultivation has almost driven out of recollection, always proved the best of all for sets, though utterly une a table and useless for ti h table. What we then would advise growers to do, is, not to indulge in :a vain hope that needling <a name="potatoes1071"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> will be any better than what they now. have but to adopt the practice of raising <a name="potatoes1072"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for sets upon a different principle from those which are for the table ; to treat the latter as they now: do, but to grow the former in poor, light land, where there shall be no excessively rapid growth, and no great produce, but where a small, compact <a name="potato805"><mark>potato</mark></a>, thoroughly ripened, thoroughly organized, and therefore thoroughly healthy, will be a guarantee that all the freedom from disease, which, in the nature of things, is to be expected, shall be secured for the crop it is to furnish, beyond all chance of risk. If such <a name="potatoes1073"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are left in the ground all the winter un dug, or are planted in the autumn, or, if taken up, are thoroughly greened and packed in sand, and planted before sprouting, a far more rational means of renovation g the <a name="potato806"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop will be adopted than running to Peru for seed not half so good as our own. <a name="potato807"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Murrai N. It is the belief of some that a fungus is the cause of this disease. From facts, however, which have come under my own cognizance, I am led to hold a contrary opinion. I have about three or four bushels of last years <a name="potatoes1074"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> (they have been about twelve months out of the ground) that have been since spring in a corner of a tool house, held up in front by a few loose bricks; and, as might be expected, they have put forth numbers of small tubes, and the greater part of these small tubes are diseased, and bad as any that have been grown in the soil in the open air. I should suppose that the manner in which the fungus is conceived to affect them, is by a transition from the leaf to the tube r; however, in my case, it will be perceived that such is not the case, as not a single leaf has been formed. The small tubes have been produced from the intercellular tissue, or elaborated. 61 matter of the old <a name="potato808"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and without the assistance of any foliage whatsoever; but, as the tool house door stands open all day, and the <a name="potatoes1075"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not far front it, they are consequently under atmospheric influence, and the greater portion of them are covered with fungus, which seems to have proceeded in om the stop to the bottom of the heap. I have, likewise, some early <a name="potatoes1076"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that are diseased to the very centre, without a fungus having yet made its appearance upon them. These two facts surely prove that the fungus s of the primary cause of the disease, which certainly does hot occur through in the agency of the leaf. I have always been of the opinion that it is to the dull weather we have experienced that we must attribute the cause. The plants have been charged to excess with water, which, owing to the absence of sunlight, could not pass off by evaporation; this, then, has produced a disorganization of the tissues, and disease has followed in consequence. I observe an article in last weeks number setting forth the average quantity of rain that has fallen during the last eight years, as a proof that the disease is not caused by moisture. It is not the great quantity of rain that has fallen that is to be considered the cause, for we certainly have had more in other years, but the absence of bright sunlight must be kept in view; for days the sun never broke forth to dispel the moisture of the atmosphere, or to elaborate the juices of the plant. I cannot conceive any other cause for the small tubes grown in the tool house being diseased, unless it is to be ascribed to some unknown atmospheric condition. This fact sets at rest the opinion as to manure of any kind being the cause, i one whatever being present. Time cannot be considered an antidotes to the growth of fungus; for a great quantity of diseased <a name="potatoes1077"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> 'here has been well dosed some time ago with caustic lime, and on many of them the fungus is abundant; not even drying and greening by exposure will entirely prevent its growth, as I myself have proved, although it does partially. Mr. Tyres remarks that he cannot add his testimony to the beneficial effects of greening. If the <a name="potatoes1078"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are diseased previously to greening, the disease will proceed, although much more slowly; and such, I have no doubt, was Mr. Dress case. Such is the case with some of mine; but greening <a name="potatoes1079"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for seed, if perfectly sound, I believe does produce beneficial effects. That the <a name="potatoes1080"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have received the disease during their growth, I feel firmly convinced; otherwise they would not receive it after, for I have some as heaved kidneys green, and ripened early on a raised slope in the garden, and greened by a long exposure, and they are now as promising seed as I could wish, and I have no fear that they would have remained sound if not greened. The question for seed another year appears to me a serious one. I am afraid planting <a name="potatoes1081"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> diseased at all, either now or in the spring, will prove a fruitless effort, as I doubt not they will rot when they come in contact with the moisture of the soil. ,HENRY. Wood. From the Manchester Guardian. Of I E <a name="potato809"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. At a (cid127meeting of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, Or l. Aclampbdil, murat or of the botany c gardens, stated that he had tested the 422 efficacy of fungating with sulphur, suggested by Mr. Horn, and had found that in those <a name="potatoes1082"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>' which had been subjected to the process the disease never made any further progress, even though they were subsequently placed in contact with diseased tubes. He also referred to other experiments, most of which went to prove the necessity of exposing the <a name="potatoes1083"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to light and air, and the evil effects of hugging or pitting them. Mr. Pale said he had planted a <a name="potato810"><mark>potato</mark></a> which had been fungated, and found it to ve get ate as well as those to which sulphur had not been applied. The whole of the observations that were made confirmed the accounts previously given, and light and air, a good ventilation, and a frequent examining and turning of the <a name="potatoes1084"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, are the most effective agents in checking the disease. From the Dark Lane Express, December 1, 1845. <a name="potato811"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. From the Leicestershire Agricultural Report. To much has been said and written upon this matter, by the learned and the unlearned, it would be presumptuous in us to make any lengthened remark as to what means should be taken to arrest the malady; but, as it is generally admitted that it proceeds from an excess of water in the tube r, we believe the best way to preserve them is to cut every <a name="potato812"><mark>potato</mark></a> in two, or if small, a considerable piece off them, which gives vent to the watery matter; and if they are stored in chaff, s lacked lime, or anything of a drying nature, they are likely to escape the decay which otherwise awaits them. Even the saving of some for seed becomes a matter of great importance. There is 'no fear as to the diseased tubes growing, as a friend of ours stated he had seen sets with shoots more than an inch long from diseased <a name="potatoes1085"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which lay in a warm place. We believe that, in this country, not one-sixth the usual quantity will be preserved until the spring. From the Berkshire Agricultural Report. We know not whether the dis temper, that certainly has prevailed with more or less violence, is likely to be reproduced by the tubes hereafter to be planted; but it cannot be doubted that the painted ones are wonderfully excitable. The eyes, if they do not push shoots, are inclined to produce a perfect young tube r; and therefore a full experiment ought to be tried at once, by sowing extensively such <a name="potatoes1086"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as are sound within, though affected superficially taking care to cover each row with at least twelve inches of good earth. Another method of planting might be to make drills, six inches deep and two feet asunder, covering first with earth, and then with as much coal ashes. These could be raked off in spring, and scattered over grass or c lover land, to which latter they are applicable, especially when they contain gypsy m, of which we have detected, occasionally, nearly ten per cent. Another fact is worthy of mention. Though no one can doubt the attack of the haul m as the early indicator of disease, in
623the first period of its attack, about August, yet the condition of the leaf in October and November was no certain index. Two plots of <a name="potatoes1087"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, standing side by side in one field, each about forty yards long, ten yards wide, exhibited appearances totally different. One, the Jersey blues, had no sign of vegetable life remaining early in October; its neighbor, a white variety, was very ant as spring. Suddenly, the latter became affected at the close of October, and both were dug up about the 10th November instant. The blue s those which were black six weeks before the others gave any sign of disease were nearly all sound. Of the whites, 150 bushels were raised, and only 18 remained fit for pigs !from the Dark Lane Express, December 1, 1845. <a name="potato813"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. To the Editor of the Salisbury and Winchester Journalsi  : It is now some years since, after a severe winter, and the snow lying long on the <a name="potato814"><mark>potato</mark></a> pits, I found, on opening them, a very considerable portion apparently completely destroyed by the frost. My bailiff was about taking them to the dung heap; but, with no trifling difficulty, I induced him to fill our steaming tubs, and, to my delight and astonishment, we found, after the operation, their contents as fair, and the meal as fine, as from the <a name="potatoes1088"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that were perfect. It is now about three years since that I discovered a pit containing about a hundred sacks of <a name="potatoes1089"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, showing a sinking upon the surface, which induced me to suspect mischief. I directed them to be opened; and theeffluvium arising from them was frightful. We found nine tenths of them more or less affected. I would not, however, throw them away without trying the effect of steam; when again, to my surprise, the offensive matter was removed, and the remainder was perfect and fit for use. I scarce need say that I am pursuing the same operation with the diseased <a name="potatoes1090"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the present year, and have great pleasure in stating, with the most perfect success. I have grown between seven and eight hundred sacks, of which I consider nearly one-fourth to be more or less affected; but all fit for the steamer. When thoroughly steamed, and not required for immediate use, it would be desirable to place them in a tub or vat, (but sunk in the ground to keep them air tight) and thoroughly beaten with wooden hammers. A little salt sprinkled over them during this latter operation will keep them sweet and fit for use for many months to come. J. Peni Ston. Renovati   Of Of The <a name="potato815"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Seed. Having three times, during a long life, raised <a name="potatoes1091"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the seed, and minutely observed the progress of vegetation from the period of sowing to62
the maturity of the crop, and having given my best attention t t the culture in every stage, my, practical experience and observations convince me that the time has now arrived which makes it imperative to re nova te the <a name="potato816"><mark>potato</mark></a> by seed. The first step in this experiment is to collect the balls, or seed ferries, or <a name="potato817"><mark>potato</mark></a> apples, as they are called, and place them in a dry situation; but these would have been found with greater facility before the late crop was raised; yet there are a sufficient number to be found scattered about the land where they grew, on every farm. The apples, having been hoarded till as mellow as ripe plums, must be squeezed by hand in a basin of water, till the tough skin and pulp are well separated from the seed, the latter of which will readily quit the former, and precipitate to the bottom of the basin; the water must be poured off and the seed spread thinly on a coarse cloth to drain and absorb the remainder of the water; and then removed and spread upon brown paper, and, when perfectly dry, must be well preserved till the following spring, for sowing. I have found the most favorable time for depositing the seed in the ground, well pulverized, is the second week in May, or whereabouts; at this late period the probable occurrence of frosty nights may be less prevalent than at an earlier sowing, as the tender plants springing up are extremely susceptible of the least frost. The operation of sowing may be performed precisely the same as with onion seed, and there will be no particular care to be further taken before the time of transplantation. The seed will come up freely, and the plants, when elongated three or four inches, should be carefully raised with as much root as possible adhering, and removed into small trenches ready to receive them, and planted to the depth of the under leaves, distant about six inches apart in the trench, the trenches being about fifteen asunder; and the ear thing up maybe performed in the usual way as the plants progress; but the transplanting operation will be more favorably done should the earth then possess natural moisture. As the plants advance towards maturity, some will exhibit great luxuriant e a long time, and others will sooner appear to droop the latter indicate an earlier sort, and may be distinguished by placing a little stick at the haul m. The process now terminates; but the fruits of the labor in raising the ripe crop will present a scene to the operator truly wonderful and amusing; he will behold amongst the vast variety of new <a name="potatoes1092"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, at the roots, from the size of a pea to that of a bullets egg, purples, whites, fiats, rounds, kidneys, &c in fact, such demonstrations of the sports, freaks, and vagaries of nature, as are truly astonishing. These new roots must be planted whole the following season; and after, they will be in perfection for selection as future stock. Of. Nex. Gloi  cESTER, November 19. From the Dark Lane Express, December 8, 1845. To the Editor of the Dublin Evening Postdear Him: The disease of the <a name="potato818"><mark>potato</mark></a>, I believe, arises from an excess of moisture in the tube r. It is not surprising that <a name="potatoes1093"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> sur charged with moisture should heat and decay when deposited in close pits. Train put premature ly together would likewise decay. With respect to diseased .625 <a name="potatoes1094"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I have to observe, that I cut some of them with a view to ascertain whether the disease would go forward in the sound when removed from the diseased part. More than three weeks have elapsed, and the disease has not made further progress in the diseased portion, whilst the sound continues sound. The superfluous moisture appears to have escaped by the incision, and the disease to have been arrested in its progress. It appears to me that the redundant fluids of the <a name="potato819"><mark>potato</mark></a> press towards the outer rim, and not finding a vent, the disease commences like a bruise, round the rim, or in the weak est part of the <a name="potato820"><mark>potato</mark></a>. But the <a name="potato821"><mark>potato</mark></a> across, and, as far as I have observed, the disease is arrested, when the operation is timely performed. I dwell on this, because I fear a considerable portion of the crop will, from time to time, become diseased, and because I conceive the cutting of the <a name="potato822"><mark>potato</mark></a> will save the greatest part, at least for present use, as human food; and I think it, moreover, probable, that in many instances it will be found expedient, as a measure of precaution, to cut a portion from the sound <a name="potatoes1095"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for seed or other purposes, and thus relieve from their superfluous moisture. With respect to a future crop, I would strongly recommend that all small <a name="potatoes1096"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be reserved for seed. It has been generally remarked they are this year the sound est; and this, probably, arises from there not being such a body of superfluous fluid in them as in the large. I have proved, by experiments, the great value of small <a name="potatoes1097"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted entire. They should be closer set than the large ones; and, if properly attended to, a full crop may be expected. I perceive by the public papers that a learned German professor, and others, expect relief next year from the seed of the apple, to be sown in the spring. It is certainly most desirable that the raising new kinds from seed should be generally adopted; but, as far as my experience goes, it is some years before new kinds are fit for human food, and the proportion of those which prove eventually good is very small. In consequence of the partial failure of the <a name="potato823"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in 1831, I sowed the seed of the white apple and pink eyed species in 1832, in the same manner as ce very. The young plants are very delicate. They should be transplanted when sufficiently strong, in drills. A perch of ground produced 102 pounds, and exhibited a great variety of kinds. Each kind had its trial for one or more years; and such as were considered incapable of improvement were rejected. Ultimately, two kinds only were considered worthy of cultivation; and I send you specimens of one of them, which I call the Palmerston apple cap, from having been cultivated there. You will perceive that it is an excellent <a name="potato824"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I have more than 30 tons of this kind most valuable for seed. The disease in this species was by no means so bad, nor to one tenth of the extent that pervaded apple <a name="potatoes1098"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the old kind, which adjoined them in the field. Their constitution being more vigorous, resisted the disease; but there was disease amongst them, and the same superabundance of moisture that may generally be perceived in <a name="potatoes1099"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> this year. Hours, faithfully, Leland Crossthwai T40626
. From the same, Dear Of  R : An industrious person, for whom I entertain a regard, and whose crop of <a name="potatoes1100"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> consisted of about three tons, of excellent quality, obtained leave to place them on a spacious air drying left, which afforded an opportunity of spreading them thin. After the lapse of a few days they lost their bright color, and were discovered to be so seriously affected, particularly the largest and finest, that they were of little value. I prevented him from throwing away a quantity of them. They have since been cut across, and the progress of further decay has been arrested; and the color in a great measure restored. Those which were accidentally cut with the spade almost entirely escaped; and also the small ones, with little exception. They will all be reserved, and will, I doubt not, make excellent seed. As to the large <a name="potatoes1101"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the keen air to which they were exposed checked evaporation, contracted the outer coat, thereby causing a pressure on the <a name="potatoes1102"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in a state of plethoric, as they mostly are this year, and producing the bruised appearance, which has been considered a particular disease of so insidious a character as to render <a name="potatoes1103"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> so affected unfit even for pigs. I find, in an article from Power Saxony, November 6, that amongst the methods adopted to stay the malady, which had accelerated and increased its ravages, was that of large cultivates having exposed the dugotatbulbs to a current of air. It thus appears that the same cause in places so far asunder, has produced the same effect, and it may probably be inferred that the disease is the same. It has been by many considered that the disease proceeded from the leaves and stem to the root; but some <a name="potatoes1104"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are affected at the butt, whilst the crown is quite sound. Others suppose that the disease proceeds from fungus; but, as far as I have observed, when this does appear, it is not until a <a name="potato825"><mark>potato</mark></a> has reached an extreme state of decay, and it seems to be the consequence rather than the cause of the disease; besides, hung i are occasionally discovered every year in delayed <a name="potatoes1105"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Greatly alarmed a month back, I intended that all the s talks should be burnt, in order to prevent the supposed infection from spreading; but close observation has altogether changed my opinion, and they have been added to the dung hill. It has also been said that late <a name="potatoes1106"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were the most subject to the infection ; but nearly one half of the old apple <a name="potatoes1107"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, to which I referred in a former letter, and which were planted in March, were diseased; while, in three-fourths of an acre of " Palmerstonapplecap <a name="potatoes1108"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>" planted 3d July, after a crop of rye used for green feeding, only th part has hitherto proved to be affected; but, on the other hand, <a name="potatoes1109"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted before the severe frost of last winter escaped entirely. I mention the latter circumstance, lest an opinion might otherwise be considered as having been given in favor of late planting, which ought to be avoided, except under particular circumstances. In order to ascertain whether the disease could communicate any injury by being put in contact with the sound part of a <a name="potato826"><mark>potato</mark></a>, I cut diseased <a name="potatoes1110"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> across, which were sound in the centre, made excavations in them, put pieces of highly injured <a name="potatoes1111"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to fit therein, and then tied the cut pieces closely together. In opening them after some days, I found that the disease had not been communicated to the sound parts, but that the diseased parts had materially improved. My friend Air James Surrey, who had read my letters to you, informed me on Friday last, that u amongst. 627 other experiments, he cut off the sound part of a <a name="potato827"><mark>potato</mark></a> from the diseased, and applied a preparation of lime to it. The result was, that the application deteriorated the sound part, whilst the mere incision, without any application, improved the diseased part. Leland Crossthwai T. From the Dark Lane Express and Agricultural Journal, of December 15, 1845. Major Beami  Shs Experi Ment. We are authorized to state that the simple method of rendering diseased <a name="potatoes1112"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> available for human food by boiling them in two waters, (the first being thrown away when it has reached the boiling point) has been tried by Major Beamish with complete success. He purchased, we are informed, last week, 100 weights of so called diseased <a name="potatoes1113"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, at the current deprecated rate of twopence per weight, for the purpose of giving them to cattle, (concerning, with the seller, that they were fitted for no other purpose) and had already applied many of them to that use; but after seeing a statement in the public prints, he had a portion taken indiscriminately from the heap and boiled according to the prescribed directions. The result was in every respect corroborate ve of the first experiment. The whole of the black acrid matter, which in few cases extended beyond the skin, was completely extracted by the first water, and the <a name="potatoes1114"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, when served up to table, after the second boiling, presented as sound an appearance and were as dry and pal a table as any <a name="potatoes1115"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the kind, under the most favorable circumstances. They were the common white lump era horse <a name="potato828"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and were cooked in their jackets From the Dark Lane Express and Agricultural Journal, of December 2, 1845. The <a name="potato829"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. The assertion of a fact seems to me to offer a clue to this great enigma which has afforded so much excitement. It is the presence of sulphuretedhydrogen in rain water in and during the latter end of summer. This I observed, and proved by chemical means; indeed, the water was so much impregnated with it that the presence of lead turned it to a deep brown. This fact, I find, does not only rest upon my own observation, but acute observers, who have no pretension to science whatever, have noticed this peculiar state of rain water at times, and even at miles distant. Now this cannot be a mere local case, for there is no local cause. It must be more universal than in the immediate neighborhood, as there is nothing to afford the slightest cause for its being generated; and though it is sometimes given out in vegetable decay, as in pools, &c, yet it made its appearance at a time when Britains verdure was at its height. Thus, there does not appear any probable cause for so remarkable a phenomenon in England; so, consequently, we must look for a cause beyond the sea. The remarkable excavations of some of the European volcanoes, which have been reported, seem to afford a probable cause for its existence, as the property of this gas on mixing with water is well known. Now, having seen that such did exist in rain water, and that, in all probe 28 C )to. 1 ability, it originated with some volcanic eruption, let us see the likelhoiodof its being the cause of <a name="potato830"><mark>potato</mark></a> decay. It is reported that it is not known in the more southern countries; this is what one might expect from such a cause, and to suggest a theory of its probable manner of acting. I to power of deoxydizing metallic oxides in solution is well known to chemists. Now, according to Sprengeps analysis. <a name="potatoes1116"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> contain, of their weight, about , i both part of oxide of iron. The impregnated water acting upon <a name="potatoes1117"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in deoxydizing the iron, might produce, to all appearance, little effect at the moment; yet, in process of time, the iron would begin to attract oxygen again, when hydrogen would be liberated, and, by the vis inertia, combine with the nitrogen, and produce a decay in the <a name="potato831"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Such a theory appears probable, though it may not be quite correct but at all events, I have, by artificial means, produced similar results. I took a few small round <a name="potatoes1118"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> the best I could pick and stepped the min strong impregnated water two or three days. I then poured off the water, when they appeared no different. In the course of two or three days or so, I found some of them covered with a white mould, and all beginning to feel rather soft; and about the fourth night, all going more or less some presenting nearly throughout a gray appearance, much after the manner of those 1 have examined that have gone of themselves; and, indeed, a practical farmer told me they quite resembled some of his ; and      also found a considerable quantity of starch, to all appearance no worse, which I extracted out of the worst part. This experiment goes to prove the preceding views. It is also reported they all went not in the tubes, but in the stalk. Now, the water soaking into the stalk would show itself there first; but the impregnated water, in passing through the soil, would become partly de composed, though not quite so ; consequently, it seems to harmonize with the account. It has also been stated that Mr. Seess suggestion of chlorine has also restored them. Now chlorine, as well as its antiseptic properties, decomposes sulphur e ted hydrogen. Thus, all reports serve to corroborate the truth of what has been stated, and much more might be stated in its favor; but, after seeing that the presence of a gas in rain water a produce of volcanic eruption at a time when such were pouring out most furiously and when there was no other probable cause it makes it almost indisputable that such was the origin of it; and having shown that this was capable of producing dire effects upon <a name="potatoes1119"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, these, together with other corroborations, place it also t without doubt, wanting nothing but a philosophic history of the disease, together with the state of the winds, to make it as clear as if Duc lid had demonstrated it. Baougi o Ton In Furness, December 6, 1845. From the same. Of Seased <a name="potatoes1120"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>. Our attention has been called to a circumstance which may be of service to those who are employed at the <a name="potato832"><mark>potato</mark></a> mills, among the diseased <a name="potatoes1121"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Two men belonging to the town, employed some weeks ago among the <a name="potatoes1122"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> preparing for the new mill at Friar town, happened to get (one a thumb and the other a finger) slightly scratched; but so trifling were the Doc: To: 1 400 629 wounds that they paid no attention to them, and continued at their work two or three days after. The injuries, however, continuing to increase in severity, the limbs having become dreadfully swollen and painful, they were obliged to drop work. The swelling, accompanied with the most severe inflammation, continued to increase, extending along the hand and up the arm; and to such a state has i it increased that at the present time it is doubtful whether both the workmen may not require amputation of their arms to be performed. A boy, about eight years of age, while engaged in grating diseased <a name="potatoes1123"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, about five weeks ago, to make weavers' dressing, got a finger scratched upon the greater, and is also in a state of suffering similar to that stated. This leads to the belief that there must be some highly poisonous quality in the <a name="potatoes1124"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, of which it would be well for those who work among them with broken skin to beware. From the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, November 1, 1845,REPORT Of I Of Of Commi  Ssi  Oners. The commissioners in I re land, directed to inquire into the disease which has attacked the <a name="potato833"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in the United Kingdom, consist of Professorskane, Lay fair, and Kindly. Their first report, directed merely towards the prevention of improper methods of storing the crop, has been published by the I wish government, and attributed, by means of the constabulary, through the whole country. We re print it, and shall continue to give our readers the succeeding reports as soon as they have been made public. Is they will contain all that is considered worth recording respecting this fatal disease, it will be needless hence forward to occupy much space with other comments. As we said before, the issuing of this commission is a sufficient proof of the prevalence of the <a name="potato834"><mark>potato</mark></a> murray in to a most formidable extent, and of the accuracy of the view we have always taken of its importance. We by no means blame those who, disbelieving the extent of the mischief that has been done to this crop, charged us with exciting undue alarm. They had not our means of gaining information. We hope, however, that on a future occasion, when we shall again have to anticipate the ordinary intelligence of newspapers, if such an occasion should unhappily arise, those who disbelieved us in the present instance will give us credit for not making assertions without due authority. In I re land the official inquiry is essentially aided by the important evidence collected by various diligent inquirers, especially by the Royal I rishgricultural I improvement Society, a inst zealous and useful association, and the officers of the Royal Dublin Society. In England the Rev. M. Joberkley and Mr. Edward Folly are occupied with a minute investigation of the subject for the Horticultural Society, in the my co logical and chemical points of view; and in Scotland the Agricultural Chemistry .association have put forth a circular inviting the public to subscribe five hundred pounds !a! for the expense of an entomologicobotanicochemicopracticalexamination of the subject. The following is the report above alluded to :a* Boa0ndroom, Royal Dubli  - Soci    Etwy, October 24, 1845."MY Love R He, the undersigned, commissioners appointed by her Majestys government acid 127) report to your excellency on the state of disease 00 B i No. 140.in the <a name="potato835"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, and on the means of its prevention, have the honor; to, inform your excellency that we, are pursuing our inquiries with unremitting. attention 6" We are fully sensible of the important and difficult nature of the inquiry, and therefore are unwilling to offer, at the present moment, any final recommendations, as we are still receiving evidence, and awaiting the results of various experiments now in progress. But at the same time, we, ought to state to your excellency that we have reason to hope that the progress of the disease may be retarded by the application of simple means, which, we trust, may appear worthy of adoption, until we are enabled to offer further recommendations." In the present communication we avoid entering into any account of the origin or nature of the disease; but we would particularly direct attention to the ascertained facts, that moisture hastens its progress, and that it is capable of being communicated to healthy <a name="potatoes1125"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> when they are in contact with such as are already painted. A knowledge of these facts, determined as they have been by experiment, and agreeing with the scientific information obtained as to the causes and nature of the disease, leads us to propose the adoption of the following plan for diminishing the evils arising from the destructive malady :of  n the event of a continuance of dry weather, and in soils tolerably dry, we recommend that the <a name="potatoes1126"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be allowed for the present to remain in the land; but if wet weather intervene, or if the soil be naturally wet, we consider that they should be removed from the ground without delay When the <a name="potatoes1127"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are dug out of the ground, we are decidedly of opinion that they should not be pitted in the usual way, as the circumstances under which <a name="potatoes1128"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are placed in ordinary pits are precisely those which tend to hasten their decay he recommend that <a name="potatoes1129"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, when dug, should be spread over the field, and not collected into heaps; and if the weather continue dry and free from frost, that they should be allowed to lie upon the field for a period of time not exceeding three days." The <a name="potatoes1130"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, after being thus dried and improved in their power of resisting disease, by the means proposed, should then be sorted by carefully separating those which show any tendency to decay. Those <a name="potatoes1131"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which appear to be sound should then be placed about two inches apart in a layer, and over each layer of <a name="potatoes1132"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be placed a layer of turf ashes, or dry turf mould, or dry sand, or burnt clay, to the depth of a few inches. Thus will be formed a bed of <a name="potatoes1133"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, each <a name="potato836"><mark>potato</mark></a> being completely separated from the other by a dry absorption material; upon this bed another layer of <a name="potatoes1134"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be spread in like manner, and also .be covered with the dry materials employed. As many as four layers may thus be placed one above the other; and when the heap is completed, it should be covered with dry clay, straw, heath, or any other material adapted to protect it from rain." In the event of the weather becoming wet, these recommendations are not applicable. In that case, we would advise the <a name="potatoes1135"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be packed in small heaps, with either straw or heath interposed, and well covered ; in such a situation they should become as well dried as seems practicable under the circumstances. When outbuildings exist, it would be advisable that this mode of temporary packing should be carried on in those places. If there be no outhouses. the heaps may be left in the open field. He, a. 631 however, particularly recommend that <a name="potatoes1136"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should not be removed into inhabited rooms With regard to the treatment of <a name="potatoes1137"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> already attacked with the disease, we have to state that in this early stage of our investigation, we do not feel justified in proposing to your excellency any mode of positive treatment: this subject we reserve for a future report; but we may remark that exposure to light and dryness in all cases retards the progress of alterations such as the disease in question, and we therefore suggest that all such <a name="potatoes1138"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should, as far as possible, be so treated." We do not mean to represent that these recommendations, if carried into effect, will prevent the occurrence of disease in <a name="potatoes1139"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; but we feel assured that the decay will extend less rapidly and less extensively under these circumstances, than if the <a name="potatoes1140"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, when taken from the ground, beat once pitted in the usual manner. Either do we offer these suggestions to your excellency as a final means of securing the crop, but merely as a method of retarding the progress of an enemy whose history and habits are yet but imperfectly known, whilst we endeavor to ascertain the means of more completely counteracting its injurious effects, if any such can bediscoveredAll which we submit to your excellencys consideration, and remain, your excellencys obedient and faithful servants, "ROBERT Kane, "JOHN Of   Ndley, "LYON Playfai R." To His Excellency Baron Heytesbury, &from the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, Sov. 8, 1845. Second Report Of I Of Of Commi  Ssi  Oners. Boardroom, Royal Dubli   N Soci    Ety, October 2 , 1845. Of Lori : Having submitted to your excellency, in a former report, some preliminary instructions intended to prevent improper treatment of the <a name="potato837"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop still remaining unaffected, we now have the honor to lay before your excellency our views regarding some processes of treatment for the <a name="potato838"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which appear to us to be of practical value and importance. We are deeply sensible of the in completeness of form which this mode of presenting our results to your excellency necessarily assumes, but theexigencies of the case are such, that we consider it our highest duty to bring at once under the notice of her Majestys government such principles, or modes of practice, as, upon due consideration, we feel authorized to recommend. We have been engaged in the investigation of many plans for preserving diseased <a name="potatoes1141"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as proposed by other persons, or suggested by ourselves, and we have been collecting precise information as to the experience of others in their endeavors to arrest the progress of the disease. From all the results that we have obtained, we feel justified in submitting to your excellency the following observations 6 82, 
OPlans of treatment have been proposed by persons possessing more or less chemical knowledge, in which, by some, acids are to be employed; in others, alkaline liquors; and in a third class, gases, such as chlorine. These processes we dismiss from further consideration, as, even did they in the laboratory answer the intended purpose, they are totally inapplicable to the circumstances of the produce of an entire county, and to a population such as that for whose welfare your excellency is so deeply anxious. Other methods, apparently more practical, consist in the treatment of the <a name="potatoes1142"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with chloride of lime (be aching powder) and salt, either separate or in mixture. The result of our own experiments, and the evidence we have received concerning trials made by persons in whom we have full confidence, authorize us at once to recommend the rejection of those materials. We have found the decomposition of the <a name="potato839"><mark>potato</mark></a> decidedly accelerated by their application. With respect to lime, the results of our own experiments are not yet decisive; nor is the experience of others as yet satisfactory. He therefore reserve this point for further consideration. Whilst the disease is not yet very far advanced in the <a name="potato840"><mark>potato</mark></a>, it is certain that, after being boiled or steamed, it may be employed as food for immediate use, both for man and other animals, without prejudice to health. When the disease is more advanced, so as to have invaded a large part of the <a name="potato841"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and when the tubes have acquired a disagreeable smell, their influence on the system is more questionable. We have put in operation a series of experiments in order to determine this point, and will, in due time, report the result to your excellency. Is, however, the <a name="potato842"><mark>potato</mark></a>, when once affected, quickly runs into total decomposition if left to itself, it is evident that its consumption merely for the purpose of food cannot be sufficiently rapid; and it therefore becomes necessary to consider to what other uses it may be applied. The extraction of starch from <a name="potatoes1143"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and its use as food, having strongly attracted public attention, and conflicting and in many cases inaccurate opinions having been entertained on this subject, we consider it of paramount importance at once to direct your excellencys attention to the actual state of knowledge regarding this material. It is recognised that the <a name="potato843"><mark>potato</mark></a>, in relation either to its weight or bulk, is one of the most inferior articles of food. In its ordinary state of sound constitution, every hundred pounds by weight of <a name="potatoes1144"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> contain, on an average, 74 pounds of water, of Skin and fibrous matter 8 pounds, and of starch 16 pounds; whilst of glum ten, the most nutritions of vegetable matters, and which predominates in corn, there is not more than 2 pounds in the above quantity. It is quite certain that starch, or materials corresponding to it, exist to a certain amount in every variety of useful food but it is equally certain that in food, starch is not the material which serves for the support of the animal frame; and an animal fed on starch dies of starvation nearly if not quite so soon as if totally deprived of food. Hence starch, extracted from the <a name="potato844"><mark>potato</mark></a>, cannot be viewed as a substitute for the <a name="potato845"><mark>potato</mark></a> itself; and we consider it of great importance that while the attention of the people is directed to the real value of starch, and the uses to which it may be advantageously applied, they should not be allowed to rest their hopes of nourishment during the succeeding season upon any store of it alone. With this preliminary caution, we have to state to your excellency that: 633 probably the best use to which diseased <a name="potatoes1145"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be applied is the extraction of starch. In a commercial point of view, the starch represents a considerable proportion of the value of the <a name="potato846"><mark>potato</mark></a>, although it is not at present in as large a quantity in the unsound tubes as in those which are free from disease. The extraction is simple, and consists in processes which we need not here describe, as they are given in the current publications of the day, and indeed are already practised in most parts of the country. Your excellency is aware that we are directing our attention to the manner in which starch can be advantageously employed. It can be worked off, and With utility, as food, when mixed with proportions of o at meal, bean meal, or peas meal; and such inter mixture forms ah excellent and economical article of food. It is also to be remarked that the pulp remaining after the extraction of the starch from the diseased <a name="potatoes1146"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> contains a considerable quantity of nutrition material; and as the decomposing substance is, to a very great extent, washed out during the preparation, the pulp may, when dried, be applied with confidence to the nourishment of animals. Further, if the dried starch extracted from the <a name="potato847"><mark>potato</mark></a> be mixed up with the dry residual pulp, a material will be produced really representing the <a name="potato848"><mark>potato</mark></a>, equivalent to it as food, and, if kept dry, capable of being preserved for a considerable length of time. It of course must be prepared for use by cooking or baking in the ordinary way. The manufacture of the pulp and starch on an extensive scale, in accordance with these suggestions, we venture to consider worthy of your excellencys attention. It is an operation not suited to the circumstances of isolated potters, and just now might not be a proper object for commercial speculation. But arrangements might possibly be made for carrying out this recommendation through the agency of the poor laws unions, and other government establishments, in which mechanical power and intelligent superintendence could be speedily and economically applied. We feel, however, that even these facilities for the conversion of the tubes may not be sufficient to keep pace with the progressive injury which, it is to be feared, the <a name="potato849"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is sustaining. We therefore recommend a mode by v which we believe the process of decomposition may be retarded. In our preliminary report we mentioned to your excellency the important influence exercised upon the disease by moisture and dryness. Our subsequent investigations have confirmed this opinion; and we believe, where means exist for a more complete drying of the tubes, such a method will prove the most efficacious plan for preserving the <a name="potato850"><mark>potato</mark></a> from further decay. This more perfect drying cannot, however, be effected in this climate by mere exposure to air. It requires artificial heat, applied in some form of kill; and without entering into mechanical details, we may name some contrivances which seem well adapted to the purpose. The corn kills, extensively distributed through the country, may at once be applied to the drying of <a name="potatoes1147"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; which will, however, demand a temperature rendered gradually higher than that required for corn. But as in many cases those kills are at present fully occupied, we would represent that every lime kill may be adapted to the purpose without interfering with its ordinary operations, by erecting over it, at a suitable height above its mouth, a framework of hur does, upon which the <a name="potatoes1148"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be spread in a thin layer, fresh <a name="potatoes1149"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being added as the others become dry and a rete No140removed. In localities where the previous means do p it exist, or may, o the. on a sufficiently extensive scale, <a name="potatoes1150"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be spread on a frcid127gcid127ework of hur does, supported on a few props of stone two or three feet high one or two turf fires burning slowly under the hur does would effect the same object. There need be no fear of the <a name="potatoes1151"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> becoming slightlycid127browned, as they are not injured thereby for future use; and the turf smoke would act favorably on the <a name="potatoes1152"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rather than otherwise. In all these modes of drying, the <a name="potatoes1153"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be cut into two, or, if very large, three pieces, so as to allow the water to escape. <a name="potatoes1154"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> dried in any of the modes above described are certainly capable of being preserved, when kept in a dry place and stored with the precautions described in our first report, until suitable opportunities arise for converting them into starch or meal, according to the degree in which they were affected by the disease. It is gratifying to us to find that our own opinions as to the advantage of thoroughly drying the <a name="potato851"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the manner we have recommended, and by processes such as those above described, are confirmed by the experience of highly intelligent persons, who have simultaneously directed their attention to the subject. We shall not hesitate to bring under the notice of your excellency our further conclusions; and we have the honor to be your excellencys obedient and faithful servants, Robt. Kane, John Of   Ndley, Lyon Playfai R. To His Excellency Baron Heytesbury, c c. From this it will be seen that we were right in refusing assent to the recommendations that have been offered, by various persons, of nostrunmsfor saving the decaying crop. Even chloride of lime, positive as were the assertions of its efficacy, is condemned, and, as we now know, with perfect justice. The first report has been made the subject of criticism by gentlemen who seem to have been disappointed at not finding effectual remedies proposed in a report whose whole objects were, as it declared, entirely temporary. The gist of the commissioners' recommendations was to secure dryness, and absence of contact, by all possible means; and any intelligent man would see that the particular methods proposed vere merely in reference to those all important precautions, and might, keeping them in view, be departed from according to circumstances. Dr. Pal pin, of A van, has strongly urged upon the I wish <a name="potato852"><mark>potato</mark></a> growers the construction of pits, in which it is supposed by him that effectual ventilation is secured by laying the <a name="potatoes1155"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> on rough sticks or other materials, and introducing into the heaps cone shaped funnels of wicker work, the whole, except the mouths of the funnels and a hole at each end, being covered down with clay or earth. We add the reply of the commissioners to this propositionBOARDRcid127OMr Of Royal Dubli   N Soei Ety, October so. Of You : We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your excellencys communication of this date, enclosing a copy of a letter publish. 635ed in the Dublin Evening Nail of the 29th, in which Dr. Pal pin, of A van, has proposed a plan for preserving the <a name="potato853"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop which he considers more worthy of public confidence than that which we had the honor to submit to your excellency. It will be observed that the author of the letter under consideration does not state that he himself has tried the method which he proposes, or derived a knowledge of its advantages from the experience of others. He merely thinks that it would prove efficacious. We can, however, state to your excellency that a plan founded on the same principle, and at least as well adapted to practice, has previously been proposed in England, and experimentally tested by one of us. The result convinces us of its total inefficiency; and the cause of failure becomes manifest on considering the manner in which the disease is propagated, and the circumstances under which <a name="potatoes1156"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are placed in ventilation g pits. In such places, <a name="potatoes1157"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being in contact are precisely in the condition best suited for the extension of disease, and against the danger of which we so strongly warned the public in our first report. Further, without giving any positive opinion whether the hung i found in decaying <a name="potatoes1158"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> be the cause or the effect of the disease, it is quite certain. that their presence aids very materially its rapid advance, and that their transmission from one tube r to another is one of the Most ordinary means of infecting those <a name="potatoes1159"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are at all predisposed to decay. Hence the isolation of each tube r is indispensable to its preservation, and hence our urgent recommendation to interpose some dry, solid substance between each <a name="potato854"><mark>potato</mark></a>. I f, as Dr. Pal pin supposes, gentle currents of air did occur among <a name="potatoes1160"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> collected in heaps in ventilation g pits, then, in that case, the germs r seed of parasitic al hung i, together with the emanations from any one decaying point, would be rapidly distributed over the entire mass of <a name="potatoes1161"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. We have to state, as our decided opinion, that in such a pit no current of air sufficient to dry the <a name="potatoes1162"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the manner anticipated by Dr. Pal pin could exist; or if it were produced, could only arise from inequalities of temperature, caused by the decomposition of the <a name="potatoes1163"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> themselves. We observed that Dr. Pal pin has, in some points, mistaken the object of our report, more especially in supposing that the methods of storing which we have recommended are intended to be permanent. As yet, we have given no opinion on this matter, which involves such important considerations that we must delay our suggestions on the point until some further information has been obtained. In the execution of die responsible duty intrusted to us by her Majestysgovernment, we have refrained from bringing forward any theoretical or speculative opinions, however plausible. Our former recommendations were founded on the results of experience, and we continue to recommend them with confidence.

The dreadful disease that has attacked your <a name="potatoes1164"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is one, the effects of which you can only stop by strict attention to the advice of those interested in your welfare. Any plans have been proposed, and after examining them all, we recommend the following directions All competent persons are of opinion that the first thing to bear in mind are the following directions: "a( Fig your <a name="potatoes1165"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in dry weather if you can; and if you cannot, get them dry somehow as fast as you can 2. Deep them dry and cool, 3. Deep the bad <a name="potatoes1166"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> separate from the good 4. To not pit your <a name="potatoes1167"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as you have been accustomed to do informer years 5. Recollect that if they get damp, nothing can make them keep; and do not consider them dry unless the mould which sticks to them is like dust to not take them into your houses unless you want them for immediate use Digging and drying is you dig the <a name="potatoes1168"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, leave them in the sun all day; and if you can, throw them upon straw, turning them over two or three times. At night you may gather them together and cover them with straw, so as to keep off frost. Next day take off the straw, spread them out, and give them the sun again. To this for three days running if the weather permit. If you put straw enough upon them at night they will not suffer." If the weather be unfavorable, and you have a dry left or outhouse large enough to hold them, you may spread them thinly on the floor, allowing a free circulation of air so as to dry them there." They must be got dry." Sorting the <a name="potatoes1169"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is soon as they are dry, you must sort them. Sick them one by one, and put in one heap the very bad ones; in another, those which are not so bad; and in a third, those that are sound. Great, 63 the bad <a name="potatoes1170"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as shall afterwards be directed, and store the sound ones according to the directions given in the next paragraph. You will know the very bad <a name="potatoes1171"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by their unpleasant smell, and the second set by their skin looking brown or dull, and not bright, as it generally does. A very little practice will teach you how to distinguish them easily from each otherStoringWhen the <a name="potatoes1172"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are quite dry, and well sorted, proceed to store them thus : Dark out on the ground a space six feet wide, and as long as you please. Fig a shallow trench two feet wide all round, and throw the mould upon the space; then level it, and cover it with a floor of turf sons set on their edges. In this soft or spread, very thinly, the dry mixture, or any of the (dry materials described below, and which you may call ' the packing stuff' Also, get some dry s lacked lime, and dust all the <a name="potatoes1173"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with it as well as you can. When put one row of turf sons, laid flat, on the top of the floor, all round the sides, so as to form a broad edge and within this spread the dry <a name="potatoes1174"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, mixed well with the packing stuff, so as not to touch one another. When you have covered the floor in this manner up to the top of the sons, lay another row of sons all round the first, so that half of each sod may rest on the bed of <a name="potatoes1175"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and the other half on the first layer of sons; this will make another edge one sod deep, which must be filled up with dry <a name="potatoes1176"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and dry packing stuff as before. When lay another edge of sons in the same way; fill it again, and so go on till the heap is made. When the building of this pit is finished it maybe covered with sons at the top, and will be ready for thatching. If rightly made, it will look like the roof of a cottage cut into steps f you do not understand this, ask your landlord or your clergyman to explain its meaning, and we are sure that they will give you every assistance ; also recollect that the recommendation applies only to sound <a name="potatoes1177"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, after being well dried You will lose nothing by applying these materials in storing, for the turf can be burnt as you use up the <a name="potatoes1178"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and the mixture of lime with dry sand, dry clay or ashes, which you are afterwards directed to employ, will form a good manure after having saved the <a name="potatoes1179"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The only difference is, that you must get what you want now, instead of waiting till another time After you have completed the heap, thatch it, so as to throw off the waters into the ditch and keep out the frost. Of  n districts where there may not be spared turf sufficient to form the pits in the above way, make them as follows : Dark out the spot, and make the trench as before. May on the ground a floor of stones about as large as apples, and over them as much heath, brushwood, or twigs, as 388 o. No. 140.will just cover the stones. In this floor form the heaps of <a name="potatoes1180"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and packing stuff, just as described for the turf pit. Over the sides of the <a name="potatoes1181"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> with more of the packing stuff, and thatch it in the usual wayne must again impress upon you that to put <a name="potatoes1182"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in your usual way is certain destruction to them Packing stuff his, which is of the greatest consequence, may be prepared in either of the following ways some of you may prefer the one some the other: "first way: Six a barrel of freshly burnt un s lacked lime with two barrels of sand or earth, as dry as you can possibly get it. The lumps of lime should be broken into pieces as large as marbles, and the mixture should be left 24 hours; at the end of that time turn the heap well over, mixing together the lime and sand (or other dry materials) till no lumps of lime can be found Second way: Six well equal quantities of earth and broken turf, or dry sawdust ; put a few sons of lighted turf on the ground; place the mixture on them by degrees till a large heap is made; in a few hours the fire will have spread through the heap, which is then to be covered with earth so as to put out the fire. In fact, this is to be managed just as if you were burning land. This burnt mixture forms a very good kind of packing stuff; perhaps as good as the mixture of lime with dry materials. That to do with bad <a name="potatoes1183"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> When <a name="potatoes1184"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are only slightly diseased, that is, when the disease shows itself only under the skin in small dark spots, or, at most, spreading into the substance of the <a name="potato857"><mark>potato</mark></a> for about a quarter of an inch deep, with a yellow, or light brown, or blackish color, without any smell, they may be eaten by the family without danger. They should be peeled, and the diseased parts pared off be foie they are boiled. The parts cut off should be kept for making starch. <a name="potatoes1185"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> thus treated are wholesome and pal a table, but should be used for food as quickly as possible, as it is not quite certain that they will keep long without the greatest care t is a pity to destroy <a name="potatoes1186"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for starch, if they will otherwise keep. But out the diseased parts, if it can easily be done, and dust over the cut   parts with lime, and the <a name="potato858"><mark>potato</mark></a> also. Met them dry as soon as you possibly can; and if you have outhouses or sheds, you should keep the <a name="potatoes1187"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in them, also using the packing materials. In such cases you should allow the air to circulate freely in the sheds, and should frequently examine your <a name="potatoes1188"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which should not be laid in layers above two or three feet in height. If you turn them frequently during the first two or three weeks, and keep them very dry, in this way they will probably keep. Although sheds or outhouses are to be preferred, if you have them not, and cannot construct them out of cheap materials, you should store the diseased <a name="potatoes1189"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by themselves, just as we have recommended you to store the sound ones f, with all your care, the diseased <a name="potatoes1190"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> still get worse, dry them thoroughly in kills, or on hur does placed over lime kills, or on screens or hur does placed over low turf fires, after having cut the <a name="potatoes1191"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> into two or three slices.

For this purpose proceed as follows. Provide yourselves with the following things : A ras p or greater, which may be made of a sheet of tin, or even of sheet iron bent round, and punched full of holes with a nail, a common coarse linen cloth, or hair si eve, hand si eve, or common cloth s trainer, and a pail or tub, or two, to hold water." To make the bad <a name="potatoes1195"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> useful wash them clean, and then grasp them into one of the tubs of water. The finer they are grasped, the more food will you procure from them. Having grasped a good many, take the cloth and place it on another tub; then put the pulp on the cloth, and pour water on it, allowing the water to run through. You have now two things to attend to the pulp and the starch First, attend to the pulp. Squeeze out as much water as you can from what remains on the cloth. You should wash it, however, till no smell remains. After you have squeezed it pretty dry, complete the drying on a g riddle over a slack fire, and when it is dry put it aside for use Next look to the milky water. It will then become clear, and themilkiness, which is starch, will have settled to the bottom. Your off the water gently till the starch is tolerably well drained; then add more water, stir the whole well up, and let it settle again. As soon as it is again clear, pour off the water, and when you have got rid of as much as you can, put the wet lumps of starch on a shelf or other place to dry. In a few days it will be fit to pack up. S Good wholesome bread may be made by mixing the starch with the dried pulp, peas meal, bean meal, o at meal, or flour. You must bear in mind that starch is not food by itselfTThere will be of course a good deal of trouble in doing all that we h ve recommended, and perhaps you will not succeed very well at first but we are confident that all true I irishmen will exert themselves; and never let it be said that in I re land the inhabitants wanted courage to meetdii4cuities against which other nations are successfully strugglingROBERT Kanejohn Of   Ndley, "LYON Playfai Rboardkoom, Royai Dubli   N Soci    Ety, November 3, 1845,"From the Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette, November 15, 1845. Fourth Report Of The I Of Of Commi  Ssi  Oners. Boardroom, Royal Dubli   N Soci    Ety. November 7, 1845. Of On : Having laid before your excellency our views as to the best means of storing <a name="potatoes1196"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and converting to useful purposes such as are too much diseased to offer a probability of being preserved, we now have the honor to bring under your consideration the question of seed for a future year. If in our former reports we have found it difficult to determine what course, under the peculiar circumstances of I re land, it might be most advisable to pursue, we are still more embarrassed on the present occasion 640 in consequence of the conflicting testimony that has been presented to us, and the absence of all decisive evidence as to the cause of the <a name="potato859"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease. The want of experience derived from previous visitations of the same nature, til so renders it impossible to affirm in what manner the <a name="potato860"><mark>potato</mark></a> maybe affected in the course of the next few months. We have, however, endeavored to ascertain all that is positively know upon those 7 subjects, by the examination of a great variety of published documents, both foreign and domestic, by personal observation, and by inquiries addressed to persons of practical experience or scientific reputation. It g isa very general opinion, and one entertained by men whose extensive knowledge entitles it to respect, that parasitic al hung i, similar in their nature to those which produce mildew and dry rot, are the real cause of the malady. Of  t is stated that one of these plants, belonging to the genus Botrytis, "and similar to that which some years since produced great mischief among the silkworms of France and I talk, has attacked the <a name="potato861"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. It is described as entering the <a name="potato862"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant by the breathing pores of its leaves, and then passing down through the interior of the stem into the tubes, in which its mycelium or s pawn fixes itself, traversing the cellular mass, separating the cells themselves, causing alteration in their chemical condition, and thus producing decay. In other cases, where the s pawn is not apparently distinguish able in the diseased portions of <a name="potatoes1197"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, even by the most practised observers, it is suggested that the juices of the plant maybe vitiated by the parasite which destroyed the leaves, and that particles of it, too obscure to be distinguished by the eye, may be circulating with the juices, and producing disease by irritation. The presence of the parasite is not to be detected by the naked eye, unless it makes its appearance on the outside of the <a name="potato863"><mark>potato</mark></a> in the form of mould y tufts; but its s pawn maybe detected in the diseased portions by the microscope, whether any external indications of its presence can be perceived or not. Hence it is inferred that it is produced exclusively from within. It is, however, within our knowledge that, when apparently sound <a name="potatoes1198"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are pitted in places where the mould i ness of a diseased <a name="potato864"><mark>potato</mark></a> is able to appear, that mould i ness rapidly establishes itself on the sound <a name="potatoes1199"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> at every point where their surface has been wounded or bruised, and that, un  der such circumstances, the disease is immediately extended through the entire mass. That the pawn or hung i is present in large quantity in diseased <a name="potatoes1200"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is undoubted. The evidence of the best microscope l observers would be with us conclusive on that point, even if we had not verified the fact by personal examination. We also regard it as we il ascertained that these parasites spread rapidly in warm and a damp situations, producing infinite mischief under such circumstances, and that their advance is only to be successfully resisted by dryness. Of t it does not appear to us that their being the original cause of the disease has been well established. If it ere so, it is difficult to conceive why fields of <a name="potatoes1201"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> placed very near each other should be differently affected, or why certain varietiedofthis plant should be much more injured than others: the irish apple <a name="potato865"><mark>potato</mark></a>, for example, which appears to have suffered more extensively than any other. We are also unable to reconcile wit the theory of the <a name="potato866"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease being caused by parasiticalfungi, the remarkable fact that, in its present form, it is certainly of modern origin. That it may have always existed is possible, though of this we have no proof; but at least there can be no doubt that it has only mania. 641 rested itself to any considerable degree within the last few years. We cannot suppose the Botrytis, which observers find to be the kind of fungus that attacks the <a name="potato867"><mark>potato</mark></a>, to be a recent creation. We must assume it to have been coexist went with the <a name="potato868"><mark>potato</mark></a> itself, and therefore we must conclude that some recent causes have come into operation favorable to its increase to the present alarming degree. Without pretending to decide what that cause really was, we may state that it seems to be connected with the cold, cloudy, un genial weather which has characterized the present year over the north of Europe; conditions highly unsuited to the constitution of a plant which, like the <a name="potato869"><mark>potato</mark></a>, is a native of a warm, dry, sunny country, and insufficient for the ripe king of the tubes. Without averting to solitary cases, which require to be examined with more care than we have the means of giving to them, we may state, that amidst the mass of conflicting evidence which we have obtained, the following facts appear to be established 1st. That <a name="potatoes1202"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted early in the season are more healthy than those planted later 2d. That the crop has suffered less in dry, elevated, sandy districts, where the influence of the season was mitigated by the slowness of the growth, or compensated for by the natural warmth of the soil 3d. That the late varieties of <a name="potatoes1203"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are more diseased than early ones 4th. That the present disease seems to be confined to the northern parts of Europe and North America, and to be unknown in the countries southward. If we are right in the conclusion at which we have thus arrived, there will not be cause for serious alarm as to the crop of another year, unless an equally unfavorable season should be experienced, or the supply of healthy seed should be insufficient, or that the parasite should be found to have so entirely taken possession of this years plants as to overcome the natural power of living bodies to repel the attacks of such enemies to healthy vegetation. To Providence we must turn, in the hope that a second season like this may not be visited upon us. Should the Almighty, in his infinite mercy avert such a misfortune, we entertain confident hopes that the two other sources of danger may be guarded against by human foresight and diligence. Of  n providing seed for a future year, we may look with confidence to such <a name="potatoes1204"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of home growth as shall have resisted all tendency to decay during winter; and we trust that a considerable quantity of them will be found remaining, where the precautions for storing, which we have recommended, shall have been observed. We do not anticipate any danger in the use of them, if they are planted early; especially if, before being planted, they are exposed to light till they become green. Another source of supply may, doubtless, be found in the southern parts of Europe, where, we have reason to believe, the disease has not shown itself; and we would strongly advise the public to lose no time in securing what may be procure able from that quarter. It is stated by M. Syringe, secretary to the commission appointed in the department of the Shone, in a report just published by him on the <a name="potato870"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, that it is unknown to Genoa, and in the warmer countries. Our own advices describe the crops about Marseilles as being perfectly hbealthly41642 and therefore we may conclude that mercantile enterprise will make Up, by importations, a large part 'f the deficiency to be apprehended      t has also been ascertained by actual experiment that <a name="potatoes1205"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, although diseased, will grow and produce apparently healthy plants. The Rev. Mr. Berkeley, a gentleman eminent above all other naturalists of the United Kingdom -in his knowledge of the habits of hung i, and whom we have consulted on h this occasion, states, that although there would certainly be some risk of raising a diseased progeny from a diseased stock, yet the growth of hung i so evidently depends on atmospheric conditions, that it does not follow that because germs are present they should be developed e cannot, however, recommend the use of diseased tubes for seed, except by way of experiment, or in cases of absolute necessity; and it will always be prudent to dust them with powdered lime before they are used. It would indeed be proper to do so even when sets, however sound in appearance, are employed; for this process will destroy the minute <a name="seeds69"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of parasitic al hung i which may be sticking to the sets, and assist in repelling those which are lying in the ground; of course, those <a name="potatoes1206"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being selected which, on careful inspection, show no sign of disease, and hence afford the fairest prospect of a sound and healthy growth. There home grown sets are to be employed for another crop, we would suggest with very great confidence the adoption of the system of autumn planting method of cultivation which has been proved advantageous in regard to the crop, which is attended with no unusual expense, and which seems particularly adapted to the circumstances of the present case. It has been shown by Mr. Grey, of Wilson, that in Northumberland his <a name="potato871"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop has been considerably increased in quantity by this practice, and that le has no disease in it this year. In 1844, his autumn planted crop produced 100 and 111 loads; when the same quantity of spring planted land yielded but 80 loads under the same circumstances. And in the present season, this gentleman states that his autumn planted is one third better than his spring planted crop. There can, therefore, be no doubt that the autumn planting may be safely practised. In this occasion, it has these peculiar advantages that it offers an additional chance of security against renewed attacks from parasitic al fun gin this point, the evidence of Mr. Berkeley is positiveAutumnplanting" he says- "seems to me to offer the best chance of obtaining healthy sets. What are now planted will produce their tubes before the atmospheric conditions requisite for the growth of the parasite in the leaves can be realized; and without such growth, the particles, if present, will be too few to cause much evil. I think, under existing circumstances, the commissioners cannot do a greater service than by encouraging and enforcing as much as possible autumn planting: Concur ring, as we entirely do, in this recommendation, we trust that the planters of <a name="potatoes1207"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> who have it their power to apt it will do so at once. All that we conceive it necessary t) state, with reference to this practice, is, that it should be performed at any time before the end of January; that the sets should be thoroughly dried by exposure to light and air; that they should also be well dusted with lime; and that they should be planted in drills six inches deep, with farm yard manure below the sets. We also recommend that where the <a name="potatoes1208"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are not large they should be planted whole, and even large <a name="potatoes1209"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be cut into not more than two pieces. We have ascertained that autumn planting has already been practised. 64 3 throughout In gal, for the early supply of the Dublin market; and that although the practice has been nearly discontinued, that has not happened for any reason that affects the present question. Either can we learn that the early period at which the leaves appear above the ground in spring is attended with any greater risk than what attends precarious crops like the <a name="potato872"><mark>potato</mark></a> in any season. The effect to be anticipated from autumn planting consists not merely in a probable increase of quantity in next years supply, but in the saving of <a name="potatoes1210"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which may perish before spring, if the slow growth which goes on during winter is arrested, and in the early ripe king of next years crop, in the event of a second unfavorable season super evening. We may add, that experience has shown the small refuse <a name="potatoes1211"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the year to be suited to autumn planting, if sound, and prepared in the manner we have recommended. It has been supposed by many persons that the <a name="potato873"><mark>potato</mark></a> has arrived at a state of general debility, and that the crop will continue liable to disease like the present, until new varieties shall have been raised from seed. He do not find any satisfactory evidence to support this opinion. It is doubtless true that great constitutional differences exist among the varieties of the <a name="potato874"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and that some are much more delicate than others; but we do not find that the oldest varieties are the most tender, or the newest the most hardy. In the contrary, it is within our knowledge that in the present season very healthy varieties, recently raised, have suffered much more than kinds that have been long in cultivation. While, however, we withhold our assent to the proposition that newly raised varieties of the <a name="potato875"><mark>potato</mark></a> were exempt in any peculiar degree from the attacks of disease, we fully admit the fact that some varieties are much more subject to it than others; and we therefore recommend the cultivation of the tender kinds to be discontinued, and those alone be used for future dropping which the experience of the present year shows to be best suited to unfavorable seasons; and on this point we may further remark, that all concurrent testimony points out the I wish cup variety as that which has suffered least from the attacks of the disease. We are also of opinion that it will be imprudent to plant <a name="potatoes1212"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for the next crop in land which has been just 'cleared of them. The latter is in all probability filled with the <a name="seeds70"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the hung i, countless myriads of which must have been scattered over the painted fields; and although they probably have been borne by the winds to every portion of the country, yet it maybe conceived that the soil will be more impregnated where diseased <a name="potatoes1213"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have just been growing, than in fields in which decaying matter was not absolutely present. Under these circumstances, we are decidedly of opinion, that prior to putting any kind of crop, for the coming year, into land that has been this season under <a name="potatoes1214"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, it will be prudent, if not absolutely necessary, that the ground should be turned up and exposed to the action of the atmosphere with care, and that it should be thoroughly manured with lime. Behave already recommended that the <a name="potatoes1215"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, whether whole or cuttings used for seed, should be dusted over with lime previous to planting; and we further urge that in the case of corn, or seed crops of every kind, the <a name="seeds71"><mark>seeds</mark></a> should be stepped in lime water, or in the solution of blue stone and salt, well known to farmers. Evidence has already been laid before us of injurious effects where such precautions as we have described have beenneglected644 the forbear from averting to the possibility of replenishing the diminished supply of <a name="potatoes1216"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> by sowing the <a name="seeds72"><mark>seeds</mark></a> formed by the flower. His is an operation which can only be carried on successfully in a garden; is unsuited to the means of the small cultivate or; cannot in any way affect the question of immediate supply, and may be safely left to the intelligence of the gardeners scattered throughout the country. Hitherto we have laid before your excellency, for the purposes of publication, several reports in a merely popular form, suited to the present emergency. We are confident that the recommendations contained in them, if carried into effect, will tend to mitigate the evils arising from the attacks of the disease in the <a name="potato876"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. We now propose to proceed forthwith to apply ourselves to the investigation of the important scientific questions involved in the subject, and to report in due time the results of our inquiries, in order that from past experience we may derive knowledge for future guidance. These investigations will occupy us for a considerable time, and while we do not contemplate the necessity of publishing further popular directions, we shall hold ourselves in readiness to give our immediate attention to any question which your excellency may submit for or consideration, or to report from time to time for your excellency s private information he have the honor to be, my lord, your faithful and obedient servants, Robert Kane, John Of   Ndley, Lyon Playfai R. Of Fth Report Of The I Of Of Commi  Ssi  Oners. Royal Dubli   N Soci    Ety, November 8, 1845. My Lord: We take occasion to mention to your excellency some facts regarding the action of pe at or turf upon diseased <a name="potatoes1217"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which we are anxious to make known without delay; although at the present moment we do not wish to put forward a formal report, or official recommendation. We had early fixed our attention on the preservation action of turf, and in our first report gave some directions for its use, since which time we have received accounts of its decisive utility in many cases. We had also obtained very distinct evidence that in wet, bog land the disease was in reality milder and less extensive than in driver and more fertile soils. Upon these grounds we proceeded to institute experiments on the action of bog water on diseased <a name="potatoes1218"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; and we find that certainly, when immersed therein, the disease appears to be arrested, and the substance of the <a name="potato877"><mark>potato</mark></a> does not appear in any way to suffer. Our. trials have been made in Dublin, and but on a small scale; and also the pressure of circumstances forcing us to make known every plan likely to prove useful without loss of time, we do not wish to have this notice considered as decisively stating that sleeping in bog water will stop the progress of the disease; but we consider it highly important that the plan should be tried by persons residing in bog districts, where circumstances render a possible failure in a certain quantity an object of no importance. We have accordingly applied to several gentlemen to institute trial t on
645a large scale, and shall, when we learn the results, at once proceed to lay them before your excellency. We remain your excellencys obedient and faithful servants, Robert Kane, John Of   Ndley, Lyon Playfai R. In the first of these reports the public has still to pronounce judgment. It is at variance with opinions held in estimation by many careful inquirers, and it is probable that the correctness of the commissioners' views will be called in question, The dis put able matter may be divided into two parts. In the first place, the commissioners reject the theory of parasitic al hung i being the cause of the evil, which they refer to atmospheric influences. As this is what has been always maintained by ourselves, it is needless to insist further upon that point until more proof shall have been brought forward in support of the fun gal theory. The other point is the wearing out of races. It has been repeatedly asserted that the reason why the <a name="potato878"><mark>potato</mark></a> is now suddenly attacked by a malady which at one time threatened its destruction, is, that it has degenerated. This has more particularly been insisted on in a frothy pamphlet noticed in another column; and all on sides we hear of recommendations that new varieties of the <a name="potato879"><mark>potato</mark></a> should be immediately raised from the seed. In this, as in all other matters, it is easy to make assertions; but, before we give assent to them, we must ask for some proof of their truth. To the gentlemen who clamor for new varieties know which are the old varieties now cultivated, and which the new ?a? Have they any proof that the old varieties have suffered in any peculiar degree, or that the new varieties have escaped ?a? An they point out any one instance among <a name="potatoes1219"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, in which facts support their views ?a? We think not. At least they have not done so; and we therefore entirely agree with the commissioners in rejecting this hypothesis. That the new varieties do not escape, we have the most positive proof. Doctor A clean, a gentleman in all horticultural affairs, raised but the other day a needling <a name="potato880"><mark>potato</mark></a> of great vigor and excellence. I to production is so recent that few persons yet possess it at all. With this variety a portion of an old meadow, newly trenched over, near London, was planted in the autumn of 1844 and spring of 1845, no manure being used. The crop was so much attacked by the disease that not a single <a name="potato881"><mark>potato</mark></a> was found worth preserving; and the difference between autumn and spring planting, which Doctor Macleans new <a name="potato882"><mark>potato</mark></a> was selected for the purpose of determining, could not be ascertained. In reality, there is no proof in any part of the vegetable kingdom that the races of plants wear out. Such an opinion was entertained, indeed, by the late Mr. Night, and his views have been adopted by some physiologists. Met there is not only no proof of their correctness, but the strongest presumption to the contrary. It is superfluous to say that the golden pipe in apple is the instance on which this theory mainly turns. It is said that it has worn out, and can be no longer cultivated. But the golden pipe in still appears abundantly in Covent Garden market: trees as healthy as ever are to be found in this country; we ourselves have seen it in I re land, where there is no symptom of its decrepitude; and in Madeira it is in robust health 6 46 a. The wearing out theory, therefore, falls to the ground. We observe the commissioners recommend all land which has borne diseased <a name="potatoes1220"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be well limed before being re cropped. They give no reason for the recommendation, but probably regard it as a prudent precaution against two possible dangers. It is improbable, but not impossible, that the myriads of <a name="seeds73"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of hung i lurking in the soil may attack a new crop; that kind of danger will be arrested by the use of lime, which absolutely destroys such parasites. It is not improbable that decaying <a name="potatoes1221"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, left in the ground, may destroy such young roots as come in contact with them before the putrid matter has become de composed; lime again hastens its decomposition, and therefore becomes a valuable agent in such a contingent y. It may be that these fears are groundless, and that danger is not to be anticipated; but no prudent man, acquainted with i the nature of plants, would venture to assert what will or will not follow in the train of such a pestilence as that which has attacked the <a name="potato883"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Professor 4fenslow, indeed, has furnished us with an instance of the deleterious effects of decaying vegetable matter upon young plants, which is particularly instructive at the present crisisd. Hard. Thrown. From the Edinburgh Knees. I Nvesti   Gati   Of Of The <a name="potato884"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. We are glad to learn that a special subscription is at present being raised among the agriculturists of Scotland, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of an investigation of the <a name="potato885"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, or murray in, which is at present spreading so alarming ly throughout the three kingdoms. The proposed inquiry is to be chemical, botany cal, entomological, and practical; the latter embracing inquiries as to the extent, appearance, and general characters of the disease in the different districts ; the nature and condition of the soils in which it has appeared ; the mode of treating and maturing the crops, &c. It is proposed to in trust this investigation to Air William War dine, Part, of Applegarth, for the entomological branch; Dr. Are ville, of Edinburgh, for the botany cal; and to Professor Johnston and Mr. Fleeing, of Barochan, for the chemical and practical part of the inquiry, with such other assistance as they may think proper to obtain. The sum required for this investigation is, we understand, five hundred pounds a sum which, considering the vast importance of the subject, there will, we should hope, be little difficulty in collecting. The results will be published as they are obtained, and in a cheap form, so as to be accessible to all. The Highlandsociety has also offered a premium for analyses of diseased <a name="potatoes1222"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the results to be sent in to them at the close of 1846. <a name="potato886"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Rot. The Edinburgh Quarter ly Journal published a letter from Professorjohnston, in which he remarks: " This disease in the <a name="potato887"><mark>potato</mark></a> has already called forth many hasty opinions, almost all partially true, because founded on one or two facts, but nearly all unsound as general expressions of the. 647 truth, since they are contradicted by the experience of other practical men in other districts of the country. We are clearly unable as yet to assign either any general cause for the disease, or any universal remedy. Something may possibly be suggested by the analysis of sound and diseased <a name="potatoes1223"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, for which the High land Society has offered a premium; though in the present state of our knowledge upon the subject, even this is doubtful From the Farmers' Library. <a name="potato888"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. Report on the cause of the <a name="potato889"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, by C. Dorr en, Professor in the University of Siege; together with a preventive remedy. It is known that a general malady has stricken the <a name="potatoes1224"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in Belgium, and it appears that the crop of this most necessary production is there much compromised. As it is said that this malady threatens also the <a name="potato890"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in France, we believe it right to reproduce here the advice that Mr. Dorr en, Professor of Agriculture at the University of Siege, has addressed to the public in a letter that we find in " The I independence" of Brussels. Mr. Dorr en, after stating that this evil has for several years existed in Belgium, although in a less alarming degree, adds: "the true cause of the evil is a mushroom, a nouldiness the learned will class in their genus' bory tis' but that the agriculturists hardly distinguish, which they call a burn, a fire, a stain, and which some attribute to humidity others to dryness; some to a bad wind coming from France others to insects, &c, &c. It is not, however, indifferent to us to know the true cause of the phenomenon, for this knowledge will put us in the way of diminishing the scourge, and possibly of destroying it." For some time I have followed every day, and step by step, the progress of the evil, in observing several fields of <a name="potatoes1225"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The malady commences decidedly in the upper part of the leaves. I have even seen the flowers and fruits attacked in the first place. A part of the green tissue loses it stint and turns promptly yellow ; the stain soon becomes more gray below, and it is always on the lower surface of the leaf, or on the fruit, where, a day or two after the appearance of the yellow stain, a whitish down shows itself. The microscope discovers then that this down proceeds from a mushroom which grows between the numerous hairs which varnish the bottom of the leaf of the <a name="potato891"><mark>potato</mark></a>. This mushroom is of an extreme tenacity ; but it breeds and reproduces itself by thousands. I to stems are formed of little straight and partitioned threads, which have at their summit one or several branches, always divided in two; and at the end of these branches reproducing bodies develop e themselves, which have the for n of eggs, but which have not more than the hundredth part, or even less, of a millimetre in size. I may be told it is a very small body to commit ravages so great; but I answer, the it ch is not the less to be feared because the animal rule which produces it is a microscope being. After the formation of the yellow spot, and the development of thebotrytis' on the leaf of the <a name="potato892"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the stem /receives the deleterious influences. Were and there its surface becomes t brown, slackens, and when the phases of the evil are followed with the r microscope. it is soon nor reid tcid127648 Doc. B. 140.the stem is attacked through the back. The morbid agent carries its action from the bark to the skin, and although this does not always offer mushrooms, it is not the less stricken with death ; for to any one that has some notion sa of vegetable physiology these effects easily explain themselves. The sap modified into living juice, into vegetable blood, forms itself in the leaf, and then descends into the stem and the root, by the bark. Were this sap is sick, modified it carries the poison of the leaf into the stem, and this perishes. I need, so soon as the black spots declare themselves on the stems, the leaves become dry and die. Blackened and stricken with death by a venomous mushroom, they fall, unfortunately, to prop agate the source of the scourge, or to deposit e its germ in the earth. I will soon indicate the means which should be taken to prevent this fatal communication The infection soon descends into the tubercle itself. If the evil follows its course, the tubercle immediately gangrenes. A <a name="potato893"><mark>potato</mark></a> is not a root, but a branch. It follows from that, that a tubercle possesses a marrow, which is the eat able part to be preferred, and a distinct bark. Between the marrow and the bark is found a zone of vessels which represents wood. One can easily understand this structure by cutting a thin slice of <a name="potato894"><mark>potato</mark></a> and placing it between the eye and the light r Now, the infection attacks the part which receives the descending sap that part where the morbid agent has itself descended. Upon a <a name="potato895"><mark>potato</mark></a> being attacked, one perceives a series of livid spots, brown or yellow, sometimes gray or blackened a series which extends itself throughout the wood y zone. In following the process of the evil over a great number of spoiled tubercles, I could see how the disease, increasing by small degrees, finished by reaching the heart itself of the <a name="potato896"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and corrupts it entirely. The skin of the sick <a name="potato897"><mark>potato</mark></a> easily detached itself; the flesh no longer cracks i under the, knife : a dis colored flaccid it y, a fade, and later an animal smell, analogous to that of mushroom freshly cut, declares itself and carries off the heart. her t. e animals even refuse to eat a food which may be regarded to be quite as injurious as deteriorated mushroom themselves to soon as the <a name="potato898"><mark>potato</mark></a> is gangrened within, that is, in its cortical part, but a few days, three at the most, are sufficient for the mushroom (the 'bory tis) to show itself without' This white efflorescence is seen to declare itself in the eyes of the tubercles, and then extend itself like light, white flakes, at first upon a rounded surface, but which finished by invading the whole tubercle. The <a name="potato899"><mark>potato</mark></a> is then entirely lost The source of the evil being known, all the attention of the cultivatorshould be directed toward the destruction of the mushroom ; for it is unfortunately too' true that the blight, the rust, and all the race of parasites, once introduced into the country, they remain there and prop agate themselves. This year the epidemic- has been general he by where the germs of it exist millions of that which prop agate it, if their number be not diminished, will attack plants the approaching year, and it will then be more difficult than ever to eradicate the plague, to do which it is essential to adopt the follow" 1st. When the leaves are lost, they must be collected as quickly as possible, and burnt upon the spot, without being transported to a distance. The ashes (cid127tay be spread upon the soil- I n" collecting them they must be shaken as little as possible. I have seen with regret the farmers collect the sick leaves, to preserve them in a pile in the field, or to cast them over , re in v e lrnrv^ for the next For, ve
6492d. When certain varieties of the <a name="potato900"><mark>potato</mark></a>, or certain localities, are free from the calamity at the time of the crop, it is always prudent to burn the leaves ; for a field may appear clear of the ' bory tis' when it is not so. Several leaves are attacked ; these leaves throw out the <a name="seeds74"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the disease upon the tubercles, which, preserved as seed, will preserve the disease the next year 3d. If the tubercles are themselves attacked, it is essential to take them out of the earth to make a prompt choice out of them, which is easy, for habit soon enables one to recognise the spoiled tubercles from those which are not so. The sound tubercles ought to be used as soon as possible, for they are not injurious up to the moment the bark becomes yellow. The smell alone is sufficient to detect the development of the malady. The sick tubercles should be burnt 4th. To obviate the sorrowful consequences of a crop which will be always reduced either a half, or a third, or even less than an ordinary crop, it would be important to follow, in our country, the method practised in Scotland in cultivating <a name="potatoes1226"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> during winter 5th. Since it is very probable that the seed tubercles that may escape from the present crop will be infected with the germ of the mushroom, it would be well if, by the intervention of the government or commerce, the farmers had at their disposal pure seed tubercles, that were not infected ;and for this purpose the <a name="potatoes1227"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of Pennsylvania or I re land would suit us exceedingly well. The plague is not known in those two countries. He must distrust the <a name="potatoes1228"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of Germany, where the dry gangrene, the shrivelling, (la crisp are) and the ulceration of the tubercle, are but too common and we might take advantage of this importation to endow the country with those varieties of <a name="potatoes1229"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are most congenial to our soil 6th. If the farmers are obstinate in employing, as seed, tubercles of this years crop, it will be necessary to subject them to living, as is done with wheat, rye, oats, and all plants which are subject to be invaded by parasites. The living ought to be done by immersing the tubercles, because the study of the habits of the ' bory tis' shows it is the eye, the deepest point of the <a name="potato901"><mark>potato</mark></a>, which is attacked. The limed water should then bathe this leprous eye. Twenty-five k i log. of lime, one quarter pound of the sulphate of copper, and three k i log. of marine salt, to 125 litres of water, constitute a living of which the useful effects have been acknowledged by a great number of instructed cultivators7th. In the plantings either of the winter of 1845 or the spring of 1846. it is essential to plant in <a name="potatoes1230"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> parcels of ground as distant as possible from those infected this year, for it is easily understood that the chance of transmission, by the preservation, in the soil, of the seed of the mushroom, is much greater in plantings that approach each other than if they were made at a distance th. When the Counsellor de War tens visited Belgium, and inquired in our different provinces the state of our <a name="potatoes1231"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, he informed me, in one of his interesting conversations, that the farmers on the borders of the Rhine had remarked that the dry gangrene attacked oftener the <a name="potato902"><mark>potato</mark></a> planting made in the afternoon, than those made in the morning; and he explained this phenomenon, which at first appeared singular, by a simple fact. When the sun has passed the meridian, the heat of the strata of air is at its maximum : this heat accelerates the vitality of plants; that which propagated them flies more rapidly in a ,dilated air; the insects 650 in their flight, disperse with facility a mass of little bodies, of which their is, the vehicle; and the dissemination of their germs is then also at its maximum. The farmer is plunged in this atmosphere, and he causes to pass through it the <a name="potatoes1232"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which he plants; it attaches itself to the seed, and is sown with it; and that happens here which occurs to the grain not lived the poison is sown and grows with the plant, to attack and kill it at a later period. From which arises the advice we give to the farmers, to plant their <a name="potatoes1233"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the morning. ;9th. The employment of lime and marine salt, mixed with a small quantity of the sulphate of copper, is, as I have said, of a recognised efficacy in the destruction of the germs of parasite plants; consequently, to powder with these mixed substances the soil which has been planted with sick <a name="potatoes1234"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, is an operation calculated to destroy the germ of the scourge, and cannot be too strongly recommended everywhere." 10th. The preservation of the <a name="potatoes1235"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that have escaped being attacked this year, in cellars, &c, will certainly deposit e in these places the germ of the mushroom. To cleanse these cellars and white wash them with lime, are excellent means of destroying the germs; and to spread lime and wounded coal on the places where the <a name="potatoes1236"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been deposited, will finish the series of proceedings we consider the most rational, and the most certain to destroy, if it be possible, the evil at its root.

I s the general crop large? and howmutchof it do you think is affected 2. I s it more extensive during the present than during the past years. Now many years is it since it first began to be noticed among you ?4. At what time during the present season did it first appear in your neighborhood ?a? Was its appearance been sudden and unexpected ?NOTEA: letter from a Mr. Oil christ, of It. Johns, New Brunswick, dated 27th September last, contains the following passage: " I never was. 61 more surprised at any thing than the change upon the appearance of the country from the time I had gone through it two months before. At that time every thing looked beautiful, and crops of every kind seemed abundant; but now a blight seems over every thing. From Halifax to It. Johns I did not see a single field of <a name="potatoes1237"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> but what was completely destroyed; and it is universal throughout the whole of North America. To bad are they upon It. Johns river that the health officers have forbid them being brought to market; and from what the country people say, there will be scarcely enough left for seed. It is a strange sort of disease. It first attacks the shaw, and so rapid is it that in the course of two or three nights a whole field will be destroyed, and the stench that arises from them is almost unbearable 5. What peculiar appearance has it presented ?a? Does it differ in character from the disease of former years? Does it generally show itself in the leaf and stem before it appears in the bulb ?NOTEThe rot in the tube r of the <a name="potato906"><mark>potato</mark></a> assumes two distinct characters, known by the names of the dry and the wet rot. The former, which has hitherto prevailed most in this country, has the appearance of brown or brownish black streaks, spots, or layers in the <a name="potato907"><mark>potato</mark></a>, beginning at the outside and extending inwards, often to the very core. The affected <a name="potatoes1238"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> often appear sound externally, though upon a closer inspection the seat of the disease may be traced by a slight wrinkling or discoloration of the skin. In many cases the disease appears first at the end of the <a name="potato908"><mark>potato</mark></a> most distant from the root. In others, it is the prominent eyes at the side of the <a name="potato909"><mark>potato</mark></a> which are first attacked, presenting a blue or livid appearance, and exhibiting, when cut, the brown fungus within. <a name="potatoes1239"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> with this form of the disease are often difficult to boil soft. When far gone, they have a disagreeable taste and smell after being boiled, and they not un frequently decay after being pitted. The wet rot forms an ulcer or distinctly delayed and rotten part in the <a name="potato910"><mark>potato</mark></a>. It sometimes appears as a rotten hole proceeding from the heel of the <a name="potato911"><mark>potato</mark></a>, where it is attached to the root let; sometimes it forms a soft mass over a large part of the surface, which can easily be pushed off by the thumb; and sometimes it appears sound externally, and yet may be crushed together in the hand. The rotten portion has frequently the consistence of paste, "with tenacity sufficient to rope when held up, and the semifluid mass strings down like honey 6. In what soils is it most prevalent; on light or heavy, on wet or dry, or on all soils equally ?7. Was it, to your knowledge, appeared on petty or on newly broken up grass lands 8.

Are varieties raised from seed, to your knowledge, liable to failure ?10. Have <a name="potatoes1241"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted whole shown any difference in the extent of failures ?11. Was the previous draining of the land any effect in preventing the disease ?12. Was the kind of manure applied any influence on the appearance orfatality of the disease ?13. To you think the want of lime in the land is any cause of failure ?652 14. Does it, in your district, attack particularly fields or farms, and what are the peculiar conditions of these farms ?15. Does nearness to the sea or the use of seaweednmake any difference 16. What is your opinion of the cause of the disease ?17. To you think you have in any way contrived to prevent it during the present or past seasons; and how ?NOTEAn American agriculturists says: "I have used s lacked lime, which     sprinkle on the <a name="potatoes1242"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as soon as they are cut for seed, and shovel them over in it, and plant them immediately. Since I have adopted this plan I have not lost a <a name="potato912"><mark>potato</mark></a>, either in the ground or after they were put in the cellar; and such of my neighbors as follow my example are alike fortunate, and in no way troubled with the rot." This was Written in 1844. In Scotland, some practical men have supposed that, by the use of saline or chemical manures, they have been able to prevent it 18. Was the peculiar wet ness of the season, in your opinion, had anything to do with its occurrence in your neighborhood ?NOTEThe American Report for 1844 contains the following passageSNotwithstanding the intensity of the drought, and its long continuance, the <a name="potatoes1243"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in this section of the country are rotating to such an extent as to destroy nearly the whole crop 19. What are the first symptoms of decay after storing 20. It is said that the rot spreads faster after the <a name="potatoes1244"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are put together in heaps or pits than when left in the soil, and late digging or leaving the mall winter in the soil is therefore recommended. What practice would your experience lead you to adopt 21. Now would you recommend that the <a name="potatoes1245"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be stored during the winter ?a? Will a sprinkling of s lacked lime, or of salt, or wounded charcoal, or charred pe at, or wood ashes, be beneficial? Will washing the <a name="potatoes1246"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> clean, and then picking and drying them before storing, help to preserve them 22. What precautions would you adopt in preparing the seed in spring 23. Have any cases occurred in your neighborhood in which the use of diseased <a name="potatoes1247"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> has been injurious to animal life ?24. Are you able to forward to me any striking examples of very healthy or of very diseased <a name="potatoes1248"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from your neighborhood, or specimens of insects or of hung i you suppose to infect the <a name="potatoes1249"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, for the purpose of chemical, botany cal, or entomological examination ?JAS. F. W. Johnston. From the London Mechanics' Magazine, &c. Of The <a name="potato913"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. S Of Andrew Ure, M. D., F, R. S. The vague and contradictory statements concerning the nature of this calamitous visitation of Providence, as well as the directions for the treatment and preservation of the tubes, generally impracticable and preposterous, which have recently issued in vast variety from the press, do little honor to economic chemistry. It is needless to notice all the notions and schemes which have either officially or spontaneously been projected. And. 65 3 ly two of these deserve comment. The first as coming from a great master in science; the second as emanating from the I wish commissioners. Professor Lie big imagines the essence of the disease to consist in the conversion of the albumen, a usual constituent of healthy <a name="potatoes1250"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, into case in, a principle which, by its great in stability of composition, is supposed to cause the <a name="potato914"><mark>potato</mark></a> to put rely rapidly. I have subjected this opinion to the test of experiment. Perfectly sound <a name="potatoes1251"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as also diseased ones, were sliced or grated :and separately digested in a very dilute alkaline let, at a blood heat. The infusions, when cool, being filtered and faintly acid elated with dilute ace tic acid, afforded respectively a like proportion of case in looking flakes. It would thus appear, from this mode of testing, as prescribed by M. Sum as in the seventh volume of his "or acte de Chiinie" that sound <a name="potatoes1252"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> contain as much as unsound. Professor Liebigs plan of preserving diseased <a name="potatoes1253"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is founded on the above notion, and consists in cutting them into slices one quarter of an inch thick, and sleeping them twenty-four or thirty-six hours in dilute sulphuric acid. In this proposal, I need make no comments, as it has no chance of being practised beyond the precincts ofGiessen. In the Pharmaceutical Journal for October last, I inserted a few observations on diseased <a name="potatoes1254"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, chiefly with the view of showing that till the putrefactive stage commences, the <a name="potato915"><mark>potato</mark></a> had the same acidulous reaction as in the sound state; but that then a portion of ammonia made its appearance, as was proved by its alkaline action on lit must paper, and by its covering over in distillation. That brief notice was .written while I was at a distance from home on professional business, and where I had no means of prose cuting my experiments. At my first period of leisure since, I resumed my inquiries, and have obtained certain results which may probably be found useful as well as interesting. Before entering into a detail of them, I shall shortly describe the constituents of sound <a name="potatoes1255"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, according to the most authentic analyses. Their average composition in 100 parts, according to Eenhof and Lampadius, is Fibrous matter, 7; starch, 15; vegetable albumen, 1; gum, acids, and salts, 3.5; water, 75. Besides these principles, Paquelin, by his elder and more minute analysis, discovered the following in minute quantities: Crystalizable as para gin ; an azotised substance resembling gum; are sinus matter, emitting an agreeable odor when heated; an extractivematter which slackens in the air; nitric acid; citrates and phosphates of potash and lime. *a* *a* *a* *a* *a* *a* *a* *a* *the nutritions quality of <a name="potatoes1256"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> resides chiefly in the starch, fibrin e, and albumen; the latter being essential to the formation of blood. *a* *a* *I n the diseased <a name="potatoes1257"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> a portion of the starch is transformed into sugar, and of the albumen into an acrid offensive brown substance. :If such tubes as are characterized by brown spots in the interior, and a thickened brown skin, both composed of fungus fibres, be grated or sliced and exposed to pressure, either alone or with a little tepid water, the juice obtained will be found to have a mawkish sweet taste, followed by a sense ofpungency on the tip of the tongue. If some of this juice be mixed with a little of Drummers grape sugar test, (an alkalined solution of sulphate of copper) this blue colored mix ta. will, fhag4intb. ~a~ bright or age. huge, slowly ;inthieotkl, but sapidjly654 on application of a gentle heat, with a deposit e of pro t oxide of copper. By means of a modification of that test, described by me in the " Pharmaceutical Journal" for July, 1842, I have ascertained the existence of about five per cent. of sac charing matter in diseased <a name="potatoes1258"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; yet by the same re agent, which is sensible to T th of a grain of sugar, I could observe none of it in sound <a name="potatoes1259"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. After satisfying myself, in this way, as to the presence of sugar in diseased <a name="potatoes1260"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, I proceeded to verify the fact by placing their expressed juice, as also their infusion, in contact with a little yeas t, at a fermenting heat of from 800 to 900 Fahrenheit, and watched the resulting phenomena. A ferment active action soon began, and in an hour or two became so brisk as to throw up a thick creamy f roth, like that occurring' with smallbeerwort. At the end of thirty-six hours, the liquor having considerably diminished in specific gravity, was subjected to distillation, and yielded alcohol equivalent to about four per cent. of sugar in the <a name="potato916"><mark>potato</mark></a>. *a* *a* *the venous spirit produced is by no means disagreeable in taste or flavor, and may be easily rectified into excellent alcohol, fit for every purpose of arts, manufactures, and parma cy. Were it not for the oppressive laws of the excise, sufficient alcohol might thus be obtained this season for the uses of a temperate people, reserving an equivalent portion of grain from the whiskey manufacture for their sustenance. The residual cake of the diseased <a name="potato917"><mark>potato</mark></a> is well adapted for feeding cattle, the morbid juices having been separated; and it may be so dried as to keep unchanged for a moderate. length of time. In all the diseased <a name="potatoes1261"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which I have examined with the microscope, the fibres of a fungus, called bory tis, from its grape like form, or of one called are do tuberosum, may be observed ramifying round the cells which enclose the starch y corpuscles. Now these plants, however minute, are not self generated, but must be produced by some seminal impregnation, transported by the atmosphere, and peculiarly adapted to f rectify, upon thesolanum tuberosum. I would hence conclude that the <a name="potato918"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease is a peculiar vegetopestilence, diffused generally through the atmosphere, whose ravages have been favored by the s unless humidity of the last season, as the predisposing but not as the exciting cause. The proximal e cause, again, in medical language, or the essence of the morbid state, is the fungus inmate of the tube r, from seminal impregnation of the stem, which so paralyzes the vitality of the plant that a portion of the starch and albumen becomes de composed. This vegetable dis temper, like that of the cholera, while general in its diffusion, is determined to particular localities and plants, by certain predisposing causes; yet it is independent of these, having occurred in many regions where such causes did not materially operate. Whether it will recur, no human being can predict; meanwhile, it reads a great and solemn lesson to the rulers of states, never better expressed than in Virgils well known verse: "his cite justinian mon it i, et non ten mere di vos which may be translated" Beware of obstructing the free supply of food to your people any preposterous prescriptions have been obtruded upon the public eye as to the best method of preserving the diseased <a name="potatoes1262"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from putrefaction. The above researches show the existence of a highly ferment able, sac chap. 655 line, and albuminous matter in them, which becomes rapidly operative by contact with air and moisture. Are should therefore be taken to keep their skins entire, so as to exclude the atmospheric oxygen and humidity. It is well known that the sugar in ripe grapes undergoes no change while the skin is entire; but the moment this is pricked, the grapes begin to ferment and speedily spoil. To plan is, therefore, more to be deprecated than that of sliding arid washing <a name="potatoes1263"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. They should be placed in an atmosphere kept by chemical means in a state of extreme dryness, which may be easily and cheaply effected by piling them upon a bed of brushwood, dry turf, or straw, interspersing through the pile un s lacked lime, coarsely bruised, and covering the pile thoroughly at the sides and on the top from the external elements. Since un s lacked lime absorbs greedily one third of its weight of moisture, it will bring the air in the spaces between the tubes into a perfectly arid state a condition in which no decomposition of the substance can possibly take place. In the same principle, highly polished steel articles may be kept for any length of time without tar wishing in our humid climate, provided a basin with lumps of un s lacked lime be enclosed is the case or chest containing them. Lacked lime, on the contrary, being saturated with water, has no power of destination, but acts only, by its caustic it y, in favoring the destruction of all vegetable and animal matter. Charlotte Of, Bedford Square, December 9, 1845. Professor Of   Ebi Of Opi Of Of Of The <a name="potato919"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. The researches I have undertaken upon the sound and diseased <a name="potatoes1264"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the present year have disclosed to me the remarkable fact that they contain in the sap a considerable quantity of vegetable case in, (cheese) precipitate by acids. This constituent I did not observe in my previous researches. It would thus appear that, from the influence of the weather, or, generally speaking, from atmospheric causes, a part of the vegetable albumen which prevails in the <a name="potato920"><mark>potato</mark></a> has become converted into vegetable case in. The great in stability of this last substance is will known; hence the facility with which the <a name="potato921"><mark>potato</mark></a> containing it undergoes putrefaction. Any injury to health from the use of these <a name="potatoes1265"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is out of the question, and nowhere in Germany has such an effect been observed. In the diseased <a name="potato922"><mark>potato</mark></a> no solanincan be discovered. It may be of some use to call attention to the fact that diseased <a name="potatoes1266"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may easily, and at little expense, be preserved for a length of time, and afterwards employed in various ways, by cutting them into slices of about a quarter of an inch thick, and immersing them in water containing from two to three per cent. of sulphuric acid. After twenty-four or thirty-six hours, the acid liquor may be drawn off, and all remains of it washed away by sleeping in successive portions of fresh water. Treated in this manner, the <a name="potatoes1267"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are easily dried. The pieces are white and of little weight, and can be ground to flour and baked into bread along with the flour of wheat. I think it probable that the diseased <a name="potatoes1268"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, after being sliced and kept for some time in contact with weak sulphuric acid, so as to be penetrated by the acid, may be preserved in that state in pits. But 656 further experiments a fe necessary to determine this. It is certain, however, that dilute sulphuric acid stops the progress of putrefaction. Of Essen, November 5. From the Gardeners' Chronicle of November 15. Cause Of <a name="potato923"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Fai Lure. The cause of this disease appears to depend partly upon too great an amount of moisture, and partly on too copious a supply of manure to the soil both induce too rapid a growth of the tubes, which renders the formation of a strong and dura be cellular membrane impossible. Moreover, all the <a name="potatoes1269"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have experienced the cell rot contain a much larger amount of aqueous constituents than the sound ones. It may be expected that the disease of the tubes which are laid up for winter store will extend itself and finally destroy them, if care be not taken to preserve them in a dry place, whereby a portion of the excess of moisture may be removed. The author has found that the disease remains stationary when they are dried; at least, at the end of several weeks it had not attacked the neighboring parts. Professor Kutzi Of. From the Gardeners' Chronicle, November 29. Royal Agri Cultural Soci    Ety In England. December 9.--Thefirst annual lecture was delivered this evening in the theatre of the Royal I institution, by Dr. Lyon Lay fair. The subject was, the dis temper in the <a name="potato924"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The lecturer commenced by making some general remarks on the history of the <a name="potato925"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and its cultivation in this and the other countries of Europe. He also exhibited diagrams of the structure of the <a name="potato926"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and tables of the chemical composition of the tube r in its healthy state. He then described the nature of the changes which took place in the <a name="potato927"><mark>potato</mark></a> under the influence of the disease. Such had been said and written with regard to the source of the disease; and since minutefungi were frequently found present in the delayed <a name="potato928"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the disease had been attributed to them as a cause. Some <a name="potatoes1270"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, apples, and other things had been inoculated with the s po rules of the fungus, and these had become diseased. But if there were not some previous disease in the <a name="potato929"><mark>potato</mark></a>, how was it that some <a name="potatoes1271"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> escaped whilst others were attacked The disease he believed arose from physical or chemical causes. It was simply a decay of the tissue of the <a name="potato930"><mark>potato</mark></a>, arising from the union of the tissues of the <a name="potato931"><mark>potato</mark></a> with the oxygen of the atmosphere. When a delayed <a name="potato932"><mark>potato</mark></a> was examined, it was found that the diseased spots were always found in the region of the tissue called spiral vessels, whose function it was to carry air into the tissue of the <a name="potato933"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The reason why the cells entered into this decomposition so rapidly, arose from a constitutional weakness on the part of the cells of the tube r. This decay is rapidly spread from one cell to another, and the loose r the tissue the more rapid the decay. By grating the tissue of some sound <a name="potatoes1272"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and exposing it to the. 65 atmosphere of the lecture room, it speedily assumed the color of the diseased <a name="potato934"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The cause of the constitutional weakness in the cells of the tube was undoubtedly to be looked for in the weather. A peculiar weather had been observed over the whole of the north of Europe, where the disease had been observed, as well as in America. The disease was no new thing, and appeared always when such weather occurred. At the time the plant commenced growing there was very warm and mild weather, and this was followed by cold and wet weather. The consequence was, the cellular tissue of the tube r contained more water than usual. In previous years, an analysis of the <a name="potato935"><mark>potato</mark></a> gave on an average 72 per cent. of water; by analyses which he had made this year of healthy <a name="potatoes1273"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, gave from 72 to 75 per cent. of water ; whilst the analyses of diseased <a name="potatoes1274"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> gave as much as 80 per cent. of water. Other plants contained the same increase of water constituents, as turn is; and turn is were also affected with the same disease. Turnips were not so generally affected as <a name="potatoes1275"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, on account of their nitrogenous principles not being so ruble, as those of the <a name="potato936"><mark>potato</mark></a> were. The disease, then, was a consumption of the <a name="potato937"><mark>potato</mark></a>, arising from the decay of its particles in combination with the oxygen of the atmosphere, produced by the state of the cellular tissue brought on by the weather. It arises from no de genera cy in the <a name="potato938"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and it need only to be feared from a repetition of the same circumstances. In the storing and preserving the <a name="potato939"><mark>potato</mark></a>, one great fact should be borne in mind; and that is, that the decaying particles were capable of communicating the decay to the sound tissue. Are, then should be freely taken that they be freely ventilated, that they are kept dry and cool, and that there is absence of contact of the <a name="potatoes1276"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. He defended the directions given by the I wish commissioners for the storing and preserving the <a name="potatoes1277"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as those best adapted for obtaining the object in view, in the community to which those directions were addressed. At the conclusion of the lecture, a vote of thanks to the lecturer was proposed by the Duke of Richmond, and seconded by P. Use y, esqDECEMBER 10.-Lord Sort man in the chair. Dr. Lay fair commenced y stating that the object of the lecture this evening would be to point out the mode of treating the <a name="potato940"><mark>potato</mark></a> for the future; and first, with regard to planting. He recommended that the <a name="potato941"><mark>potato</mark></a> should be planted immediately, for several reasons. First, because there might be little left for seed in the spring. Second, because <a name="potatoes1278"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted now might be ready for use a the latter end of May, or the beginning of June. There economy of seed was not necessary, he thought it would be better to plant the whole tube r of the <a name="potato942"><mark>potato</mark></a>, than to cut it. There economy of seed was necessary, single o buds or eyes" of the <a name="potato943"><mark>potato</mark></a> might be removed and planted, the rest of the tube r being used for food. With regard to diseased <a name="potatoes1279"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, he recommended that they should not be used for seed where sound ones could be obtained; but where these could not be got, then he advised the planting of diseased <a name="potatoes1280"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rather than none at all. There was no prospect obtaining sound <a name="potatoes1281"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from abroad for seed, and he had the permission of the late government authorities for stating that this was the result of their consul ar returns. If he were right in his views with regard to the nature of the <a name="potato944"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, then no evil can arise from planting <a name="potatoes1282"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the same soil in which they had become diseased. The fungus theorists objected to planting <a name="potatoes1283"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the same soil; but he had shown their theory to have no foundation in facts. He would now consider how 42 -65 the bad <a name="potatoes1284"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> might be used, and quoted On jeans experiments to show that no injurious effect was produced on the system by eating them cooked they might, when boiled, be safely given to animals, which would thrive on them. He described the various processes of procuring the starch which had been brought before the public, and pointed out the fact, that in procuring the starch only one of the alimentary secretions of the <a name="potato945"><mark>potato</mark></a> was obtained that which assisted in i keeping up the animal heat. The nitrogenous portion is thus lost. The plan he recommended, by which these last might be saved to a great extent, was to grate the <a name="potato946"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and pour water upon it till no more so ruble matter was taken up: the remaining insoluble substance should then be dried, when it would be found an excellent meal with which to make soups, puddings, bread, and other articles of food. He did not apprehend a scarcity of food, but he wished to point out the fact that <a name="potatoes1285"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> contained a very small portion of nutritions or nitrogen sized matter; and, as this was the most important constituent of a working mans diet, he had drawn up a table of the comparative expense at which various articles of food might be obtained, which contained one pound of this nitrogenous matter 25 pounds of milk contain one pound of protein; price is. 6d 100 do turn is do do 2s. 9 d 50 do <a name="potatoes1286"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> do do 2s.

He drew attention to the importance of cultivating the leguminosawith such plants as the <a name="potato947"><mark>potato</mark></a>, on account of the large quantity of nitrogen they contain. In conclusion, he hoped the present blight would direct attention to the <a name="potatoes1287"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as an article of diet, and lead to a much less extensive dependence on them as food a dependence of which they were unworthy; and, in the end, this dreaded visitation might prove a nationalblessingrTHE <a name="potato948"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease In France. The extraordinary disease which has destroyed the <a name="potatoes1288"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in England has extended its ravages over Belgium and the north of France. In the latter there has been a complete paine on the subject, and, according to a statement in one of the You en journals, the mayor of one commune ordered that no travellers were to be supplied with <a name="potatoes1289"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The Central Society of Horticulture for the department of the Seine I nferieure reputed a commission to visit the spots around You en where the <a name="potato949"><mark>potato</mark></a> is cultivated. I immense fields were found entirely destroyed. In all the neighboring districts the disease was found to be prevalent. In fields with a north or south aspect, having a good or bad situation, in all sorts of soils stiff clay by, light sandy, deep, and shallow the disease is the same. The only differ. 65 hence is, that the red <a name="potatoes1290"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are less affected by it than the others' The disease begins at the stalk: small black spots make their appearance; they increase. and spread, and multiply, till in the end they cover the whole stalk. It begins on the surface, and soon sinks beneath it; the vessels of the plant then take up the virus it descends with the juices, and destroys the texture of the plant The s talks dry and wither. The leaves die the last. The virus being carried to the tubes of the descending sap, small black spots appear in the middle of the <a name="potato950"><mark>potato</mark></a>; they enlarge and spread. When the disease reaches the skin, the starch or pulp decorsposesand becomes dry, hard, and black. The skin breaks ; decomposition is then complete, and the <a name="potato951"><mark>potato</mark></a> is rotten. It is supposed that the cold nights and the rain have caused this disease. The s talks look as if they had been frozen. The commission learnt that the peasants have given these diseased <a name="potatoes1291"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to their cattle without c using them any injury. The commissioners, therefore, had some of those which were just spotted boiled for themselves, and par took of them without inconvenience. The amount of the crop destroyed in the north of France is estimated at one fifth of the whole- You en paper. The <a name="potato952"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops have failed in considerable portions of the provinces of Antwerp and Arab ant. In Hamburg and Luxemburg not a single locality has escaped the infection, but the light soils have less suffered. In western glanders the greater portion of the crop is lost, and in eastern Glanders only one-fourth of the spring <a name="potatoes1292"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and nine tenths of the less forward kind can be used. In Hainault the devastation has been' very extensive ;and in all parts of the provinces of Siege and Femur the disease has raged moore or i less. In fact, it may be broadly asserted that the <a name="potato953"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops have all but universally failed he remark Lane Express.

It is stated that the disease is beginning to show itself in Sweden; and as the crops, particularly of the latter kinds, are more backward than in the Netherlands, it is feared that the disease may spread wider.

The <a name="potato957"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease. Paris Academy of Sciences : sitting of September 15.-Several communications were received relative to the disease which has this year manifested itself in the <a name="potato958"><mark>potato</mark></a>. The writers who treat on this subject, scientific ally, are divided in opinion as to whether the disease is the result of the invasion of a parasitic al mushroom, or solely attribute able to the unfavorable nature of the season. One writer thinks that the parasitic al invasion alluded to is common to the <a name="potato959"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and that it has been developed more extensively by the coldness and dampness of the summer. With due deference to the scientific gentlemen who have turned their attention to the visitation, we beg to observe that it is comparatively of little importance whether the disease have one origin or the other. The great questions to be considered, are, first, whether the diseased <a name="potato960"><mark>potato</mark></a> is, as people suppose, generally poisonous, or in any way injurious to health; secondly, whether, supposing this not to be the case, the disease has deprived the tubercle or its nutrition properties ; and, thirdly, whether these diseased <a name="potatoes1296"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> can be used as seed for the next years crop. M. Philip pon and M. Fouche t say that they have eaten <a name="potatoes1297"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in their diseased state, without suffering from them in any way. This is tranquil living news; but these gentlemen do not tell us to what extent the <a name="potatoes1298"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which they ate were diseased, or whether, supposing that the diseased <a name="potato961"><mark>potato</mark></a> is not poisonous, it has not in its affected parts lost all its farinaceous character. We have examined diseased <a name="potatoes1299"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the present year in all the stages of the disease, and have eaten some of those which were least infected first, however, removing all the unsound parts with a knife and certainly we did not experience any ill effects. This shows that the malady has only invaded such parts of the tubercle as give evidence of its existence; and there cannot be the least doubt that such parts as remain sound are fit for food, whether for man or beast. As to the diseased parts, we have no hesitation in saying that they are wholly unfit for food, whether they be poisonous or not, for they can have no nutrition whatever. As to whether the diseased <a name="potatoes1300"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> may be safely used as seed for the next crops, we do not think it requires much science to give an answer. If any part of the <a name="potato962"><mark>potato</mark></a> remain unsound it may terminate, and produce as good stock as that from a <a name="potato963"><mark>potato</mark></a> that is not diseased; and it is very improbable that the diseased portion should have the power of propagation, for it is a mass of putrid matter but it remains to be seen whether the malady will not continue its ravages between this time and the period for planting, and so deprive the tubercle of all power of propagation. a. 661REPORT Of Of   Of Commi  Ssi  Of Of Agri Culture Of The Provi Nce Ofgroni Ngen, Of The Of Sease Affecti   Of The <a name="potato964"><mark>Potato</mark></a> In Thnetherlands. : :a: *a* .a. :1. Causes and nature of the disease. "did 127) The :agricultural commission is of opinion that the disease is not occasioned by any direct cause, but rather that various circumstances have combined to give the disease this year an extraordinary impulse, it being, in the opinion of many scientific persons, not a new scourge. The primary cause may be attributed to. the extremely wet summer of1845arind to the heavy rains which fell at the moment of the formation of the tubes. It is probably owing to this circumstance that many plants did not terminate. In the second place, the commission is of opinion that the growers do not sufficiently attend to the preservation of the <a name="potatoes1301"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> used as plants, so as to keep them from all damp. It is also very probable that the intense cold in the month of March much injured the tubes. The more direct causes are probably as follows :1. The too rapid development of the plants this year. It is well known that those plants which spring up too quickly, and the grain sown on an over manured soil, are subject to such diseases as ergot for rye and other cereal grains, and rust for wheat, and the presence of cryptogamous plants 2. The intense heat in the early part of the summer of 1845, and which amounted on the 13th June to 87 Fahrenheit, on the 3d July to 870, and on the 7th of July to 91, necessarily had the effect of drying up the ground excessively ; and the rain which fell at intervals during the continuance of the hot weather, and was soaked in, had the effect of scorching, as it were, those plants and <a name="potatoes1302"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which, not being very deeply planted, were exposed to the action of the heated water3This intense heat was succeeded by cold and rainy weather, which lasted from the 16th of July <to the end of the month of August. Thisdamnp weather, and the total absence of the 'verifying rays of the sun, caused a kind of rotten ness among the pithy plants, and especially developed the cryptogamous plants 4. In the 2 1st and 22d of July, an extraordinary fog was perceived in many places, which spread a disgusting smell. Soon afterwards, on the 2 8th of July, the first symptoms of the disease were discovered in the provinces of Gtoningen and North Arab ant. arid it is more than probable that this fog, which was epidemic al, was intimately connected with the disease. According to all the experiments and descriptions made of the disease, it appears that it commences on the upper part, and then attacks successively the leaf; the stalk, and the tube r. This is fully confirmed by an experiment made at Droning en. As it is the upper part of the stalk which isgenerallyifirst attacked, it is probable that the disease originates in i the leaves, descends the stalk by means of the feel, and then communicates with the part below the ground a. In the leaves spots have been perceived, and also a kind of fungus described in the work of Of. Maleschott and Baumhauer, and classed byHMde Parties among the Fusisporium Poland. These hung i are similar in every respect to those drawn by the above gentlemen. It is very probable, then .that the above enumerated circumstances have been the simultaneous causes of the plant rotating, and of the hung i which6621
are observed thereon. It unfortunately happens that these hung i, which are extremely minute, are quickly propagated to an inconceivable extent, favored by the dampness of the atmosphere. But the principal cause, or rather the character of the disease, is a kind of gangrene or mould i ness in the leaf, which occasions a very hurt full and even mortal decay to the plant. The dangerous influence of the cryptogamous plants has long since been shown by the example of the rust (uredorubigo) in corn. As soon as the rust spot developes itself on the leaf of the wheat or oak plant, it is observed that the leaf turns yellow, and withers at the spot where the rust shows itself. To traces of the hung i have been found in the interior of the stalk or in the tube r. The commission, therefore, considers that the disease of these parts results from that of the leaf. It is very probable that the disease has long existed in this country, but it has never hitherto sufficiently developed itself to attract serious attention. Having been fed for two years by a moist temperature, it has increased this year to a frightful extent, and become a real calamity. The commission is, however, of opinion that the disease, as now 'known to us, has never been treated of by naturalists. At any rate, it is far from resembling the cancer described by He Parties, or the scurf of <a name="potatoes1303"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as these two diseases arise in the tube r, and not in the leaves. 2. Remedies for the disease. The disease itself, its character, and causes, having now been sufficiently considered, it is necessary to consider the remedies for the disease, of which the commission points out three different kinds. A means which, unfortunately, it is not in our power to adopt at pleasure that is, a driver atmosphere; for if it be damp that has caused the mould i ness of the leaves, and has propagated it among the plants, it follows that dry weather would put a stop to the ravages of the disease, and even result in entirely destroying it. His observation applies to the measures which science may propose, now that the disease has probably reached its period. I I . To prevent the return of the disease, it is necessary to take the following precautions 1. To leave the <a name="potatoes1304"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the ground until very dry weather, occurs. Experiments having shown that their decay is accelerated by being taken up, it is advisable to leave them in the ground at first, in order to get dried, and afterwards to lay them out over the field. This would have the double advantage of rendering the vegetable more whole some, and of preserving it 2. The following applies especially to those <a name="potatoes1305"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be used as seed for next year. It is necessary to beware of planting those plants which have been attacked by the disease. They must be carefully chosen from those whose s talks have not been attacked, and placed in a situation free from the slightest damp. As the disease has been less severe in gravely than in clay by soils, the tubes should be chosen from those ,gravely soils where the disease has not penetrated 3. The withered leaves of diseased <a name="potatoes1306"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which are of no value, a. 663 should be immediately burnt; the same should be done with the rotten <a name="potatoes1307"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which cannot be of any use. Nothing should remain of them 4. It is necessary to avoid as much as possible planting <a name="potatoes1308"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the same spots where they have been planted this year, for it is most probable that <a name="seeds75"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the hung i have remained in these places, and there would be great risk of the ensuing crop being similarly attacked. It is also necessary to manure the land with lime after the <a name="potatoes1309"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been taken up, and then to clear it; and if the land be employed for produce which need hot be planted before winter, it is better pot to harrow it, and so allow the air and cold to penetrate it. In the spring the lime manure should be renewed as much as possible, and the land may be watered with diluted sulphuric acid, one part of slip hur to 100.of water 5. Next year the <a name="potatoes1310"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be planted in dry land ; all damp places should be avoided, even places shaded by houses or trees. It is once more repeated that great care should be used in selecting the tubes, and they should be planted at a little distance from each other, so that the earth round each plant may be raised, that the air may penetrate everywhere 6. The commission does not agree with those naturalists who think that the origin of the disease may be attributed to the race of <a name="potatoes1311"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> having gradually deteriorated, owing to their being seldom reproduced in fresh soil. The report mentions that in the commune of the Varum, (province of Droning en) among other instances is to be seen a field of <a name="potatoes1312"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the produce of only three years' culture, equally attacked by the disease ; and an infinite number of similar cases prove incontestably that :the <a name="potato965"><mark>potato</mark></a> has not degenerated. However, the commission recommends that fresh seed t should be employed this year; for it will then, at any rate, be certain that it has not been attacked by this scourge. Of  I I. I f, notwithstanding every effort, the disease should again break out next year, the moment the first symptoms of it are perceived, the first leaves that turn yellow should be taken off and burnt, or the entire field should be watered towards evening with lime water, or, still better, with, diluted sulphuric acid, so as to destroy the <a name="seeds76"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the cryptogamous fungiulphuric acid, moreover, prevents rotating, and, when prepared as above directed, can do no injury to the plants themselves 3. Use to be made of the diseased <a name="potatoes1313"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. Those <a name="potatoes1314"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have been attacked by the disease appear not to be pre judicial to health, when taken in moderate quantities. The commission has consulted veterinary surgeons as to whether the <a name="potatoes1315"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> can be 3 employed, without danger, to feed cattle. Their reply was in the affirmative. It has been proved, moreover, that pigs have eaten the diseased <a name="potatoes1316"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> without death ensuing. The commission is, however, of opinion that they should be cooked beforehand. An may likewise make use of the diseased <a name="potatoes1317"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, but must carefully remove the brown spots which caused the disease. It has also been shown, by experiments, that <a name="potatoes1318"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have remained un painted on the same plant where there are spoiled tubes may be eaten without hesitation. I tis almost useless to remark that <a name="potatoes1319"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are completely rotten arehurtful not only to man but to cattle: and too frequent use of spoiled <a name="potatoes1320"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is equally dangerous to those who make their sole food of them. Dr. Westerhoff remarked, that in the commune of Warffum (province of Gronincid127
gen) those persons who made use of spoiled <a name="potatoes1321"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> experienced pains intothe stomach, and nausea, followed by vomiting, after eating them. I that also been perceived that sheep. have been made severely ill by eating attacked <a name="potatoes1322"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, though they were soon cured by a change of food. As to the means to be employed to prevent the baleful influence, that my be exerted on the health of man by eating the diseased <a name="potatoes1323"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the commission proposes to make this the subject of another inquiry. In the mean time, it advises that as much use as possible should be made of thefecula of <a name="potatoes1324"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>.

I do, not think we have yet lost more than the tenth or twelfth of the crop. It is everywhere more observed in wet, heavy land, than in such as is dry and, sandy, or chalky. It is distinguished from the disease that attacked us in 1842, by the rapidity with which the infected <a name="potatoes1325"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> run into a state of putrefaction, by the absence of any evident fungus s pawn or mycelium, and by the obliteration of the membrane of the cells before any diseased action is visible, in the starch grains. I am perfectly satisfied that it is the extraordinary season, combined with the negligence of our cultivates, and their bad treatment of the plant, that have caused us to be visited with this calamity. I cannot believe that any parasitic al fungus has produced any such mischief. This year the parasite aecidium column are has done great mischief to the spruce fir trees on our Alps. The trees have been much weakened by the loss of the leaves of 1844 and 1845, which were loaded with the parasite but leaves of a greater age have not been touched. The young leaves had assumed a dull yellow color before they were attacked, and this disease, which was the precursor of the fungus, was no doubt caused by the long duration of an extraordinary lodgment of snow during the past winter, and by sudden changes of temperature (as much as from 300 to 50 R. in three days) during the summer.

Maude r, Count Minims gardener, at Boitzenburg, (in Mecklenburg) has succeeded in producing a good crop of <a name="potatoes1327"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from seed the same year in. 665 Was sown, and as large as those from sets, and those needling <a name="potatoes1328"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are entirely free from disease. His plan is as follows: He ga the th apples before the frost sets in, (according to others, a slight frost does not injure them) and keeps them in a dry place till the end of January. The apples are then crushed with the hand into a vessel, where they lie from six to eight days to rot, that the <a name="seeds77"><mark>seeds</mark></a> may be easily separated from the pulp. Later is then poured on, and the seed is washed and dried like cucumber seed, and put away in a dry place. At the end of March, or beginning of April, the seed is sown in a hot bed, and treated much the same as otherculinary plants. If there is a convenient place for a hot bed near a wall or house, exposed to the sun, glass is not necessary. The plants may be treated like tube vous plants; but as they are very susceptible of frost at night, they should be covered with straw or boards, which can easily be done, as the bed is surrounded with boards set in the ground, upon which the covering can be laid without injuring the plants. In May, if the plants are well grown, they can be planted out in a light soil about the usual distance that sets are planted. Maude r this year sowed early <a name="potato967"><mark>potato</mark></a> seed on the 11th April, and planted them out on the 26th May ; and here we may remark that vegetation is 14 days later in Boitzenburg than in Berlin. The plants produced from 1 to 1 gallon (met zen) of tubes. One plant even produced 280 tubes. There were of course a great many small tubes among them, yet the produce of large ones was, on the whole, equal to the produce from sets. As Maude r has followed this plan for five years, he was able this year to give seed to several gentlemens' gardeners and laborers. The <a name="potatoes1329"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> raised by them have all been healthy, while the disease was everywhere, and even in the neighborhood. The result of this experiment deserves to be widely spread, that the people may still preserve the apples for next year. The space of half a square room of land (7 feet) is sufficient to raise enough to plant one acre, so that it will be useful for small farmers who plant just enough for themselvesPreussische Zeitung.

Of Franci     S Augustus Of Nckert Wei Mer. The crops of <a name="potatoes1331"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in mountainous districts are found to be invariably of better quality, and larger in quantity, than those raised elsewhere. In former years only single <a name="potatoes1332"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have rotted here and there; still it is only within the last few years that the malignant and destructive <a name="potato968"><mark>potato</mark></a>, rot has commenced.

I n Bavaria <a name="potatoes1334"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> rot sooner than they did six years ago. Those from the other side of the Rhine being planted, they were no better. In Austria and Russia, particularly in Vera, this disease exists. In some fields not half of those planted terminated. In the midst of all these, we were delighted to see the fields of On Meutzch, with fine luxuriant crops of po toes, owing to the rational mode of cultivation. Any tenants who had raised several hundred pecks of <a name="potatoes1335"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> now had but twenty or thirty pecks. In ness e and Pass au, Mechlenburgand In halt, the crops of 1842 were very diseased. In 1780 and 1782 there was a <a name="potato969"><mark>potato</mark></a> disease, but only of the stems and leaves. In England and France the disease is complained of greatly. In Denmark, in Sweden, and in Norway, it is found. In the Russian provinces on the Baltic it appeared in 1843, and the seed <a name="potatoes1336"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> procured from a distance suffered as well as the native seed. This disease shows itself by perfectly obliterating the whole internal organic structure of the <a name="potato970"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant. It is of two kinds the wet and the dry rot. Professor Kohlert, of Prague, terms the dry rot a cold combustion. They have white spots on them called combustion spots n Pass au, the <a name="potatoes1337"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, after digging, show on their outsides brownish red spots' After being in the cellar some time, they become spongy, cavities commence in them, and a very bad smell. In Saxony, they say the spots were black, and they term them corruption spots. 'lee man says the dry rot does not always affect all the <a name="potatoes1338"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the same field at the same time, or same extent; that the eyes are first affected. In 184 the first observed numerous brown or black spots on them, called stagnation spots. Kohlert says the wet rot causes the <a name="potato971"><mark>potato</mark></a> to become spongy, moist; and, being compressed, resemble rotten cheese, and also have a putrefying smell and such ones infect sound <a name="potatoes1339"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in contact with them. In Thuringia, <a name="potatoes1340"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> had the wet rot. Formerly they had been injured much by worms. A field which had never before been planted with <a name="potatoes1341"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> showed the same disease. Of Sease Of The Potatoftranslated by H. Veins, esq, Secretary of the New York Farmers' Club, fro in the Annalesde la Society Royale dHorticulture de Paris, November, 1845.]Note by M. May en on the special affection of <a name="potatoes1342"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in 1845 :progress of the disease his special affection of the <a name="potatoes1343"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> has extended from Germany to Belgium and to Great Britain, and afterwards to France, where it has spread by degrees in the departments of the north, northwest, centre, south and east, moving step by step, attacking all varieties of soil, situation, exposure sparing here and there spaces of more or less extent, or circumscribed in the midst of diseased fields. In the midst of this confusion, we have generally remarked varieties of. 6 67 <a name="potatoes1344"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> ripe king very rapidly, some later escaping the evil. Cry, sandy, sloping soils, open to the south, may be little or not at all diseased. Causesall observers agree in acknowledging the influence of extraordinary weather: cold in a very wet summer intervals of great heat and storm. The luxuriant growth of the <a name="potato972"><mark>potato</mark></a> s talks promised a great crop; but the tissues having pores thus widely opened, distended with the wet which the, plant could not ex hale, were easily dislocated by sudden cold, and more generally in this condition they received the germs of the cryptogamid, whose s po rules penetrated through the conducts of the s talks, so full of liquid, to the tubes. We conclude that the disease consists in the development of cryptogamous vegetation from s po rules, introduced into the <a name="potato973"><mark>potato</mark></a> through the s talks. This parasite vegetation often attacks only those <a name="potatoes1345"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> nearest to the bottom of the stalk, sparing almost always those <a name="potatoes1346"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are second or third in growth on the roots of the plant. This cryptogamous vegetation and the diseased <a name="potatoes1347"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are then attacked by various insects, which have been carefully observed and described by Messrs. Layer and Euer in He neville. Putrefaction then fills the tissues with fungus, and, besides, they are attacked by myriads of microscopic animalculae, which, in their turn, decay and add their ruins to the putrefaction. One rational mode of preventing this disease would be to burn the <a name="potato974"><mark>potato</mark></a> s talks, so that we may destroy as many of the s po rules as possible. But many would still escape. Letter seasons than our last may doubtless suspend or diminish this evil. We ought to plant our crops of <a name="potatoes1348"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as far as, possible from the fields where they were diseased. We ought to plant them on dry, sloping lands, rather than wet and low grounds. We ought to plant such <a name="potatoes1349"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as ripe n early. We ought to plant all the varieties of <a name="potatoes1350"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from fields not yet diseased. Time the <a name="potatoes1351"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for planting, and give the soil some lime. Watch the growth of the <a name="potato975"><mark>potato</mark></a> s talks, and as soon as they show signs of disease cut off the s talks, take them away, and burn them. When the <a name="potatoes1352"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are approaching maturity, watch the leaves, and take off such as show disease.

Note by M.

We hoped a great crop (about the last of July) but all this anticipated maturity paralyzed the growth of the <a name="potatoes1357"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, so that, although one crop was good as to the quality, yet the p <a name="potatoes1358"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were small and few in number. From the Farmers' Cabinet, February, 1845. Of Sease In The <a name="potato976"><mark>Potato</mark></a>. A committee was ordered, by the Philadelphia Agricultural Society, sometime since, to collect facts and materials for a report on the disease of the <a name="potato977"><mark>potato</mark></a> now prevailing. As a part of their action, the I following translation was made, at their desire, of a paper on the subject, by Professor On War 668 ti us, one of the most celebrated scientific men of Europe; and they now publish it as a part of the report that they intend making at some future time. The <a name="potato978"><mark>potato</mark></a> epidemic of last year, or the rot and scab of the <a name="potato979"><mark>potato</mark></a>, described by Dr. C. F. Oh. On Parties : Punish, 1842. Certain diseases of the <a name="potato980"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant have been observed for more than eighty years. Curlthe curl has been observed in 1776 79, in the principal it ofGoettingen, and was described first in 1779. The so called white table <a name="potato981"><mark>potato</mark></a> was almost the only sort attacked at first. In 1780 90, the disease appeared frequently on the British I s les, where it is said to have been first observed in I re land, whence it spread over England and Scotland. John Holtmenticns two other diseases, as having appeared contemporaneously with the curl, viz: the cancer, which appeared, according to him, chiefly in wet seasons; and the scab, which appeared to be produced by dry seasons. In Hanover, the curl was first observed by Her, in 1790, and in the beginning of this century it showed itself most destructive ly in Southernprussia, since which time it has shown itself at different places in Germany; nowhere, however, to any great extent. Putsche, a monographerofthe <a name="potato982"><mark>potato</mark></a>, gives the following description of the .curl: The plants attacked by it look very poor; stem of a brownish green, or of a variegated color, with rubiginous spots, penetrating into its with; leaves rough, wrinkled, curled, shrunk, with short pet poles, covered with spots some of a light green, others of a yellowish green color. The with of the sick plants is often found rust eaten, as it were, and parched. Early in the fall the plants turn yellow and perish. The few tubes found are of a bad flavor, soap y, and hardly eat able; leaving, when eaten, a feeling of scratching in the throat. The very skin of the tubes is different from that of the sound ones; its color being partly brown, partly of a pale yellow, or often with both colors blended. Experience has shown that certain varieties of <a name="potatoes1359"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are more liable to this disease than others; that they are less exposed to it on mountains than in the level country; that the round and of long red varieties are more readily attacked by it than the white ones; and that this disease is propagated by the seed <a name="potatoes1360"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and does not disappear before the fourth or fifth generation, even when the plants are well taken care of. Rustanother disease, which is mentioned as occurring contemporaneously with the curl, is compared by Putsche with the rust of the grain. According to his description, small rubiginous spots appear on the leaves of the sick <a name="potato983"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants, and, spreading gradually further, cover finally the whole surface of the leaves. The perspiration of the leaves being impeded, the stems become parched and wither ; or, where this latter does not take place, black n obs are developed in the tubes, which are harder and more string y than the rest of their substance. The causes of this disease are unknown; it is often but of short duration, and is cured by a gentle rain. Mr. Same mentions a disease of the <a name="potato984"><mark>potato</mark></a> under the same name of rust, where the tubes show spots of the colors of the rust, with excoriations here and there. This disease occurred in cold, wet summers, when fresh dung had been brought upon the soil. Blue pox Another disease, called blue pox, or blue tumor, not yet obs. 669 served by Mr. Martins himself, has appeared in several parts of the kingdom of Saxony, and in the Upper Are. According to Mr. Am pes description, blue spots and risings are first observed on the skin of the tubes afterwards a dark colored texture, similar to a rhizomorpha, (probably the forerunner of a, mushroom) appears, which surrounds the tube r, penetrating even its interior, followed by blue spots and streaks in the heart of its substance. It is said to be produced by an improper admixture of sawdust and pine straw, and other imperfectly de composed organic substances, with the dung. Very wet weather causes, then, the final outbreak of the disease. Rotthe disease which has lately committed so great ravages in the <a name="potato985"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops seems to be the same that was described first in 1769, byGleditsch, and may be called the rot. In Germany it has been called " rot of the stem" " fruit cancer" "rot, or gangrene of the tube r." This same disease seems to have prevailed in the Saxon Voigtland, in 1783, when the summer was very hot and very foggy. It was described in 1784, by Dr. Ackermann. In the present century it began to show itself first epidemic ally in 1830, in France and Germany in the latter country, in Rhenishbavaria, Northern Bohemia, Saxon Mountains, Erfurt, In halt, Silesian andMeklenburgand continued increasing in intensity, and spreading more and more, until it reached its height in 1840. The rot may be designated by the dry and the moist rot, according to the degree of moisture either contained in the tube r, or acting from without upon it. Symptoms of this disease are the <a name="potatoes1361"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> brought home to the cellar, and the seed <a name="potatoes1362"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> when laid on the field, get rapidly rotten; and the latter either rot before the leaves have sprouted, or they produce but small and scanty lateral tubes, closely attached to the seed <a name="potatoes1363"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, of the size of musket bullets, which produce but very slender stems, or the plants that are grown from them are but meagre and soon droop and wither. At any rate, but few small and weak tubes are produced. These, when but little exposed to moisture, appear dry and hard, of a consistency like that of ruffles, and unable to produce any eyes; when brought into the ground, they soon rot by attracting the moisture from the ground. Fields that suffer much from this disease look like stubble fields, where <a name="potatoes1364"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, left here and there, from last harvest, have sprouted. The flowers show themselves very unequally on such plants, and but very seldom produce fruit. The rot seems to have appeared principally in those parts of Germany where a denser and more industrious population cultivate the <a name="potato986"><mark>potato</mark></a> in a more rational, but also more refined way, and chiefly where they raise their <a name="potatoes1365"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> not by laying whole tubes, but by cutting these into several slices. Too great economy in planting the <a name="potato987"><mark>potato</mark></a> seems, therefore, to have a a essential influence on producing this epidemic al disease. The two forms of mushrooms that are observed most frequently in <a name="potatoes1366"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> attacked by the rot, are set by Parties under the genus Fusisporium, and are called by him Asp. Vol an, and Asp. sporotrichoides. Chemical analysis or. And r. Buchner, jr, found, on a chemical anal y si of <a name="potatoes1367"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> infected with the rot, which he made at the request of Dr. Parties, that no new substance had been formed in them; they contained a considerable quantity of asylum in cases where the moist rot had not shown itself, but only the dry one and its quality was not alte word, but the albumen had disappeared entirely; and the quantity of water, of 6 70 which the sound <a name="potatoes1368"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> contained 73.6 per en t, had been reduced in the diseased ones to less than the half; i. e, to 35.6 per cent. The fibrin in them was of a brownish color, and in part already mouldyScbThere appears often at the same time with the rot, another disease, less injurious, called the scab, which occurs, however, also sporadic ally, from a great variety of external causes. As far as it is known toMartius, the scab produces but very rarely an entire alteration of the substance of the seed <a name="potatoes1369"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. It is distinguished, from the rot by its being merely a corruption of the cellular tissue, that ises immediately under the epidermis, followed by the generation of a mushroom, called by him Protomyces tube rum Poland, and by the destruction of the epidermis. The rot, on the contrary, infects the entire substance of the <a name="potato988"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and is an induration and a mould i ness of the tube r. Sometimes, also, the tube r that are attacked by the scab pass into a state of putrefaction, or produce but feeble stems, with fewer tubes, yet far less frequently than those attacked by the rot. Dr. Parties has not been able to determine whether the scab and the rot occur together on one and the same field, or even on one and the same plant. Causes of the rot There are both external and internal causes of the rot, of which the former regard, first, the preparation of the seed <a name="potatoes1370"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for laying, and the soil wherein to plant them; second, the state of the weather; and, third, insects wounding the plants. The internal or predisposing causes regard, first, the peculiarities of the different sorts of <a name="potatoes1371"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> second, the manner of treating the plant on the field, and of treating the seed <a name="potatoes1372"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from harvest time to the time of planting them ; and, third, the way of laying the tubes, and of treating the plant till its maturity. Soilzthe chemical composition and the degree of density of the soil seem to have the greatest influence on the growth of the <a name="potato989"><mark>potato</mark></a>. In its native country, in Peru and Phil i, it grows in cold mountain regions, and in a stony soil, that is rich in loam, but sufficiently loose. In Europe the sandy soil has been found the most convenient. The rot has been observed, however, on all kinds of soil, comparatively speaking; however, less frequently, on a light, sandy, loose soil, rich in mould, than on a hard and heavy one. The scab of the <a name="potato990"><mark>potato</mark></a>, on the other hand, has been observed principally on lime soil. It is not so much, however, the original quality of the soil, as the particular way of preparing it, which seems to influence the rot, since it has been observed even on fields that were manured carefully, at the right time and with old dung, whilst other fields, badly cultivated or not manured at all, remained free from it, and yielded even good crops. Manuremost injurious seems to be the bringing the seed <a name="potatoes1373"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in immediate contact with the dung. Manure is best applied before the beginning of the winter season. Hung that is too fresh and too hot is in general injurious. Moisturewith regard to moisture, stationary wet ness is undoubtedly injurious. In its native country the <a name="potato991"><mark>potato</mark></a> is found thriving in a dry soil, which at certain seasons is strongly penetrated by moisture. A rotation of crops appropriate to the locality has been observed to be favorable to the productive ness of the <a name="potato992"><mark>potato</mark></a>. Weatherwith regard to the weather, as an external cause of the rot, we may conclude from all the reports that have come in, that most parts of Germany that have been ravaged by this epidemic have rather suffered by too great dryness, than by too great moisture. A long continuance of dry weather in spring proved very injurious to the sprouting of the seed pot a. 671 toes in the Palatinate. In the lower Rhine, on the contrary, wet ness was found to favor the breaking out of the rot; the same has been the case in the Are mountains, and in Bohemia. A very singular fact, observed in several villages of the Palatinate, was that of <a name="potatoes1374"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, taken from one and the same cellar; all those laid in the morning sprouted, while all those laid in the afternoon failed. Parties is opposed to the opinion of those who seek the cause of the rot in insects laying their eggs on the <a name="potatoes1375"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as but very rarely any eggs have been found on them. He is, on the other hand, not disinclined to side with those agriculturists who believe that two different sorts f <a name="potatoes1376"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of very different d egress of acclamation being planted aside of each other, the one less acclimated will exert an injurious influence upon the other. In the year 1781, already several farmers ascribed the cause of the curl to the cultivation of the lately introduced large American or New England how <a name="potato993"><mark>potato</mark></a> the same probably as the English cluster, or perhaps also to that of the kindred Toward, or large cattle <a name="potato994"><mark>potato</mark></a>, in the neighborhood of the red <a name="potato995"><mark>potato</mark></a> then generally cultivated. I internal causesMartins has observed the rot attacking only the late sorts. In the Palatinate, the g elbe and we is se Speisekartoffel, i. e. yellow and white table <a name="potato996"><mark>potato</mark></a> ; and among these, more those of a softer and proportion ally more juice texture were chiefly attacked. In Saxony, Meklenburg, and elsewhere, again, all sorts were attacked indifferently. Joints to be observed in the cultivation of the <a name="potato997"><mark>potato</mark></a> n cultivating the <a name="potato998"><mark>potato</mark></a>, we have to attend to the following points, when we wish to obtain a healthy crop 1st. The seed <a name="potatoes1377"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are to be raised separately from those destined for food, since the growth of the eyes in the tubes takes place at the expense of the asylum contained in them. In gathering and bringing home the <a name="potatoes1378"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, they ought to be guarded from all unnecessary concussion s 2d. In preserving them in cellars, they are to be kept from freezing, but so as not to prevent a free draught of air, since they begin to perspire soon after being brought in, chiefly in confined places, and continue to do so for four to six weeks; which perspiration, when not allowed to e vapor ate, occasions their decomposition 3d. Those tubes will prove the best for raising vigorous plants whose eyes are yet quite short, but juice, and where the tubes have just begun to spend a part of their nutrition matter in the formation of the eyes, which is recognised by a slight withering of them 4th. Ord at care is necessary in propagation g the <a name="potato999"><mark>potato</mark></a> by cuttings, as those whose eyes were wounded have been found particularly liable to the rot. Chiefly the upper part of the tube r, lying opposite to its point of connection with the plant, and having the greatest number of eyes, ought to be used for planting. The cuttings ought to be kept for eight days at a moderately warm place before planting them, or to be strewn with wood ashes or gypsy m on the cut surface, in order to make them less accessible to the moisture of the soil. *5th. In laying the cuttings, care must be had to lay them with their eyes upwards. When, instead of entire tubes, cuttings only are laid, it is important whether the earth around them lies loosely or closely, and in what manner the sloughing is done. The rot has been in general less frequently observed where, instead of the plough, the spade is used. With regard to 72 the manure, Parties thinks it is best to cover the cuttings with earth, and then first to spread the dung over them in the furrows. In the ore mountains of Saxony, the farmers have improved their <a name="potato1000"><mark>potato</mark></a> drops in quantity, as well as in quality, by laying whole tubes, instead of cuttings, and preparing for every one of them a couch, as it were, of a handful of dried leaves, or of chopped straw, and covering them afterwards with earth 6th. It is necessary to heap up the earth around the stem of the <a name="potato1001"><mark>potato</mark></a> plants, and it will depend on the quality of the soil, and the sort of <a name="potato1002"><mark>potato</mark></a> used, to what height that is to be done 7th. It is injurious to the growth of the tubes to cut off the leaves and to pluck off the flowers; the later the season is at which the leaves are out, the more the future crop is diminished, as the plant will spend part of the substance accumulated in the tube r in forming new sprout shot a contagious epidemicMartius considers the rot of the <a name="potato1003"><mark>potato</mark></a> a san epidemic al disease, being contagious under certain dispositions, and having its seat in the tube r, in which it produces a peculiar decomposition and destruction of its form, which, at a certain stage of the disease, renders it unfit for self preservation and propagation, and terminates with the production of a peculiar mushroomFusisporium Poland. Parties a scribes to the seed grains, or s po rules of the latter, the capacity of infecting other tubes already predisposed to this disease, so as to produce in them the rot. Cries, in his System a Micologicum, and Anger, think the rot, as well as the ergot in the grain, to be produced by comic causes, and not to be contagious at all. Sinclair, Pink, and. He Candolle, on the other hand, think it contagious, and the last mentioned scholar believes that the seed grains of the smut (are do) come always from below, out of the ground, in which they lie in great numbers, into the plants which inhale them, together with the water through their articles. This opinion corresponds with the previous observations of Night, Billet, and Easier. The smut can then only develop e itself when a diseased mixture of the juices has been prepared by unfavorable terrestrial and comical relations as too fresh manure, sudden changes from cold to heat; or, vice versa, great wet ness, too early harvesting. Experiments have been made concerning the contagiousness of the Fusisporium Poland. When its seed grains were sown upon slices of both diseased and healthy <a name="potatoes1379"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the mushrooms developed themselves very rapidly within three weeks. When they were sown on the outside of a healthy thin skinned <a name="potato1004"><mark>potato</mark></a>, its epidermis became diseased, which might be seen by numerous round dry spots of one twenty-fourth of an inch in diameter, and of a darker color. Preventive remediesMartius does not expect to see the rot cease entirely. In order to prevent contagion, the ground of places where infected <a name="potatoes1380"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been kept is to be strewn with pure dry sand or ashes, and in cases of strong infection, straw might be burned in the cellar, or the walls be whitewashed. The diseased <a name="potatoes1381"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> themselves are not to be thrown upon the dung hill, but into the water, or to be buried. Need <a name="potatoes1382"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> that come from fields infected with the rot, before laying them, are to be slightly moistened, to be strewn with powdered lime and ashes, and to be turned with a shovel. Numbers that have not sprouted may be laid for some hours in lime water. The only remedy against the seed grains of the mushroom buried in the Doc. 6. 140. Ground, is to raise in such a field, as long as possible, other fruits, and, when about to raise again <a name="potatoes1383"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in it, to mix the soil with gypsy m, loam, lime 4. Preservatives are: to select, for raising, some good sort; to separate the seed <a name="potatoes1384"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, from the very first, from those destined for food; to sort the <a name="potatoes1385"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> according to their size; to reject those apparently healthy, that show dis colored round is h tumors. To secure the <a name="potatoes1386"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in the cellar from rot and scab, the cellar ought to be dry, and, if possible, laid out with dry boards, and ought to have a sufficient draught of air; the floor to be strewn, besides, to the depth of some inches with sand mixed with ashes, coal dust, or fine iron filings. Trhepotatoes ought to be well dried before laying them upon this, in heaps of more than four feet high. Horizontal poles ought to be stuck in, with dry brushwood round, to draw off the vapors arising from them, and the <a name="potatoes1387"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> to be laid upon the poles.

It is not a matter of surprise that a plant cultivated under such various circumstances as <a name="potatoes1388"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> should be subject to various diseases. Some of these have been more or less imperfectly described in the older agricultural works; but in the absence of all minute details, it is almost impossible to ascertain precisely what is meant. I need, before the improvements which have been made in microscopes within the last 10 or 15 years, it was scarcely possible to enter into some points in the diseases of plants, which are now comparatively easy The principal diseases which have been noticed in <a name="potatoes1389"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are the curl, the rust, the blue pock, the scab, and the dry rot. The disease of the present year is different from all of them. The three first have not at present been sufficiently observed. For an admirable account of the two latter, we are indebted to the zeal of the Bavaria n government, and the scientific researches of Dr. Parties. The curl is described in the "hanover Magazine" page 1779, as follows: "soon after their first appearance the shoots become curled, and make but little progress afterwards; sometimes, indeed, they disappear all together. Some, however, remain nearly stationary, either not producing blossoms at all, or only very weak ones, which soon fall off and yield no seed. They produce no tubes, or only a few minute ones, which are strong and unfit for food. These, however, when set, do not always produce plants infected with the disease. It is said that at the; base of the shoots, where they spring from the set, there is a hole, which the author attributes to the agency of some insect: This disease was extremely prevalent in England towards the end of the: "eighteenth century, and prizes were offered for the discovery of some means of arresting its progress. It is probable, from some of the descrip43674 nations that were published, that it was accompanied in some cases by rust and scab; but in what degree the diseases are connected, it is at present impossible to say. Various causes were assigned by those who first observed it. At present, the more general opinion is, that it arises from the use of over ripe tubes. A fuller description is given of the disease in the "monograph of <a name="potatoes1390"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a>" published by Putsche and Vertuch, at Weimar, in 1819. The plants which are affected by this disease have an extremely meagre appearance. The stem is un branched, brownish green, or mottled, and here and there sprinkled with rusty spots, which penetrate to the with, so that it is not white but rust colored, or sometimes black. The upper surface of the leaves is not so smooth as usual, but rough, wrinkled, curled, or crumpled. The leaves are far more sessile than usual, and are not of a uniform brownish or dark green, but spotted. The passages for circulation, inhibition, and respiration, are none of them in a healthy state. The with is often dis colored, or dried even in the young shoots. The starved plant often perishes early in autumn, when the tubes should be making the most rapid growth. These are scanty and taste less, juice, and almost unfit for food. Even the, color of the outer coat of the tubes is changed. The same tube r is in parts brown, in parts of a dirty yellow, and sometimes the to o tints run into each other. Some sorts of <a name="potatoes1391"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are more subject to the disease than others. It is more prevalent in fiat countries than in more elevated districts. The second disease mentioned by Martins is rust; which, however, as is in 'the case of the curl, he has not himself had an opportunity of observing i It di described in the Monograph, quoted as above, as allied to the rust of wheat. -in ist colored spots appear upon the leaves, which are at first small, but gradually increase, and at length overrun the whole leaf. As the respiration of the leaves is in consequence impeded, the stems are thin, andiataist wither. When, however, this does not take place, the flesh of the tubes is infested with black knots, which resemble ulcers, and are harder and more fibrous than the rest of the flesh. The cause of this disease is unknown. It is often only of short duration, and is ameliorated by mild rains, so that the produce is not much affected. The t nature of this disease is evidently very obscure. It is probably theSaqte with that mentioned by Standinger, in the I s is of 1832, as occurring at Alton A, in land highly manured with her rings. The peasants aboutHambubrg and Alton A attributed the rust in wheat to the introduction of <a name="potatoes1392"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. H -ollandihad the monopoly of <a name="potatoes1393"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and supplied Hamburg, but at length they depended on a home supply ; and <a name="potatoes1394"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> being largelycitiiatedi o highly manured land, in consequence of a rise in the price of' ~eat: they believe that their wheat became infected with rust. There is great doubt as to its being really allied to the disease in corn which bears the same name. The third disease is the blue pock. Parties has not himself observed it. Thitape 'describes it as first appearing under the form of blue spots, and elevation on the skin of the tubes. At a later period, dark rhizomorphalike ti 1 read (piobablyithe, mycelium of a fungus) invest the tubes, or eventhietrates their substance. i Blue spots and stripes at length appear in the beth lfhetfubers, which are not eat able. It is said that it arises in very top. N o 10. *65 wet weather from under composed matter, such as sawdust, (which in the infected districts is used extensively for floors, instead of stand) being mixed with the dung. The disease, to the examination of which the greater part of Martiussbook is dedicated, (the dry rot) makes its appearance on the tubes after they are stored in the pit or cellar, and when, in early summer, the sets are committed to the ground. In the latter case they perish before they have thrown out any shoots, or merely produce one or two minute tubes, which either do not produce shoots at all, or only such as are extremely weak and soon perish. If there is little moisture, the tubes become hard and dry and as soon as the soil becomes wet, the greater part perish, so that the fields appear like fallow lands sprinkled with a few stray <a name="potatoes1395"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the last years crop. The disease is often accompanied by scab; which, however, is not so universally diffused through the infected districts as the dry it, but is sporadic in its appearance, while the dry rot is a complete epidemic. It was first observed in 1830; but it had increased in the year 1840 in, various parts of Germany to such an extent as to cause very serious alarm, and even to threaten the total extinction, for a time, of the cultivation of <a name="potatoes1396"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. The <a name="potato1005"><mark>potato</mark></a> pits, when opened, exhibited a greater or less degree of corruption, three parts out of four occasionally having become altogeqpruseless; and of the residue, when planted, the greater part often failed :ti rely. In the early stages of the disease, the use of the tubes was not found to be injurious to man or cattle. In the latter stages of growth, bowed, it e decay is such as to make it quite impossible to use them. The disease is very insidious in its progress. When the crop is harvested, there is little to attract the superficial eye. The surface of the til bell is rather dull and wrinkled, and then gradually exhibits little round, birqnihspots, which soon become confluent. The surface then appears more than usually cracked and reticulated, and at length scaly, the edges of the scales being free. Sometimes, however, the tubes become transversely wrinkled, in which case their color remains nearly the same as in healthy individuals. in thin, the tube r is clouded and dis colored, and has an unpleasant smell, and is soon more or less impregnated with a peculiar species of mould, which forms white elevated compact spots on the outer surface, and is distinguished by its curved, fusiform, articulated spores. The grains of starch are found not to be in their normal state, their surface being covered with variously shaped processes. This disease does not appear to have been sufficiently prevalent in this country to attract much notice. Whether it depends upon the growth of the mould, or whether the mould is merely subsequent to the disease, is uncertain. The mould itself is either very variable, or two or three sped (cid127fcid127ia very similar habit occur on diseased tubes. Is, however, English and French specimens, though they, exhibit form of spores different from what Parties figures, present very in trial ii terences of form in the same tuft of mould, I am myself inclined to :ti i that the different kinds may all be referred to one species. The disease is often accompanied by scab, which is easily raised by its rather cup shaped bordered pustules, the concave surface do fr ich is covered with a stratum of large, yore or less gaobuliaar, snow it reticulated spores, which are at first greentiscid127) and at length acquire d ferrugitious676 tint. The spores are attacked at first by a little, somewhat lateral, thread, and usually exhibit a sort of him, which Parties has not noticed They agree in structure with those of a parasite which is sometimes common at the base of a different species of Orobanche, and which has been described by Cries, under the name of Tuburcina. A similar fungus occurs on the leaves of Rental is Europas. Parties has referred it to the genus Protomyces, in consequence of not having observed the little thread by which it is attached. The scab occurs principally in ground which has been dressed with rubbish from old buildings, or where the soil is in a very raw and ill drained condition. It is sometimes very destructive, and is usually to be met with in greater or less quantities in some portion of every crop. Parties has entered into very minute detail, and at very considerable length, as regards both the dry rot and the scab, but we have stated sufficient to enable any one to recognise them. As in most cases of the diseases of plants, it is more easy to discover the cause than to suggest a remedy, the suggestions given by Parties are confined within a small compass. If the disease arise from the attack of a species of mould, it will, of course, be advisable to take all possible precautions against infection ; though, where the spores are so subtle, this is almost a hopeless task. Some good, however, may be expected to result from change of soil, and proper purifying and disinfecting of the store houses; and more, perhaps, from such a system of culture as will insure the vigorous but not exuberant growth of the crop. I have seen occasionally a good deal of damage among store <a name="potatoes1397"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, arising, I believe, from this disease; but, as I have not be enable at present to obtain specimens of infected tubes from Germany, I cannot positively state that it is identical. The disease of the present year is altogether different from any that has been recorded. M. J. B. Report Of Of. Von Marti   Of, Commi  Ssi  Oner Appoi Nted Of The Of Ghmi  Of Steri Of Rescri Of Of August 25, For The Accurate I Nvesti   -GATI   Of Of The <a name="potato1006"><mark>Potato</mark></a> Of Sease In The Palati   Natetranslated from the Central Platt des Landwirthschaftlichen He reins in Layer n, by E. Good rich Smith, of the Patent Officeto the Royal Academy of Science n executing the honorable commission of the 25th of August, to institute further investigations, in time and place, for the full understanding of tie notices respecting the <a name="potato1007"><mark>potato</mark></a> epidemic in the pa latin ate, for the examination of the locality, the local and general causes, and the more perfect judgment of the original cause generally, I visited, in the end of the month of September, the And Commissariat at Frankenthal, and I now have the honor respectfully to report the results of my investigations in the following observations, prepared for the further use of the Kings Minister of the     interior. The <a name="potato1008"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop of this year, in that region, has suffered a considerable loss. This is not of equal proportion in the particular fields; but while many farmers are satisfied with the product, both in quantity and quality, others in the neighborhood complain of a most decisive deficiency of s talks, i. e of. 77 a failure of more or less s talks, so that the sprouts producing the knobs are either wholly wanting or have put forth only a few small knobs, or none a tall. In the first case we observe the rows of the <a name="potato1009"><mark>potato</mark></a> hills on the field interrupted, and this is the case in different circumstances. Any times a single plant is missed from the row; many times a whole succession of three, four, six, and more plants. In many this deficiency is scattered about in the s are proportion ; in others, on part of the field, all remain sound, while still another presents abundant marks of failure. Neighboring c fields are often thus uninjured by the disease The dis similarity of this years harvest, soil, and climate, being the same, confirms the view already presented that the proximal e causes of the disease are not to be sought so much in these general circumstances as in local means of injury. The failure the present year does not exhibit itself, in the And Commissariat of Frankenthal, so much in the early <a name="potatoes1398"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> as in the much larger proportion of late <a name="potatoes1399"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In the fields which for the most part I have investigated in company with the royal land commissioner, Vonpollnitz, there were everywhere round, middle sized, white, yellow, or fine skinned, meal y, clear, reddish kinds of <a name="potatoes1400"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. At the first view of the fields in that region planted with <a name="potatoes1401"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the circumstance was striking, that, although the stalk in the average had reached the usual development, yet the number of stems which blossom ed or bore fruit was very small in proportion. While, heretofore, in Germany, in most regions, the <a name="potato1010"><mark>potato</mark></a> s talks have been seen in blossom from the second half of August, and even the present year in many places for example, on the A as; in Mannheim, and Heidelbergin September numerous s talks were in blossom, and others bearing fruit) yet in the And Commissariat of Frankenthal, at the end of September the fields s hewed but very rarely a blossoming stalk, and the <a name="potato1011"><mark>potato</mark></a> balls were few. But otherwise, in general, on those fields which have suffered a loss of plants no visible change with respect to the stalk was to be noticed. Such had, yet further, the usual height and quantity of leaves, and only in particular cases, of which we shall directly speak, did any variation appear in those portions above ground. A closer comparison of the particular plants on one and the same field showed a great dis similarity in the vegetation, as well in regard to the stalk as the knobs* This view is confirmed by the different accounts of the disease in Germany, as well as in the ample statement which a Scotch farmer (charles Ferguson) has collected together from the numerous notices of British agriculturists, inserted in the Journal of the High land Agricultural Society at Edinburgh. The rot of the stem, in English, taint, failure, rot, dry rot, which made its appearance in an alarming manner in Great Britain, in 1834, as did the epidemic curl disease in 1792, has given occasion to many similar treatises. Ferguson has given prominence especially to ist, the period of planting the knobs; 2d, the time when the knobs which had set were taken from the ground; 3d, the method of their preservation; 4th, the mode of preparing J e <a name="potato1012"><mark>potato</mark></a> fields; 5th, the kind and condition of the manure; 6th, the condition of the setting knobs; from what place they were taken; whether they were laid whole or cut in pieces; 7th, the question whether the plants were exhausted, and a renewal of the seed would be necessary. The views of the British agriculturists are very diverse. But in one point they all agree that cuttings warrant no sure r crop. The general valuable results of the observations alluded to have been employed in drawing up the rules recommended at the close of this report See report on the failure of the <a name="potato1013"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, in the Quarter ly Journal of Agriculture of theHighlandand and Agricultural Society of Scotland, No. 36, 1837, page 477511S
. According to the results of such a classification of the different circumstihs, bringing under view the whole growth, the plants which were found i in the fields may be arranged in the following three groups afferent conditions of the <a name="potato1014"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant 1. !round plants, in which neither the part above or below the soil presents a diseased appearance. In general, these bear no very numerous product. The knobs, also, were not particularly large; an appearance which may be explained by the unfavorable circumstance of the long continued drought of the present year. The agriculturists of the communities visited by me, from the results of such sound plants, look for a moderate crop, or three fifths of a good one. Besides, in such plants is to be noted, also, that in small portions of thesaiie the stalk was wholly withered by the 25th of September. Of there tinder, the conclusion was, that they would not be either high or branching; and corresponding to this, the knobs were not very large, but of tenure    der middle size; but the plants, which yet stood fully leaved, were provided with more and greater knobs 2. A second portion of the plants, and indeed the smallest, showed numerous Talks; but these were thinner and more slender, mostly single or slightly br arched, yet with many leaves. The leaves frequently bore more leafletsthihusual; and these latter were often very small only a fifth of an in chin diameter. The angles of the stalk were sometimes furnished with aprtbportionally very broad strip of leafy substance, and this more or lessaufied. Both sides of the leaves were more than usually set with very fine hairs, which gave the stalk a brownish green appearance. In the lea' es of this kind were also noticed, sometimes, black, burnt, dry places, ye i (cid127wVbiiout meeting any rust fully developed. The stalk also showed, many times, black spots. In plants of this description I have met with no blossoms or fruit. The roots talk presented an unusually large branching, Did the branch roots terminated in great quantity of fine fibres. Thecoll0ctive undergrowth appeared accordingly, as it were, an irregular felting of fibres, between which appeared only rarely one or a few knobs of one half to one inch in diameter. In the contrary, the lowest part of the stalk, where it passes into its branching under the soil without bearing k if obs, and in the latter itself, which were often disproportionately long, were set with small knobs of pale color, and having a very tender outer skin, of the size of peas, and mostly furnished with leaf buds on their ends. I hesitate not to explain the above described plants as infected with the before mentioned curl disease, (in French, lafrisole) though in a far less degree. But other plants appear smitten with the same disease on the growth above ground, of which nothing abnormal can be noticed, while the knobs exhibit a peculiar variety. Such knobs, indeed, bear long white sprouts, which put forth sometimes singly, sometimes numerous, on every part of the upper surface, and often are so long that they run out of the ground, where, when they come to the light, they unfold many small greenish gray, strongly haired leaves, similar to those in the curl disease. Any times this sprouting forth appears as a true, thorough growth, while the uppermost eye of the knob passes out from the so called " crown" over into anew green stalk provided with leaves. <a name="potatoes1402"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> which were from plants of this sort exhibited often a variety of. 79 appearance, which can only be distinguished by the experienced, reflectingagribtflturist as sickly, and not to be used by them in the next planting for seed. They are usually below the regular size ; often not round, but of i a distorted, round is h form. Their outer skin is sometimes very tender, and sometimes proportion ally furnished with little excresences, and allow the cellular tissue to shine through with a light, greenish clouding. In being cut into, they present a less compact texture, and also offer proportion ally less resistance to the knife. The year ring (charring) exhibits a comparatively darker color; and where it breaks out on the outer surface, for the commencement of new eyes, it is often of a brownish color, and encircled by a clear, white, juice less (happy) cellular texture. Others, (still of these diseased knobs) on being cut into, showed themselves to be what we, in common parlance, are wont to call whetstone; i. e, considerable portions were juice less, swelled up, filled with air. Such <a name="potatoes1403"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, in essentials, therefore, present the same peculiarities which we find in those which have begun to terminate in the cellar. When boiled, these knobs were taste less, flat, or disagreeable, and of a fatty substance; and where they had passed over into irregular sproutings, or at least had diseased eyes, they showed the well known, une a table chits, which are nothing else than the corrupted beginnings of the sprout (the germ tube r) contained within the substance of the <a name="potato1015"><mark>potato</mark></a> 3. Besides these two already described kinds of condition of plants, there was exhibited yet a third, which has been distinguished by many agriculturists as the first state of the prevailing disease. In the plant usually no variation was to be noticed; it appeared much more juice and leafy, and only sometimes an uncommon quantity of dark green compact leaves i andd the want of blossoms and fruit indicated a deter i oration in the knobs. Still, one could not with certainty form a conclusion from the appearance of the plant as to the diseased condition of the knobs; and this disdasedtendexdyfirst developed itself by the deprivation of the root stand, which, :according to the opinion of agriculturists, is connected with the "loss of the s talks 2nd the . dry rot." These <a name="potatoes1404"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have the following characteristics a) In one case, there were numerous knobs; but these were small, (not full grown) provided with a very thin clear colored outer skin, and any tires also somewhat greenish. The upper surface had many little warts, rents, or dark colored places, with reddish brown spots, like spots of rust. Suchhalfgrown knobs were of a peculiar dried up appearance, and thus less smooth and shining than sound knobs. In some cases, also, the outer skin was wanting in certain small spots, and a white eruption, which dropped off easily, consisting of grains of asylum, took the place of the outer skin sometimes even these knobs (plainly not yet ripened) already had put forth short sprouts or shoots 6) In the other case, the s talks, when taken out of the ground, were found to have a moderate amount of knob formation, and the knobs were tolerably large and grown out. But they bore immediately on their surface sometimes one, sometimes more y bunch knobs of the size of a marble, musket ball, or nut. This after growth, which, according to the opinion of the farmers, owed its existence to a late rain, after a very long drought, is' for the most part found on <a name="potatoes1405"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which exhibit a broken, and here and there dark colored or light brown, somewhat dry upper surface. Theamother knobs, also, on which they sit, have, not rarely, a variation of form 680 while in an angular transition form from the ball form to that of an irregular ragged body. The bunch knobs themselves are covered with a thinner, often reddish, swollen, outer skin, and not un frequently bear a cluster of young premature ly developed eyes. In the knobs thus changed by disease being cut through, it is noticed that the vascular circle which pervades the whole texture of the knob, and distinguishes the outward (the mind) from the inner part, (the marrow) is colored darker (yellowish) than usual; but the cellular tissue which lies inside of the vascular ring is softer than the part which lies outside of the same. Such a <a name="potato1016"><mark>potato</mark></a> offers less resistance to the knife cutting in than does a sound one; and sometimes little holes are found already to exist in the inside. The inside also differs in color, since it is rather of a milk or slim white, than of the otherwise prevailing color yellowish white, or slightly changing into red. These peculiarities are so visible that many agriculturists regard them as the certain signs of the introduction of the disease. They are wont to call such <a name="potatoes1406"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, very appropriately, glassy which expression is at other times used respecting those which, being frost bitten, have begun to sprout in the cellar. If the <a name="potatoes1407"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> described under a and b are cooked, the substance exhibits the same slim y or fatty state, and the same want of pal a table taste which is found in <a name="potatoes1408"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have sprouted. In large plants we often also find that the outer part (outside of the year ring) is yet meal y and pal a table, whilst the inside has already undergone a slight decomposition, and is stale and harsh. Any times, also, such a <a name="potato1017"><mark>potato</mark></a> cooks very differently some portions remain harder than others, and the mind part, which is still tolerably meal y, crumbles before it is prepared. It is this state which is called by many "the double growth" or " offset." Very often such a dressed <a name="potato1018"><mark>potato</mark></a> presents on the cut surface immediately a light violet color, which indicates that some tenn in has been developed in it a change which must naturally also make itself known by the taste. I influence of the premature development of the sprout on the taste and the inner structure of the <a name="potato1019"><mark>potato</mark></a>. It may be appropriate here to notice how this change in the taste of the <a name="potato1020"><mark>potato</mark></a> is connected with the untimely commencement and progress of growth and development of the near sprouts. When, indeed, a mother <a name="potato1021"><mark>potato</mark></a> begins to sprout, it first takes place in the portion of the cellular texture lying in its centre the marrow for the after growth. From this the young shoot is nourished, which receives its vessels from the year ring, and by means of the same stands in the closest connection with the marrow portion. The nourishment goes on, while, from the centre, the asylum is converted into disease and sugar the sugar into slime, the slime into fibrous substance and albumen, and from the last the cellular tissue of the new sprout is formed. In a sound case, the mother <a name="potato1022"><mark>potato</mark></a> accordingly is gradually, and in due time, hollowed out from the middle. If it is very large, the sprout growing forth already obtains a considerable development before that is wholly exhausted; in which case it is hollowed out, but near the circumference it remains still solid. There remains, therefore, in a wholly regular process of nutrition at the end, only the shell, dried up and hanging on the new formed stem. There, on the contrary, we observe the mother knob not thus regularly
681employed for the nutriment of its offspring, but wholly or partially becoming rotten, there it is supposed that the part which furnishes nutriment to the young sprout has not had a regular but diseased course. The too early, over hasty putting out of the young knobs, as presented in the cases described, is connected with a diseased tendency of the mother knobs, which does not check, but too much hastens, the usual periodicity in their production, in consequence of which the decomposition of the cellular tissue must become putrefaction; which I have met with, in all such cases, in place of the regular exhaustion, even to the skin. State of the present crop in general. If we lay the already stated circumstances together as they have been observed in the open field, in the And Commissariat of Frankenthal, we shall arrive at the following general result The vegetation of the <a name="potato1023"><mark>potato</mark></a> plant appears in the highest degree. The whole progress of its growth, even in kinds planted under similar conditions of soil, climate, and culture, and in the same region, is very different. The stalk part is partially retarded in its development, so far as the observation in general could be ascertained, so that it came to the blossom more seldom and more various than for some years. The knobs did not ripe n equally in a short period, but took a more gradual succession. The quantity of the most domestic a ted <a name="potatoes1409"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> is only a middle crop or below a half crop. The quality in not an inconsiderable portion of the crop exhibits itself already as small, indeed inferior, inasmuch as these <a name="potatoes1410"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have no good taste. Their present condition renders it probable that they will not preserve long in the cellar. I must here also add, that the peculiar irregularities which we have already mentioned have been found in different kinds, and as well in those <a name="potatoes1411"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which were grown from entire <a name="potatoes1412"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted as in those froZdcuttings. A part of the <a name="potatoes1413"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are already diseased, or have such a tendency in the field. From the above mentioned facts we may very justly conclude that a part of this years crop of <a name="potatoes1414"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were not wholly sound, but already disposed to disease, or really diseased, in the field. But as now experienced farmers in these peculiarities which are exhibited in such diseased <a name="potatoes1415"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> recognise the first symptoms of the dry rot, it hence follows that the dry rot did not originate first over winter in knobs before wholly sound, but that the foundation or germ of the disease was transmitted from the field with the <a name="potato1024"><mark>potato</mark></a> into the place of preservation, and that consequently the disease fully developed, namely, the remarkable hardening and the appearance of peculiar fungus in the upper surface, was produced where the circumstances prevailed to favor such a development in the primary source of the disease. The disease is connected with the fungus as the primary source or origin. For the scientific standpoint of the investigation, the question now especially is important, whether this disease consists merely in a peculiar de 6 82 He: To, 140.-stradti6h of the vital power; and in a corresponding decomposition; or, wa eh ti~ i iacirdiig t th'e ricneisions of my earlier investigation, the germ of a parasitic fingers already exists in the <a name="potato1025"><mark>potato</mark></a> on the field, in: whieticaseit moist be recognised as the original cause of the disease. Theiin vestigatiofis which I have instituted on this yeas <a name="potatoes1416"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, on theficid127ld itself co firm the last opinion most fully, as I have found the germ of the fungus also in such knobs. We may observe, indeed, without trouble, and with the eye simply, the <a name="potatoes1417"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> described under letters a and b (which were distinguished by experienced agriculturists as the first stage of the dry rot fine, white, little points here and there scattered beneath the outer skin; these, through. theclaeaer color, distinguish themselves before the rest of the cellular tissue, and give it to h appearance as if tittle grains of meal were enclosed or sprinkled on it. In closer examination, it is found that these little whitepoirits, as it were, in nests, i. e. united in small round or of long spots, lie lathe cellular tissue They are found especially in the outer portions of the tissue, between the year ring and the outer skin. Slightly magnified, they appear as irregular shaped, yet for the most part rounded) spake j white, shining grains; when strongly magnified, they exhibit themselves as a slime. But after being yet stronger magnified, from three hundred to four hundred lines, we can detect in these little invisible points an uncommonly fine tres s work of wreathed, ratified, half spake, here and there dismembered fibres, wholly like those which I have acknowledged, from the cases of disease before more fully described by me, as a fungus texture of thePFsi poriati, and represented in table 3, figure 23, of my treatise. Hereantd thecid1273, also, are seen in the cellular tissue those dis proportioned, globular, and foi a trite still lilac f spake, pale yellow little bodies, which are the commencement of the original fungus, (Protomyces Poland) and represented in table 3, figure 21, of my treatise. I other t knobs, even when first taken out of the ground, I noticed, asmwflihoned above, that here and there little portions of the flesh broke through the outer skin in the form of irregular clusters of small white grains. By the microscope they were proved to be grains of amy in, on which little excrescences and bands had begun to form, which I have represented in table 3, figure 34, and have distinguished as the earliest organization of single fungus fibres h e last appearance also observed in knobs artificially infected. This appearance wholly agrees with that which some before sound <a name="potatoes1418"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> presented to my view, which were artificially covered with fungus dust, and which were also thus inoculated. The outer skin of the sat me first showed rotten, brownish, dry spots, by which the whole knobs plainly lost in moisture; three months after, the infection broke out of the outer skin here and there, and the diseased cellular texture pressed through in the form of little white bunches of meal, the grains of amy in of which at the same time, attended with small excrescences, callosities, and bands, might be recognised as the medium of the fungus texture in its earliest period. In sound <a name="potatoes1419"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, the starch meal never shows the above described begin" in g .the german of the fungus texture already existed on the field, and became developed in the most unfavorable circumstances. a. 683 oh m e 4erinnts hitherto made by nine investigator of niiir4e had placed it beyond doubt that the first germ of a fungus texture iyiroeifiainfdr a long time in r its primary, incomplete state, without losing it i vital power ; but that, ii circuinstaces which favor its perfect and entire got ah, it always more and more developes itself, increases in size and extent and finally reaches the state of ripened fruit, where it then puts forth iunrierbusgermis as grains, and thereby accomplished its propagation. In such a growth of fungus texture, the moist, warm weather has the most import dr it influence. To fungus grows in a temperature below 2 or 30 ofReaumnir. For, on the contrary, a high temperature up to 15, 20, or more degrees is very favorable to its development, of which any one may be convinced by the common mushroom of the fewer and of the marshy beds ofbotanic gardens, which are well known to be often covered by the vegetation of the Aethalicum fiavum. It follows, therefore, that <a name="potatoes1420"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> in which the germ of the fungus already exists undergo the progressive deter i oration even to the highest stage of the dry rot, not in all places, but only where they have been surrounded with a damp atmosphere, and have been shut out from the light, while in the winter and spring a considerable temper attire is developed. The inquiries which I have instituted in the And Commissariat of Frankenthal, as to the condition of the place where sound or diseased <a name="potatoes1421"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> have been preserved, confirm this opinion. A great land holder in Peters au, who was accustomed not to bring in his stock of <a name="potatoes1422"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> into cellars beneath the ground, but in parts, of slight depth, of a large barn furnished with dry walls, has not yet suffered from the dry rot; on the contrary, we find that agriculturists, whose crops have been injured, have been accustomed to fill in their moist dark cellars, shut out from the draught of air, wholly with knob fruit, where is also a heat in, and with this the essential condition for the formation and greater devefopident of the fungus texture, and consequently of the higher stage oft hi dry rot, which gardens the <a name="potato1026"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and renders it wholly unfit to be eaten. Mdfiv: weighty authorities have lately represented this heating as the sole original cause of the dreaded disease. In the contrary, I consider myself justified in setting it down as only an essential condition of the last form of the dry rot. Without the peculiar cooperation of the fungus form iris itself out on the heated <a name="potato1027"><mark>potato</mark></a>, the knob fruit might wholly lose its power of germination and good taste; but it cannot escape the view, how the fruit, also, may in itself thus present that peculiar and so greatly diverse character of a sort of fungus hardness, with a contemporaneously production of a mould y fungus on the upper surface, and, indeed, always of one and the same sort, when the fungus does not thereby perform a definite part. By the heating, in the cellar, the <a name="potato1028"><mark>potato</mark></a> suffers a commencing decomposition; a part of the starch turns into sugar; and then, by means of the processes of germination, as they begin, into string y substance. From this it goes (if hindered in the proper development of its shoot) over into the wet rot. The quantity of water in it will hereby, indeed, be hardly as much lessened, as is the case in the dry rot where the knobs lose half of their watery substance. That, on the other hand, the <a name="potato1029"><mark>potato</mark></a> contains the same peculiarity by means of which it resists the operation of the water in which it is cooked, and, indeed, also the steam of water; and after it has been cooked for six hours, so that it can only be cut with a very sharp knife, as a 6 84 moist sunk this circumstance is merely the consequence of the fungusdevelopmentContradictory, also, as this fact must appear at first view that a tender, mould y fungus may exert this drying up, hardening influence, rendering it tough on the substance of the <a name="potato1030"><mark>potato</mark></a> yet it stands not isolated, but is well known as analogous to the effects of other hung i. The, sepedonium mycophilum, a little yellow filament out fungus, which grows on flesh colored mushrooms, thickens the cellular tissue of this latter so much that while otherwise it rots in the last warm days of autumn, now affected by this parasite, it not seldom with stands putrefaction during the whole; and yet, in the spring of the next year, is found dead, indeed, but preserving its original form. In a similar manner, also, other hung i which grow on wood as, for example, species of the warty mushrooms, thelephora, and the inflated mushrooms, as sphaeriaproduce such a peculiar drying up and contraction of the wood, which draw out in the same manner its albumen, as does the fungus of the <a name="potato1031"><mark>potato</mark></a> spoken of t. Of the fungus found in <a name="potato1032"><mark>potato</mark></a> cellars. In the house of Burgomaster On Heissheim, who, as an agriculturists, for many years has suffered much from the <a name="potato1033"><mark>potato</mark></a> rot, I noticed that the walls of his moist, damp cellar were here and there covered by a very fine web of white filament out fungus. The same extended itself, even as such vegetation otherwise is wont to do, out from a middle point to every side for some inches diameter. This covering was scratched off, and in Munich was subjected to a careful microscopic observation. It consists of very fine ratified complicated fibres, and it is probable that it is a mother fungus, slightly developed on account of its barren situation, and of the same kind of vegetable growth to which I have attributed so important an influence on the existence and formation of the dry rot. It may not be impossible that the close contact of the <a name="potatoes1423"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, stored up within the walls, with the fungus mould ve getting there, may have been the means of infection, and contributed to the appearance, inexplicable to the agriculturists, that one row of seed <a name="potatoes1424"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> did not shoot forth, while another from the same cellar developed themselves regularly and in a healthy manner. Besides this, the occurrence of a mother fungus, not on the <a name="potato1034"><mark>potato</mark></a> itself, but in other places, which group themselves under certain favorable circumstances in the same, and here are extended with much greater rapidity than elsewhere, may be considered as an appearance of which we find many analogies in nature, and it must be looked upon with reference to the inexplicable mode of the spreading of the disease, as if it was a contagious epidemic. It is thus with the increase of the dry rot, just as with the sudden appearance of certain destructive insects, which also are not newly generated, the eggs of which still more always exist, but only reach their development under favorable circumstances* Very justly says the intelligent agriculturists, Night On Saline: " Although the heating of the <a name="potatoes1425"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> during the winter preservation must unquestionably have promoted their rotating, yet the wholly peculiar disease distinguished by the name of dry rot cannot so be explained only. This heating must be followed by a ferment at ion and a wet (not a dry) rot, arising therefrom." (andre Oekonomische Neuigkeiten und Verhandlungen, 1842, n. 69, 549 t Compare, as to this peculiar effect of cryptogamous parasite, Treviranus Physiologie derGewiichse, And I I , 792, in Bavaria, 1842, p. 443. a. 685Microscopic discoveries in diseased <a name="potatoes1426"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which bear on them no fungus formation. The <a name="potatoes1427"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> mentioned under 2, exhibit under the microscope more or less extended variation from the regular formation. The appearance most visible in them is a deficiency of grains of starch in the cellular tissue. The same is the case also in those which are yet juice throughout, but which are of a soap y or fatty state, as well as in those which are already become whetstone a) Any cells contain, in these cases, scarcely any grains of starch. They are filled with liquid or air, and their skins are withered or flabby b) In other cells the grains of starch are called up together in the middle, in the form of round balls ; or c) They hang in clusters heaped up on the sides, especially in the corners near the intercellular passagesd) These last are not seldom wholly stopped up that is, filled in with an spake, shiny mass, a shapeless close) The vessels of the year ring are of a darker color than usual. The same is the condition of the vessels which run from the year ring outward, to the eyes in the so called germ tubes. The texture near the last is often juice less, and, as it were, standing off, (happy) Thus, as also the condition of the new sprout shows itself changed, diseased, at the earliest period, it cannot be thought strange if the same shoots out no new s talks, or retains only a very weak power of production. All the above mentioned appearances are found more or less decisively in those seed <a name="potatoes1428"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have already put forth sprouts, and in consequence have dissolved a portion of their texture and employed it for the development of new s talks. Thus with such knobs, already provided with sprouts, the change described shows itself always in the inward parts of the cellular tissue ; i. e, inside of the year ring. These appearances, therefore, indicate that those <a name="potatoes1429"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have become fatty, or whetstone and which, on account of their less size, and of a weaker portion in the starch formation, are to be considered as not yet ripened have begun with a sickly haste to develop e their eyes. It is evident that their offspring must likewise be feeble. Finally, I further notice that the scab or scurf was scarcely observed by me in this region, or with less intensity, while in Upper Bavaria it appeared to be spread about abundantly Result. From the comparison of the facts, and with respect to the location with which they are connected, the following general conclusion is drawn For the irregular vegetation of the <a name="potatoes1430"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> (the deficiency of stock) observed in the And Commissariats, and the rotating of the knobs in the cellars, two diseases, the curl disease and the dry rot, are original causes. The curl disease, which appears hitherto to be developed in no high degree, depends on an irregular vegetation of stalk as well as of knob, on account of unfavorable circumstances of climate and soil and disproportionalSome have accounted for this disease especially from the excess of pro t oxide of iron in the soil686pc. No. ,40cuitI   are, w her e by the knobs one in their starch substance and imbibe a tendency to put forth untimely sprouts. The. stalk rot was occasioned by a resting of the fungus texture in the knobs, which injures the chemical mixture, and so gains the upper hand in the knobs, by favor of a heating method of preservation, that this becomes unfit for germination, and, by means of the hardening of its cellular texture, can no more serve for nutriment. This disease also affects sound knobs as well as those which spring from curly s talks. While the curl disease appears to have been for a long time known as an epidemic, but not infectious, that which for ten years has been known as the dry rot has at its foundation a concrete contagiousness. Against the former, therefore, must be prescribed all those means which rational husbandry generally recommends; against the latter, likewise, a careful removal of contagion, and guarding from those circumstances which favor the spreading and development of the contagion. Precautionary rules against these diseases. Met; there be a careful previous as sorting of the <a name="potatoes1431"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> harvested, and a choice made only of such knobs, for future planting, as are sound and will ripened. For this purpose reject all knobs a) Which have reddish, or brownish, or black spots, with cracks and splints of the outer skin; orb) Such as are affected with knots, warts, or with any appearance of mould) Or on which are set other little tube red) Which have a thin upper skin, partly scraped off, or of a color turning to green ;e) Which, by their small ness, or by the adherence of long pieces of stalk under the ground, show that they are not yet fully ripe f) The form of which is angular, or remarkably irregular, varying from those of the well formed kind ;g) Which are withered, wrinkled, hard, or exhibit a diseased variation of the eyes ;h) Which have been cut in or bitten, or otherwise wounded i) Which have already begun too soon to sprout in the cellar. The practice of planting such <a name="potatoes1432"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, again deprived of their sprouts, is in every respect very faulty. We should not employ a <a name="potato1035"><mark>potato</mark></a> as a seed <a name="potato1036"><mark>potato</mark></a> which on one side appears wholly sound, but which on the other bears on it any of the above mentioned traces of a diseased state; the as sorting of the necessary seed <a name="potatoes1433"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> (so far as such have not already : been brought in separated) should be done in the day light, so as not to overlook the diseased state. He should choose, for preservation of seed <a name="potatoes1434"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, most suitable places, as far separated as possible, which are safe from moisture, cold, and heat. Remember that seed <a name="potatoes1435"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> piled up high l, not only in winter but also in spring, when they begin to sprout, undergo a heating, and thus become injured in their power of germination ; which, therefore, must be carefully provided against. Moreover, let there be an as sorting of the great heaps of <a name="potatoes1436"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for use, by means of a grate or si eve, which will separate the knobs according to their size. Have out the large, well ripened knobs, separated from the smaller and later, and use the latter, before -the rot, has affected them, earlier than the former. Preserve also these collections with all possible care. If the cellars are not clean, white wash the walls and straw the, bottom of the cellars with dry sand mixed with coal dust, ashes, or sifted cinders. Take care as to the proper access of air; set poles perpendicular in the cellar, which are to be wrapped around with pea straw, and about which the <a name="potatoes1437"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are to be heaped up. Turn over these heaps during the winter.

Cry to obtain and preserve an appropriate, strong stock, or race. His may be done by a selection of sound, strong, ripe seed <a name="potatoes1439"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the kinds which agree with the location et there be prudence in i the naturalization of a kind which has been formerly raised under very different influences. But iv ate the h kinds separately, and not togethertChoose the most favorable soil, the best situation, and the manure and rotation most appropriate for soil and climate. But the manure on the field before winter. In England, it is recommended to mix horse and cow dung; to withdraw the same from the direct rays of the sun, and plough it under in every case as long as possible before planting. Wine dung in Thuringia has operated un favorably. Nail not in a careful preparation by cleaning out, loosening, and heaping up. Avoid laying seed <a name="potatoes1440"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> too early or too late, or in unfavorable weather. (local experience must be principally relied on here) I Leave not the seed <a name="potatoes1441"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> long uncovered in the furrows, and let not these last dry up too long in the sun. Beware, lest the seed <a name="potatoes1442"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> themselves, selected with care, should be attacked with fungus germination ; and therefore soak them some hours in lime water, and after they are dried off again in the air put them in the field. His treatment destroys also any insects or their eggs which may be attached to them. Experiments made in the Royal Botanical Gardens, with laying in lime, have proved that <a name="potatoes1443"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which have lain ten hours in lime water have not lost their terminating power; which, indeed, was the case with such as had lain from 24 to 36 hours in lime water. The method of laying cuttings instead of whole <a name="potatoes1444"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, should in no case be adopted in the present unfavorable circumstances; as, without To improve the stock by deprivation from seed, 1 do not consider necessary. By such a method, in general, two years are lost; and in the third, there is yet the labor of separating and collecting experiments in favor of their employment in given situations, as to the various kinds which have been produced. Similar are the views of experienced agriculturists ; as, for example, Professor Schweitzer, (All g. Anzeig. dDeutschen, 1841, No. 341 344) We have the experience already (for example, of Mr. Albert, in Rosslau) that the knobs from stocks which have been produced from the seed were also attacked by the dry rot. There is, therefore, in this method, in no way any protection against disease The English farmers recommend, after some years, to import new seed <a name="potatoes1445"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from higher situated regions, tin general, it seems more advisable to put the <a name="potatoes1446"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> into the soil too early than too late. The practice of laying them too late, even in June, has undoubtedly contributed to enfeebled any races 6 88 doubt, it has exerted an influence in the deter i oration of the race, and will exert the same in a higher degree father the crop not before it is ripe. Throw riot those <a name="potatoes1447"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which are affected with mould, or otherwise useless, on the dung hills, but into running water, or bury them in a place which will not be ploughed up. The adoption of the above mentioned rules must essentially contribute to limit and gradually eradicate the diseases at present so injurious, and increasing in such a threatening manner. Of. Von Marti   Of. Muni Of, November 4, 1842.*The agriculturists who will not break off from the practice above mentioned, as bad, should at least take care that only sound cuttings, well provided with eyes uninjured, should be planted, that they be not cut too long before placing, and that those cuttings be rejected which change visibly in color on the surface of the cut. The sprinkling over of the cut surface with powdered lime is recommended by many agriculturists as a proper improvement. a. 689APPENDI X No. 7. Grasses For The South. Edjito- Of The Culti   Vator: Your correspondents frequently inquire respecting the grasses sir it able to the south. If each would communicate what he has observed, it would be a sufficient answer to such inquiries, and might prove the most important benefit to the agriculture of the south. During this winter I have seen bundles of northern hay brought to the stables of my neighbor, which had paid for carriage many hundred miles round the capes of Florida, through the gulf of Mexico, and five hundred miles (by the course of the river) into the interior. This is a standing reproach to the agriculture of the south. Lucernethis is found to grow well here. Now it in drills, in the early part of the fall, 24 to 27 inches apart: it flourished, yields four to five cuttings in the course of the year; and, on soil which would bring twenty bushels of corn to the acre, grows one foot and a half high. This season, some was cut on the 12th of March, for soiling, and was then from a foot to knee high. The most of it has been cut twice over, since the first cutting to this day, May 13. Battle and horses eat it greedily. A cow fed on it chiefly is yielding at this time between five and six gallons of milk daily; when, as yet, there is no grass in the woods or on the common sufficient to change the poverty stricken appearance of the cattle in the range." I have made no hay from it, but have no doubt it will make good hay. Guineagrassthe root is similar to that of the cane or reed, and isperennial. The stem and blade are like those of the Egyptian mille t. Enrich soil it is very luxuriant, yielding many cuttings in the course of the year. It is good for soiling; horses and cattle eat it readily, and, if cut when in flower, it makes a hay most abundantly, of which cattle feed greedily in winter. Horses do not seem to like the hay. It is most readily propagated by the root. A small root, two inches long, with one or more joints to it, will ve get ate ; and, if the ground is made loose by sloughing once or twice during the season after planting, roots placed in checks of four feet will take complete possession of the soil the first season, so that the next spring it will start up evenly over the soil, everywhere. Dogs root after them with great eagerness; and as the tendency of this plant is to fill the ground with roots in so thick a mat that the grass does not grow tall in consequence, the idea suggests itself of past during cattle on this grass in the spring and summer, and giving the hogs the benefit of the roots lathe winter. They cannot destroy it; the smallest fibre left in the ground will grow. It might be a great pest in a garden; but if land is to be used for stock, it will take and maintain entire possession, to the exclusion of any competitor which we have in middle Alabama. Lover and herds grass have now a beautiful lot of these grasses in conjunction, on high land; the whole about knee high, and the c lover in flower. Mr. Air by, one of my neighbors, cut the wood from a piece of low, pipe clay, c raw fish land, last winter; and when the brush, &c, lying 44 690 on the ground, had become sufficiently dry, he set fire to it and burnt it all off; thus giving it a top dressing of ashes. He then sowed herds grass on the top of the ground, without plough, harrow, or anything of the kind. He now has a most rich and beautiful crop of this grass growing. If desired, your readers may obtain further particulars of this crop. Persia Orizoides, (rice grass his plant so much resembles rice, that only a practised eye can distinguish it.

This term, of whose meaning perhaps nineteen twentieth of our readers are utterly ignorant, is applied to a new and particular kind of maturing, which has been employed with signal success by Mr. Our ney, a farmer in last Cornwall. The operation consists in covering grass land with long straw, coarse hay, or other fibrous matter, about twenty pounds to the fall allowing this covering to lit till the grass springs through it (which it does with astonishing rapidity) to the desired length, and then taking it off to allow the bestial to reach the pasture. The covering is then applied to another portion of the field; the operation of removal and covering being repeated so long as the straw or hay remains sufficiently entire to admit of convenient application. The merits of the system, which is yet in its infancy, was thus stated by Mr. Our ney at a late meeting of the Last Cornwall Experimental Club: About seven weeks since, he had covered half a field of grass of three acres in this manner, and about a fortnight ago, when examined, the increase had been found to be at the rate of 5,000pounds per acre over the uncovered portion of the field. At that time the straw was raked off and laid in rows twelve feet apart on the field, and one hundred and fifteen sheep were put on the grass, with a view to eat it down as quickly as possible. After they had been there about a week they were succeeded by twenty-six but locks, to eat off the long grass remaining, and which the sheep had left. The field was thus grazed as bare as possible. The same straw was now again thrown over the same portion of the field from which it had been raked; and, on inspection that morning, he had found the action going on as powerfully as on the former occasion. He thought the sheep, on first taking off the straw, were not so fond of the grass as they were of that uncovered ; but after twenty-four hours' exposure to the sun and air, he thought they rather preferred it. He had forty acres now under the operation, and in consequence of it he had grass when his neighbors had none." Fibrous covering, or Gurneyism, as thus described, is certainly a cheap and convenient mode of maturing; all that is wanted is only further experiment to test its general applicability. 
 .691From the Cultivator. Cutti   Of And Curi Of Hay. i From our notes of the discussion on " the proper stage for cutting grasses, and the best modes of making hay" at the seventh agricultural meeting in this city, we give the following or. Cement said he had formerly been in the habit of cutting timothy grass quite late. It was easier cured after it got pretty ripe. But he found, in using hay thus cut, that it wanted substance, and he had ascertained that the best time for cutting was while the grass was in blossom. In making c lover hay, he had adopted Judge Duels plan. He thought it best not to expose it much to the sun. His practice was to cut in the morning, let it lay till noon, and then cock it, and let it sweat for two or three days, according to the state of the weather. In putting the hay in the barn, he had used about four quarts of salt to the ton. May thus managed came out in the spring very bright and sweet. In the ordinary way of curing c lover hay, the beat parts are wasted. Mr. Toward was aware that there were different opinions as to the proper stage for cutting grass; but he thought the observance of certain principles might afford a guide in the case. For example, the stems of glasses were filled, just before the formation of the seed, with a starch y or sac charing substance. In perfecting the seed, the stems were exhausted of this substance, it being consumed in forming seed. Now, if the herb age is the object, the plant should be cut before the nutriment has passed from the stems. If seed is the object, the plant must, of course, be allowed to attain a good degree of maturity. May made from ripe grass may " go further r "spend better" as the argument is; and it is admitted that this may be true, for animals are less inclined to eat it; but this is no proof that it is morenutritive. He spoke of the different modes of curing hay, with nearly all which he said he had been acquainted. Lover hay was altogether better when cared in cock than by any other mode he knew practised. All hay was better for undergoing, to some extent, a sweating in the cock. Coarse timothy was thus rendered much softer, and was less straw y and stiff, and every description of hay was less likely to be " now burned or. Debts was not in favor of mowing a great deal of grass while the dew is on. He was in the habit of spreading the s baths as soon as the ground was dry, and he always had it well cocked up before night. The next day, if the weather was good, he opened it again; if it did not dry enough, lie put it together again; but his object was to get it so that it would do to put it in the barn. He was in favor of using a little salt with it. He had sometimes found his hay heat too much in the now. From being hurried he had occasionally put a load in the barn too green. To stop the heat and ferment at ion which had ensued in such cases, he had made holes in the hay with a crow bar, and scattered in salt. In this way he had stopped the ferment at ion, and saved his hay in very good order. Mr. Garretson, of the assembly, from But chess county, said he generally eut from 150 to 200 tons of hay per year, chiefly timothy and red top. He generally begun when the grass was in blossom. His method was to cut in the morning, spread the s baths lightly, and in the afternoon put it in rocks. The next day, if the sun came out, it was again spread, and, if made enough, put in the barn with a little salt sprinkled on it. About three quarts of salt to the ton was as much as he used, There was danger 2 
6ftling too much. He had formerly used more salt, and was satisfied his animals, particularly sheep, had suffered by it. It occasioned scouring, and, by keeping their bowels out of order for some time, they died. He usually got about two tons of hay to the acre. In the latter part of the season, it would sometimes make enough in one diary. Back always directed his men to make he as any as idly as possible. He had often made it and put it in the barn in one day, and never had better hay. He was always particular to secure it from the dew when it must He left over night. It is said by some who had much practice in making that that it is never injured from its own internal juice, but only from rain or de v. Mr. out ham did not like the plan of salting hay, neither did he like the that that: as made in one day. If it could be so made- that it would take rio hurt in one day, it must have been too dry for good hay before it was cut, or else very light burden. He would as soon have good bright straw for cows or sheep as timothy hay after it had gone to seed. He cuts cloverwheni a part of it is in' blossom and' part in the head ; cuts all his grass early. It takes longer to make hay cut thus early; but for laws, and sheep especially, it was a great deal better. The objection to salting hay: was, thataditimals were forced to eat salt, whether they wanted it or not, and it made sheep se our. His hay came out of the barn of a bright, given i color, and his stock wild fatten b on it. There was another great advantage in cutting early: the root retained their life and trench better, and the after feed and future crops were much more abundant.  He did not like timothy for lily; he never saw it in England; the farmers the thee thought it was toooafse and wiry -or stock.  Ryigrass made a good hay; would yield inEtignd two tons pe i 'are.

Judge Sheer said he would cut his c lover in blossom n of sooner. Hewbuld let it take the f un dcid127on- day, but not enough to have the leaf breakoffpthent put it in small cocks and cure it, until, by a few hours' drying, byiltrnigcid127bver aid breaking the cocks, the fluids would be so far out of it that it r hay be 'housed without h retiring. I he length of time necessary to curt Oil depend upon the state of the :weather, i and the larger r or smaller growth of the crop. Upon this the farmer n must exercise iss judgment He . Would I it cut timothy until it had passed r out of the blossom. Rob (cid1270DiDavy, in his Agricultural Chtemisty, says that 64 parts of c lover hay, it in blossom, prodauedd 10; parts of 'nutrition t matter and the same taken i i; ed 0 timothy 10 parts in blossom ai d 23 in seed. This, in the timothy, is probably too much ; it that the nuatritive .after in timothy improved t erie 'fall of the blossom , 'he lad no doubt. Red top comes to maturity ate, :and he did not think :there was much o difference whether cut in blsoimsersoo n after. He 'believed timothy It in blossom would, pound' fr6picid127da, produce icid127mI be risk -when i fed; t cows or sheep, than it would cut tears; bu for idea and other st k, he thought it ore ufitritious: tout add a little l on . It ediitaI   ill by improved in weight. He preferred mowing his hay, as a fr as he cold, when free from dews or water. He let the s baths take the sun l a few hours, until the ;top got a little wilted or seared, before turning. It thus held up the greener parts when turned over and spread, and permitted the air to, circulate under it. It also gave the ground between the s baths time to dry, which was important in hastening the curing. In this way, he avoided the necessity of turning the hay after being spread, which was one of the most tedious processes through which the hay had to be passed, and of course the most expensive. He never permitted his hay to take a dew when it had sun enough to wilt it considerably, if he could help it. The dewd disco lore d it, and he had never been able to restore the fine fresh color afterwards. He preferred letting his hay stand over night in the cock. He could then better tell of its fitness to be housed. It is very easy to break up the cocks and give it more sun if necessary, and the slight ferment at ion or sweating in the cock, which is checked and dried off in carting, is a great preventive against heating in the now.  May heated in the now is sure to be dis colored. Some people insist that it is not injured for feeding, especially to cattle. It may be so. 1 know that flour, corn, or oats, which have been heated until they are musty, are thought not s p good. I do not know why hay should be. In the approach of rain, .always put all tete. ay that has had any sun of consequence into the cock. If the storm is a long one, it may turn yellow, so that it cannot be restored, but it 'will retain most of its nritfitivematter and its weight; whereas, if left spread out to take the rain, it loses both, and is much worse dis colored. I never use salt upon my hay but upon compulsion. When the weather is good, I dry my hay sufficiently to keep, and as soon as I can 1 house it; but sooner than leave it but to take a storm, even in the cock, I would put it in a Little short dried, and apply salt to save it, as I would sooner have it saltedicid127tanl musty. Dr. See thought it the best way to now grass after the dew was off spread it, dry it as much as possible, :and rake it into window. If it was dried enough and it would frequently be so he would load it from ttiewinrow, and save the labor of cocking it up. a.

. 695The above table, showing the results of an experiment given in the Journal of Agriculture, for the purpose of proving the best depth for burying the different kinds of grass seed, cannot fail to be interesting and valuable to our farmers. It was performed as follows: Two boxes, each one foot wide, and five feet ten inches long, were filled with soil to. 1, to within a quarter of an inch of the top; No. 2, to the top on one side, regularly sloping to within three inches of the top on the other side. Both boxes were then divided across by slips of wood a foot long and two inches broad, so as to leave fourteen spaces, one foot long, in each box. Fig. 16 will show these divisions box No. 2 being filled to the top on the side A, and three inches from the top on the side B. The same weight of seed was sown in each box, the slips of wood were removed, and the boxes filled to the top with soil. The seed in box to. 1 would thus be all buried a quarter of an inch deep; and in No. 2, from no depth to three inches. They were placed in a greenhouse, for the first ten days, to prevent the risk of heavy rains, which would have crusted the surface. This may have caused the <a name="seeds79"><mark>seeds</mark></a> to spring from a greater depth than under other circumstances. The quantities of each sown, (except timothy, which was about double the rest) were such as would have produced about the same number of plants to an equal surface ; but the experiment being performed in summer August 1,) the different kinds had variously diminished in vegetative powers. This diminution with c lover is such that the experimenter, S. D. Stirling, remarks, that c lover seed " kept over one summer would be dear at half price The whole furnishes a striking exhibition of the loss sustained in all cases by narrowing grass seed deeply into the ground. This is especially the case with very small <a name="seeds80"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, as timothy and wood grass none of the latter ve getting an inch beneath the surface, though this remark would more strongly apply to a heavy than to a light soil. The writer also makes the excellent recommendation to " all who would avoid disappointment, to prove all their grass, c lover, and turn in <a name="seeds81"><mark>seeds</mark></a> before sowing, by sowing a small weight in a pot, and placing it in a warm situation, and counting the plants which come up by which they will often find that 30 pounds in some cases will be cheaper than 20 pounds in others. The scientific names of the plants are given to prevent mistake where different common names are known in different districts, and which have enabled us to add or substitute some common names in place of those which are nearly unknown to our farmers- Cultivator. Sowi Of Of Grass <a name="seeds82"><mark>Seeds</mark></a>. The fifth monthly meeting of the "stirling Agricultural I mprovementClub" took place on the 14th of April, 1843, when, after some preliminary business, the following paper, on the sowing of grass <a name="seeds83"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, was read by or. David Drummond, of the Agricultural Museum, Stirling, and 58 Dawson street, Dublin. A lively and interesting discussion took place. The members then resolved :6 96 Toe. No. 140.1st. "that the land should be well pulverized and rolled, immediately prior to sowing the grass <a name="seeds84"><mark>seeds</mark></a>; the <a name="seeds85"><mark>seeds</mark></a> should then be carefully sown, and covered in as lightly as possible, and again rolled 2d. " That the quantities and varieties specified in the essay are, in the opinion of the club, well adapted to the general it y of soils in the sowing of grass <a name="seeds86"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. There is perhaps no branch of cultivation where so much of what maybe called random practice has existed, or where the execution of the work on correct principles will tell with more effect, than in the sowing of grass <a name="seeds87"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. It is a subject on which a great deal might be said ; in a comprehensive view, however, the following remarks will, we conceive, embrace the most essential points. Preparing the ground to be sown. It is almost needless to say that the land should be in good condition, well worked, and free of weeds, which it generally is after green crop or summer fallow; the usual way is to sow the <a name="seeds88"><mark>seeds</mark></a> immediately before the last turn of the harrows, when grain has been sown, though sometimes a little additional narrowing is given, by way of injuring a betterbraird. I have known no less than three turns of the common harrow having been given to timothy seed: the consequence was, that scarcely a plant ever appeared. I instead of all this I would say, roll well, if the weather admits of it; and even previous to sowing, this operation is to be recommended; for the benefit arising from firming of the surface will of itself more than repay the trouble; besides, by thus making an evenly bed for the seed, the foundation is laid for a more regular covering, and the <a name="seeds89"><mark>seeds</mark></a> will come up flush, or together a point not to be overlooked, if we would secure the greatest number of plants. I I .the kinds of grasses to be sown, and quantity of seed per acre. The kinds must depend on the object in view at the time. If hay, and one or more years' pasture in the alternate husbandry, be intended, those kinds which yield the greatest bulk of produce and come soon est to perfection are to be preferred, as rye grass, timothy, cocks foot, and the c lovers. If permanent pasture, those are to be added which further insure the advantage of an early and close s ward, and a succession of fresh herb age throughout the year, as meadow fox tail, several of the rescues, meadow grass, &c. The whole family of the graminiae being what may be calledgregarious in their habits thriving better in company than alone a variety of species is the surest way to obtain a maximum of produce. All land has a tendency to reproduce those plants which are indigenous to it; so that after a series of years, more or less, according to the care which has been bestowed upon its cultivation, the indigenous plants will ultimately supersede those which have been artificially sown; but if we can at once produce the varieties naturally suited to the soil, especially those preferred by animals, by filling the ground with a proper proportion of their <a name="seeds90"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, a point will be gained calculated to enhance the value of our pasture land, without having to wait natures time. Although, in Great Britain, we possess about 500 graminiae, we only chin. 697 late about fig, and in some parts only one species namely, rye grass. Linnreus remarks, that, out of about 900 plants, the cow eats 286; the goat 458;the sheep 417; the horse 278 ; the how 107 ; the cow refuses 184 of them the goat 92; the sheep 102; the house 207, and the how 190; and he further remarks, that those rejected by some are highly relished by others. Under these circumstances, why should the farmer prefer only white clever and rye grass for pasture, in enclosed fields, into which the live stock a replaced, and compelled to eat these crops alone, when, by a little care and attention, other varieties may be sown, tending to preserve the animals in a more healthy state, and producing a more valuable supply for milking and feeding ?I n proof of the theory that many of the natural grasses are preferred by sheep and cattle to rye grass and c lover, Mr. Stirling, of Glenbervie, Stirlingshire, made an experiment by dividing a field into ridges, and sowing every alternate pair with different kinds of <a name="seeds91"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. The following spring sheep were enclosed in the field, and allowed to roam at large. After having the liberty of all the varieties for months, the rye grass was found almost wholly untouched, while the timothy and some other sorts were cropped to the root; thus proving, to a demonstration, the error of cultivating rye grass only, especially for sheep pasture. Timothy hay is eaten greedily by horses, being sweeter and more nourishing than rye grass. The crop is also very abundant, four tons per statute acre having been produced at Glenbervie. The quantity of seed should be regulated according to the nature of the soil, and the object to be attained. The following selection, suggested by experience, exhibits the varieties and proportions most suited for permanent pasture, per statute acre, sown with a crop on medium soilPerennial rye grass -18 lbs, or bushel. Timothy -3- Meadow rescue -4) Hard rescue -4) Meadow fox tail -2) Locks foot -3 White c lover -5 Red perennial c lover -3 "Mifilfoi -when sown without a crop, add about a fourth. For light soil, take one pound off those marked (H,) and add to those marked (for heavy soil, the contrary. I italian rye grass may occasionally be substituted for part of the perennialryegrass ; it does well in feat y soils. For alternate husbandry, viz: one years hay, and one or two years' pasture, per statute acrePerennial rye grass -18 lbs, or- bushel. Timothy -3 Red c lover -5 "white c lover -3 "fellow c lover -1 f for one years hay only, use 1} bushel annual rye grass ; add 2 is. of the red c lover, and de duct 2 lbs. from the white; and the contrary for two 698 years' pasture. A Scotch acre requires one-fourth part more, and an I wish acre fully a half, or a half and an eighth part more than a statute acre. I I I.- Owing. The regular distribution of the seed is of great importance; for this purpose there is nothing equal to a machine, which can also be used in windy weather. Owing a variety in mixture with the hand requires considerable dexterity; and, indeed, the work can scarcely be done in that way correctly. Owing the light separately from the heavy <a name="seeds92"><mark>seeds</mark></a> is considered a good practice. It has been recommended to sow first the large and then the small <a name="seeds93"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, giving them proportionate degrees of covering; but as the large will do equally well, with that degree of covering which will not be too deep for the small, this appears unnecessary. Calm weather should always be selected, if possible, for sowing grass <a name="seeds94"><mark>seeds</mark></a>; and should the weather be wet at the time of narrowing or rolling, a quantity of <a name="seeds95"><mark>seeds</mark></a> maybe expected to be wasted, by adhering to the roller and harrows. The period of sowing must be regulated by the seed time of the crops with which they are sown, or, if without a crop, any time from March till September. I V.- Covering. In horticulture, it is well known as a general rule, that different <a name="seeds96"><mark>seeds</mark></a> require a scale or degree of covering proportionate to their strength and size yet in agriculture a practice exists till this day much the same, as if the gardener were to sow mignonette in the drills made for peas, or turn in in the diable hole intended for <a name="potatoes1448"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; for, by the use of the common sized harrow, a great portion of the grass <a name="seeds97"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are as effectually buried as themignonette and turn in would be. The short teethed light grass harrow is an improvement, but still too coarse. A harrow formed of thorn bushes comes nearer the point, but is inconvenient, and cannot at all times be procured of the right sort. Mr. Smith, of Means ton, having turned his attention to the subject, has supplied the desideratum by the invention of his chain web harrow, which gives the required slight and equal covering in a manner difficult to sur pass; for, besides covering the grass <a name="seeds98"><mark>seeds</mark></a> effectually, it, from its nature, compresses the surface of the soil to a greater depth than does the roller, and leaves the ground in that state which is so favorable to the growth of grass. This harrow is also valuable for drawing over wheat lands in spring, when the surface has become battered with rains; being constructed on principles which admit of self adjustment to the surface of the soil, it is, instead of teeth, furnished with numerous little sharp discs, which, revolving, cut or since, without tear fig the plant or turning the cold; for same reasons, it is also well adapted for narrowing top dressing. Mr. Stirling, of Glenbervie, who has, in the most practical way, been for several years proving the merits of the different grasses and best method of cultivation, suggested a trial of the most useful of these <a name="seeds99"><mark>seeds</mark></a> at various depths, in regular g radiation. The following experiment was conducted under our own superintendence in the nursery grounds at Money Parkseeds sown 13th of May, 1842, on an open border of light sandy soil, the covering regulated by a frame standing 3 inches in depth at a b, and level with the surface at c d the border 4 feet wide. The white spots. 99 show where the <a name="seeds100"><mark>seeds</mark></a> have braided, and the proportionate thickness of the plants at the different depths, thus proving, to a certainty, the great loss sustained by the ordinary mode of covering the seed sac 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1)11 12 13 14 15 to. 1, perennial rye grass; 2, timothy; 3, meadow rescue; 4, red clever 5, white c lover ; 6, yellow c lover; 7, rib grass; 8, meadow fox tail; 9, hard rescue ; 10, smooth stalked meadow grass; 11, cocks foot; 12, c rested dogs tail; 13, wood meadow grass; 14, florid ; 15, I italian rye grass. The perennial rye grass alone has grown at 3 inches depth, but after passing the middle or 1 inch, the plants decrease more than half. This experiment was repeated in September, on clay soil, when the results were found much the same. The weather was dry; in wet weather, the probability is, that they would not have vegetated at so great a depth as in the light soil. I immediately after sowing, weather permitting, the roller should be again used, as nothing seems more clearly established than that grasses thrive best on a firm consolidated surface, as will be seen by the superior growth and appearance of head or end ridges, where, in laboring the field, the horses have trodden by frequent turnings; hence, where the <a name="seeds101"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are sown with a crop of grain, rolling in autumn after the crop is removed, and also the following spring, is of essential benefit; and if sown without a drop frequent rollings during the first and second years will be found to improve the pasture, both in growth and thickness. In regard to the question, whether grass <a name="seeds102"><mark>seeds</mark></a> for permanent pasture should be sown with or without a grain crop, I would say, that where it is an object to have a close s ward speedily, or where, from the richness of the soil, apprehensions may be entertained of the grain lodging and injuring the young grass, sow without a crop; but otherwise there does not appear sufficient compensation for the sacrifice, though, in general, it may be advisable to sow the grain thinner than ordinary. Sti   Rli   Of, December, 1843.7.00 a. Appendi X No. 8. Shemp. Loui Svi Lle, November 7, 1845. Dear Of  R: I received your letter of 3 1st multi moon yesterday. I cheerfully comply with your request, as far as I can, to furnish you with statistical information in relation to the culture and manufacture of hemp. I know nothing as to the culture of hemp east of the Allegheny mountains; but I suppose it to be so inconsiderable as to be of no importance in a report of the character you suggest. I put down the following in round sums as the product of the few western States where it is chiefly grown viz :kentucky in 1844* -i. -2 2500 tons, Missouri in. 1844 -a. (did 127- -12500Tennessee in 1844 : , -a- -1500 Ohio, In diana, and I illinois in 1844 -a: 50037,000Which is thus consumed :kentucky, for bagging and bale rope -tennessee, for bagging and bale rope -missouri, for bagging and bale rope -ohio, I illinois, and I i diana, for bagging and bale rope     n to bagging and bale rope -consumption of the various towns on the cordage, lines, t wine, &o, say -exported to the eastern cities, say Exported to Europe -in sold in the hands of farmers -1 5000 tons15004500100022000Ohio river, for 1500' -50001008400Thus exhibiting a surplus product of -37000The experiments made of sending hemp to Europe did not succeed getting the shippers but about                $40 per ton. This is caused, in part, by the heavy expenses consequent upon the shipment and sale; but mainly because it comes into competition with Fig a Vein hemp, which can be afforded in England at                                                                $140 to                                                                    $150 per ton of our currency, because England levies only a nominal duty of five shillings per ton on it. His hemp is worth intrinsic ally     $60 to     $70 per ton more than Kentucky or Missouri dew rotted hemp, for cordage, &c, which reduces the market value Of the latter there far below what it is worth in the United States. Very many farmers have made the experiment of water rotating; but owing to bad success in watering, and worse success in selling, they have* Believed to be for 1845. The. No. 140. 701 nearly abandoned it. One of those who grow hemp largely will water rot; it is only those who have not slaves, and who grow but a few acres, wh .will water rot. That sent to the eastern cities is used chiefly in the manufacture of cordage, lines, t wine, &c. Kentucky manufactures of bagging, per annum -1 2000 000 yes. Tennessee manufactures of bagging, per annum -1000000Missouri manufactures of bagging, per annum -2000000Ohio and I illinois manufactures of bagging, per annum -1000000New Work, New Jersey, and Louisiana manufacture of bagging, per annum -500000S16500000Kentucky manufactures of bale rope, per annum -1 2000 000 lbs. Tennessee do do do -1500 000. Missouri do do do o -5, 000000At the east do do do -a, 5,000,000S23,500,00This amount of bagging and bale rope is sufficient to cover about 2600 000 bales of cotton. The price of hemp, bagging, and bale rope has declined almost in the ratio of their increased production; thus, in 1835, with a crop of 7,000 to 000 tons in all the western States, it was                                                                     $10 to                                                                $12 per cut, bagging 35 cents per yard, and rope 12 to 13 cents per pound. In 1840, the product had increased 50 per cent, when the prices were hemp     $9 per cut, bagging 25 cents per yard, and rope 10 cents per pound. Since then, under the stimulating influence of the tariff of 1842, the products are four or five times the amount that they were in 1835, and the prices now are                $3 perch t. for hemp, 8 to 9 cents per yard for bagging, and 3 to 4 cents per pound for bale rope. These prices do not regenerate grower or manufacturer and, were either compelled to pay 6 per cent. interest on the capital employed, it would be ruinous. You will observe that I have before stated that there is a surplus of hempen sold in the hands of farmers of 8,400 tons; besides this, there is a vast quantity of unsettled land in the western country, s u it able for hemp growing, which is fast filling up with a hemp growing population. At present we consume more that half of the hemp that is grown, in the manufacture of bagging and bale rope which cannot be increased, unless by increase of the cotton crop, the h very low p ice of which would. indicate that it cannot arid will :not be increasedcid127) :The whole amount of the crop of hemp of the western; States, that s is consumed in. the manufacture of. ord age, lines, &c, is about 6,000 tons. What is to be done. with the present and annually increasing surpluscid1273 Rope, we see, will not buy of us at regenerating prices. ;If the growers would water rot, and our naval and commercial marine be supplied wholly with it there would be no difficulty. But how is this to, be effected ?a? But in: one way : government must set the example in its use, and should not only establish agencies in the west for its purchase in i the raw state, but should establish factories tar make the cordage say one in Doc, No. 140.this place and one in It. Louis; these two points, by direct water communication, would be easily accessible to all the hemp growing region. Were all the tow could readily be sold to bagging and rope manufacturers; for such is the improvement in machinery, that tow can now be more cheaply manufactured into bagging than the best hemp could be five years ago. Majority of the farmers would water rot portions of their crop, if they had a market at home for it, where they could be assured of obtaining                                                                   $120 person; which, you are aware, is .60 to         $80 per ton less than is paid for Russian hemp. The cordage can be manufactured here as cheap as at the east, and the cost of transportation to any port of the United States would not exceed                              $20 per ton ; but the farmers will not water rot so long as ninety-nine hundredths of them are ignorant of the modes opera n di nor while the market is so distant from them as Boston, &c, and while the inspection is uncertain, and returns more uncertain. Your letter did not invite the last paragraph; but I hope you will not consider it unobtrusive, and also superfluous, inasmuch as your position brings you in contact with every matter or thing for the promotion of the interests of the artisans and agriculturists. If what I have written should be of any service to you, as a small mine, in making such a report as will develop the resources of this great country, and be the means of enlightening our lawmakers and pointing them to, some interests which need encouragement, I shall be amply compensated for the few minutes I have expended. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Thos. S. Forman. Edmund Burke, Esqcommissioner of Patents, Washington, D. C. P. Of t is perhaps proper to say that I have been a grower and manufacturer of hemp for fifteen years. Useful Method Oof Rotti   Of Flax And Hemptranslated from the Polytechnic Arch iv, Del in, 1841, by E. Good rich Smithdr. Scheidtweiler, professor of Botany in Brussels, has introduced the following mode of rotating, which is much recommended: A wooden box, six feet long, broad, and high, and therefore containing two hundred and sixteen cubic feet, has over its bottom a second floor, five to six inches above the lower one; this upper one is perforated with holes; a hole is also made in one side of the box close above the lower bottom, which is stopped up with a hung, in order to let off the water which may be produced in the course of rotating. Upon the upper perforated floor let there be a layer of straw three to four inches thick; on the straw the flax or hemp is to be spread as uniformly and closely as possible, to fill as much as three-fourths of the depth of the box i When the flax has been spread, then place again a layer of straw of the same thickness as the former, (three to four inches) Now let the box be filled with river, or, what is better, rain water, and cover the whole with a op, likewise perforated with holesi70
. 703According to the temperature and the degree of dryness of the flax, allow it to soak for from twenty-four to forty-eight hours ; then open the hung hole in the bottom, and draw off the water, and let the flax be trodden down close together with the feet. When thus trodden down and covered with a layer of straw, the flax, according to the degree of warmth of the atmosphere, will more or less soon become rotted; and in this method of rotating, it is of the utmost importance so to conduct the trotting that the interior heat shall never rise above from 300 to 360 Reaumur about 134 to 1620 Fahrenheit. In the first day the heat inside the box rises not above the surrounding atmosphere. The day after, it reaches to 200 R., (or 900 Ah) and gradually increases up to 700 R, (or near y 3 200 aah) on which account the precaution must be taken of pouring in a dozen or more pails of cold water, according to the quantity of flax in the box. If the whole apparatus is placed in a warm place and protected from the cold winds, then cooling it off twice in twenty-four hours is sufficient; but if it is already cool, then once cooling with water is enough, in the same time. In this we must be governed by the thermometer, which is tried in the .midst of the layer of flax, and the heat must not be allowed to exceed 360 reaumur, (or 1620 Fahrenheit) over 40 R., (or about 180? Fahrenheit) the flax is in danger of being spoil ten the third day take out some s talks t fr trial, and see whether the flax has rotted to that usual degree in which the fibre is stripped off. To aid the process, place four or five inch e s of wood ashes on the upper layer Of straw, on which gradually, and in small quantities, pour water the let from the ashes will then fully act on the rum my parts, without attacking the fibre. Finally pour on again some pas il o, f water; let it be drawn off; take out the flax from the box; wash and dry it, either in the air or a gentle heat of an oven. The use of ashes is not "necessary, but the fibre will be better cleansed, and contain less tow. I f, on drawing the stalk through the fingers, it shows itself still of a greenish color .and g luminous, the rotating is not complete, and the flax must remain in th box a day longer.  If We employ the let on the second day, the rotating will be aide ti Therotting can be carried on during the whole year, if there be a drying room or an oven. As the process occupies only three or four days, all the 2axcultivators can use the same apparatus, and thus avoid the injurious Lwdunhealthy consequences of the usual mode: a single proprietor of such an apparatus could do the rotating for a whole township. By practice, the princess may be yet more perfect, and the loss in tow, &c, lessened. Of France I Ndustri Elle. From the side, page 160. Machi Of For Preparati   Of Of Flax, &c. According to the transactions of the I industrial Union for the kingdom of Hanover, a Vol stein farmer has invented and constructed a machine of wood, by means of which, he states, he can clean flax merely dried in the san, without any rotating, as it is called, or having undergone any chemical preparation, so perfectly, in twenty-four to twenty-eight hours, that it far 70 4 excess the threads of flax which are derived from the usual process. The machine, too, whether of wood or iron, is so cheap that any farmer can purchase one. It also prepares a large quantity rapidly, and can be worked by a child ten years old. The specimens of flax prepared by this machine, submitted to the Union in Hanover, were of extraordinary clean ness, strength, and fine ness. Water Rotti   Of Hemp. The sub joined article we find in the Nashville Agriculturists, from the pen of Men. G. J. Pillow. I have water rotted a crop of forty acres of last years growth, and have not made a single failure; nor have I had any difficulty in determining the point at which the rotating process should cease; nor have my hands been at all exposed; neither is there the least danger to be apprehended of sickness from this kind of labor. But I believe my success is mainly attribute able to the construction of my vat, and my preparation for the business. I will first state the character of these: My vat is built hear a small creek, which I straightened by a ditch, and thereby gave it a deep channel. The vat is 90 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 4 feet deep. I to walls are bill of hard brick, laid in hydraulic cement mortar, and they rest upon a solid stone, which extends clear over the bottom of the vat. The walls of the vat are thus made water tight, and proof against the action of the water. To dispense with the immense weight which would be required to press the hemp down, 1 drilled holes in the stone bottom, along the whole length of the vat on both sides, and within two feet of the walls, the holes being eight feet apart; into these holes I drove iron bolts, with wedges of the same material inserted in the lower ends, as firmly as I could with a sledge hammer. The upper ends of these bolts have each a closed hook or ring, into which are hooked iron bolts 4 feet long, with keyholes in the upper ends. When my vat is filled with hemp, I place cedar logs across the whole width of the vat. The upper bolts pass through the ends of these logs, and, with iron keys, the whole are clamped finally to the rock bottom. This being done, by the use of a water gate across the small creek spoken of above, the water is raised in height equal to the top of my vat, and it then passes through wooden pipes, of 41 inches hole, into the vat, and fills it in about three hours: I i drawing the water off from the vat, I raise a small water gate which slides in a casting on the inside of a frame, worked into the wall, and the water thence passes rapidly through a ditch, constructed for the purpose, into the main creek. The vat may in this way be emptied in half an hour. It will thus be seen that with five minutes' labor my vat may be emptied or filled. Within 20 steps of this vat are built my hemp house, the house for my machinery, and a very large shelter to protect my hemp from exposure to the weather, all under one roof. By having my hemp always protected from the weather, I can carry on any department of the labor without any interruption from rain for i clement weather. I n; addition 1 to this consideration, (which is very important save a heavy loss which is always incurred by s tacking hemp, and I promo c" No. 140. 705 kept my hemp, from the deleterious effects of the weather upon the color, weight, strength, and oily qualities of the lint. In this last point of _new, the shelter is indispensable inasmuch a si that, in water rotating hemp, it has to be handled a great deal, i is very important to cut instead of pull the hemp. It is equally important to the after labor to handle it so as not to break the s talks nor tangle it; but care should be used to lay it down as straight as possible. I ft his is not attended to, the subsequent labor is greatly more difficult, and the loss from the broken s talks and tangled hemp is much increased. After the hemp has become wilted by exposure to the sun for half a day and, after such exposure, care should be taken to avoid rain or a second nights dew) it should be taken up and bound in bundles six or eight inches in diameter, and loosely shocked in the field for 24 or 30 hours, so as to dry the tops and leaves, and prevent the hemp from mould bring under the shelter. It should then be removed and packed away under the shelter. It would be preferable (if there were time sufficient) to top the hemp before sheltering it. The only additional preparation necessary, before placing it in the vat, is to top the hemp, bringing it to a uniform length, and placing around each bundle another bind near the upper end, having previously pressed the first bind towards the lower end of the bundle. I have not found it necessary to introduce a stick into the bundle, to support the hemp in lifting it out of the vat; .nor do I believe it will ever be necessary, if the vat is so constructed as to draw off the water previous to removing the hemp. After taking the hemp out of the vat, for the purpose of drying it, it should be opened, and spread against something which will support it in an erect or inclined position, and keep it off the ground. If suffered to come in contact with the ground, the dirt adheres to it, and will in some degree injure the beauty and whiteness of the lint, and make the process of breaking and cleaning it more difficult and unpleasant. The length of time required to rot hemp in water depends very much upon the quality of the hemp, and the character of the weather. The large and coarse hemp will rot much quicker than will the small or fine hemp. Are should therefore be taken to bind the small hemp by itself, and not to place the coarse and fine hemp in the vat at the same time. If the weather is warm, and the same water retained, ordinary hemp will rot in from six to ten days. If the water is frequently drawn off, and pure and fresh water supplied every day or two, it will require two or three days longer; but in the latter case the hemp will be much cleaner, and brighter, and softer, and it will lose less in preparing it for the i manufacturer, than if kept all the time in the same water. After the hemp has been perfectly dried, it should be tied in bundles again, and removed to the shelter, where it will remain free from damage until it suits to apply it to the brake. After taking it from the brake, it should be run through the hatchet, so as to straighten the fibre and extract the tow from it. The hemp which remains is most beautiful, surpassing in brightness, length, strength, and glossy appearance, any hemp 1 have ever seen. The tow which is thrown off from the brake is less in quantity and superior in quality to the tow from the hand brake. This tow, as also the tow extracted by the hatchet, I straighten by again running it through the bake, (by which process it is cleaned almost perfectly of the sheaves) and sell to our home manufacturers for making rope and baling. Are should45706 be used, after hat chewing the hemp, to keep the butt ends of the lint all tone her, and to keep them all as even as possible. Being thus handled, will contribute greatly to the ease with which it can t be handled and separated by the manufacturers, without its becoming tangled; whereas negligently and carelessly putting it up, by mixing the tops and butts of the lint together, will very materially de tract from its value in the market. In this latter condition it will not be received at all at the navy yard of the government. Being hatchet led and thus arranged, it should be bound tightly around the butt ends of the lint, in bundles of eight inches in diameter, and in that condition ba led up, without being twisted at all. In baling, the ends of the lint may be doubled over so as to make the bales of proper length. The hemp should all be asserted that is, the long hemp should be bound and bald by itself, and so of the shorter quality. In order to protect the lint from dirt, and the consequences of roughly handling during transportation to market, its whole outer surface should be covered with ordinary baring of other canvass. Washi Ngton Of    Of, January 8, 1844. Of  R: The following treatise on the culture of hemp, and waterrottingis submitted to the farmers of Missouri and the adjoining Statesthe land best adapted to the culture of hemp is that which has been timbered with black walnut, buck eye, hack merry, and a reasonable proportion of white oak; or rich bottom lands answer well. The land should be ploughed deep, and well harrowed before seeing. If sod land, it should be ploughed down in the fall, to receive the winter frosts; and when time for seeing, (which is from the 1st of April to the 10th of May) it should be well ploughed, harrowed, level led, and smoothed. The seed should be sown broadcast, one bushel and a half to the acre. When the blossoms begin to fall, (which is from the middle of July to the 1st of Augustitshould then be cut. Hemp left standing too long injures the staple, and produces a harsh ness and weakness. It should be cut before it is ripe, which is before the blossoms begin to fall. By attending to this, particularly, you will find the lint heavier, as it will retain its oily substance what is termed the essential oil) which, by being left standing until ripe, the action of the atmosphere, as it ri pens, causes to leave it, which produces a lightness and harsh ness in the lint, and deprives it, in a certain degree, of its elasticity; consequently, when the hemp is applied to the hatchet, the staple breaks into small fibres, which are converted into tow; and when the tar is applied to it, and converted into cordage, it becomes stubborn and brittle in frosty weather, and consequently not so dura be. Any chemical process, or any other mode to produce a rapid solution of the gum, extracts the oil, weakens the staple, and produces the former injurious effects. The instrument for cutting is similar to the point of an ordinary scythe it his about two feet long from the point, with a socket standing at right angles with the face of the blade, and angling to the edge to prevent the person, when cutting, from bending too much, as it is necessary for him to stand upright as much as possible to keep the hemp from t angling. The hemp should by cut as close to the ground as possible, and, for watering, it should have the tops cut off as for as the seed ends, and thrown into the shade or kill dried. The drying in the shade retains its natural color, and doc. No. 140. 707sauses the essential oil to be retained. The kill drying has the same effect, but is a more rapid process, The sun produces a harsh ness when rotted, and the dew dis colors it and produces less weight. Pulling hemp is not recommend able; it injures the soil as well as the quality of the hemp more particularly that of water rotted. When cutting, all the large hemp should be laid by itself; it should be bound up into bundles, with two bands on them, about the size of six or eight inches through in the butts. When too large, they are awkward to handle, which wastes the hemp Also, place sticks in the centre of each bundle, about one inch in thickness or more; it prevents the hemp from breaking and t angling when rotted and will assist to facilitate the workmen in handling it : the same sticks will t answer for a whole crop. If your pools are prepared, commence filling them and be particular in selecting the size of hemp, placing the large in a pool by itself, and the small also in a pool by itself, as the large undergoes a more rapid solution when immersed. The hemp placed in the pools should be, carefully packed down with narrow plank laid on the points and butts, and with rock or timber to weigh it down ; rock is preferable. To hemp less than five feet should be water rotted. Sizes under this maybe dew rotten. It depends upon the temperature of the weather in what length of time it produces maceration. In the month of August, it takes four or five days; September, six to eight; October, ten to twelve; December, three or four weeks. After the fourth or fifth day in August and September, the sixth or eighth day in October and November, and the third week in December, or less time, it should be carefully examined, to ascertain when it has fully come to its solution. You will discover that the stalk has a roughness on the surface previous to its being placed in the pools. When the solution has arrived to its extent, by drawing a few s talks out of the bundles in the centre, promiscuously, and passing your hand along the, stalk, you will find that the roughness has left it, and that it is smooth to the touch. The hemp is then finished; take it out immediately; spread it on the ground; and when perfectly dry on one side, turn it over for the other say for two or three times until you find that the with has hardened. If it should receive several rains, it does not injure, provided you attend to turning it. The rains wash off the gum which lies on the surface of the lint; and when applied to the break, it produces a clearer staple, clean s easier, and makes less tow. There is also another mode, when the stalk will break off short, and free itself of the lint; but the former is the most certain. The hemp, as it is dried, should be thrown into shocks or risks, well secured from the weather penetrating their centres. If the weather penetrates the centre, it will injure the staple by reducing its strength. In breaking the hemp, it should be broken in small hands, about one third of the ordinary size. In all my experience I find our hemp requires to be properly hatchet led to stand the test the government requires. This is entirely owing to the different mode of handling to Russia hemp; but by breaking in small hands, it relieves itself of sheaves, and produces less tow, and comes nearer to the quality of Russia Fig a Vein, which quality of hemp the government uses for the navy. It should not be applied to the break too often, nor the breakers suffered to practise the habit of breaking dew rotted hemp, by beating it over the break to relieve it of the herds. It should be thrown up loosely into the atmosphere to let the air pass through it. In drawing your hemp, you should draw it from 'a ch end, so that the staple will draw clear, and 708 Doc.  No. 140,have an even hand. See particularly that the butts of the staple be even, and that all the drawings be handed to itself, and not placed in the prime hemp, as it is the habit of doing in dew rotted. All hemp with the drawings secreted in the centre will not pass inspection. The hemp must be perfectly clear of sheaves, arid that must be effected, not by little breaking and beating across the break, but by plenty of shaking. I have had the strongest evidence, in all my operations, that hemp broke in small hands, say 10 or 12 s talks at a time, will yield less tow in hat chewing by 20 to 30 percent, if the hemp is properly rotted. Also scut chewing helps the hemp greatly, and causes it to yield less tow, and straightens out the staple. This process is very indispensable to produce a merchant able article. The instrument for scut chewing is a flat wooden or iron knife, i it the form of a paddle. The hemp is placed on a board upright, about four feet long one half of the length of the hemp is held by the left hand at the top of the board, and the right applies the knife, which, when properly applied, relieves the hemp of the small sheaves which adhere to it, and straightens the staple for the hatchet, which adds greatly to the value of the article, and consequently produces less tow. If the farmers have a desire to arrive at that stage in their staple to be equal to Russia, it is indispensable for them to adhere to these instructions. There is no more labor attending water rotted hemp. if properly prepared for operation, than dew rotted. Hemp water rotted judiciously, and handled properly, will gain from ten to fifteen pounds on the hundred above the dew rotted, which more than amply pays for the difference of labor or expense in preparation. This has been prove n to be the fact by those who have tested it at one of my pools in Kentucky, and also by an experienced farmer in Missouri. Hemp that is darkened by the dews, or colored water, which is produced by the black ness of the soil, will not meet with a favorable demand in the eastern market; it partakes of the character and pipe of dew rotted hemp. To avoid this, immediately after your hemp is cut, place ii under shelter, or shield it with inferior hemp, that the dews or rains will not affect it; and also let your pools be made of plank, or otherwise place them at the side of the stream, and dam it sufficient in height that, in case the stream should be disturbed by rain or fresh et, it does not pass through your pool. The construction of pools is as follows: Small spring branches dug down two or three feet; a levee thrown up around them n, and small flood gates a teach end, made simply out of four pieces of boards a foot wide, and two feet long. A waste gate around them to let the water pass around, and not intothe pool; if so, it produces an uneven temperature of the water, and the hemp becomes irregular in its solution. The pools can be made of plank, and the water pumped into them supplied through a small leaden pipe by an ordinary lifting pump. A pool 40 by 60 feet, 21 feet deep, will receive three to four acres of ordinary hemp. The pool must not be over 3 feet deep; it will produce an irregular solution, owing to the uneven temperature of the water wat water rot in ponds or large streams is not so commend able, particularly running streams. The hemp becomes irregular in its solution, and loses its lint. The preparation necessary is to have two long sailings: pin them at each end with cross bars, forming a raft, with up rights at each end; their length to be the depth of the water: These form a raft, say 20 or 30 feet long: load your hemp on them, and sink them: with rock, For the conveyance of water to and from your pools, I Dec. No. 140. 70 will call your attention to the leaden pipes manufactured in this city by Mr. W. W. Thompson. These pipes will be a great acquisition for this purpose, as also for watering stock and avoiding waste of water. They can be made any length, and at a much cheaper rate than an ordinary spot. To those farmers who are not in possession of springs, they can fix a small lifting pump in any part of their farm, and supply their vats with water, As regards the process, there need not be the slightest apprehension as to deleterious effects to health. As a demonstration of this fact, in my operations for the government, I had about 200 men at various pools in the hemp growing region in Kentucky, from 1840 to 1541, in a circuit of 100 miles, and there was not one instance of sickness, although many of the men exposed themselves to the water when it was not necessary. I also advise gentlemen not to attempt to deliver more than one ton of hemp to each laborer they have, and not to exceed from 5 to 10 tons the season beyond this, it will produce difficulties. I will also observe the necessity of watching your hemp closely when near the time of its full solution. If you permit it to have too much rot, it will injure the hemp seriously in strength and in weight; and to avoid this to those that are not particularly acquainted with its proper solution, they may take it out before it is carried too far, and spread it down upon the field for the dew and rains to finish ; but, at the time, be particular to attend to turning it, that it may receive an equal proportion of (less and rains throughout. Hemp rotted in the spring is not of as good quality as that rotted in the fall say the months of October, November, and December. The spring rot produces a lightness of color, and the staple is weakened and loses much in weight. This is produced by the state of the atmosphere, and the sudden and extreme changes of it; and also the hemp lying in the s tack after being a long time cut, undergoes what is termed a, we at, which changes the state of the staple. In all the hemp growing regions of Russia, the crops amount yearly to 90,000 tons. The best hemp produced is in the government of Cheiringoff. The hemp is mostly of short, staple, and of the very best quality the produce is about 15,000 tons yearly; and in part of the government of Orel short staple is also produced, and carried to the port of Fig a; but the greater part of the hemp produced in this government is long staple, of which the produce is about 1 4000 tons. The hemp of Course is mostly long staple, and the produce is about 13,000 tons. The hemp of the government of Fooler is also long staple, and produces about 8,000 tons. In the governments of Lamb off andRiazan, the produce is about 14,000 tons, but not of good quality, being more after the color of flax, and its staple is weak; it is chiefly produced for the Archangel market, and a portion of it reaches It. Petersburg h. The hemp grown in the government of Smolensk i is of short staple, partakes of the character of that produced in the governments of Lamb off andRiazan, and which is mostly manufactured into sail cloth fabrics ; the produce is about 8,000 tons. The government of Along a produces about 7000 tons, mostly short staple. The Russian mode practised in preparing their hemp differs only with their instruction in relation to the care and pains taken in preparation. A portion of the country also adopts a chemical process to produce a rapid solution of the gum, which is injurious to the staple. As this country is subject to frequent hail storms, the crops often times fall short of this. In laying this information before you, my object is to convey to you the 710 0 quantity and the various qualities of hemp produced in the hemp growing regions of Russia. You will also notice that we have a decided advantage over the Russian article in comparing the small quantity of long staple to, ours, as all our hemp generally is of long staple; therefore, by assiduous attention to the culture and preparing of it, our staple must and will have the ascendancy in the European market. In a reasonable time, Missouri can supply the whole world with hemp; as well must I illinois and I own arrive to be extensive hemp growing States, and of a superior quality. And let the agricultural interest of these States buckle on their energies, and industry, and consummate it, to the advancement of their own prosperity and the country in general. I have had the assurance recently given me from a gentleman direct from London of the highest standing in mercantile transactions, that the moment we are prepared, he will effect a contract to supply the British government with our hemp for the navy, which consumes equal to our navy, and our commercial enterprise about 12,000 tons yearly. Also the consumption of the port of London is 20,000 tons yearly, embracing the requirements of the navy. I have also had the assurance, from a gentleman ,of high standing in commercial transactions in France, that, from the character of our hemp, the moment the country is prepared he will effect the supplying of the French navy with our staple. These countries are desirous to encourage us, that they may have two markets to flee to in case of any warlike disturbance. I have labored hard, with great sacrifices of interest, for these four years with the pleasing and proud anticipation to see the country independent of this foreign staple, and that we may become heavy ex porters; and the day is not far distant when these anticipations will be fully realized. And to facilitate this most important object, I have, by the solicitations of a number of gentlemen, delegates from the west, and others in power at this city, consented to embark upon this arduous and hazardous undertaking, with the view of supplying the navy with American water rotted hemp from the west for a term of years. I do assure you, gentlemen, that no pecuniary inducement could have influenced me to embark upon this work of enterprise again. But something must be done to keep alive and finish this great work, which has been commenced and is in progress, to its ultimate accomplishment. I have lost a large fortune in establishing the practice ability of it, and have undergone great afflictions; in consequence of which, I have felt reluctance to subject myself to a second trial of the various circumstances which befell me in effecting that important object. Tt, with a desire to promote the agricultural interest of the west, and to see my country speedily independent of this foreign staple, and with the confidence that I have in you, that you will support me in this act of enterprise, I now come forward once more, with all my resources and energy, to give this subject additional impetus, that will convince the world that this republic can stand free and independent, and can supply the commercial world. To accomplish this great work, I lean upon you, the farmers of the west, to rally to my aid, and give me your prompt and energetic cooperation. And to you, enterprising eastern men, I invite you west, to establish your ingenuity and enterprise in machinery for the manufacture of fabrics. Your interest, farmers, your prosperity, and your duty as patriots, and as an example to the rising generation, demand your prompt and un deviating attention to this important subject. *a* The question not. No. 140. 71 1 doubt will arise in your mind, how is all this to be accomplished ?a? I will answer briefly. Met every farmer take four acres of his best land, sow it down in hemp, and follow my instructions laid before you to the letter. If you have not water convenient, build plank vats 25 feet by 14 and 24 deep pump the water into them when the hemp is laid in. They require but a small quantity of water; two men can pump sufficient water in a day, and the same water, with a small portion of additional fresh added to it if necessary, will answer for two or three jottings. This size vat will answer for a crop of 25 or 30 acres, which is more than one farmer should undertake the first year. Your acres of good ordinary hemp judiciously rotted, properly cleaned, scut chewed, hatchet led, and well prepared, will yield to the farmer a clean gain of all expense of                                                                    $150 or more. What can be a greater encouragement in an agricultural pursuit than this ?a? In addition to this, a steady market, with the assurances that if you produce a prime article, the highest cash price is ready for you according to its quality, delivered at the various points of agencies. Those persons wishing to see me can address me at It. Louis, post paid. I will either wait upon them personally, or answer them from any State that feels a desire to embark in this enterprise. I am candid to inform those that have never water rotted, that there is more labor attending this operation than they imagine. But do not be discouraged experience and time will overcome it in a very great degree; with perseverance and industrious attention, not relying upon the care and attention of your negroes and laborers, but by your own close attention you will see great advantages to be gained in the prosecution of this business. I can with confidence and in truth say, that with practical experience and perseverance, they will be found worth more than all the theory and negroes in existence, in the saving of labor, expense, and the quality of the article produced. They will overcome difficulties and objections which first present themselves to you in its incipiency, which finally become obstacles of minor consideration. Therefore be not deterred when they are met; but per severe and acquaint yourself of the most practical and economical manner to exercise in the water rotating process. My plans are laid before you ;practise them, and you will improve on them. Practice makes perfect, and opens to you advantages than can be applied to great improvements and economy. Hemp for the navy must not be less than four and a half feet in length, a clear staple, of proper and natural strength, preserved by judicious treatment, and of a bright color; dark hemp will not be received for that purpose. It will be received and appropriated for commercial enterprise, at a reduced price. It is the desire that the farmer will practise the mode of scut chewing to relieve the hemp of the herds, in the place of applying it so often to the break. It straightens out the staple, and produces much less tow when applied to the hatchet. Also that they should become familiar with hat chewing of hemp generally. It adds greatly to the character of the hemp, east and abroad. And to those that wish to purchase satchels, they can be obtained at It. Louis for five to six dollars; or any ordinary blacksmiths can make them, provided they understand setting the teeth, (it greatly depends upon this) If the teeth are not properly set, it will split and deranged the staple and produce much tow. All hemp delivered unhatcheled will be received and paid for according to quality. It has been the practice tow 71. No. 14.utse great deception t in the preparation of this article, by .secreting the drawings and sheaves" in the- centre of the heads. But it will be useless to attempt this, as they are sure of being. detected. There are four classes of Russia hemp- ai ga Vein, lean It. Petersburg h, half clean, and out shot. And it is the intention to classify our hip i to the same, and the price paid will range up to eight dollars per be hundred and twelve pounds, delivered at It. Louis, for that quality of hemp that will stand the test that the government requires. And that can be effected and produced by judicious rotating, scut chewing, hat chewing, and of a proper length: That the hemp may be inspected and selected without prejudice to either party, there will be honest competent men from the east, who are fully acquainted with the qualities of Russia hemp, and more particularly that article te the government requires, whose hands it is to pass through before it will be paid for. I conclude this subject with a conviction that this appeal will not be in vain, and that in three years the foreign article will be entirely excluded from our ports, and heavy exports made to Europeiand I will impress upon your minds the importance of adhering to theseiistructifons and when your hemp is ready for market, by calling upon Messrs.

One of the editors of the Louisville Journal, now in Boston writes as follows in relation to the increased consumption of American hemp: "I findd that the consumption of hemp at Boston and New York has increased marvellous ly since last summer. An extensive establishment atPlymouith has manufactured twenty-five gangs of rigging this year of American hemp, and but six of Russia, whereas last year it manufactured not a single gang out of American hemp. The American dew rotted hemp is now used almost universally for standing rigging, and it is getting fast into use for running rigging. Tales are now making here, at six months, of a good article of dew rotted at 100, the range being from       $90 to                                                                         $100. Some lots have been shipped from New Orleans to 6Bostonthis summer at less than                $3 a ton; but, as freights are now                                                               $11 to Louisville, the whole freight amounts at present to                                                              $14 a ton. Nothing butt his new demand for hemp for naval purposes could have prevented it from sinking to nothing. The foreign demand is also taking off a good deal at present prices, at least for some time Cotton duck has almost entirely superseded Russia for sails. A merchant who formerly imported and sold a large quantity of Russia duck informs me that he has had a lot of it on hand for three years. It is no longer imported, and the demand has nearly entirely ceased. Cotton duck does not handle as well as hempen, but it is more dura be and cheaper, and holds the wind as "well. It will enjoy the i reference until the Kentucky
hempiduck takes h the field; then, of course, it will retire, except for small craft i a the coasting trade From the Prairie Farmer. Hemp Purchases Of The West. The Louisville and It. Louis papers have complained much, that the instructions of the Navy Department to hemp agents have rendered nugatorythe intentions of the law of Congress, providing for the inspection and purchase of hemp, passed September 11, 1841. These instructions have been such as to prohibit entirely the purchase of western and southern hemp the growing of which, it is claimed, the law was passed to encourage. These instructions are now rescinded, so that the article may be purchased in Louisville and It. Louis instead of Boston. American hemp is declared to be fully equal to the best of foreign, and we are glad to know that obstructions to its production are removed. Of Hemp Growers. The following letter is from a gentleman who is exceedingly well versed in all matters pertaining both to the culture and manufacture of hemp, and contains some important suggestions, which we think hemp growers should give heed to. All who have paid any attention to the prices current of New, Orleans, New Work, and Boston, must have observed that hemp of light color has been generally sought for, while that of a dark color has been generally neglected :FRANKLI   N House, Loui Svi Lle, August 1, 1845. To the Editors of the Louisville Journal and Collar Farmergentlemen : Having had some experience in the manufacture of hemp in Kentucky, and knowing something of the fluctuations in price and varieties of quality for different purposes and different markets, I venture to make a suggestion to the farmers in the hemp growing region of Kentucky. It is known generally that there will be at the end of the present season a very large amount of bagging and rope left over, though the cotton crop this year is expected to be very large. The result will be, that sales will be made at ruinous rates, if sales have not been, and are not now, making at those rates. Now, when the new crop of hemp comes in, what can r be the expectation of the farmer ?a? We see at once the manufacturers cannot give a price that will pay for raising it. Shall we have another market for it in the north? But that market cannot be beneficial to us, unless the hemp be of a quality and color that will suit it. And, in order to have i such, the hemp must be managed in the following manner : As soon as the hemp is cured enough after cutting to s tack, it should be stacked, if possible, without rain. There let it remain until frost in November, when it may be spread out. This secures the light color which is sought after forcid127the eastern or northern markets. And should one half the present crop inaaentuckjy be of that light bright color when ready for market, I have not 14 hesitation in saying it would meet a demand and price that would greatly benefit the grower. I have no expectation that the price would be much beyond the price the lead colored hemp would bring from the manufacturer here; but a division of the crop in this way, half at home and half abroad, will insure a demand for the whole crop, be it ever so great. Of Of Of Waterrotted Hemp A Of   Ght Color. The following note, from an eminent citizen fully conversant with the culture and manufacture of hemp, sustains completely the views of a letter which we gave a few weeks ago, and deserves the careful attention of allhempgrowersTo the Editors of the Louisville Journalgentlemen: In 1822 and 1823, Nathaniel Part, of Woodford county, Kentucky, stacked his hemp of bright color, and kept it in s tack sixteen or eighteen months. He spread it out to water in November, and took it up at the usual time in the winter or spring. The result was a beautiful white hemp, having in all respects the appearance of water rotted hemp, and I believe every way equal to it. Mr. Part, in 1824, published in the Kentuckyfarmer the result of these experiments, and, as an inducement to produce such hemp, offered to purchase it at a high price; yet very little hemp has been so prepared in Kentucky. I saw yesterday, landing from the Bluewing, four or five tons of such hemp, grown by a Mr. To wan, of Doyle county, sold by Mr. Now man on the wharf for one hundred and two dollars per ton. The large crop of hemp now in s tack makes the present season a very favorable one for beginning to produce this kind of hemp. I hope some experiments of this kind will be made in Jefferson county of the hemp now in s tack. E. G. Mgi Nni S. Lobi Svi Lle, September 25, 1845. From the It. Louis New Era. Hemp. The following fact was submitted to me (to assign the cause) by the Navy Department( The American water rotted hemp, when made into cordage without the application of tar, proved to be greater in strength than Russian; and the application of tar proved to deprecate its strength to that of Russian t is well known that our hemp, properly prepared, is superior in every respect to Russian ; and as this subject is one of great interest to the West, as also of great national importance, I feel a deep interest to cherish that fostering care the government is now extending to this branch of agriculture, and will give you my views in regard to obviateing this evil; for, if not attended to, it will produce such a prejudice against the use of American hemp for naval purposes, that in time its use will be abandoned. The Russian method is to select their male hemp from the female, at the
715time the pollen begins to fall from the male, and they also harvest the female before it fully matures. By adhering strictly to this method, the hemp retains the essential oil. They also kill dry it immediately after it is pulled the object of doing this is to hard en the lint and fix the oil, so that, in the process of rotating, the oil will not e vapor ate; it is essential that the same method be followed by the Americans. The hemp should be pulled before the stalk or leaves begin to change their color; when that takes place, it is a sure indication of the oil passing into the seed to complete its maturity; consequently, it leaves the lint, when rotted, harsh, and, with the application of tar, deprecates its strength. Not so with the Russian hemp; the essential oil, being retained, acts as a desideratum for the application of tar, and overcomes the evil which is effected by the heated tar and the spirits which remain in it. The American farmer, to obviate in a partial manner the evil mentioned, should adopt the method of pulling the hemp, as before described, and immediately place it under cover, to avoid the action of the sun and weather, and remain so for a sufficient time for the lint to hard en, which will in a certain degree produce the same effect as the Russian process of kill drying. By this means the hemp will retain that most important antidotetheessential oil from the influence of the tar in its heated application. Davi D Myerle. Washi Ngton, January 6, 1845. From the Louisville Courier, May 17. Ameri Can Hemp. In the Courier of yesterday morning we stated that we had seen at the store of Messrs. James Anderson & To the office of the Kentucky hemp agency, under the direction of Mr. Lewis Saundersa number of specimens of American and Russian hemp, and cordage manufactured from them; and also a machine for testing the strength of the cordage. Yesterday experiments were made upon this machine, the interesting results of which we give below, from Mr. Blunders, the agent. It will be seen from the record that the American hemp not only does not suffer by a comparison with the Russian hemp, but that in the tests of the larger cordage, it sustained a much greater weight than the Russian hemp. These facts are of deep interest to western hemp cult wrists, and to the entire country. They show conclusively that as good an article (if not better) of water rotted hemp can be furnished by the farmers of the valley of the Mississippi as can be obtained from Russia, from whence our government heretofore have obtained all their naval supplies of hemp. We understand that the mode of curing hemp by the Messrs. Anderson is peculiar. It is neither steamed nor water rotted, but broken from the s tack. The samples of their hemp which we saw, cured by their process, were very superior in appearance to the Russian water rotted, and we believe much stronger 7 16 C. No. 140. Shemp Agency Forn Kintucky, Louisville, May 16, 1845. Commodore Morris, head of the Bureau of Construction and Equipment, cal used to be sent to the agency a very perfect apparatus for the purpose of testing the quality of hemp; also a box containing Fig a Vein hemp, and a box containing American water rotted hemp, as samples for examination and comparison. The apparatus and samples of hemp were sent from theBbston navy yard, and arrived here in October last. The .object of the department is to give information to the growers and dealers of hemp. Bytese samples and tests, bidders for the supply of the navy can, with more certainty, submit their proposals.

He are happy to have the opportunity of laying the following letter before our, readers, just received at the Navy Department from its agent in Kentucky, appointed by the present Secretary
17hemp Agency Of Kentucky, Louisville, June 6, 1845. Of  R: The day after the date of my last letter, (16th ulm) I sat out on an excursion to the centre of the hemp district of Kentucky, through the counties of Franklin, Woodford, Gazette, and Bourbon, placing, for examination and comparison, samples of the hemp sent out from the Boston' navy yard, at Frankfort, Versailles, Lexington, Paris, and Georgetown. I had intercourse with many of the principal hemp growers, particularly those that were inclined to water rot their hemp. I was much gratified in finding a strong disposition on their part to water rot the crop now growing, to which they are impelled by the present very low price of dew rotted hemp. Some knowledge has been acquired by the experiment made in the last few years in water rotating. It has been. ascertained that it will not do to water rot in warm weather that it must be done in cold weather. I Confidently believe that the government can be supplied with water rotted hemp hereafter to the amount of its wants. Messrs. James Anderson & To, of this city, have been a long time engaged in making experiments in preparing hemp for manufacturing purposes. Mr. James Anderson speaks now with confidence of having succeeded in curing hemp by heat, to supersede all other methods of rotating or curing hemp. His plan is to break the hemp from the stalk by a number of rollers; he then passes it through a ferment at ion caused by heat, leaving it in a condition to prevent any second or succeeding ferment at ion. A bale of hemp thus prepared has been sent to Boston, for the purpose of examination, comparison, and testing, The naval officer, Mr. Parma enter, was requested to take charge of this bale, and attend to the experimental trials. By this days mail, I have sent to your address two samples of hemp-one nearly or quite. the same as sent before; the other washed from the same, marked " refined The refined is brought to its beautiful silk y appearance by washing through several washings of alkalies, and then hatchet led. There is a strong disposition on the part of some capitalists of this city to engage in the manufacturing of sail cloth of every description. I am requested by them to solicit you to cause to be sent to this agency samples of at least one yard in length of each sort of sail cloth used in the navy of the United States, with a description of the weight and length of each bolt, and the separate value of each. If it is agreeable to you to have this suggestion carried out, you will oblige many of the citizens of this place. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Lewi S Saunders. Hemp Agency For Kentucky, Louisville, June 9, 1845. Of  R: In a former letter you were informed that I had got possession of the hemp apparatus for testing the strength of hemp. I secured an eligible position for using it, and a convenient office adjoining, for the use of the agency, for the sum of one hundred dollars per annum, to be paid quarter ly. Persons interested in hemp were anxious to witness the operation of the 718 machine. I had four parcels of hemp spun into bolt rope to. 1, Americanwaterrotted hemp; No. 2, Fig a Vein hemp, (these two were taken from the boxes sent from Boston) No. 3, Rhodian hemp, (this is a new article, broke and cleaned without being rotted, either by water or dew. After being thoroughly cleaned, it is put into a close, air tight room, and then heated by steam until it is sufficiently cured. James Anderson, who claims this discovery, is of opinion that it will answer every purpose that water rotted hemp will) and No. 4, common dew rotted hemp. The rope was not of a uniform size; from which fact I concluded to make a second test trial, and send you the statement. The editors of the city papers were present, and a number of intelligent gentlemen. The enclosed printed paper is the account of this trial. At Lexington, I had an interview with Mr. Hamilton, my predecessor. He said he had closed his accounts with the department; that he had no money belonging to the government; that he had kept no book of his transactions as agent. He handed to me some letters and copies of instructions that he had received, and gave me the following list of articles belonging to the United States government, purchased for the use of the hemp agency, at Lexington, viz One hemp press, Earners patent, cost                                                                    $150. One hatchet. One desk. A box of samples of hemp, &c. The hatchet and box of sample hemp I have directed to be sent to Louisville, and ordered a sale of the desk. The press is the one most approved by shippers of hemp. It can be sold for nearly cost, or retained for use, should it be thought, hereafter, advisable to purchase hemp in Kentucky. I have visited the hemp district of most importance in Kentuckythecounties of Franklin, Woodford, Scott, Gazette, and Bourbon; had a free conversation with many growers of hemp, gentlemen of intelligence and liberal views. I am of opinion that contracts could be made for the growing crop, to be water rotted, from three to five hundred tons, to be delivered at Louisville, of a quality equal to any purchased by the government, at one hundred and fifty dollars per ton. The counties of Mason and Fleeing, in this State, produce large quantities of hemp. The shipping point for these is Days ville. I think of visiting them next month. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Lewi S Saunders. Commodore C. Morri s, Chief of Bureau of Construction, 4,c. Second trial of hemp. Mr. Blunders, the government hemp agent, made a second trial of the comparative strength of different kinds of hemp, with a result again favorable to the American article. We are glad to learn that similar experiments are to be repeated, and that no efforts are to be wanting to settle fully and definitely the comparative merits of the American and foreign articles. 
19Mr. Blunders has applied the term " Rhodian" to the hemp prepared by or. James Anderson by heat, without rotating, called by Mr. Awes, in his certificate, " Humbuggery" from the name of the place where it Is prepared :KENTUCKY Hemp Agency, Louisville, June 9, 1845. A second testing, proving the strength of three sorts of hemp, (by the government apparatus) was made today, in the presence of a number of highly intelligent gentlemen. To Mr. Awes, a rope maker of this place, were delivered twenty-five pounds No. 1 American water rotted hemp, twenty-five pounds No. 2 Rigarein, (these two parcels are fair selections out of the two boxes of hemp sent to this agency from the navy yard at Boston, for comparison with Kentucky production) and twenty-five pounds No. 3 Rhodian hemp. The latter was cured by heat; the method of doing it will hereafter be communicated to the department by Mr. James Anderson, of this city. Mr. Awes was requested to make bolt rope of each parcel of hemp, as near 1- inch in circumference as he could, to spin the yarns uniformly alike, and to make and lay the rope the same way. Men feet in length of each number was cut off and accurately weighed. No. 1 American water rotted, ten feet weighed fourteen and three quarters ounces, measured in circumference one and seven tenths inch, parted at 2,940 pounds. No. 2 Russia, ten feet weighed fourteen and three-fourths ounces, measured in circumference one and eight tenths inch, parted at 2,218 pounds. No. 3 Rhodian, (Andersons) ten feet weighed thirteen and one-fourth ounces, measured in circumference one and six tenths inch, parted at 2 440 pounds. Lewi S Saunders, Hemp Agent. There will be required many trials before we can designate a standard, but a standard must be established in order to compete, effectively, with the foreign article. In the language of Commodore Morris, we ought to be ex porters instead of importers of hemp. The following is the certificate of Mr. Awes, who manufactured the rope on which the above experiments were madeLOUI Svi Lle, June 9, 184,5. In the three lots of hemp presented to me, I found the water rotted produced more tow than either of the three, and the " Humbuggery" [Rhodianless, in the same mode of hat chewing. Respectfully yours 1. W. Hawi S. Mr. L. Saunders, United tates agent 720 a. In order to make the comparison in the preceding experiments fair, it is necessary to reduce these results to what. they would have been with ropes of the tame size. We may assume the compact ness of the twist and the weight of the fibre to be nearly the same; as the difference in the circumference of the ropes accounts very nearly for the difference in their weights. We shall suppose, then, that each rope had been 1 810 inch in circumference. The strength, by a well known principle, is directly proportional to the area of a transverse section ; and these areas are as the squares of the circumferences. Take the case of the Rhodian hemp. If 1 610 X 1 6 410 gives 2,440, what will 1 8 10 x 1 810 give ?a? The result is 3,108. Reducing the result of No. 1, the same way, gives 3,296. To that the experiment may be stated as follows :to. 1 American water rotted -329 to. 2 Fig a Vein -2218No. 3Rhodian -3108The difference between the first and third is not more than might be expected in different specimens of the same kind of hemp; whilst the difference between them and the second or Russian hemp is very considerable, and much to the advantage of the former. These experiments will be continued; and we shall have more to say on their importance hereafter. I Nspecti   Of Of Hemp. Navy Department, July 18, 1845. Of  R: In the instructions which you may hereafter have occasion to give to the agents for testing, inspecting, and purchasing American water rotted, hemp for the use of the navy, you will authorize the inspection and test that may be made at the several agencies in the hemp growing regions to be final and conclusive, instead of requiring them to be repeated at Boston. Whenever it shall become necessary to procure further supplies of hemp, you will direct that contracts be made for its delivery at either of the agencies established ; the department to be at the risk and expense of conveying it thence to the Charles town yard, or wherever else it may be wanted. I fully appreciate the considerations which have heretofore induced you to require the final inspection to be made at the place of manufacture, and have not, without hesitation, adopted a different conclusion, But from a careful perusal of the resolutions of Congress on the subject, and the opinions of some of the legislators who assisted in passing them, I cannot resist the conviction that they were designed to encourage the culture of this important staple, by opening to its producers a valuable market in their own, region. To require them to sell at an inspection twelve hundred miles distant from their homes, must operate, in a great measure, to deprive them of this market, and have a tendency, therefore, to defeat the expressed intentions of Congress in their behalf. Entertaining this opinion, and feeling a deep interest in whatever concerns the agriculture of the country, I am induced to hazard the slight inconvenience and expense which may temporarily result to the government from the proposed change, for the sake of the permanent benefit which it may confer upon it in the increased culture, improved quality, and reduced prices of American hemp. While our agents at the west are compete at and. 21 faithful in the discharge of their duties, the department may reasonably rely upon them, or upon such special agents as it may appoint for a safe and rigid inspection of the supplies which may be offered for their approval and the risk of transporting the quantity thus approved to the place where it is required for manufacture, Congress seems to have d evolved, by its recent action, upon the government. One of the principal reasons which have induced your previous action on this subject appears to be that provision of Congress which requires all supplies for the navy to be furnished, after public advertisement, by the lowest bidder. You will meet the requirements of this law, and the purposes of the Congressional resolves, to which I have referred, by adve r rising, in the i first instance, exclusively for American hemp; and you with allow foreign hemp to come into competition with our own only when the latter cannot be obtained on the conditions prescribed by law. Acknowledging the interest which you have uniformly manifested in this important subject, and assuring you of the diffidence with which I direct the change in your accustomed action, i -a; l am, very respectfully, yours, George Bancroftonimodorec.

It is very gratifying to see so n such interest elicited in various parts of the, country in relation to hemp. The importance of this great crop, in many parts of the State, is now of the first consideration. Without having yet supplied any for the navy of the United States, and but little for commerce, the crop of Kentucky has averaged not less than twenty thousand tons for the last five years. The passage of the joint resolution by Congress, in 1841, giving the preference to American water rotted hemp over the foreign article, has turned the attention, the thought, of many inquiring, ingenious minds to that subject. The enclosed letter from Mr. Barlow will no doubt be read with much interest' This is the commencement of an era in the manufacture of hemp, so ardently and firmly believed in by my friend John George Baxter, (now dead) time ,the ri twenty years ago. Mr. 1s ideas astounded the incredulofts i at that period: I He a asserted' that 'hemp would bl each whiter than eitherTiax or cotton, and make the finest fabric, from lace and cambric down to461722 good shirting, and far cheaper than either. I will, however, send you Mr. Baxters paper at another time. Lewi S Saunders. Washi Ngton Of    Of, July 25, 1845. Dear Of  R: I perceive by your publications, that you are making experiments in testing the quality of the many different kinds of hemp. Having been myself, for the last three years, fully devoted to the subject of water rotating hemp, and believing that you are desirous to obtain any useful information on the subject, I would beg leave to lay before you the result of my own experiments in the water rotating process. It is not my present purpose to impose on your attention a history of all that I have done or attempted to do, but will only suggest to you what was finally effected by a regular train of experiments. In the usual mode of water rotating hemp, much of the good or ill success depends on the temperature of the water and stage of the weather. Under the many different circumstances, a similar ferment at ion is brought on sooner or later; and after the hemp becomes macerated the most difficult part of the process is to stop the fermentationor putrefaction at the right point: the hemp often continues to rot even after it is cleaned out and converted to use ever subject to what is called a dry rot. In order to overcome that difficulty, I put the hemp into strong tight vats, filled with water sufficiently warm to produce an effectual and equal maceration of all the parts of the lint in the same time. When, by the use of steam pipes I raised the temperature of the water up to a strong boiling point. The boiling is to be kept up for three or four hours, which will at once fully arrest or dispel all the putrefaction that was connected with the hemp cooked, to keep it from spoiling; in the meantime the g luminous matter will be fully extracted from the lint. The water is then drawn off, and the hemp is taken out of the vat in a safe and sound condition. It may be set out in the weather for a whole year, without sustaining any material injury. It is also free from any short hurts when broken or cleaned, And much stronger than any other hemp that I have been able to compare it with. The lint is strong from end to end, soft, and fibrous. The g luminous matter being extracted, it will receive more tar than hemp, prepared in any other way. The quality may be more effectually tested by making ropes of an equal size or weight of that and other best samples of hemp, and bury all together in mud and water for any proper length of time when taken up and put to the test, the result will fully show the difference in the quality of each kind of hemp. Hours, respectfully, Sthos. H. Barlowlewi S Saunders, Esqhemp agent for Kentucky. Purchase Of Hemp. We give below an interesting correspondence, which we find in the Democrat, as well as the remarks of that print; which are, perhaps, fair enough. If hemp is to be purchased here at the west, there should be no delay on
2gthe part of the government in making preparations for it. Met it be both inspected and purchased. here, that the hemp growers can t receive their money, and have no further trouble about it, and they- will be satisfied. To farmer will be satisfied with having his hemp pass inspection here, if he has to be at the further trouble of taking it around to Boston to be sold. Very farmer knows too much about the tricks of politicians and the tricks of trade to run any such risk. Although Mr. Blunders, in his letter to the Democrat, says L that purchases will hereafter be made in the west" it will be seen that Mr. Bancroft, neither in his previous letter, which we have published, nor in this one, authorizes, except by inference, such a conclusion. The Democrat says: " The reader will see, in another column, a communication from Mr. Blunders. This gentleman is indefatigable in his exertions to secure to the agriculturists of the west the advantages to which they are entitled. He congratulate him on his success. The Secretary of the Navy, ha given, the subject his prompt attention. For the former arrangement of inspecting hemp at Charles town, Mr. Bancroft is not responsible. As soon as he had time, he gave the subject the attention its importance demanded, and set the matter -right. Met the same justice be meted out to the west in other things, and we shall feel the benefit of itSGRAss Of Lls, August 6, 1845. The hemp growers of Kentucky will see, by the annexed letter from the Secretary of the Navy, that the order directing the final inspection of hemp to be made at Boston has been rescinded, and that purchases will hereafter be made in the west. The full supply of suitable hemp for the navy of the United States now devolve on the farmers themselves. The soil and climate of many parts of Kentucky are well adapted to its culture ; the natural strength of the hemp is not surpassed by the production of any country. Have the heitprotted in water of a uniform temperature, (not over done) then thoroughly cleaned ; it will come up to the navy standard, and, after supplying the government, be sought after for the commerce of the world.

' The suggestions you offer, that a quantity of water rotted hemp be advertised for, so as to give notice to the farmers in season to prepare it, will be fully considered at an early day. Not being able, after reflection, to concur fully in the propriety of the order which directed that the final inspection of hemp must be made at Boston, I have caused that order to be rescinded, and the inspection made hereafter at the agencies in the west will be conclusive. In thus dispersing with the second inspection, I feel desirous to impress upon you the necessity of vigilance in the discharge of your official duties.

'the following is from a source entitled to full confidence, and will attract the attention rot only of the hemp growers of Jefferson county, but of all others thrbothout the countryTothe Editors of the Louisville Journal and Collar Farmergentlemen: I hope that what I write may be seen by the hemp growers of Jeffersoncid127) county, that they may read it, and that they may not sneer at it as the production r of a city farmer, but that they may be profited by it. By the present mode of growing and preparing hemp in this country, it is almost worthless for cordage and all the finer uses to which hemp is applied; it is not worth, in any of the eastern markets, as much by thirty dollars per ton as if it were properly prepared; and for bagging and rope, which is the coarsest use to which it is applied, it is not worth as much by fifteen or twenty dollars p dr ton ras the hemp grown about Lexington andMaysville. For illustration, I will state that fair handled hemp will yield sixty or seventy pounds of clean hemp from each hundred weight ;very ordinary hemp will yield forty five or fifty pounds suitable for bagging; and a fair average of Jefferson county grown hemp will not yield over thirty-five or forty pounds, from a hundred weight. This great difference in value is attribute able to the following causes First. The land is not sufficiently pulverized before the seed is sown, and thus it comes up irregular, and produces a coarse, bark like lint. This can be easily prevented by a liberal use of the harrow and roller. Secondly. In the process of cutting, they " gather" with the hook, and thus hack or partly cut asunder the lint on almost every stem, which is the chief cause of so much tow being made in the process of hacking. This mode of " gathering the hemp with the hook is not practised anywhere in the United States except in Jefferson county. It is easily prevented : it only requires determination on the part of the farmer that his negroes shall not do it; and could they by made sensible of the loss they sustain by it in the deprecated value of their hemp, I am sure they would not longer permit it to be done. I would also suggest that they use the crooked hook, which is used in all the other counties of the State at least, that they will try it before rejecting my suggestion. I am sure that a, hand will cut one third more per day than with the straight hook, and that, he will do it better; and more by far than :both these, they will aid this destructive practice of gathering with the hook. Thirdly. It is common in this county to plough the ground before the hemp is spread upon it .go rot; thus many stems are imbedded in the mad and become black rotted indeed, all the hemp is seriously injured and lessened in value by the mud. His. can be prevented by having the hemp cut close and smooth to the earth, so the hemp for rotating can be spread upon it; or, if9Doc. Noa40this cannot be done, let a heavy roller be passed over the ground to mash down the stubbles. Fourthly. Chef i being the hemp, they pound it too much with the brake, instead of electing the shoves, after being thoroughly cracked with the brake, by. whipping the hemp across the brake; their object is to leave in as much tow as possible, on account of weight; but a little observation and calculation will show this to be false economy. Now much tow can they possibly leave in the hemp, and yet erect all the shoves ?may twelve pounds ii the hundred weight. Any bagging manufacturer will pay more than this difference, if this twelve pounds of tow had been whipped out; with hemp at three dollars per hundred weight, it is orJlythirtysix cents, or seven dollars and; twenty cents per to to. At any eastern market, where hemp is chiefly wanted for cordage, a difference of fifteen dollars would be made: But I am well aware that the I Jefferson farmers cannot venture to whip .the hemp across the :brake so long: as they permit their, negroes to cut: it asunder in the middle by gathering with th'e hook instead of gathering with the hand: and arm. ,I know that there are two or three farmers in Jefferson county who are exceptions to what I have said. : As a citizen of Jefferson county, I would of course give the Jefferson farmer the preference in the purchase of imp, at the same, price, if of equal quality ; but further I could not go, in justice to .myself, nor will any manufacturer ; but .unless they :will, prepare their hemp as well as it is done in the other hemp growing counties of the State, they must: expect .to take a less price for it. During the present season, manufacturers have been paying three dollars for hemp here, when, at the same time, they were paying three i dollars to three dollars twenty-five cents, and bringing it one hundred and fifty to two hundred, miles at their expense ; and, this is :not the result of concert :among them; for such is the competition to purchase, hemp, that it always brings the last cent that the manufacturer can: afford to pay; and even if it were concert, could not the same concert be as easily effected at Days ville, Lexington; Frankfort, andSSt. You is M. Anufacturer726 a. Appendi X No. 9. Of Flax. From the New York Farmer and Mechanics. Meeti   Of Of The New York Farmers' Club. Chairman- Our regular subject is now in order the culture and manufacture of fax and hemp in our own country. Judge An Wycki had hoped that our president would have been here to day, and to have heard the result of his reflections upon the subject. I will make a few remarks upon it. I fear that the culture of flax will not repay the farmer if it is conducted as it has hitherto been done for fifty years past. Too much labor, too much cost in getting it prepared and sent to a proper market. The price of seven and a half cents to twelve and a half cents a pound will not regenerate the producer. The most which can ordinarily be raised, if for the lint only, is about four hundred pounds the acre; if raised for seed only, two hundred pounds. The capital employed, consisting of land, in our part of the country worth                                                                         $100 per acre ; animals and tools,               $50 ; labor and dressing, and getting to market, altogether say                                $200. While the price will average but ten cents a pound, it will notremunerate the farmer. Perhaps on rich western lands it would pay, but not in our quarter, where grazing and raising of bread stuffs is far more profitable. Train crops cost us nothing like the labor and expense of flax. Flax rust be raised, puffed, housed, rotted, dressed, and got to market, with much delay and expense. You cannot persuade our farmers to raise flax unless you show it to be profitable; and they know what is for their best interest to produce. England had to abandon the culture of flax in favor of corn and cattle, although the government gave bounties by way of encouraging the flax culture. It will never do in the northern States, unless some revolution is effected in the culture, dressing, &c. I f, by machinery, the difficulties can be overcome, then it may answer. Dr. Underhilli t is not intended to recommend the culture of flax after the old method, but on rich soil. When cut in the flower by a cradle, instead of hand pulling, &c, this is an entirely new plan. We speak of the culture for the United States, and in the rich soils of the country west Arkansas, &c. The crop of flax does not, when cut in the flower, impoverished land half as much as when allowed to go to seed, and gives a double crop of the flax; and so much finer is the fibre, that it is worth fourteen or sixteen cents a pound. The machinery of Willings can dress the flax for three cents a pound !a! and by crawling, rotating, and dressing in the manner willings does it, almost twenty per cent. more of flax is made than was made by the clumsy old method; and the quality of the fibre far superior, silk y, and beautiful. Hemp is peculiarly fitted for the rich lands of the west. I exhibit to the club a specimen of the Gave hemp, from Yucatan. The lamented Or, Ferri ne brought this article into notice. I He was one of the most devoted friends of American agriculture that I have known. This hemp is the strongest in the world for ships cables. But common hemp is becoming very interesting as a crop in our country. -forty five
27millions of pounds were raised here in 1844. A pamphlet issued by distinguished citizen of Kentucky did greatly contribute to this most valuable result. Hemp is also now cradled when green. Judge An Wycki t is admitted in Europe that flax, although pulled when in the flower, yet exhausts land more than grain crops; but when it goes to seed, it becomes a scourge to the soil. Not so with hemp, of which t twenty crops in succession can be produced on the same land with but littlenmanuring, and the last' crop be perhaps a better one than the first !ChairmanOne cause of the neglected culture of flax is cotton, so agreeable and so useful as apparel for the greater part of the year. As to hemp, there is no doubt as to our capacity to raise it; but I think that Or. Lay must have a fine soil and well cultivated. I do not think that hemp is so great an exhausted of the soil as flax. *a* *a* It is a difficult thing to fix dyes in linen; the colors, notwithstanding the use of the knownmardants, are apt to wash out of linen. Mr. Wvakemanlinen may be made a substitute for cotton to a certain extent. We now import linen to as great an amount, or rather more than we did forty years ago, but not so much in proportion to population. He can raise say 448 pounds of flax per acre; I re land raises upwards of 500.:If ten cents a pound be the price, it is worth more than the cotton raised upon an acre. Everything in our country has been against r linen. The duties began at five per cent. on s meetings, &c, then went up to 12. In 1812 they went up to 371 per cent. A great many manufactoriesof flax were commenced, and were operating extensively. The double duty and the war caused that. After the war the duty was 15 per cent, while upon cotton it was from 80 to 100 per cent. In woollen it was 25 per cent. In 1828 linen was 15 per cent; hats, boots, &c, were at 30 per cent. Had the same protection been extended to linen as to cotton, we should now be ex porters of linen; now, that staple is all down. But people must have proper inducement to go into the linen business, or they will never, do it. Flax is manufactured in Europe, into handkerchiefs, at 3,500 per cent advance on its first cost Judge An Wyckand cotton at 5,000 per cent. Mr. Her gen; of Gowanusi have seen much flax raised. I do not think it is now a profitable crop. After the farmer has raised his flax, and even spun it into thread, he can buy his cotton thread cheaper than he can get his thread wove into linen. Flax is no greater exhausted of the soil than many other crops. He constantly looks for the greatest profit. Now, sir, it is said that if machinery shall be introduced, the profit will be got. It may be so; but how are we to get it ?a? There are many ways proposed for the encouragement of flax and hemp culture and manufacture. But there is only one way; that is, to impose duties on the importation of flax. That is at the root of the matter: do that, and you will soon have a supply even for exportation. Chairman am for encouraging every profitable operation. To doubt exists as to the profit of raising flax on the rich lands of the i west. Mr. Wakemanwith flax at 9 cents a pound, why cannot we manufacture linen ?a? Linen keeps up in price, while cotton fabrics have fallen 75 per cent. Before long, probably, we shall prepare flax for 1 cent instead of 3 cents a pound, and improve in machinery. We ought not, at all events, to depend on foreign nations for that, or for any other necessary of 7 28 life. Theft is no land in Our rope equal to ours for the production of flax and hemp, viz: the rich alluvial soil of the wepcid127t. :or. Underhillwe have much to do if we ,undertake, to supply upon domestic wants, for we import now some n millions. We now use cotton thread. The linen thread is much the best and strongest, and we cannot do without linen towels. Mr. Fleet. -he have :had specimens of manufacture linen from the household of Dr. Ri spell, of Ulster county. He does it all in the old way, and the articles are very excellent. 1 agree that flax is peculiarly adapted to the rich soils of the western country.  Judge An Wyckflax is now admitted free. For. Abbott n I re land they pull flax after the leaves begin to turn yellow at the bottom of the stem, and after the flower is off, but before the seed has been f matured. Mr. Willings, of Missouri, was requested by the chairman to state his process of flax trotting and dressing, and proceeded to state that for about three years past he has devoted himself to trials, and that his process differs very materially from the old methods. 1 pull or cut the flax green. We cut it now, having a proper cradle to do it with; a man cuts an acre in a day, I dry it in the shade. I rot it in water at 90 degrees of heat. The acetousfermentation takes place, and in three days it is rotted. I put it then in close rooms- heated until it is dry. It was said formerly that our flax was inferior to British, Belgian or French; but when our flax is treated as I have stated, it is a superior article to any of them n. I sow three bushels of seed per acre, instead of the old fashioned one bushel. Chairman n Lamb ray I remarked that they always put ou it their cambric in the night time always avoiding exposure to the sun; thus, as they said, preserving its fine appearance. From the Cultivator. Barley And Flax Grown Together. An experiment has been tried the past summer by some gentlemen of this town in raising barley and flax .together, and has been attended with success, as appears by the following statements of Colonel Stibbins. He prepared an acre of ground for barley: after sowing two bushels on the ground, he then sowed one bushel of flax seed on the same acre. In the fall he threshed the barley and flax out together with a machine, (it was cut and secured together) and on cleaning it up he had 30 bushels of barley and 15 bushels of flax seed. The sale of the crop stands thus . Thirty bushels of barley, at 50 cents per bushel -a-                                                               $15.00Fifteen bushels of flax seed, at                                                         $1 per bushel .a: 15 ~a. 30 00 Colonel S. says the flax seed was a clear net profit, as he thinks the ground produced as much barley as if no flax had been sown; for he had sowed barley on a few acres adjoining this acre, which produced only 30 bushels to the acre, and the land equally as good. ,i. Of. I. Earlvi Lle, New Work f 1846. 29 r. -a: to te American A gricultarist. Cutjlture Of Flax . The following directions for the culture and proper management of the flax crop were compiled by the ,committee of the Society for the Promotion and Growth of Flax in I re land. They :have been carefully arranged from the mass of information obtained, by the society and their .agriculturists, during their four years' experience in; the improved by stern of i management. By this. system, I wish flax has been produced which brought, in some cases, the high prices of .90 to 140 (a,              $450 to .      $700) per to ri. Messrs. Abrahambell and On, extensive shipping; merchants of this city, have deemed them of so much importance that they have had them extensively published, and we transfer the same to our columns, esteeming it the most valuable article we have ever met; on the subject. If the flax trotting and dressing machines spoken of in, page 331 of this ,number perform, all that. is anticipated, the united States will be able to grow large quantities of it i for the foreign market, which will be adding another important item to our agricultural exports, and greatly increase the wealth of the farming population. Formerly, considerable quantities of flax were i grown in this State and New1england; but since the introduction of cheap cotton fabrics as a substitute for linen, its culture; has been almost entirely neglected. It is still grown extensively in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and parts of Kentucky. Soil and rotation By attention, and careful cultivation, good flax maybe grown on various soils; but some .are much , better adapted for it than others. The best is a sound, dry, deep loam, with a clay sub soil. 'I t his very desirable that the land should be properly drained and sub soiled, as, when it is saturated i with either underground or surface water, good" flax cannot be expected.  Without method, there cannot be success; different soils require a difference of rotation. In the best soils of Glanders flax is grown in the third year of a seven course, rotation, or the fifth of a ten course rotation , I tis not considered, generally, advisable to grow flax more frequently i than once in ten years. In Belgium, it invariably follows a corn cropgetierally oats and in this country, where oats :is such a principal crop, the same system might be profit ably pursued; but it must be understood that it is only after oats following a green crop or old lea, and never after two or three succeeding crops of oats, which bad practice still prevails in some districts. It is a very general error among farmers to; consider it necessary that flax should follow a <a name="potato1037"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop. Except on very poor soils, a better crop will be produced after grain, and the double benefit of the grain and flax secured. ll fold lea be broken up, and <a name="potatoes1449"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> planted, a very fine crop of flax may be obtained in the following year. :rotation of cqopsforflaxThe following rotation, which would bring flax once in ten years, has been proposed: First year, <a name="potatoes1450"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>; second, barley, laid down with grasses; third year, cut for soiling o; fourth year, past are ; fifth year, flax; ;or the one half might be better in flax, the other in oats so that, with the return of the rotation, which would be in five years, the flax could be put on the ground which, in the last rotary course, was under corn, throwing a range of ten years between the flax crops coming into the same ground. -A gentleman of much practical, knowledge recommends the, following as being g the .most profitable: l.

Barley, sown with rye grass and c lover. 11. Lover and hay. 12. Grazing. 13. Oats. Preparation of the soil One of the points of the greatest importance in the culture of flax is by thorough draining, and by careful and repeated cleansing of the land from weeds, to render it of the finest, deepest, and cleanest nature. This will make room for the roots to penetrate, which they will often do to a depth equal to one half the length of the stem above ground. After wheat, one sloughing may be sufficient on light friable loam, but two are better; and on stiff soils, three are advisable-one in autumn, and two in spring, so as to be ready for sowing in the first or second week of April. Such will, of course, depend on the nature of the soil, and the knowledge and experience of the farmer. The land should be so drained and sub soiled that it can be sown in flats, which will give more even and much better crops. But, until the system of thorough draining be general, it will be necessary, after oats, to plough early in autumn. Throw the land into ridges, that it may receive the frost and air; and make surface drains, to carry off the rains of winter. Slough and harrow very early in spring and again a month after, to bring the land into good tilt h, and clean it thoroughly from weeds and roots. Following the last narrowing, it is necessary to roll, to give an even surface, and consolidate the land, breaking this up again with a short toothed or seed harrow, ere sowing. Sowingthe seed best- adapted for the general it y of soils is Fig a, although Dutch has been used in many districts of country for a series of years, with perfect success. American seed does not generally suit well, as it is apt to produce a coarse, branch y stem. If used, it should only be on deep, loam y soils. Select plump, shining, heavy seed, of the be strands, from a respectable merchant. Lift it clear of all the <a name="seeds103"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of weeds, which will save a great deal of after trouble, when the crop is growing. This may be done by manners, and through a wire si eve, twelve bars to the inch. Some saved seed, grown from foreign, has been used in many cases with success. It is suggested that n small portion of the crop may be allowed to stand until the seed be fully ripe, and then pulled, and the seed preserved for sowing; but the seed saved from it in the following year should only be used for feeding, or sold for the oil mills. The proportion of seed may be stated at three and half imperial bushels to the I wish or plantation acre; and so on, in proportion, to the Scotch or Running ham, and the English or statute measure. It is better to sow too thick than tooth in; as, with thick sowing, the stem grows tall and straight, with only one or two seed capsules at the top, and the fibre is found greatly superior in fine ness and length to that produced from thin sewn flax, which grows coarse, and branches out, producing much seed but a very inferior quality of fibre. The ground being pulverized and well cleaned, roll and sow. After sowing, cover it with a seed harrow, going twice over it once up and down, and once across or angle wise; as this makes it more equally spread, and avoids the small drills made by the teeth of the harrow. Finish with the roller, which will leave the seed covered about an inch, the proper depth. The ridges should be very little raised in the centre, when the
31iground is ready for the seed, otherwise the crop will not ripe n evenly; and when land is properly drained, there should be no ridges. The sowing of c lover and grass <a name="seeds104"><mark>seeds</mark></a> along with the flax is not advised, when it can be conveniently avoided; as these plants always injure the root ends of the flax. But carrots may be sown in suitable soils in drills, so that the person pulling the flax may step over the rows, which may be afterwards hoeddandcleaned, and should have some liquid manure. A stolen crop of rape or winter ve aches may be taken after the flax. Rolling the ground after sowing is very advisable, care being taken not to roll when the ground is so wet that the earth adheres to the roller. Feeding f care has been paid to cleaning the seed and the soil, few weeds will appear; but if there be any, they must be carefully pulled. I tis done in Belgium by women and children, who, with coarse cloths round their knees, creep on all-fours. This injures the young plant less than walking over it; which, if done, should be by persons whose shoes are not filled with nails. They should work also facing the wind, so that the plants laid flat by the pressure may be blown up again. or thus be assisted to regain their upright position. The tender plant pressed one way soon recovers; but if twisted or flattened by careless weepers, it seldom rises again. Pullingthe time when flax should be pulled, is a point of much nice ty to determine. The fibre is in the best state before the seed is quite ripe. If pulled too soon, although the fibre is fine, the great waste ;inscutching and hacking renders it unprofitable; and, if pulled too late, the additional yield does not compensate for the coarseness of the fibre. It maybe stated that the best time for pulling is when the <a name="seeds105"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are beginning to change from a green to a pale brown color, and the stalk to become yellow, for about two thirds of its height from the ground. When any of the crop is lying, and suffering from wet, it should be pulled as soon as possible, and kept by itself. To long as the ground is un drained, and imperfectly leveled before sowing, the flax will be found of different lengths. In such case, pull each length separately, and steep in separate pools, or keep it separate in the same pool. If the ground has been thorough drained, and laid out evenly, the flax will be all of the same length. It is most essential to take time and care to keep the flax even, like a brush, at the root ends. His increases the value to the sinner, and of course to the grower, who will be amply repaid by an additional price for his extra trouble. Met the handful of pulled flax be laid across each other diagonal ly, to be ready for the Rippling- Which should be carried on at the same time, and in the same field, with the pulling. If the only advantage to be derived from rippling was the comparative ease with which crippled flax is handled, the practice ought always to be adopted. But besides this, the seed is a most valuable part of the crop, being worth, if sold for the oil mill, 3 per acre and if used for the feeding of stock of all kinds, 4 per acre. The apparatus is very simple. The cripple consists of a row of iron teeth screwed into a block of wood. This can be procured in Belfast, or may be made by any handy blacksmith. It is to be taken to the field where the flax is being pulled, and screwed down to the centre of a nine feet plank, resting on twoSThe best nipples are made of half inch square rods of iron, placed with the angles of iron next the nipples; three-sixteenths of an inch asunder at the bottom, half inch at the top, and eighteen inches long, to allow a sufficient spring, and save much breaking of flax 732 Act.

If the weather be dry, the balls should be kept in the field, spread on win now cloths, or other contrivance for drying and if turned from time to time, they will win. Passing the balls first through a coarse riddle, and afterwards through manners, to remove straw sand leaves, will facilitate the drying.

S, Waterihgthis process requires the greatest care and attention. River water is the best. If spring water has to be used let the pond be filled sore weeks, or months if possible, before the flax is piti in ta, the sun a d air may soften the water.  That containing iron, or other mineral substances, should never be used. If river water can be had, it need hot be let into the paid sooner than the day before the flax is to be stepped. Place the flax in the pool in, one layer, Somewhat sloped, and in regular rows, with the rdotenduppermost. Over with moss sons, or tough old lea sons, laid perfectly close, the sheer of each fitted to the other- Define putting on the sons, a layer of rushes or rag weeds is recommended to be placed on the flax, especially inner ponds. Thus covered, it lever sides to the bottom, nor is it affected i by a it or light. A small stream of water all bed to run through a pool has been found to improve its color. It will be sufficiently stepped, n an average time, from eight to fourteen days, according too he heat of tie weather and the nature: of the water. Very 'grower should learntto
33know when the flax has had enough of the walter, as a few hours too much may injure it. It is, however, much more frequently under watered thanaoverwatered. The best test is the following: Cry some s talks of average thickness, by breaking the shove, or wood y part, in two places, about is ix or eight inches apart, at the middle of the stalk ; catch the broken bit of wood and if it will pull freely out, downward, for that length, without breaking or tearing the fibre, with none of the fibre adhering to it, it is ready to take out. Take this trial every six hours, after ferment at ion subsides, for sometimes the change is rapid. Never lift the flax roughly from the pool with forks or grapes, but have, it carefully handed out on the bank by men standing in the water.  Spread on the same day it is taken out, unless it be raining heavily; light rain does little harm. If it cannot be spread, let it be set on an end, or separated into small parcels, to prevent it heating in the heap. It is advantageous to let the flax drain for a few hours after being taken from the pool, by placing the bundles on their ends, close together, or on the flat, with a slope. Spreadingselect, when possible, clean, short, thick pasture ground for this operation ; and now down and remove any weeds that rise above the surface of the s ward. May the flax evenly on the grass, and spread thin and very equally. If the directions under the head of rippling have been attended to, the handfuls will come readily asunder, without entangling. 'turn it two or three times while on the grass (with a rod about eight feet in length, and an inch and a half in diameter) that it may not become of different shades by the unequal action of the sun, which is often the case through inattention to this point. Turn it when there is a prospect of rain, that the flax may be beaten down a little, and thus prevented from being blown away. Ylitinga good test of its being ready to lift, is, to rub a few s talks, from the top to the bottom; and, when the wood breaks easily and separates from the fibre, leaving it sound, it has had enough of the grass; also, when one stalk in fifty is perceived to form a bow z and string, from the fibre contracting and separating from the wood y stalk. But the most certain way is to prove a small quantity with the hand break, or in a flax mill. In lifting, keep the lengths straight and the ends even, otherwise great loss will occur in the rolling and s catching. Lie it up in small bundles. and if n at taken soon to be stitched, it will be much improved by being put up in small stacks, loosely built with stones or brambles ,in the bottom, to keep. it dry, and allow a free. circulation of air. Stacks built on pillars would be the best. Trying -by fire, is always pernicious. If properly stepped and grassed, no such drying is necessary; but to make it ready for breaking and s catching, exposure to the sun is sufficient. In some districts, it is put to dry on silas in a damp state, and is absolutely burnt be lore it is dry, and the rich i oily property of the flax is always greatly. impaired, In, this point the society can scarcely speak too strongly, as the flax is either destroyed or rendered not worth one half of what it would be, if properly dried. Breaking, or scutchingIf done by hand, should be done on the Belgian system, which is less wasteful than that practised in I re land. If by filling, the farmer will do well to select those. mills in which the improved machinery has been introduced. The society would also recommend that the farmer should endeavor to have his flax s clutched by a mill owner who pays his men by the day, and not by the stone, even if it should cost 7 34 him higher in proportion, the system .of paying the s butchers by the stone rendering them more anxious to do a large quantity in the day, than to produce a good yield from the straw. The Courtrai system his is the universal mode in the district from which the finest flax we receive is brought. As soon as pulled, the flax is stooped without binding it. The handfuls are set up, resting against each other, the root ends spread out, and the top ends joining like the letter A, forming stooping about eight feet long, and a short strap keeping the ends firm. In this way it will resist wind and rain well, and dry fast. In six or eight days it may be stacked in the field ; the seed to be taken off at leisure, in winter; the flax to be stepped the following May a system which possesses the advantages of affording the farmer the best season of the year for sleeping and grassing, and a time of comparative leisure, when his attention is not called to the harvesting of other important crops. It has, in many cases, when tried in this country, proved highly successful; although in others it has failed, from want of experience, perhaps, in watering and grassing it. The treatment in this way has made the flax, in some cases, worth two or three shillings per stone more than part of the same crop stepped green. It is recommended that trials of this system should be made, in the first instance, on a small scale. To avoid exhausting the land by growing flax t has always been urged against flax culture that it exhausted the soil; but this is not necessarily the case. If the seed be saved, and cattle fed upon the balls, a valuable addition will be made to the manure heap, as perhaps the richest manure is produced by this kind of food. The put re scent water from the flax pools should be carefully preserved, and either used as a top dressing for grass, or mixed with the weeds and other refuse of the crop, in a heap, to ferment. By these means almost all the matter abstracted from the soil by the flax crop would be returned in the shape of manure the fibre being supplied by the atmosphere alone.

One of my dressing machines, with seven men, will dress in one day six hundred pounds of flax; and so much less tow is made by it, that it saves twenty per cent. of the flax by my operation. And the same process answers for hemp. Flax, when rotted in water heated to ninety degrees of Fahrenheit, is done in three or four days. In raising flax, a part of afield should be sowed thin for the seed. Common Flemish and French dressed flax imported into England for forty years past brings them from four to eight hundred dollars a ton. This difference of value is owing to the difference of qualities, which are as sorted. Mr. Wakemancan flax and hemp be grown for a series of years on the same ground ; or is rotation necessary ?or. Willings 1 have known hemp grown on the same field perfectly well for twenty years in succession. The hemp crop is from seven hundred to nine hundred pounds an acre. I add lime to land for flax crop, but not for hemp. When flax is not allowed to go to seed, it does not exhaust the soil one half as much. It exhausts about as much as the wheat crop. Your corn and wheat in Missouri certainly exhaust our soil. We have already found the necessity of deep sloughing and sub soiling the land. I tis better and cheaper, by four to one, to cradle flax, than to pull it by hand in the old way. We do not consider the rotating and dressing flax an unhealthy business. Drunderhill, of Trot on Joint t is exceedingly important to establish the culture and manufacture of flax in our country. For the last twenty five years I re land has used the water rotating process: they pulled their flare 36 before it went to seed. They have depended on the Lifted States, for their seed for the i last half, century. :he supplied almost all their f la- seed for sowing. Dewrotting is apt to weaken the fibre and render it less fineoThey used to puts their flax in s tilt water i where it rotted in from sevdnnteento thirty days. Dewrotting requires o some three months. Some lay the flax on the snow, and 10 t it rein ain until spring: a very bad plan. The flax is liable to great, damage from cattle getting among it it is very unequally rotted, and liable to become dirty ;it loses its softness and fine ness of fibre, The operation of crawling flax is an important one: you get rid of the roots of the plant, which are injurious in the dressing of the flax. ;I believe it would be profitable to raise flax, cut it in blossom, and water root it on the farm, at least' until Willingss new plan can be found convenient to the farmer. Cotton is now whitening the ocean in the form of sails. Cotton is displacing linen in many ways. Our country is fast being filled with people: we must have profitable employment for all hands. We have climates for tea, coffee, grapes, plan pains, bananas, dams, and every good thing, independent of the whole world.

The following extract from the letter of a gentleman in the county of Merry will prove interesting: "I am happy to be able to bear my testimony to the fact, that if flax be judiciously grown, and well handled, there is no other crop that will pay like it. I had last season not quite 8 I wish acres of flax, from which I had 295 stones, which brought 8s. per stone in Looks town market, and 31 stones at is, besides 4 c cut. of s catching tow, at is. per wet 295 stones, at 8s. -118 0 03 1 stones, at is. -9 6 0 41 cut. tow, at is. -2 0 6 129 6 6 being upwards of 16 per acre.

The flax seed saved on the Courtrai system turned out exceedingly well ; and my steward showed some of the seed tour. Macadam, of One gall street, Belfast, who said that he thought it finer than any Fig a seed he had seen last season. I may add, that the flax fro mot r own seed looks to the full, better than that growing fromRiga seed. We used but the two or. Veins remarked, that the ingenious men of France and England had long been trying to make machinery to spin flax with the same facility as cotton ; the the French chemists had carefully examined the fibres of flax, and discovered that the whole length of the flax is composed of delicate fibres, about three inches long, which, by means of chemical agents not injurious to that fibre, could separate it, and thus rendering it in staple nearly like cotton, and prepare it for the spinning machinery. When that can be accomplished with such economy that its price can be, as low, or nearly so, as cotton cloth, there could be no doubt that for sheets, shirts, toweling, &c, mankind will far prefer the fabric of linen to that of cotton, and we would earnestly commend to the genius of our countrymen the invention of such process as can bring out that very valuable result; for in addition to the very well known preference for linen for many purposes, it is certain that flax grows well in vast portions of the globe where cotton cannot mature, for lack of heat, &c. Mr. Chapinon this subject I remark that the Chinese possess a grass called Chinese flax, which, from samples recently examined, appears to possess all the qualities of our flax, but in a higher degree, superior to any flax known or manufactured in England. This, excellence consists in greater strength of fibre and fine ness of staple, and length of staple also, Samples have been shown of fine linen manufactured from it, greatly re, s ambling the French cambric, but having moreover a silk y appearance. If seems also that this grass can be obtained in unlimited quantities. If these are facts, (and it would seem that they are) it becomes an object of the greatest importance to our countrymen, as well as to Europe4773
. From a letter of Has. L. Fleischmann Esq, published in the Washington "union" March 5, -a: .1846. ;a: Austri Of Of   Nen Manufactures, &c, we his branch of Austrian national industry is the oldest and one of the most important; but since cotton goods are coming daily more in use, it is declining in the same ratio as the cotton manufactures increase: it still, however, furnishes a greater number of pieces of various kinds, as well as all the other branches of a similar nature. It is highly important for Austria that this branch of industry should rise again to its former importance, as it produces the raw material within its own territories, and especially in those regions where corn is an uncertain crop, and whereby the population obtain the means of procuring food and employment during the long winter season. The yearly average crop is computed, according to official data, to amount to 1,500,000 cut. of flax, and 1,000,000 cut. of hemp. The best flax is raised in Bohemia, Dora via, and Silesian; but its quality is not equal to that of Belgium. The farmer has not the proper knowledge of its culture, and less of the necessary manipulation in its preparation for the use of the sinner. The flax is generally prepared by dew rot; and, from the following statement, the difference of quality between Austrian and Belgian flax (water rotted) can be appreciated: 1 cut. of Austrian flax, when prepared, yields 20 pounds of refuse, 50 pounds of tow, and only 304 pounds of flax ; whereas Belgian flax gives 5 per cent. refuse, 20 per cent of tow, and 75 per cent. of flax. The yarn is almost all spun by hand. Austria has only eight flax spinning factories, which have been in operation since 1835, and employ 20,800'spindles; England has now 700,000 spindles; France, 70,000; Belgium60000; the countries in the (er man league, 30,000. Ll tax spinning by means of machinery has been brought in England like all other mechanical contrivances) to great perfection; and from thence Austria has procured her machines. The amount of capital required for such a factory is nearly eight times higher than for a cotton factory, on account of the complicated machines required for spinning flax. A spindle is estimated at 80 to 100 florids, inclusive of building and other necessary apparatus; a cotton factory at 12 florids. Leaving is also generally done by hand. The number of looms engaged in this branch amounts to 300,000, which occupy 500,000 weavers during the greater part of the year; about 12 spinners are necessary to supply a loom with yarn, which occupies about three and a half millions of persons in the linen business, or one tenth of the whole population. The above stated number of looms produce yearly 4,600,000 pieces of linen, of 30 cells (yards) each, valued at 27,000,000 florids. The following table shows the import and export of flax and linen in the, year 1841. I imported. Exported. Flax -15 056 cut. 25,199 cut.

Appendi X No. 1. From the Albany Ciltivator. Tobacco. Messrs. Gaylord & Tucker: We grow in this town annually about three hundred tons of tobacco, and in the valley of the Connecticut about five hundred tons are grown annually. The yield the last yer (1843) was less than usual, fifteen hundred pounds being about the average per acre. The price of tobacco the last season, of a fair growth, was seven cents a pound, and most of the crop was sold before housed .and cured. We have two varieties of the weed, the broad leaf and the narrow leaf the latter is about two weeks the earliest. It seems our tobacco is of a peculiar species, or our soil and climate are peculiarly adapted for the production of a superior article. The soil that produces our best tobacco is a light sandy loam. We prepare our beds for the seed as early in April as possible select the richest or best land in the garden or on the farm, moist but not wet manure and prepare it as we do for the cultivation of cabbage or any delicate plant fortransplantingpulverize and make the bed as fine and smooth as possible then sow the seed broadcast, about as thick as we do cabbage seed ; then roll or tread down the bed thoroughly, that the seed may be pressed into the soil. The bed is kept clean of weeds. In a common season the plants will be large enough for transplanting by the 10th of June. The land fort re crop should be well manured, and ploughed at least twice before the time of transplanting, and harrowed and rolled, or rushed, and left as smooth as possible. We mark the rows three feet apart and straight on the rows we make small hills for the reception of the plants, two feet to two feet six inches apart. We have our land all prepared by the time the plants are large enough for transplanting. If raining at the time, we take the advantage of it and get all our plants out; if not, we set and water. After this, the field is examined several times, and where plants are dry, or injured by worms, others are set in. As soon as they stand well, they are carefully hold and vacant places filled with new plants; after this the cultivate or is used between the rows and the crop kept clean with the he. The plants are frequently and thoroughly examined for the tobacco worms, and they must be destroyed; if not, the crop is sure to be. When in blossom, and before the formation of seed, it is topped about thirty-two inches from the ground, leaving from sixteen to twenty leaves on each stalk. After this the suckeds at each leaf are broken off, and the plants kept clean till cut. When ripe, the time of cutting, the leaf is spotted, thick, and wilt crack when pressed between thumb and finger. It is cut any time in the day after the dew is off, left in the row till wilted, then turned ; and if there is a hot sun, it is often turned to prevent burning ; after wilted it is put into small heaps of six or eight plants, then carted to the tobacco sheds for hanging. We usually use poles or rails about twelve feet long ; hang, with t wine, about forty plants on each rail twenty each side by crossing thetwvine from the plants one side to the plants the other, the rails about
41twelve inches apart. It hangs from six to ten weeks to get perfectly i cured, which is known by the stem of the leaf being thoroughly dried.  I tis then, in a damp time, when the leaves will not c rumble, taken from the poles and placed in large piles by letting the tops of the plants lap each other, leaving the butts of the plants out. It remains in these heaps front three to ten days before it is stripped, depending on the state of the weather, but must not be allowed to heat. When stripped, it is made into small hands; the small and broken leaves should be kept by themselves. :it is then, by the purchaser, packed in boxes of about four hundred pounds, and marked seed leaf tobacco. The most of our last crop has been :shipped torBremen< I think we can cultivate one acre of tobacco with the same labor and expense that we can two acres of corn, that produce sixty bushels to the acre and the manure required is about the same as for the corn crop, and I do not think it exhausts the land as much as the corn cry, for i it is not allowed to seedHENRY Watson. East Of Ndsor, January 22, 1844. Prospect Of Of, April 26, 1844. Dear Of  R: Your favor of the 26th of March was duly received, and would have been sooner answered, but that I desired to obtain some information on the subject of your inquiry, from some of my friends in the tobacco growing region of Mason county. I had occasion to take a ride a through that part of the county two days since, and met with some intelligent tobacco growers, with whom I conversed freely on the subject. I was formerly engaged in the tobacco culture, but have for number of years discontinued its culture; and was, therefore, desirous of availing myself of any late improvements which might have been made. For the general mode of treating the tobacco crop, from the sowing of the seed till it is prepared for p rising, I refer you to my essay on that subject, published in the Kentucky Farmer in March, 141, and which will be re published in a volume of agricultural essays, now in press, and which will be ready for delivery in about two months, a copy of which I will do myself the pleasure of sending you. In this letter I shall attempt to give you such additional information as may be useful in producing the fine tobacco cultivated for cigar trappers 1. With respect to the kinds of tobacco cultivated for the above purpose. There are the Summer ville and light Curly ; some prefer the former, and some the latter. I do not understand that either has a decided preference As to the soil suitable for its growth. Line tobacco is found to succeed best on light rich soil, having a portion of sand mixed with it. New or fresh land is better than old; and pretty steep hillsides, provided they are light and rich, are better adapted to producing fine tobacco than level land. Hillsides, facing the Ohio river, and the numerous small branches emptying into it, when the land is nearly cleared, and sufficiently rich, are well- adapted to produce fine tobacco. I have seen these in cultivation, having an elevation of from twenty to thirty degrees. But level lands, or 742 those nearly so, if new, and especially if the soil have a mixture of sand, are also well adapted to produce fine cigar tobacco 3. As to the mode of cultivation. This, perhaps, is the most important point in producing fine cigar tobacco. The ground should be well prepared, and rendered as light and as finely pulverized as possible. In laying off for planting, I would advise the use of a single horse plough, throwing g the ground into ridges three and a half feet from centre to centre, and then crossing at right angles, with single furrows, at the distance of two feet from centre to centre, and make the hills, so as to be as near a true line as i possible, three feet and a half from centre to centre one way, and two the other. I recommend the use of a one horse plough in laying off, because in this way the ridges will be but little trodden down, and the ground will be left in a light condition. The difference in the width of the rows is to facilitate the working of the tobacco after it attains some size: Close planting is found to be essentially necessary in raising fine tobacco. I no the above mode of planting, each plant occupies seven square feet; and six thousand two hundred and twenty-three plants will stand upon an acre, if ri one be missing; and, allowing four plants to make a pound, the yield will be one thousand five hundred and fifty-five pounds per acre. I have heard of instances in which the product has been at the rate of a pound for three plants, or more than two thousand pounds per acre. But to produce this extraordinary crop, the season must be very favorable, and everything be managed in the most particular and skilful manner i To make fine tobacco, it is very important to plant early, so that the tobacco may be cured at that season of the year when the weather is warm and dry. To this end, plant beds should be sown very early and in situations where they have a good south eastern exposure. They should be lightly covered with brush to keep them moist until the plants get up, and a little while longer if there is danger of hard frosts. New ground is best for i plant beds. The hills for planting should be made as recently before the plants are ready as possible. These may be set out when very small, if the operation be skillfully managed, and thus the crop will be brought forward in good time. The plants should be topped to about sixteen leaves, exclusive of the ground leaves, which should be broken off. The top leaves will, of course, i not make fine tobacco, and must be separated when stripping g but; high stopping is important to improve the quality of the first tenor twelve leaves on each plant. Of  t is the practice in Mason to cure tobacco without firing, except in damp rainy, weather, when fire is applied to guard against what is called house burning, the danger of which is always increased in rainy weather, especially where tobacco is hung close. The almost universal mode of building tobacco houses in Mason is, to erect a four -qu are pen of logs, hewed or round, with large open spaces between them, and then to construct a shed all around, about twelve feet wide, by planting posts in the ground locus if to be had) and ship tapping scant long on these, at proper distances, from which poles are extended to the cracks of the log pen. Theshedshould be planked up and down to protect the tobacco from the weather. For the benefit of air, small interstices may be left between the planks, and it would be advantageous to have some broad planks, hung on hinges, on every side of the shed, which might be opened in dry weather for the purpose of ventilation. It is now too late to sow tobacco seed, but, if you wish it, I Will procure and send you some in time for next year
43I have given, in answer to your inquiry, what seemed to me to be ne ces, say. if you wish further information on any particular points, it will, afford me pleasure, at all times, to comply with your wishes. Hours, cordially and sincerely, A. Beatty. To, George W. Wei Ssi  Nger, Esq. From the Floridian. Mode Of Culti   Vati   Of Tobacco In The I Sland Of Cuba. Your nur series are the first to be attended to, in your preparation for a crop, by selecting, at the proper season, a rich and tolerably moist piece of new ground, and prepare it by burning it off very clean, and breaking it up. 'he seed then is to be sown broadcast upon it, and when they are up they are to be overlooked daily, to see that the cut worm does not commit ravages among the young plants; and as fast as the plants arrive at a proper size, they are to be transferred to the tobacco field, to make room for the smaller plants of the nursery. As casualties frequently arise to destroy some of the nur series, it is necessary to guard against a probability of not having a sufficient number of plants, by making three or four nur series, at an interval of one or two weeks each. Such attention should be observed to- keep both your nur series and fields very clean, particularly of grass, and for; that reason new lands are preferred for both. In Cuba they plant on at, even surface, and disturb it as little as possible with the he, only picking out the grass or weeds which spring up. The plants, when transferred to the field, are to be planted in squares, at about from two to three feet apart, according to the, strength of the land. 'the high lands in Cuba are such as produce the quality of tobacco, both as to strength and color, that suicid127the American market best, and such lands correspond nearest to our highhammocks. The greatest enemy to the plants, both in the nursery and in the fields, (while small) is the cut worm, which has to be looked after early every morning ; and wherever they have eaten the plants, they are to be found and killed, either on the plant or on the ground near it. When the plants get to be larger: then the large green tobacco worm is to be constantly guarded again at, and the suckeds also continually broken off as fast as they appear; and when the tobacco is judged to be off a sufficient height, it is to be lopped and allowed to mature for cutting. The time of maturity is ascertained .by the leaves changing gradually their color, beginning at the bottom leaves, from their deep green growing color, to a yellowish green ;but if this is not sufficiently obvious, and you deem your tobacco ripe, you may :test it by crushing together the tip of any of the upper leaves, which, if is caps, isa sign of its being ripe; but, on the contrary, if it does not snap, it is not fully matured. The ni ripe for the knife, it is cut down near the ground, leaving two suckeds, which have been spared a week or two prior, ready to grow up and produce a second crop; and also a third. crop may be realized in the same manner. The tobacco is to be conveyed carefully, in wide things of cow hide, to the house, to be hung up a shed is preferred, with free space for ventilation beneath; and after tying the plants together, two to each string, and leaving space enough betweepcid127them to a insert a wooden peg, you hang them, up by intruding them above eacN744 or after up to the ridge of the house, being careful not to hang them so near that they will touch or crowd each other in drying, or your tobacco will mould. Also, when the weather is moist, you must make small fires enough under it to keep out the moisture, but not enough to heat your tobacco. When the leaves are perfectly dry, the whole are to be taken down and placed in a press for a few hours, the object of which is, if the tobacco is too dry to strip off without breaking the leaves, that they may become soft and pliable ; but great care must be taken that it does not heat; and it must be strictly examined, by inserting the hand, to ascertain that it becomes not too hot. The press is made by putting rails or poles cross wise of each other, in form of a rack, and placing cow hides under, over, and around the tobacco, and placing upon it something somewhat weighty. It is then to be stripped leaf by leaf from the stock, and, being selected, the trappers from the fillers, to be tied at the butts and prepared for market. It is sometimes usual to put it again to press after being stripped. From the American Agriculturists. Culture Of Tobacco. The growing of tobacco is becoming an important business in the valley of the Connecticut, and yields a better return to the farmer on rich i land than almost any other crop. This crop was greatly increased the last season, and I think I do not exaggerate when I estimate the amount grown in the towns bordering on the Connecticut, between Hartford andNorthampton, from 1,500 to 2,000 tons. The price the last season, for large growth, and in good condition, was eight cents per pound. We have two varieties the narrow and- the broad leaf. The latter is the most productive, and sells in market much more readily than the former. Soil, preparation, and sowing he select for our tobacco plants a rich, moist (but not wet) spot, and sow the seed as early in April as the ground can be prepared for it. Our beds are well manured, made mellow and fine, and the seed should be sowed at the rate of one table spoonfuls to the square rod, before the earth gets dry; after this it is raked, so that the dirt may stick close to the seed. It should not be covered, but let a man go on and tread the surface of the bed as hard as possible. The bed must be kept free from weeds. The plants should get leaves two or three inches long before being transplanted. They grow faster in the beds at first than in the field, and are less exposed to the cut worm. Transplantingwe commence transplanting the fore part of June, and often set out the plants as late as the 20th or 25th. The ground should be made mellow and level. The broad leaf plants should be set in the rows-two and a half feet distant from each other, and the rows be three feet four inches apart. If it rains at the time of setting, we take advantage of it, and get out as many as possible. If not, we make the hills, and pour into each about half a pint of water, and follow immediately after and set the plants. They will live as well, set in this way, in sunshine as in the rain. The ground should be looked over two or three times afterwards, and re set the vacant plantsAftercultureAs soon as the plants are well growing, we go through with the cultivate or, and again fill up the vacant places. The crop
45should be hold three or four times without hilling the plants. When the green worms appear, they must be watched and killed, or they will in a great measure destroy the crop. Toppingcommence stopping the tobacco when it is in the bloom, and manage to top as much as possible the first time going over, that it may all risen at once. Leave about twenty leaves to the stalk, and make the field as even on the surface as possible, If you have late plants in consequence of re setting, break them low, and they will grow faster and ripe n sooner for it. The suckeds should all be broken off and the plants kept clear of needs till they are cut. Putting and curing he should never cut more than can be hung the same day and next morning, while the dew is on. After cutting, it should lie and wilt on one side, then turn it and wilt the other; then thrown it into heaps of six or eight plants each, and let it lie till carted to the sheds, where it is hung with cotton t wine on poles twelve feet long, and about twenty plants on each side. It must hang till the stem of the leaf is thoroughly cured to the stalk. It is then taken down in a damp day to prevent the leaves from crumbling) and stripped and tied in three small hands, keeping the broken and poor leaves by themselves. It is then packed, and pressed hard with the hands, in a double row, with the butts out, and if not sufficiently cured in a few days, it must be shaken up and repacked, to prevent heating. When fit far market it is brought in large quantities and pressed in boxes containing about four hundred pounds each, and sent to the seaports and shipped to foreign countries. Value of poudretleI used one barrel of poudrette on my plants while on the bed, leaving a small piece without it. The effect was astonishing. The plants at the time of setting were twice as large where the poudrettewas used as where it was not, and they were not as much attacked by the worms, which is an important consideration. I set the last season about two and a half acres in tobacco, which produced 5,100 I is. I sold it for             $498. P.  South Hadley Falls, Mass, March 3, 1845. We had the pleasure of visiting our intelligent correspondent above, last year, and saw his tobacco crop growing. We recently met with an enterprising farmer from Windsor, who estimated the crop grown the past year in the valley of the Connecticut and its vicinity at 5,000,000 lbs. Hesdaid he could ve t from 12 to 16 cents per lb. for his; and, although it was used for a different purpose, he did not know why it was not as good as the Cuba, which sells from 25 to 35 cents per lb. Crime tobacco land rents high at present in the valley of the Connecticut from                            $25 to               $50 per acre per annum. A rich, friable, loam y clay is considered the best soil for this crop, which must be highly manured, and deep and well worked. We think it ought to be sub soil ploughed, and that gun no as well as poudrette would be an excellent manure or it. The latter is the most lasting, and is said to keep off the fly. Coarse barn yard manure makes too rank a growth of stalk and leaf, and injures the quality o the tobacco whereaspoudrette, gun no, and other fine and highly concentrated manures, would add to its aromatic flavor. We should be glad to see carefully conducted746
experiments made the present season with these manures, on the tobacco crop. The different kinds might be tried side by side on separate rows, with a view of testing which was best for that particular locality and kind of soil. We should be pleased to learn whether the culture of the finest Cuba tobacco has ever been attempted in New England. This is frequently worth from 50 cents to                                                         $1 per l bed. Agriculturists. From the New York Farmer and Mechanics. As the growing of tobacco s receiving attention, and is raised to good profit, I must give you an estimate of the cost to raise one acre, made by myself, with the help of friend L.; and he should know, as he has several acres which average one ton per acre, and sells at Warehouse Joint for 8 cents per lb-                                                             $160 per ton. Mr. L. says one ton per acre is a good crop and probably more falls short than comes up to it. Now for the estimate Use of one acre of land, one year 10 carts of manure, at                          $2.50 -                            $25.00Carting and spreading -5 00 sloughing twice- -narrowing and marking -70 60 tobacco plants, sold at 50 centsHoldiig and setting plants -being four times -extra attendance to secure and kill worm stopping and securing -putting and hanging up to dry -stripping from stalk and packing went of shed to dry in -Freighting to Warehouse Pointonehalf is 15 00 15 003 00 -1 003 503 00 5 00 2 0 4 00 4 00 5 000 403 00 67 50 Now    $67.50 from                                                              $160 leaves a net profit of       $92.50 per acre. That crop other than tobacco would make so good return ?a? This is a fact worthy of consideration. From the Southern Planter. Tobacco Plants. Mr. W. W. Silver, of Albemarle, is so notorious for his uniform success in raising tobacco plants, that we were requested to obtain and publish his method of managing his beds. To an application to that effect, we have obtained the following answer: " Of Dear Of  R : My plan for raising tobacco plants is the result of careful observation and inquiry for twenty years. All planters of common intelligence are able to pick the best location on their estates for plants; most of them are aware that some moist and some dry land should be prepared. I burn half in situations where water may be carried round in ditches the balance on high gr our al. Early and hard burning all know to be best yet many persons put off the evil day, and scotch. The land should be
747made red hot if possible, for at least two inches. W(, frequently chop with a g rubbing hoes before b urging, regulating the depth according to the soil prepare the beds as soon as burnt ; sow half the seed the middle of February balance middle of March, on each bed; never put more than two thirds of a spoonfuls of seed to the one hundred square yards. Any beds have more good for nothing plants left, after their owner has failed to pitch, than would have planted double his crop. By sowing at the periods mentioned, we avoid usually the danger of having the young plants thrown lout by frost, and get as good roots as when sown in December or January. After the March sowing, cover the beds from one-eighth to one fourth inch thick with chaff which has been used for bedding in stalls for several months; put in at first six or eight inches, and keep the horses well littered with it; about February take it out, and put it in a pen well sheltered. First F March take it to some clean floor, and beat it fine with a flail, then sow, fifteenth March, from hampers. The stalls should be plastered at least once a week freely, (farm pens also) Over the beds with brush as usual. Icid127had this year a fine bed in an old field which had grown up, and never had more or better parts." The horses littered with chaff should be fed on corn and, fodder, or some food clear of grass seed. :the chaff manure is Dr. Wants idea, and      think it a long way ahead of gun no and everything else." We never move the wood. Turn out the bed at a single fire; put down large; pieces to keep the wood from the ground, &c. We W. Of M Ersfor the Southern Planterthe Spot In Tobacco. In. Edi Tor: If any among the many who write for the Planter have found any means to prevent the spot in tobacco, or to stop it after its appearance, you would I be doing us great service in this section of country to publish it in the Planter: Perhaps you have done it heretofore; if so, please give it another insertion for the benefit of your new subscribers: If the matter has not been discussed already, be so good as to call the attention of your contributory to it. We would like to find out pretty soon, as the season for, tobacco to spot is just at hand. Your attention to this matter will very much oblige: in our humble servant, Jesse J. Kelly. Granvi Lle County, N. C, July 31, 1845.,We have published many valuable communications on the subject of tobacco, but none have met with more general approbation than those from the pen of Mr. N. A. Enable. Upon this important subject of the rot, he says -j, Passing over the time of planting, priming, stopping, &c, on which our writers sufficiently explicit, we core to the casualties or diseases to which, the crop is subject. The first mentioned by our writer, and by far the most, serious, is the spy t or firing, or more properly the rot. This is caused by too much rain, and is more liable to occur on sandy soils, and less so on 7 48 those that are stiff, red, or thirsty. It is of much rarer occurrence of late years than it was formerly, which is a scribble, doubtless, to the improvements if i manage nice and cultivation which experience has suggested, The mode formerly practised was to cultivate the crop almost level, and to keep the soil between the hills loose and well broken; under' this mode of cultivation, immense losses were sustained almost yearly by fire. But by adopting just the reverse of this, by scraping up carefully with the he all the loose earth among the hills, as deep as the plough has gone, and throwing it on the hills, and leaving the ground among the hills as hard, if possible, as a path, the leaves of the plant, when it is large enough to take the rot, will shield the hill from the rain, and throw the water off on the hard ground, which soon runs off, and the crop is protected. A sufficient quantity of vegetable matter turned into the soil will also do much towards preventing this disease. This is proved by the well established fact, that the, first crop on a c lover and herds grass fallow, where the land is very sandy does not fire, whereas the second or third is almost certain to do so, unless some vegetable substance is turned into the soil; and hence such land (sandy loam, river i or creek flats) should not be cultivated two or three years in succession, let them be ever so rich, without applying some vegetable matter or other. These are matters of the greatest importance, for there is no disease more destructive to the tobacco crop than the one we are considering and I verily believe, if we could have cultivated our crop last :year in this way, as unfavorable as the season was, we should have escaped the disaster. But the summer was so unusually wet, we were unable to cultivate our crop in our usual way, and it is the first time we have suffered with the disease. I would not be understood to say that it can always be prevented, but I did believe that it can be generally done, and in the way I have above indicated. I will only add that 1 very much- question the propriety of ever sloughing the crop after the plants have got large enough to take the rot, on account of the loose earth that is thrcid127rwn up Upon these remarks of Mr. Enable appeared the following commentary, in the May number of the Planter for 1843. We should be pleased to hear the subject further discussed :MEssRs. Edi Tors I have been reading with much interest the several communications upon the cultivation of tobacco from the pen of Mr. N. A. Enable. I have been struck with some of his positions with regard to the mode of cultivation to prevent fire, (er rot, as he terms it) The cause to which he attributes it that is, too much rain think correct; but to prevent its ruinous consequences, I resort to precisely the opposite course, namely, sloughing deep and thoroughly, so as to admit the rapid absorption of the water, which by his mode will either be altogether prevented or effected only 'at the expense of a gully between each row, which must carry off all the strength of the manure deposited in the hill. If he will, on 1 the first indications of the spot in tobacco, run his counters deep and well, both ways, so as to break the ground thoroughly, disturbing the roots of the plant sufficiently to cause it to flop in the sun, he will, nine times out of ten, arrest it altogether, and greatly increase the product of the f crop. His never fail to do after the crop is nearly all topped, taking the heat of the day, and substituting a pair of light stretchers instead of the single tree. I have been able effectually to divest myself of that troublesome insect the
49cutworm, by letting my hogs run in the tobacco lots for a week or ten days previous to the last sloughing, before bedding or hilling; it will be found effectual in all cases, for I speak f roth experience. This being the first time I have taken pen in hand, 1 shall not touch on some other subjects relative to the tobacco crop until I see the fate of this, as I have no vanity to gratify only q wish l to be useful. Hours, A Planter. Nelson, April 7, 1843. For the Louisville Journal and Collar Farmer. Of The Tobacco Planters Of Kentucky And I Ndi Ana. The undersigned having closely observed the tobacco market in the city of Louisville for the last two years, and feeling an interest in the success of that industrious and enterprising portion of our citizens, the tobacco planters, would beg leave to make to them a few suggestions, which may possibly be of some service, if it is only by attracting their attention to the subject. There is a great amount of labor lost by half cultivation, half curing, rough handling, and general bad management of the tobacco crop, by a large portion of the planters. It is now pretty well ascertained that the crop of this year throughout the United States is much shorter than it has been for several years past: particularly in Virginia and Maryland, the crop is said to be short. The crop in Kentucky and In diana, though something smaller than usual, is of better quality. As the tobacco market in Louisville is each year increasing and growing in importance, we may expect many of the dealers in the article in the east to come west to make their purchases. Planters may expect very fair prices, provided they will be more careful in handling and putting up their crops. As the crop is now housed, I will speak of the manner of putting it up for market. 1st The entire crop should be divided into three qualities: the largest and finest leaves making the first quality; ;the shorter leaves, that are sound and clear of the ravages of worms, the second ; and .the ground leaves, or legs and worm eaten, the third quality. All of the first should be as near the same length as possible, and the same uniformity of length should characterize the second quality. If one portion of the crop is coarse, heavy leaf, and the other fine and light, they should be divided and put up accordingly, because th e planter often loses much by mixing the cigar leaf with the heavy coarse leaf. There is often a great error committed both in the size and shape of the case; also in pressing too hard. The cases are often too long, too small in the head, and with too large a bulge. When the bulge is too large, the hogs head will be very uneven and rough in appearance, when stripped for inspection and sale. When the hogs head is small in the head, and the leaf long the sample cannot be drawn without breaking the ends of the leaves, which very much de faces and injures theappearancecid127Much of the tobacco brought to this market is injured by hard pressing, to the amount of at least one dollar per hundred pounds, particularly that which comes from Green and Marion counties. The hogs head or cases soul be four feet six inches in length, and three feet six inches ii breadth 750 in the head, with a bulge only sufficient to hold the hoops well Such a sized case will contain, without too hard pressing, from r thirteen to fourteen i hundred pounds of net tobacco. rich case should not weigh more thanoneihundred and fifty or one hundred and sixty pounds, instead of two hundred pounds and upwards, as i often the case even when the tobacco is hauled from sixty to eighty miles, at an expense of fifty cents per hundred pounds for the unnecessary timber. Ash timber should be used when it can be had, because it is light and strong, and white and neat in appearance. With a view to an improvement in the cultivation of the crop, we gave last spring, at. the Louisville warehouse, premiums to the amount of one hundred dollars; and we expect to do the same next spring, with a slight alteration; and that is, to require each planter who offers a hogs head for premium to pay one or two dollars entrance money, which amount will be added to the amount of premium money. All the premiums except one were taken last spring by citizens of Part county, Kentucky. Will it be the case again ?a? What say you, planters of other counties, and of  n diana great deal of our Kentucky tobacco is taken beyond the Alleghanymountains, manufactured into chewing tobacco, and brought back and sold in  Kentucky as Virginia tobacco Ll. A that is necessary to have a great abundance of it manufactured in our State into a fine article, is, that the planters furnish our enterprising manufacturers with a good material which they are entirely able to do. Robt. K. Whi Of. Tobacco. By a recent order of the Words Commissioners of her Majestys treasury, at leaf tobacco, in an un manufactured state, may be imported from the United States of America into Great Britain and I re land in packages of the same weight in which the same description of tobacco can be legally imported from the places of its growth. They have also authorized that the requisite alteration may be made in the law in the next customs amendment act, for to allow tobacco the produce of Mexico, America, Southamerica, or the islands of It. Domingo and Cuba, to be imported into the United Kingdom, in bales containing eighty pounds weight each, from any place from which it maybe legally imported for home use. Their lordship shave also allowed tobacco the produce of Trinidad to be imported into the United Kingdom, in packages of the same size as those sanctioned for tobacco the produce of South America and It.

The quality of the crop proved a desirable one, and better than any s .ce 1840, particularly in point of color, which brought our dealers freely Into the market; and as manufacturers also showed themselves anxious to secure stocks of this growth, all supplies found a ready sale at regenerating prices until the end of November, when the market became dull, various causes combining to render it so. Manufacturers had got into stocks; money became exceedingly scarce in Europe, in consequence of the mania to speck late in railroad stocks; which, however, has not extended to Bremen, where the horror to enter into anything like a paper speculation continues un diminished and it was moreover put beyond a doubt that the grain crops in Europe, although we may not actually call them short, are far from being abundant, and will hardly suffice for the twelve months to. come i la August, reports of a short crop f tobacco, bearing the semblance of truth, reached our place from the U ited States, which caused quite a stir, and some lots of ordinary tobacco, probably about 2,000 hogs heads, were 184 220, 1066,26,9, 5953, 85239, 82113,142 hhds2544 do 2 229 do 66 34 do 30 90 do 10 570 do 4 106 do 42, 315 752 taken by speculators; but, upon the whole, the business has been left to its legitimate course, and we again find it proved that nothing will go so far towards increasing sales as good qualities. Desirable tobacco is sale able even at this moment, whilst anything bordering upon ordinary cannot be sold even at ruinous rates. Your planters cannot devote too much attention to this fact, as nothing but their producing a better article than the inland (german) tobacco will increase the sale. We consider this of much more importance than a small reduction of the 1' Zohverein" duty, which, for the consumer, amounts to but a very small item, whilst a better pipe of tobacco for the same money will so accustom him to the United States tobacco that manufacturers will be compelled to prefer it to the miserable stuff growing in our country. Since some years, a kind of ready tobacco, grown in Mason county, has made its appearance, which promises to become a very important article in the manufacture of cigars. It is beginning to supersede Domingo tobacco. We saw 1,000 hogs heads sold this year at 8.22 groats. The average prices paid for tobacco are as follows 1814. 1843. 1842.

The prices of Kentucky and Mason county, from 2 "17 " 5 Another kind of tobacco has grown into importance this year, viz Florida, which is extensively used in cigar making. It is a most abominable article as to taste or smell, but being splendid wrap per leaf for the eye, and much like Havana, it will take the field against the latter. It is imported in boxes, averaging 300 pounds, and we sold some ourselves at or ix dollars per pound. The, common is not worth above 4.6. There were imported n 1843 -125 boxes, and nearly all sold 1844 -200 boxes, and nearly all sold 1845 -7 80 boxes, and nearly all sold. It may be of interest to add some particulars about the other kinds of tobacco, which are brought to market in bales, averaging 120 pounds. The imports, which are about equal to the sale, were 1842. 1843. 1844.6,490 bales Havana against -17 275 20,425 18, 70916,560 do Domingo do -97 62 10,145 7, 12321,990 do Porto Rico do -236 61 2,094 22, 6412,490 do Marin as do -8 192 9,025 10, 9936,560 do Brazil do -1 490 2004,950 do Cava do -havana, Marin as, and Brazil cannot be driven out of the market, by United States tobaccos, as they have a particular flavor, and cannot be dispensed with. Domingo finds a rival in Mason county and Florida; and Porto Rico in Maryland. The growth of this island is an item, and would be a formidable rival but for two causes firstly, the freight is too expensive, as it cannot be possibly brought here for less than \I six dollars per 100 pounds, whilst we regularly have Maryland at three quarters, and some
75times at three-eighths per cut, and Kentucky at three-eighths and five-eighths; and, secondly, in consequence of the export duty in Porto Rico being another one-fourth. The cultivation in Porto Rico has much increased of late, and we bought several cargoes this year at 4 for prime, and 3 for second quality, &c. It appears planters find these rates remunerative. As we can pay them in linens and other manufactures, we almost give this trade the preference to that with your country, whenever we have a heavy cash balance against us. As regards stocks of tobacco here, we find them larger than they have ever been, and should set them down in all hands at 50,000 to 60,000 hogs heads; of which about 20,000 hogs heads common are held by speculators 127 47 hogs heads in first hands, and the balance held by dealers. *in the 29th of January the French government will enter into contracts for the supply of 300,000 kilograms of Kentucky tobacco, 200,000 kilograms of Maryland, 1,880,000 kilograms of Virginia, 1,400,000 kilogramsof Kentucky, and 2,200,000 kilograms of Maryland. Tobacco, in this country, is a government monopoly, and these large quantities are required for sale. From Silver and Smiths European Times, January 4, 1846. Of   Verpool Annual Tobacco Report.

The de liveries of the year have been 12,341 hads, viz: 193 Virginia leaf, 288 stemmed, 332 Kentucky leaf, and 355 stemmed, to the trade 234 Virginia leaf, 97 4 stemmed, 143 Kentucky leaf, and 1,159 stemmed, sent coast wise; 269 Virginia leaf, 51 stemmed, 1,700 Kentucky leaf, and 28 stemmed, for exportation ; and 1,107 Virginia leaf, 1,529 stemmed, 478 Kentucky leaf, and 292 stemmed, to I re land. The sales of the year amount to 14,424 hads, against 13,045 in 1844,and 12,739 in 1843. They consisted of 2,063 Virginia leaf, 3,003 stemmed 29 02 Kentucky leaf, 6,435 stemmed, and 21 Marylands; of which 1,263Virginia leaf, 1,864 stemmed, 598 Kentucky leaf, and 7 48 stemmed, (4473hhds) were taken for I re land; 29 Virginia leaf, 485 stemmed, 3 Kentucky leaf, and 334 stemmed, (85 1) for Scotland; 403 Virginia and 1,783 Kentucky leaf, with 13 Marylands, (2 199) for exportation; 30 Virginia leaf 4 854 133 stemmed, 67 Kentucky leaf, and 6 77 stemmed, (90 7) for re sale; and 338 Virginia leaf, 521 stemmed, 451 Kentucky leaf, 4,676 stemmed, and 8Marylands, (5 994 hads) by manufacturers; and there remain for sale 1 220 Virginia leaf, 2,627 stemmed, 2,170 Kentucky leaf, and 4,506 stemmed, to which will have to be added 4,530 hads. yet to sample. The weight of un manufactured tobacco, upon which duty was paid in 1843, was 22,828,467 lbs; in 1844,24,250,010 lbs; and this year, 25,852,199lbs.-showing an increase over the previous one of 1,602,189 lbs.

55APPENDI X No. 11. Cotton. For the Southern Cultivator. Of The Culture Of Cotton. A. Camak: Having seen the report of Mr. R. P. Bassett and others, who have been experimenting upon Dr. Clouds plan of planting cotton, and having, in 1844, made a small trial myself, and discovering that my result approached so near in quantity that of Mr. R. P. Bassett, I am encouraged to report, through your very useful periodical, the quantity of seed cotton which I grew per acre. The land, in a natural state, is a sariyYridge, had been cultivated several years, and was consequently somewhat exhausted; perhaps six or eight hundred pounds might have been grownup on it, un assisted by manure. In 1843 it was not cultivated, but was used as a pasture for calves. In February of last year I had the land broken deep with a s cooper plough; after which, I hauled out my manure and laid it in piles at suitable distances. In the 2d of April 1 laid off the rows at the distance of two feet and a half the narrow way. This was performed with a very narrow plough. In the 3d of April the rows were run off the wide way, four feet, with a shovel plough, and the manure deposited in the check, in such quantity as to nearly fill the shovel furrow as each hill; after which the bedding or riding was performed the wide way with a very simple kind of turn plough, leaving enough of the middles un ploughed to retail the small s cooper marks as guides in planting. In the 4th of April the ridges were opened with a small s cooper and light stock the seed rubbed in reached ashes, and a few dropped in each hill and covered with the feet. The ground being dry at this period, the seed did notvegetate till after the fall of a shower, which was 15th of April. After the rain the middles were turned out. As soon as the cotton was up it was hold, leaving three or four s talks in a hill. The second working was performed by running a small plough round the cotton, and leaving the middles un ploughed, and hoping out, leaving two s talks in each hill. In June the middles were ploughed, and the cotton hold. At this period I discovered that the cotton was not inclined to branch properly; and, consequently, I thinned it down to one stalk in a hill. At this time the plants were booming, and on many s talks several balls were found. Early in July I ploughed and hold the ground very lightly which finished the culture. In the 16th July I topped the cotton plants it branched so as to fill up the row the wide way, and produce two thousand and thirty-four pounds per acre. Had the thinning been performed in proper time, I doubt not but that the product would have been larger. His fact is detailed as an error in the cultivation. One stalk in the hill is enough and, if thinned as soon as possible, everybody knows that fruit will be produced the sooner. The manure used was "com post" prepared from stables. The kind of756
seed planted was Rio Janeiro. I shall say something of this cotton in my next. Hours, Of  Les Scarborough. Mount Pleasant, Meriwether county, April, 1845. From the Washington " Union" of March 5, 1846. Cotton Manufacture. We are permitted to copy the following interesting paper upon the cotton manufacture of Austria, from letters addressed to the Commissioner of Patents by Charles L. Fleischmann, esq, late of the Patent Office, nowtryeling in Europe. It is extracted from letters dated "vienna, Austria, January 15, 1846.7Austrian cotton manufactures, -4 c. The manufacture of cotton goods, although laboring under a great many disadvantages in regard to perfect machinery and a less experienced and skilful working class, has developed itself since the beginning of this century in one of the most important branches of Austrian industry. In the year 1801 a Baron Kobliesky introduced into Austria the first English cotton spinning machines, and established the first cotton factories, which have since increased to 175, with 1,300,000 spindles. Some of these factories are now extensive; as, for instance, that at Pattendorf, which has 47,000, and that of Rum an 32,000 spindles, producing yarn above the to. 100. Within fifteen years the importation of raw cotton has increased five fold, viz' in the year 1828, it amounted to 65,000 cut; in the year 1831,it was already double; in 1836, it reached 207,985; in 1837, 223,545 in 1840, 302,694; in 1841, 248,121; and in 1842, 321,377 cut. In the year 1834 the government reduced the import duty from 3 florins30 kreutzers to 1 florid 40 kreutzers per cut, in order to encourage this important branch. The above stated numbers of spindles produce yearly 214,896 cut. of yarn and thread of the following numbers: from 1 to 30, 12,613,074; of 32 to 60, 8,313,327; of 62 to 100, 283,398 ; above 100, 17,410, and thread 262 410; in all, 21,489,619. In the early stage of the development of this branch of industry, the importation of yarn to No. 50 was entirely prohibited, but afterwards admitted under a duty from 30 to 81 florids, according to the degree of fine ness of the article; in the year 1833 it was reduced to 20 florids; and in March, 1845, to 10 florids, or about          $5 per cut. This reduced duty increased the importation of fine yarns, in which Austria cannot compete with England. In 1831, it was only 6,773.; in 1833, 10,670; in 1838, 57,766; and in 1842, 61,411 cut. Austria imports three different kinds of cotton the Macedonian, Egypt' 757tian, and American. The Macedonian is used for the most common yarn, or the numbers from 1 to 10; the American for the numbers from 12 to 30;for the fine numbers from 32 to 60, partly American and partly Egyptian and for the numbers above 60, the best Egyptian. The average price of the different kinds of cotton stood, in 1841Macedonian, 32 florids; Egyptian, 48 florids; and American, 37- florids, perch t. The price of Egyptian or A co cotton has, since 1841, diminished in price, and in 1844 it could be bought for 27 florids per cut; the middle quality of American fell in the same period from 371- florids to 25 florinsper cut. The Egyptian cotton is of great importance to Austria. In the first place, it is of superior quality, and can be used for the finest numbers; and, secondly, it employs its vessels in commerce with Egypt for the transportation. The whole amount of imported cotton can be estimated at oneeighthMacedonian, two-eighths Egyptian, and five eighths Americancomputedat a value of 9,860,000 florids. When to this sum for raw cotton the expense of manufacturing into yarn is added amounting to 214,896 cut, valued at 5,260,000 florinsthe value of yarn produced in the Austrian man factories amounts to15120000 florids. The low rate of labor has prevented the general introduction of power looks. Most of the yarn is woven into different goods by hand; and, according to the official statements, there are turned out 5,800,000 pieces, at a value of 20,760,000 florids. Great as the increase of manufactured cotton goods appears within twenty years, there is yet room for a far greater extension. The yearly consumption of cotton goods amounts to 218,000 cut, of a population of 36,000,000,or two thirds of a pound or six yards per head ; which is considerably less, when compared with the countries of the German league, where it amounts to two pounds per head. The extensive production of English cotton yarn stands to that of Austria as 1 to 12; to that of France as 1 to 4; and to those of the German league as 4 to 3. The importation of cotton yarn into Austria, which amounts to 47,337 cut, was in the German league three times greater; in France, very small. From the Union. Cotton In I Ndi A. New York, September 22, 1845. The Zenobia, which arrived at this port on Saturday morning last from Calcutta, Last In dies, brought home one of the American cotton planters, who, some five years since, entered the service of the honorable Last I ndiaCompany as a superintendent of cotton farms in their extensive experiment, made to grow American cotton in that region, and to improve the cultivation of native cotton. I have had much conversation with Mr. T., who went from Mississippi; and after having served the government for five years, the term of his engagement, has returned, as stated, in the Zenobia. He has communicated to me much valuable and interesting information i a relation to I ndia758 a. The estimates that the experiment has cost the government about                  $500,000,and that it has resulted in the most complete and signal failure. In 1840 an agent of the government came to the United States, and repaired to Louisiana and Mississippi, where the growing of cotton has been carried to the greatest state of perfection, and where he engaged ten Americans who had been employed in superintending cotton estates in that section of the Union for several years. They were well recommended by the most respectable planters. They left with the agent for I india, via England, and took with them large quantities of the best American cotton seed, agricultural implements, cotton guns, presses, &c. The planters were engaged at an average salary of about 300 each, with an allowance for subsistence of 100 more. Each entered into a contract to remain in the service of the company five years, and to conduct the experiments in such parts of I india as the government should point out. Of the ten persons thus engaged, three, after the first year, returned home, being paid their salaries up to the time of leaving, but were left to bear their own expenses home; while, according to the agreement, those who remained five years were to have all their expenses borne from America to I india, and from thence, at the expiration of the service, back to the United States. Even of the party remained to the end of their engagement; one of whom is Mr. T., who has just arrived in the Zenobia. He says, on reaching I india their party were distributed to different parts of the I indian empire, in order that the experiment might be tested in reference to the different soils and varieties of climate in that vast empire. One (or. T.) was placed at Calpee, in the district of Bundelcund. Another was stationed at Goruckpore, under the Papal hills; another in Dooabanother was located in Soomapore ; another at Humeapore, in the province of And a; another at Watch, in Bundelpore; others in Coimbatore and at murat, on the western side of the peninsula. After experimenting a year or two at each place without a prospect of success, they were changed to other localities, so as to give every district in I india, as far as possible, a trial. Mr. T. was changed from Bundelcund4o Rungpore, North I india, near the base and in full view of the Himalaya, mountains, which were covered with perpetual snow. Others were changed to Ah war, in the southern Mahratta country. The American planter placed at Watch, during a rebellion which commenced with the Decoyts, (robbers) had his premises attacked, his houses sacked and burnt, barely escaping with his life and the clothes he wore. In every part of I india where the Americans tried the cultivation of cotton, and endeavored to instruct the natives in the best mode of culture, they most sign ally failed. Those who remained used every exertion to succeed, as they were liberally paid, having every facility granted that they could ask, with the expectation of being handsomely rewarded if they succeeded. Mr. T. thinks the two great and insuperable difficulties in the way of cultivating cotton in I india are attribute able to the two great extremes of dry and wet weather, either of which is peculiarly fatal to cotton. During the continuance of the rainy season, the cotton plants grow with unwontedluxuriance and rapidity, to be as suddenly checked and cut off by the intense heat of the sun which pours upon them during the succeeding season. When the dry weather sets in, the sun ri pens the balls premature ly, when apparently not more than half grown, while the leaves of the plant are crisped and burnt to a ,now u color by the intensity of the solar heat. 759 n lower Bengal the rainy season commences late in May, and continue still October. In central I india the rainy season begins about the middle of July, and lasts till from the 1st to the 15th of September. In lower Bengal as much as 76 inches of rain usually falls in 12 months. In central I india no crops can be anticipated with much less than 13 inches of rain. Eleven inches never fails to result in a famine, which is dreadful in its effects upon the natives. In addition to the unconquerable difficulties of the climate, the cotton plant is exposed to the fatal attacks of destructive insects. There is one which lays an egg in the flower of the plant. Before the ball matures, the worm forms within it, which feeds upon the green and tender fibres of the cotton, eating out all the cotton within the ball before it manures, leaving only a lock or two in some bolts, or ponds, while in others not a fibre is left. In some parts of I india it is also subject to the attacks of white ants, which cut down the plants while young, or attack the young ponds and cut them off. All that the Americans could do with their best exertion only enabled them to raise, on the average, about ten pounds of clean cotton to the acre from the best American cotton seed, and only seventy pounds of clean cotton to the acre from native I india cotton seed. Mr. T., before leaving Mississippi to go to I india, superintended a cotton estate near God ney, in that State, in 1839, on which he raised over nine hundred pounds of clean cotton to the acre. He says that year he made a fine crop, actually sending to market two hundred bales of good cotton, averaging four hundred and fifty pounds each, from ninety-six acres of land. What a contrast this to dropping in I ndiaMr. E., one of the American cotton growers who went to I india, and was stationed at Goruckpore, put two hundred acres in cotton, from which he gathered only two hundred pounds of clean cotton. The most those sent toCoimbatore could do was to raise, in a favorable year, two hundred pounds of seed cotton to the acre equal to about fifty pounds of clean cotton. The most Mr. T. could do was to raise, the first year, ten pounds of clean cotton from American cotton seed of the Mexican variety, (the best) and seventy pounds of native cotton, to the acre. He says the American seed carried out from about God ney (the best in America) deteriorated every year; the staple or fibre growing shorter, while the yield grew less. It is his firm conviction that if the American seed be planted over andover again in the same soil, in I india, in five years it will totally cease to mature any cotton whatever. He also says, by changing it to other districts, it may be made to yield something a few years longer, but would ultimately run out. From the Southern Cultivator, July 4. Ameri Can Cotton In I Ndi A. It appears, from a report of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, that the experiments in growing American cotton in I india have not been entirely unsuccessful, particularly in the neighborhood of Hyderabad, under the superintendence of Captain Meadows Taylor. The following is an extract from the report of the committee of the Bombay Chamber: "your committee place in the appendix to the present report the letters of Captain Taylor relative to the samples, which give a very favorable 70 in account of the progress making in the culture of New Orleans, Tea island and Bourbon cottons. It is gratifying to perceive that the native growers are engaging actively in the cultivation of these varieties, and that, instead of being with difficulty persuaded to make the smallest experiment as has too often been the case before in other localities they evince the greatest eagerness to obtain seed for sowing. The crops of Bourbon and Tea island on the bank of the Parish na are described as most luxuriant, and the success of the New Orleans appears to be beyond a doubt. Captain Taylor states that he has given directions for the whole of the cotton grown from the seed furnished to be collected and sent to Sholaporeand he adds that he purposes afterwards for warding it to Bombay, in order to ascertain its value in our market. Your committee trust that the time is drawing nigh when we shall be able to calculate on a regular supply of such cotton. There can be no doubt that it would fetch a good price here for shipment to the home markets, and that it would amply regenerate both grower and dealer From the Gardeners' Chronicle, August 30, 1845CULTI   Vati   Of Of Cotton In I Ndi A. In resuming the subject of the cultivation of cotton in I india, I must request your attention to an error which has crept into my communication. I had stated that the American species that is, gossypium peruvianum and. Barbadensethough long introduced into I india, still retain their distinctive characters. I then mentioned some corroborate ve facts, and concluded by stating that these facts show 4' persistence" of character, even in, the midst of the I indian species. Your printers have made me say "perverse ness" of character, which is a manifest contradiction to what was before said. I am glad, however, of recalling attention to this part of the subject, hoping that some of your correspondents may say something respecting the influence of different species of the same genus in hybridizingeach other when grown in large quantities in the same open country. I have said on each other, because, if the I indian species, from their vicinity, deteriorate the American species, these, on the contrary, ought to have some influence in improving the species indigenous to I india. Some, indeed, are disposed to look with hope in this direction. Dr. Turn, indeed, in the very last letter, dated in May, which I received from him, says : " I am full of hope that something good may be obtained by crossing the foreign with our native cottons." In the meantime, however, he has made an experiment in crossing the two I indian species with each other. Of these, G. arboreum, as its name indicates, grows to a tree bears comparatively little cotton; butt his little is of a fine silk y nature, and comparatively long in staple ; the other species, G. herbaceum, which ought rather to be called G. in di cum, as it will grow into a shrub, though only sebaceous in the south of Europe, is the source of the different cultivated varieties of cotton in different parts of I india, some of which are of very excellent quality, as I hope afterwards to show. I give the results of Dr. Burns experiment in his own words, which were communicated in a letter to Vol. Eyes, and which has beenlithographed at the I india House, and of which I send you a copy, with colored drawings of the plants 61" The plant from which this is a specimen was sown at the beginning of the mon soon, in July, 1844, along with other plants of the G. arboreum. It grew up and ripened its produce; but it differed from them in habit considerably. They grow and blossom all the season, from November, until checked by the heat in April. It blossomed and yielded all its produce in the space of two months, as the G. h. does, and it was free from the chief fault of the G. a, viz: that of yielding too small a quantity of produce. In short, it had all, or nearly all, the good qualities of the parent plants. The plant grew to the height of six feet, and the lower lateral branches, four in number, were two feet in length each; the remaining ones being shorter gradually up to the top of the plant. The number of blossoms was 60; but only about 50 remained to yield produce; the others falling off. The color of the stem and other parts was greener, like the G. h, and not so black or dark colored as the G. a. The whole plant was also more hairy than the G. a, and resembled in this respect G. h, the most hi route of all the varieties of the genus gossypium. The color of the blossoms was chiefly red, but at the roots of the petals the yellow color of the G. h. flowers was vivid, and more distinct than is shown by the dried specimen. The produce from the 50 balls weighed equal to four rulees and three quarters, or 85 5 troy grains; and for the sake of comparison in results, an equal weight of produce from G. a. was examined at the time along with that of the cross plant. The results were as follows iCrossplant wool, grains -239 =28 per cent seed, grains -607 71 loss and dust, grains -8- 1855 100. arboreum wool, grains -191 =a- 22: per cents seed, grains -6 58 =a= 77 "loss and dirt, grains -5= 03 "85 5 100" This shows clearly that improvement as to quantity of wool has been one result of the crossing. 28 per cent. is, I believe, equal to the yield of the best New Orleans produce in America; and, in this instance, the quality of the wool, in my opinion, is quite equal to the best* New Orleans to be found in the English markets. It is superior to the best Reach or " Murat S." One fact, however, should be noticed the yield of the G. h. here, on fallow land, is commonly 33 per cent. The G.  a. and G. h. are eminently suited to the climate here, which none of the foreign varieties are. A knowledge of the climate, as to distribution of moisture, is the grand desideratum in I india for successful cotton culture. The average fall of rain at Reach, for 1843 and 1844, was 38 inches 31 .per cent. The average of Bombay, as given, I believe, by Mr. To ton, is 76 1 inches; showing an excess overBroach of 38.18+, or double in amount. Now, the two last seasons approach are considered to be above the average fall, and too much for successful cotton crops. Cotton cannot be raised near Bombay; and if at sample parcel is sent along with this by same post 7 62 a. Reach the fall of rain was anything like that at Bombay, it is clear no cotton bushes could grow; they would be rotted by the excess of moisture, as they have been in all low places during the past two seasons. These latter remarks apply chiefly to G. h. and G. a, for each variety of cotton plant varies much in habit. Crossing appears to me to be a very likely mode of obtaining a better and more productive kind of plant than is at present cultivated in I india. Witness the varieties of the <a name="potato1038"><mark>potato</mark></a> thus acquired ; of the Hopetoun o at, now so universally esteemed in the Lothians. Use the pollen of some of the fine foreign cottons to impregnated the blossoms of the hardy, and suited to climate, (G. a) and is it too much to expect to permanently improve upon it ?a? In the case now under notice, I am perfectly satisfied of the success so far; but will the produce from the seed of any plant retain the improvement ?a? We must try and see the results next season. If an acre of land were planted with 7,000 plants not too many and they yielded at the rate above stated, or take it only at grains 720 each plant, then the wool would amount to 201 lbs; and at 4d. per lb or 6 lbs. per rule e, its value would be 34 rulees, a sum one third of which would be ample to cover the expenses of cultivation, if judiciously gone about." The number of <a name="seeds106"><mark>seeds</mark></a> from 85 5 grains of produce wasCrossplant -67 6 good. G. a. 76 2 good. Difference in number, 62.27 bad. 3 bad 7 03 765. Burnbroach, January 25, 1845." P. Of t is clear the cause of the partial success attending the experiments in cultivation of the American cotton plant, both at Coimbatore andDahwar, depends on the moisture of both mon soons affecting the atmosphere of those two places, on different sides of the Oats, with a degree of moisture, the continuance of which is sufficient to admit of the growth andmaturation of the produce. The pass in the Oats at P. admits of this. Of. Of sent Colonel Eyes a specimen of a horrid cotton plant, raised here. I am full of hope that something good may be obtained by crossing the foreign with our native cottons. What think you ?or. Turn, commenting on this result, says: "crossing appears to me to be a very likely mode of obtaining a better and more productive kind of plant than is at present cultivated in I india. In the case now under notice, I am perfectly satisfied of the success so far ; but will the produce from the seed of any plant retain the improvement" I must conclude with asking, what do you, and what do your correspondents say to the course of experiment, and to its probable results ?J. F. R. Growth Of Cotton In I Ndi A. Three years ago I addressed the sub joined letter to a gentleman in Liverpool, connected with the trade to South America, and he forwarded a
63copy of it to his partners in Peru, who did me the honor to translate it into Spanish, and circulate it among the planters there; but with what effect, Know not. Now, it seems to me to be quite as applicable to I india as Peru and it every year becomes more evident how vitally important it is for us to endeavor to grow that indispensable article, cotton, in our own colonies, rather than continue depend ant on the United States for our supplies; as a war of two years' duration, or even a serious outbreak among the negroes which is very likely to occur if we have a war with the States) might set fast all our mills, and deprive our work people of bread. I am aware that many experiments, having for their object the growth of a better quality of cotton, have failed; indeed, so long ago as the year 1828, I sent seed of many varieties to Calcutta, where they were put into the hands of the Horticultural Society; but I heard no more of them, and it did not then occur to me that the failure of all attempts to grow good cotton would be probable, from the overwhelming preponderance of the native cotton, planted in the same vicinity. The growing of better kinds of cotton may have been attempted in I india, with the precautions suggested to the Peruvians; but if it has, I have never heard of it; and I am convinced if success is to be obtained at all, it must be sought for in that direction. T. G. The following is the letter above alluded to' I have for some time intended to call your attention to the importance of attempting to grow fine cotton in Peru. We have been, as you are aware, consumers of Peruvian cotton to some extent for the last six or eight months, and, from the observations I have made on it during that time, I have no hesitation in saying that it possesses many excellence is. I tis long enough, (almost too long) very sound in staple, and, when well managed, of a very good color; its defects are coarseness and harsh ness of staple; and if these could be removed, I do not see what is to prevent its rivaling the Egyptian and Tea island cottons, any considerable approximation to which would very materially enhance its value; seeing that the highest quotation for Tea islands was last week 30d, whilst the highest forPeruvian was no more than 61d. With the view of improving the quality of cotton in Peru, I would strongly recommend you to send <a name="seeds107"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of various kinds, packed in air tight boxes, particularly Tea island and Egyptian, which some of the cotton brokers would easily procure from the spinners using these descriptions ; and, judging from what I hear of the climate of both countries, I should think the Egyptian would go to a very similar atmosphere and mode of cultivation to that where it has been raised, which would be very likely to render it much more easily acclimated, and of course make it much more likely to succeed than a sort of cotton which had been grown under dis similar circumstances of soil, climate, and mode of cultivation These <a name="seeds108"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, when sown, ought (with the exceptions hereafter to be mentioned) to be planted at such a distance from all other cottons as to render it very unlikely for the wind or insects to carry the pollen from the flowers of one kind to those of another; for, without this precaution, such is the tendency in many genera of plants to hybridize or cross breed with each other, (and I believe, from what I have heard, that there is this tendency in the different varieties of cotton) that, however good the quality in the first instance, they would all revert to the old variety in a season or two, in consequence of the great preponderance of that variety over any 7 64 newly introduced ones. To much are the growers of turn in seed, for sale in England, aware of the importance of attending to this, that the greatest precautions are taken to remove all cruciform plants from the vicinity of the field, whilst their turn is are in flower, as there is such a tendency in them all to hybridize that the quality of the seed is often injured by the wild mustard (snap is ravens is) springing up in the same or adjoining fields; whilst by carefully selecting, on the other hand, the best bulbs for seed, and by judiciously crossing one variety with another, new sorts are obtained, combining the excellence is of both. This leads me to observe, that probably seed of foreign varieties of cotton may not thrive well in the first instance; and I would therefore very strongly recommend the gentleman who makes the experiment carefully to select seed from the plants on his estate which he sees are producing the best and finest cotton, and sow them in contact with a few <a name="seeds109"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of each of the sorts you may send out to him, carefully .removing them in every instance, as far as is practicable, from the vicinity of all other cotton; and then again sowing the seed which is obtained from these experiments, and carefully examining the cotton growing upon each of them. It is more than probable that some of the plants will be varieties par taking of the character of both the parent kinds and by selecting the best of these, and sowing them alone, (still at a distance from all other cotton) there is but little doubt that much benefit will be derived by the persevering and skilful cultivate or. I have heard it stated that the origin of the Tea island cotton is to be traced to something of the kind. An observing and experimental planter, by carefully examining his plants, and sowing seed always from those alone which produced the largest and finest cotton, at last arrived at that excellent quality known by that name. Took again at what has been done in Egypt, by the introduction of <a name="seeds110"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of better cotton; and there this improved variety has by no means had a fair chance of showing what it is capable of becoming, inasmuch as the wretched cultivate or has not the slightest inducement to improve its quality. He gets no more per pound for the finest and cleanest cotton than he does for the coarsest and dirt i est, and therefore it is not very likely to improve under his care. But with all this neglect and want of management, we can see, by what it is, what it would most probably become in the hands of an enterprising and skilful man, who knew that every improvement he made in its quality would be to his own advantage. Assuming that our Peruvian friends would so far improve the quality of their cottons as to double its value in this market, (and I do not think myself too sanguine in expecting even more than this) with very little extra labor, nearly all the additional price would be profit." But supposing that even crossfertilizing, or hybridizing, as the horticulturists call it, does not frequently naturally occur in cotton plants, we all know that it is very easy to effect it artificially, by premature ly unfolding the petals, and with fine scissors cutting away all the seamens beforeimpregnation takes place. This requires to be carefully done, so as not to injure the petals, and they will then close again of themselves; and when they expand naturally, then impregnated the stir ma of the flower with the pollen of the kind you want to cross with. We owe many of our finest varieties of fruit to this practice. The late Mr. Andrew Night, in particular, was very successful in raising new kinds in this way. And it appears to me, from the experiment I have made, that the more frequently this cross breeding takes place, the more easy (within certain limits) it is
65to extend it, until cultivation has so completely changed the character of the plant that it bears very little resemblance to its original stock. There is nothing growing wild like our cabbages, turn is, and cauliflowers, nor even like our carrots, ce very, and asparagus. There are the originals of our wheat, barley, rye, beans, and peas? Any of these appear to be so completely transformed by cultivation, that we do not know where to look for the original stocks from which they have sprungTHOMAS Garnettfrom the Southwestern Farmer. Of. Hammonds Report. We give, at the conclusion of this notice, the report of a committee of which our friend, J. H. Hammond, was chairman. We congratulate him on the knowledge of farming that he displays. We see how readily the educated and intelligent can learn the business of farming. But a short time since, our old school mate was up to his eyes in politics: he now retires to the field, there to live a quiet, peaceable life. We rejoice at it, and can but repeat the remark we made to him before he was elected governor : You are wrong you have no business in that sphere seek your ease and peace it suits you better, and will give you satisfaction." His answer was then, as his works answer now: ":I will do so as early as the force of circumstances will permit" or to this purport were both. We again congratulate him, and also our country, in the success of our friend. We also press on all agriculturists any article from the pen of Hammond; he will, we feel assured, give all matters that he writes on his minute and particular attention. Behave known him from both of our boyhoods, and know him to be talented and observing; and, more than all, when he does apply himself, it is an application deserving and injuring success. As we are his senior in planting the cotton, especially in personal attention to it, we beg to give him a hint or two. We may err in our notions and why we say so, is, that we differ so materially from so large a number of farmers. We think that very early planting is disadvantageous. And to define early planting: We think the last week in March is early enough at any time, even for this year, when it will be borne in mind the fruit trees were quite green at that time; to plant as early as the 15th or 20 thou March is very early." We generally judge it to be time to plant corn when the " leaf of the oak is as large as the squirrels ear" many of our planters have planted cotton as early. We think cotton planted from the 1st to the 10th of April is early enough for old land, and have known, by several crops, that the later planting say the 10th-was considerably better than the early; we know this not only by our own weights and measures, but also by others. We would make an exception to early planting. New ground and rich fresh land has such a tendency to make weed, that it is necessary to plant as early as a stand can be had so all think; we would not object, but think that judicious culture would make a different result. We would act precisely as with the tree that produced wood instead of fruit amputate the roots. We think that if the land has been broken up very early, and 7 66 left to be consolidated by rains, then planted about the 5th to the 10th of April, thinned out as early as it was up, cultivated deep and late, the s talks would set the fruit and ripe n in time, To we not thus with fruit trees, I wish <a name="potato1039"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and sweet potato the latter, too, by either cutting off tops, or feeding with calves? And why not a similar practice with the cotton plant ?the cotton plant is a very tender plant if treated as it was some ten or fifteen years since some three to six bushels of seed sown per acre, and it not thinned out until third leaf had appeared. It has been raised in a hot bed, and no wonder it be tender; but if sown thinly, and then thinned out to single s talks, we think it a hardy plant. There is no use in trying the hardihood of the plant it is unlike corn. It has a tap root, grows in dry weather, and unless the land has not been properly prepared, or remarkably dry, it will improve by hot or dry weather; but corn having superficial roots, should be planted early as possible, that it may ripe n before the drought sets in. If cotton will make 1,000 pounds per acre when planted late in May, there can be no fears to plant 10th April. The farmer can place his land in excellent order have his corn cleaned handsomely; and when cotton is up, he can push it to the utmost. We request our friend H. to plant one acre of cotton, even now, after his seeing this, on a piece of well ploughed land, in the same field that he has now even scraped over. Must open out furrows where the cotton now stands, which will destroy the cotton that has been scraped. Our impression is, that the difference will be very slight, and, if adopted generally, would give considerable time to manure, plough, and improve, instead of giving cotton the additional working necessary. The land that we have known planted late would not, average seasons, make anything like one third more by early planting; and if the extra labor was applied to improving it, we doubt if it would yield as much. Understand, we do not advocate either late or early planting that is, after the 25th of April or before the 1st; and only wish to show there is not so vast difference between planting 1st April and 1st May. What would be the gain to any farm by this extra months work ?a? P. Report Of The Commi  Ttee Of The Barnwell Agri Culturalsoci    Ety Of The Culture Of Cotton. The ground cannot e too well prepared for cotton f it has rested one year it should be broken flush, as early in the previous fall as possible, and headed just before planting. If it has rested two years or been planted the preceding year, let it be listed as early as it can be done, and two furrows thrown upon the list. I immediately upon planting, let two more furrows be thrown up, and the balk broken out completely. The common method of running three furrows, and planting on it, throws the winters portion of the crop work upon the laborer during crop time, and is in excusable, unless heavy clearings are absolutely required. The reason for not listing after one years rest is, that the vegetation matter will be too abundant, and too coarse to form a sub stratum to receive the tap root. Cotton should be planted early t may increase the difficulty of getting a. stand, and give the plant, for a long time, a puny appearance, but every stalk of cotton planted in March, or first week in April, that survives, may
67be readily distinguished in any field that has been re planted later. It bears more, and earlier, and stands all the vicissitudes of June, July, and August better. There are several methods of planting. Your committee recommend planting in spots regularly measured by the diable. It is somewhat tedious, though less so than is generally supposed, and certainly does not take as much time as both to drill and chop out; nor is time so valuable at that period as when the latter operation is required, while a better and more regular stand may be secured. There is no land, or but little, in our district, in which cotton rows should be over three feet apart, or the cotton further than fourteen inches in the drill, one plant in a place. To make a large crop there must be an abundant supply of s talks. When the weather is too wet to plant, time may be often saved by dropping the seed, but not covering until the ground is driver, I f, however, it cannot be covered in three or four days, it is time lost, for it must be re planted. Always cover lightly, under any circumstances ; and always plant on something of a bed, in any land. I to keeps cotton driver, and affords more air when it is young it enables you to get at it in working. By increasing the surface, it absorb s more moisture if it is too dry, and gives out more if it is too wet; and, in both cases, gives you the advantage of a vertical sun on the tap root, which hastens the maturity of the balls a vast desideratum in our climate. In this account the bed can hardly be drawn too high at the list hoping in any season. In cultivating cotton, whether with the plough or he, the chief object is to keep down the grass, which is its greatest antagonist, bringing all, or almost all other evils in its train. It is not so essential, in the opinion of your committee, to keep the ground stirred, as is generally supposed, and by no means requisite to stir it deep at all events not to our light soil. If it be well prepared, deep sloughing is not only unnecessary for any of our crops, but often highly injurious to them, while it rapidly exhausts the land by turning it up fresh under a burning sun. Such unnecessary pains is usually taken and time lost to work the plant in a particular way, under the supposition that it is a peculiarly delicate one. If it survives its infancy, few plants are harder. It is often found to reach maturity in the alleys, where the mules walk with the ploughs following, and the laborer tramp s backwards and forwards. Sometimes it will bear fruit in turn rows used frequently for wagons, while it really seems to -derive benefit from being bitten down almost to the ground by the animals; it will bear almost any usage better than it will that mortal enemy, grass. The most critical operation in working cotton is thinning. It should be done with great care, and, if early, with the hand. In a dry year, it cannot be done too early after the plant is up. In a wet one, it may be profitable delayed until it has begun to form, or later even. In the experience, observation, and judgment of the planter, in this matter, everything depends, as each year brings its own rules with it. There circumstances are favorable, early thinning is of course the best. Some planters always top their cotton; others never do. Your committee are of opinion that it seldom or never does harm to do so; but whether it is worth the trouble is a doubtful question. Those who have no clearing or other important employ for their hands, would lose nothing by devoting three or four days to this operation early in August. Those pressed for time might gain by omitting it. Too much pains cannot be taken in preparing cotton for market, for they 8 are all well regenerated by the additional price. The first thing to be attended to is to have it gathered free of trash. With a little care, wonders an be effected in this way, and hands with a short training will pick ali Most if not quite as much without trash as with it. It should never be gathered when wet. And here it may not be out of place to remark, that one of the very best sanitary rules of a plantation is, never before frost to send out your hands to pick until the dew has nearly or quite disappeared. It saves time in the long run, as well as health and life. Cotton should never be gin ned until the seed are so dry as to crack between the teeth. If damp, it is preferable to dry it in the shade, as the sun extracts the oil and injuries the staple. If by accident, however, it gets wet, there is no alternative but to put it on the scaffold. It is of great importance to sort the cotton carefully into several qualities, in ginning and packing; for by mixing all qualities together, the average of the price is certainly lowered. A few old hands, or very young ones, breeding women, suck less, and invalids, will earn excellent wages in a gin house at this occupation. Seat packing is of no small importance in the sale of cotton, and no little taste may be displayed in making the packages. The advantage of square bags is universally known, and the committee are astonished that any other should ever be made now. Very kind of manure is valuable for cotton very kind of com post, green crops turned in, cotton seed, and even naked leaves, listed and left to rot, improve this crop. When planted on cotton seed, and sometimes on strong stable manure, it is more difficult to retain a stand, owing probably to the over stimulus of these strong manures. To on leaves, unless well rotted, the cotton will long continue to die, in consequence of the leaves decaying away and exposing the root too much to sun and rain. These difficulties may be avoided by a little pains, and by no means justify the opinion entertained by some, that cotton should never be planted on freshly manured land. The only question is, the cost of the manure. A great deal may be made on every plantation, without much trouble or expense, by keeping the stables and stable yard, how and cow pens, well supplied with leaves and straw, and also from pens of corn cobs, sweepings from negro and fowl house yards, and rank weeds that spring up about them, collected together and left to rot. Whenever the business is carried further, and a regular force is detached to make manure, at all seasons, and entirely left out from the crop, it becomes the owner to enter into a close calculation of the cost and profits. In many agricultural operations, such a course the experience of all countries has proved to be profitable, but these operations partake rather more of the farming and gardening than planting character, and whether the same method will do for the extensive planting of short staple cotton, remains, in the opinion of your committee, yet to be tested. If anything like an average of past prices can be maintained, it is certain that more can be made by planting largely than by making manure as a crop. I f, however, prices continue to fall, and the growing of cotton be confined to a few rich spots those susceptible of high maturing then our whole system must be changed, our crops must be curtailed, and staple labor losing its past value the comparative profit of a cotton and manure crop, will pre ponder ate in favor of the latter. As a substitute for maturing on a large scale, resting and rotation of crops is resorted to. In our right level land, the practice of resting cannot be too highly recommended, and, by a judicious course such as resting two and planting two, or at most three
69yearsour lands may not only be kept up forever, but absolutely improved, From rotation of crop is i but little is gained for cotton. After small grain, whether from the exhausting nature of that crop on light lands, or because the stubble keeps the ground always rough and porous, cotton will not do well. After corn it is difficult to tend, as, from our usual manner of cultivating corn, grass is always left in full possession of the field. It does best after cotton, or after a years rest. West is the grand restore r, and the rotation chiefly required in the cultivation of cotton. J : H . H. Ammond, Chairman." . From the Nashville Agriculuriltprepari Of Of Of Cottons For Market. U Eufajtla, Barbour County, :ALBAMAApril 25, 1845. Gentleme : Hours of the 14th instant, was received by last nights mail, calling on the for my system of preparing for market fine cottons. Sit at all times affords me the greatest pleasure to do or say anything that may in any way be of any service to my brother farmers, I lose no time in replying to your inquiries. At to the point. I live in latitude about 31 . The land I cultivate is poor pine land, which would riot sell at the present time for five dollars per acre, (though I am at this time making a great effort to enrich it by maturing. We cultivate our cotton on the usual plan adopted in this section of country, taking care to keep it clean, and not suffering it to be injured by grass or weed sloughing it late with the sweep or buzz and plough; so that when we commence picking in the fall, there is not a particle of grass or weeds. We commence picking out as soon as the cotton opens; and here is one of the great secrets of making fine cottons. Last r we commenced on the 7th of August, and picked out in that month nearly one third of our crop, as we made but about one hundred thousand pounds of seed cotton. 1 find at page 132 of my Farming Memorandum, for 1844, the following entry, to wit Picked out in August -2 1000 pounds. To. September -36000Do. October -3800095000So you discover that our crop was nearly out by the first of November. We take all the care we possibly can in picking it out of the field, not suffering our pickets to pick any; or, at any rate, we avoid trash as much as possible, as we average only about 100 pounds per day; and it is not uncommon in this country to nearly double that amount in picking. It is then dried on a scaffold. We always require our hands to pick it over as the baskets are emptied on the scaffold. It is only the hands that are not employed in weighing that are engaged in picking it over. After it is dried we pack it away closely, and suffer it to remain in bulk some three months, for the purpose of drawing oil from the seed, which gives the cot- *a. S 'a- *a* *a* ;a* *a. ' ;770o
ton that beautiful cream color, or golden tinge, so much admired, and adds to its value some two cents in the pound, provided it is not heated too much ; for it may be completely ruined by over heating. We gin with a fine saw gin. When we start our gin we set some five hands to picking over the cotton before the gin, to pick out the remaining trash that may be left in the cotton, and the yellow ends of balls, that greatly injure the cotton if suffered to remain and be gin ned up with it. We run our cotton through a blue after it leaves the brush. This blue is about eight feet long, and is so constructed that all the dirt and fine trash, in passing over the fingers or ribs of the blue, falls in a box below, and is emptied out once a day. We run our gin extremely slow so much so that the cotton is not passed from the brush sufficiently hard to throw it out of the blue: consequently, a hand pulls it out of the mouth of the blue. One hand drives the mules, though a boy will answer for that purpose; then the dinner and the five hands picking over, and the hand that pulls it out of the blue, and a boy that hands the cotton to the dinner making in all eight hands, though most of then, are small hands. We do not suffer much cotton to remain in our room that holds the picked cotton, but pack often. We take the greatest care, in packing, not to suffer the cotton to be trod in the box, but run the screw down on it twice or three times, as every time the cotton is trod on, it de faces it to some extent. We are very particular to put up our cotton in nice packages, with the best bagging and rope, carefully sewing up the sides and ends. We make three distinct qualities of cotton, as every farmer, I think, should do. We place our name and residence on the first and second quality; on the third quality we put the letter M. The past year we made 59 bales, in the following order: 31 marked A. Mcdonald, Eufaula, La, (with 3 F.;) 16 bales, A. Mcdonald, Eufaula, La, (2 F.;) 12 bales marked Of. The M cotton we sold at Appalachicola for 4 cents; most of the 2 F. we have sold in New York at 7 cents ; the 3 F. we have refused 9 cents for, and expect to eat 10 cents. It took us something over three months to p i out our cotton out of the field, and about two months to gin it, with nearly as many hands as it took to pick it out, as we gin but little over a bag a day. Thus, Messrs. Editors, you discover that it is a tedious business to make fine cotton ; but I think I am amply paid for my pains, not only in money, but what I esteem more my standing as a farmer. Your friend and obedient servant, Alexander Mcdonald. Messrs. Cameron & Fall. P. Messrs. Editors, I have endeavored to be particular in answering your inquiries as to the plan of making fine cottons. We made last year near five bales to the hand; weighing 490 pounds; but ours is completely the cotton growing region. This important plant loves a southern sun. If I lived in Tennessee, I would, by taking the same pains with the products that were intended by the Almighty to be reared in that more northern latitude, if I am not greatly deceived, be as successful as I have been with cotton. Agriculture is a great business; it has to be studied as a science. He, as farmers, must procure all the lights that we can, to succeed in our honorable a vocation. A. Act. N. The cultivate, as we have stated, poor pine land. We made last year about 1,000 pounds of cotton to the acre. By a system of manuring
71that4i have now commenced. I have no fears I it that 1 can double that quantity, and make 50 b bushels of corn to the acre. We made, last year 6000 bushels of manure: we expect to more than double it this year. A. Act. From Silver and Smiths European Fires, January 4, 1846. Of   Verpool Annual Cotton Report. The review of the year 1845 is simple. The fluctuations in fair qualities of upland and Orleans cotton, from the highest to the lowest, have exceeded 12 per cent, and the import, generally, has been profitable. The season opened under favorable auspices. The stock on hand was large, f but prices were so low as to inspire confidence. All expectation of an overwhelming import, which had operated so pre judicial ly in the month of November, and in the beginning of December, 1844, had disappeared before the month of January of the present year, and the result now proves the American crop to have been 2,394,500 bales, exclusive of 25,900 bales from Texas. It is true that there are many, who, in January last, believed this to be an over calculation, and, under the conviction that the growth would not exceed 2,100,000 to 2,200,000 bales, prices rather advanced in that and the following month. In addition to this motive for action, common both to the speculators and the trade, the announcement of the intended repeal of the duty on cotton furnished fresh stimulus, and the sales were very extensive. But, in spite of this, the month of March, by a combination of circumstances, proved to be unsatisfactory, since, instead of advancing, the market declined -d. per lb. The duty of -a 5 per lb. on cot ten wool, however, being then taken off, the real difference in money to holders was not important; but as many of them, in the first instance, expected to gain that amount, the disappointment seemed almost equivalent to a loss. In the early part of April, the statements as to crop, which had, as just stated, been gradually diminishing, now began again to increase, and the receipts intothe ports seemed to justify the new anticipations. It was for a time in vain that the buying here continued large, and that the probability of dissension between the United States and this country respecting the Oregon territory was again brought more prominently forward by the declaration of both parties in the House of Commons as to the general determination of the legislature not to surrender our early rights to the disputed country. All was unavailing, under the pressure of the heavy stock and increasing supply, to raise prices. In the contrary, they again receded. This state of things, it is true, was only of short duration, for the profits realized by spinners being at least 2d. to 3d. per lb. at the end of April, and in the beginning of May, the decline was again recovered, and the excitement upon the American question seemed to gain fresh force. It is certain that neither then nor at any time since has it been generally believed that the discussion would terminate seriously ; yet a certain degree of fear has existed, that, previously to any final arrangement, so angry a feeling might be raised as to interpose increased difficulties. The negotiations were now rendered more delicate and critical from the decided manner in which each, party had asserted its claim, and with every wish to avoid actual hostilities yet, in discussions between nations, the slightest un toward incident may lead to open rupture. It is this sal me sentiment which still prevails; and 772 which has always more or less entered into the views of holders throughout the year. The message of the President is of a nature to confirm this impression. Returning, however, to the question more immediately before us, June was a month of large business, though without any advance in price. The only new feature which manifested itself was that of advice was to the appearances of the coining crop of 1845 46, which. were not propitious. Though the period of the year was far too early to form any correct judgment, yet the plant terminated, it was said, so un favorably as, in the opinion of many, to furnish a reasonable motive for steaminess in prices. In July, the intelligence continued to be of the same description and it was then also supposed that the crop would be later than usual. Speculators, encouraged by the facilities of the money market, as well as by the continued prosperous state of trade, and the low ness of prices, purchased largely on the one hand, whilst the spinners, on the ether, deemed it prudent to keep up their stocks to a point beyond their usual quantity. It was the large supply in the port alone which tended to keep the market in check. The weather might have had some little effect at that period bit this was only slightly regarded, though circumstances have since proved of what immense importance was its then character. Before the end of August, all apprehensions as to the harvest, if any were ever seriously entertained, seemed for a time to subside, and the market again improved. The stock of American cotton had reached its maximum of 832,000 bales. This amount now began sensibly to diminish, and the month of September was one in which the business trans acted was of vast extent. In the beginning of October, in consequence of the alleged deficiency of yield in the wheat crop, and of the injury done to the <a name="potato1040"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop in this and other countries, a settled, dull, and anxious feeling began to prevail; and this continued unabated throughout the remainder of the month. November was still more discouraging, and a second advance in the rate of interest to 3- per cent, by the Bank of England, (the rate of interest had already been raised, on thqi6th of October, from 21 to 3 per cent) effectually destroyed all hope of change for the better in the money market; and with this all prospect of amendment in cotton seemed for the moment to be annihilated. During the present month of December, there has been a regular and steady demand daily; but a tighter state of the money market, coming, too, at a period of the year when there is always rather a desire, than otherwise, to liquid ate existing engagements, and to diminish the amount of responsibility, both on the part of merchants and brokers, had, until counteracted by the ad van ces of the last packet, bringing reduced estimates of crop, operated still further to depress prices, and to throw a gloom over commercial transactions generally. The projected change in the ministry, and the uncertainty of the immediate effect of the measures to be proposed with reference to the opening of the ports for the admission of grain, and the abolition of the corn laws, have contributed still more to un settle the public mind, and in the doubt that has been raised, and the hopes and fears which have alternately predominated, trade has suffered, and confidence has been considerably shaken. The railway deposit e question, also, which belongs to another part of our subject, has likewise been one of the principal causes of the distrust which has pervaded the moneyed interest, and through this influence essential injury has been done to the holders of cotton. Having now alluded more especially to tie fluctuations in the article itself, other events of the year, as they are more or less indirectly connected
73with it, call for a few observations. The first one of these in the order of time, and probably In importance, as it refers to cotton itself, is the ab rotation of the whole import duty, which is one of the most remarkable events in the history of commercial policy. It is a measure fraught with wisdom, not only as being in itself of vital importance to the country, but as a precedent for other changes of a like nature. It will tend to give a still greater development to the manufacturing energies of Great Britain, aid will better enable us to compete, in common and heavy fabrics, with that very country the United States) where the raw material itself is produced. It had been a growing complaint, that the duty, which constitutes in coarse goods so heavy a per cent age upon the cost, was causing our manufactures to be superseded in the South American markets; and it was to correct the evil in that hemisphere, and to prevent its extension to I india, upon which so much of our future prosperity depended, that, seeing the financial state of the country would bear the abstraction, the government wisely abandoned this branch of revenue, though it is certain that, for immediate popularity, other reductions might have been selected, and other taxes taken off, which would have been more acceptable to the multitude. This act of the government cannot be too much commended. The next point which calls for comment is the mania in railway speculation during the greater part of the year. The words of the historian of 1720 describe in so accurate a spirit the folly of 1845, that it can hardly be out of place to quote them. Speaking of the South sea and other schemes of that day, he says: "all distinctions of party, religion, sex, character, and circumstances, were swallowed up in this universal concern, or in some such pecuniary project. Exchange alley was filled with a strange concourse of statesmen and clergymen, church men and dissenters, whigs and tories, physicians and lawyers, tradesmen, and even with multitudes of women. All other professions and employments were utterly neglected, and the peoples attention wholly engrossed by this and other chimerical schemes, which were known by the denomination of bubbles. The sums proposed to be raised by different expedients amounted to 300,000,U00 sterling, which exceeded the value of all the land of England. The nation was so intoxicated by the spirit of adventure, that people became a prey to the gross est delusion." By a most valuable sycosis, published in the London Times newspaper last month, it will be seen that 47 completed railway companies had paid up and borrowed 70,000,000 ; that t 18 lines in the course of construction, and for which acts of Parliament had been obtained, required 67,000,000 ; that for the railways projected, amounting to 1,263 companies, 59,000,000 of deposites would be necessary; so that the total capital invested and required, (taking the amount actually paid up at 54,000,000 in railways completed, and those in course of execution, sanctioned already by Parliament, into account, together with 59,000,000to be paid of deposites upon new lines) would be 113,000,000. Thus, to carry out these projects, including the money already borrowed590000000 would be necessary the very magnitude of which sum must strike every one is evidenting the highest degree of insanity in any nation which could entertain projects involving such an out lay. The deposit e question, as it has been generally designated, arose out of this extraordinary state of things. By the act 1st and 2d Victoria, it is rendered imperative that the deposites upon the undertakings in question should be paid into the Bank of England, to the credit of the Accountant General774 *a* Doc, . No. 140.-within 14 days after the meeting of Parliament. It is true that the check so opportune ly given by the Bank of England, by raising the rate of interest, effectually put an end to many of the schemes; but it was supposed, iii the first instance, that a sufficient number had complied with the forms necessary to make the deposit e alone 20,000,000. Subsequent information has led to the conviction that this sum was greatly over stated, and that the amount required will not be 10,000,000; but during the time that the process has been going on of wedding out the lines which had not complied with the necessary formalities, great uneasiness has existed in the money market. The banking interest all along has felt quite unable to explain how the difficulty would be met; and, although certain that, from the total impossibility of complying with the law, there must be some mode of extra eating the country from its embarrassment, yet, even now that .1000 000 only are supposed to be required, the moneyed interest is necessarily upon its guard; for to withdraw this sum, if only for a few days, from the requirements of trade, would be to put a stop to the whole machinery of the circulation, and de range all branches of public financial arrangements. The Presidents message, though looked for with great anxiety, has produced less effect than might have been expected. I to tendency by a few is not thought to be un pacific; but the general it y of persons consider, notwithstanding its calmness of tone, that there is a determination pe reading it which is anything but amicable in spirit, or generous in feeling. It seems to breathe a decision of purpose hardly concealed by the moderation of its language. I to demands assume conclusions which are most exaggerated and its harsh est and worst feature is, that it seems to close the door, by anticipation, to all interference in a matter which, in case quarrel is to be avoided, can best be arranged by foreign friendly arbitration. It is difficult to suppose that nations so wise and so enlightened as our own and that of the United States should not recoil from the idea of war for the sake of so trifling an object as the possession of a wilderness, separated from both countries by rocks and deserts on the one hand, and by the ocean n n the other; but as there is a point beyond which concession would be considered weakness, it is impossible to say what may be the result. The deductions to be drawn from all the facts before us are, as usual, liable to much uncertainty ; and the crop, after all, in the opinion of most persons, is the main point upon which, as far as cotton is concerned, the future depends. There are some who rate this high, and consider that it will reach 2,300,000 to 2,400,000 bales; but there are others equally well informed, who pretend that 2,200,000 bales will be the maximum. Added to this contingent y, there is the certainty of a large consumption and a good trade, and the re m te possibility of war; but the transactions of this year, as far as regards speculators, have been so unfortunate that it is probable the market will be left very much to the trade for some time to come, and under these circumstances it is rare for prices to improve either very rapidly or considerably. Decline seems considered by every one to be out of the question; but whether or not any material advance is to be experienced; depends so much upon points that are yet doubtful, that to predict an important rise, should it prove to be the case, would be rather a fortunate conjecture than the result of reasoning which at present could be fully justified.

775S From Silver and Smiths European Times, January 4, 1846. Smnchester Marketannual Report. In addressing you with our two last annual circulars, e had occasion to notice the general fulfilment of the expectation we had held out at the commencement of each period embraced by them, of a satisfactory course of business. Seldom, however, have our prospects appeared of a more propitious character than those which ushered in the past year, 1845. The demand for our manufactures abroad and at home was gradually and steadily increasing, employment of the working population was very abundant, food of all descriptions was plentiful and cheap, capital was accumulation g and seeking every channel for employment which offered any fair chance of being a profitable investment; and as our foreign political relations were without the appearance of any immediate interruption, confidence was general throughout the commercial world. With a combination of such favorable circumstances, and with an abundant supply of the raw material, which forms the basis of the staple manufactures of this district, and of which, independently of the large stock in Liverpool, so considerable a portion was also held by spinners and manufacturers, as to prevent the probability of success being gained by any extensive speculation in the Liverpool cotton market should such be attempted, it was not difficult to conclude that the course of our market would be favorable for sometime forward. For the first two months of 1845 we had a continuance of the favorable aspect which characterized our market at the close of the previous year, and prices gradually, but decidedly, advanced for most of our staples. The months of March and April witnessed a less active state of business the market being influenced by the long continuance of the frost, (which retarded for a time the usual continental dem a d) by unsatisfactory advice from the Bombay and Calcutta markets, and also by an uneasiness which began to be entertained for the settlement with the United States of our claim upon the "oregon" territory. The effect of these circumstances was a decline in prices generally, and which reached to a greater extent before the end of April than was previously expected. The month of May, however, showed a renewal of the demand, and prices were extremely steady, with a slight tendency upward, which became more decided in the succeeding months of June and July, when a considerable advance took place. In the early part of August, fears began to be entertained as to the result of the harvest, the weather being generally unsettled throughout the country. The month of September was one of critical importance to the maintenance of the prosperity which may be said to have characterized every previous month of the year; the early part of it gave promise of those expectations being realized which were formed upon the improvement of the weather towards the close of the previous month; but these were soon succeeded by renewed fears in consequence of a return of the un propitious weather, which continued until it became evident that the harvest could not be secured in good condition, and that the yield would be deficient in both quantity and quality. In October a new ground of alarm began It present itself in the unexpected and serious failure in the <a name="potato1041"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop, and which not only existed in this country, but extended itself throughout the continent of Europe, besides occurring again in the United States. I twas in this month, also, that the Bank of England deemed it necessary to 7 76 raise their rate of discounts, for the first time during the past year; and this, accompanied as it was by increased rates of discounts throughout the country, brought on a tightness of money generally, (and especially in the share market) and led to a sudden and rapid decline in the prices of all shares many of which became almost totally un sale able. The effect of this reaction was not confined to strip shares, but extended also in a smaller but still serious degree to shares in the long established and dividend paying lines, which declined sympathetically, and often with less discrimination to their respective merits than to the strength or weakness of their holders. The combination of these un toward circumstances could not exist without producing considerable influence upon the state of our own market; and during the month of October a general languid ness existed, which was followed, in November, by a sudden and most serious decline in the value of every description of goods and yarns. The difficulties which combined in producing this decline were no doubt much increased by the uncertainty then and still. existing as to the manner in which the railway deposites are to be paid over to the Accountant General on the opening of Parliament, and which rendered the bankers unusually tight with their customers; and were also further enhanced by unsatisfactory advices from the United States respecting the 4 Oregon" question. Towards the end of October, and in the month of November, a general impression existed that government would open the ports, by an order in council, for the admission of foreign grain and provisions, with the view of averting the evils attendant upon the impending scarcity; but as a succession of cabinet councils were held, and broke up without any such determination having been come to, the general gloom and want of confidence was continued and augmented towards the close of the month, and was evidenced in this market by sales being pressed at most sacrificing rates. The same features have since continued with more or less intensity during the month of December, attaining their maximum towards the middle of the month, and during the continuance of the ministerial crisis which succeeded the resignation of Air Robertpeel and his cabinet. Since his resumption of office, more confidence has been felt throughout the country; and our market, although without any decided improvement in prices, may be considered rather stead ier and firmer; for it is felt that he has the power to carry through Parliament such measures as the country in its present critical position requires. Similar to the course of our own market has been, with little exception, that of the Liverpool cotton market. Throughout the early part of the year, and up to the month of September, spinners and manufacturers purchased freely, although a gradual advance was taking place in prices during that period, and which, notwithstanding the remission of the import duty on the 22d of March, of -the of a penny per pound, amounted, by September, to fully the to id. per pound, average. Upon reference to the Liverpoolbrokers' circular, we find the trade had taken, up to the 26th of September1151210 bales, or at the rate of 30,295 bales per week an excess over the power of consumption, according to the best estimate we can form for the year 1845, of fully 3,000 bales per week. At this period the same unfavorable circumstances, of which we have more minutely traced the operation on our own market, began to have their influence on the state of the cotton market also; and we find, from the same authority, that the quantity of cotton taken by the trade during the remainder of the year, up to the 26th December, amounted to only 245,010 bales, or an average of 18,847 bales
77per week; thus making the total quantity taken, from January 1st up to that date, 1,396,220 bales, or a weekly average, for 51 weeks, of 27,377bales. Notwithstandi no e recently diminished supplies taken by the trade as above noticed, we are of opinion that they still hold as large a supply of cotton as they did at the close of the year 1844. In confirmation of this opinion, we would beg reference to the following table, showing the mann or in which they have taken their supplies from the Liverpool market for the last two yearsDeliveries of cotton for consumption from the port of Liverpool.

In the first twenty-two weeks of the year 1844, viz: up to May 3 1st, and in consequence of the speculation which existed in the cotton market, the purchases made by the trade amounted to only 467,910 bales, or an average of 21,269 bales per week, by which time their stocks must no doubt have been reduced to a very low point. After this period, and up to the 3 1st of December, 1844, when prices continued rapidly to decline, they took their supplies much more freely; for we find that, for the remaining thirty weeks, they amounted to 844,421 bales, or a weekly average of 28 147 bales ; the total quantity taken in the whole year of 1844 being1312331 bales, or an average of 25,237 bales per week, whilst the estimated consumption of the year was about 24,000 bales per week, as we showed in our last annual circular. From these circumstances, and upon reference to the above table, it will be seen that from June 1st to December 3 1st, 1844,they must for thirty weeks have taken an average weekly supply of about 4000 bales per week in excess of their consumption; and from January 1st to September 26, 1845, for thirty-eight weeks, allowing of 3,000 bales per week as the increased amount of consumption of 184.5pver 1844, they must have still added to their previously large stocks fully 3,000 bales per week more for that period. In corroboration of this view, we would further notice the circumstance shown in the above table, that, from June 1, 1844,to September 26, 1845, a period of sixty eight weeks, the supplies to the trade amounted to 1,995,631 bales, or 29,348 bales per week; during which time there was every inducement to increase their stocks to as great an extent as they could conveniently hold, from the circumstance of cotton ruling at very low prices; money being abundant, the demand for twist and goods very extensive, and likely to continue so; and, above all, from the increasing abilities of the trade, from the profits they have lately realized, to invest a larger amount of capital in a stock of the raw staple than they were formerly able to do so; the fluctuations to which they were in past years subjected, and from which they occasionally suffered severely 7 78 by the action of speculations in the Liverpool cotton market, rendering in obviously to the interest (as undoubtedly it is becoming the practice of all who have the power) to maintain a large stock of cotton beforehand, so as to take advantage of the most favorable opportunities for making their purchases. The supplies of this material for the coming year appear likely to be abundant, as the advices just received from the United States indicate a probable crop of 2,300,000 to 2,400,000 bales; and as the estimated stock in Liverpool, on the 26th of December last, is, 889,970, against 727,660 at the same period of 1844, (an amount greater than ever previously held at that period of the year) there can be but little grounds for apprehension of any undue excitement in the Liverpool market which can seriously interfere with prices, notwithstanding the speculation going on in America, unless in the event of a war with that country becoming probable. Having cursorily alluded to the principal features which have characterized the course of our market, and also the cotton market in Liverpool, during the past year, we may now glance at the particulars of our export trade in cotton manufactures. For this purpose, we beg your reference to the following table, showing the amount of exports from January 1st to November 2 3d, in the years 1844 and 1845 respectively, with particulars of the increases and decreases to the several markets. a.

81served that the increases are chiefly to Germany, Holland, and Naples and Sicily, whilst the chief decreases have been to Had ras, Calcutta, Bombay, the Meant markets, and Russia. The total amount of increase in the exportation of yarn would appear to be by no means sufficient to account for the comparatively high prices at which all descriptions of yarns have ruled throughout the year, when 'contrasted with piece goods, and which we have so frequently had to notice in our monthly circulars during the past year. We have previously attributed these comparatively high rates of yarn to the circumstance that, in the years 1843 and 1844, when trade began generally to revive, a much more rapid increase took place in putting down new looms than spinning machinery; which last not only involves more capital, but also requires much more time for construction ; and we think the above table bears out the opinion we have before expressed, that the buoyant y of the yarn market was chiefly occasioned by the demand for the supply of the new looms. Referring to the exports of piece goods for the periods embraced in the above table, it will be found that the principal increases are to Phil i and Peru, China, It. Thomas, British West In dies, Syria and Palestine, British North America, and the United States whilst the principal decreases have been to Bombay, Turkey and Greece, Portugal, Egypt, and the Brazils. The total increase in the export of piece goods and twist shows a satisfactory progress in the state of that branch of our trade ; but when it is remembered that there has been an increase in the consumption of cotton during the past year, compared with 1844, of probably 150,000 bales, or about 12- per cent, and that of piece goods to about 5 per cent, there must be a large residue left, either for home consumption or for increase of stocks held on hand. That the latter partially exist at the present moment there can be no doubt; but not to such an extent as in any way to account for the increased consumption of cotton. In point of fact, until the panic came upon our market in the month of October, there might be said to be no stocks of any moment held by manufacturers of any description of goods; and from all we have seen, we have every reason to think that there has been a large increase in the home consumption of our manufacture throughout o the year. A similar feature to the above, in the position of the home trade, is exhibited in the following table com piled from the official accounts of the Board of Trade, of articles entered for home consumption from January 1st to November 5th respectively in the years 1841 to 1845, inclusive Articles entered.

From the above table, it will be observed that a decided increase has taken place in the consumption of all the articles specified, and which, it will be seen, embrace all the principal necessary luxuries of life, and upon which four fifths of the total revenue derived from our imports is levied. Such a considerable increase as exhibited in most of the articles here enumerated could only have taken place, or can be maintained, whilst the great mass of the people are profit ably employed, and the first necessaryes of life are cheap. Whether a similar satisfactory result will be exhibited in the next and in future years, depends much upon the course which our legislature may follow on the important questions which will doubtless come under discussion in the ensuing session of Parliament. The several changes which have of late years taken place in our commercial legislation, indicate a better appreciation of what we conceive to be sound principles than formerly existed. The most important step made in this direction was the partial revision of the tariff during the past year, when the duty upon cotton wool, together with that upon 430 other articles, which yielded but trifling amounts of revenue, and including silk, hemp, flax, dye stuffs, &c, was totally repealed, and a considerable reduction was was made in the sugar duties also. This change in the tariff gave, we believe, very general satisfaction to the country, (and particularly to the commercial classes) the more especially as it was thought to indicate but the commencement of a policy which would hereafter be more fully developed. In the proposal for a modification of the sugar duties, it was estimated that the reduction in price would lead to an increased consumption of that article, and that the total amount for the year would reach 250,000 tons, or 5,000,000 cut, the largest previous consumption being for the year 1844, when it amounted to 207,000tons, or 4,140,000 cut. The above table, although embracing but ten months of the year, and only eight months during which the new scale of duties has been in operation, exhibits already an increase in the consumption over the entire year 1844; and we can have little doubt that the consumption of the whole year, under the new duties, will exceed the estimated amount. We cannot, whilst upon this subject, refrain from expressing a hope that, at no distant period, the distinction which has been continued in the late tariff, and has excluded us from availing ourselves directly of the supplies of sugar afforded by the Brazilian market and by the Spanish colonies, will be discontinued; for already has a spirit of retaliation been shown by the Brazilian government, in the increased disadvantages under which our trade has been placed, and by the curtail men t of the political and civil privileges formerly enjoyed by British subjects trading with that country. In concluding our remarks upon the recent changes in the tariff, we are strongly reminded of the necessity which exists of as early a revision of the tea duties as practicable, so that we may reap the full advantage of the liberal and enlightened treaty made with us by the Chinese. Although many articles of returns will continue to offer, and pro by in increasing quantities, from the Chinese ports with which we carry on trade, it is pretty evident that, for a considerable time at least, the principal article in payment for our exports must be tea the only present limit being that of our consumption, and the extension, therefore, necessarily resting with ourselves only. When it is considered the duty now levied upon tea amounts to 2s 3d. per lb, whilst the price of common Long on, which furnishes about two thirds, probably, of the whole amount consumed, is now only 10s. per lb the extent to which the duty enhances the cost to the consumer will be. 783 readily understood. Although, since the year 1841, the above table shows an increase of consumption of nearly 25 per cent, and a proportion ally larger increase than any other leading article specified, this only indicates the more strongly the growing favor of the population for this luxury, and the probability that the consumption would be very greatly augmented by a liberal reduction in the duty. In looking to the future prospects of our market, it is impossible to form a very decided opinion so much being immediately depend ant upon the future policy of our legislature, the course of which, under existing circumstances, it would be almost idle to speck late upon. We therefore refrain from offering any prospective remarks of this nature. George Fraser, Son & Of. January 1 1846. From Silver & Smiths European Times, January 4. Cottons1 Havrie, December 31. During the last s en night our market has worn a decidedly improved appearance, both as to the amount of business trans acted and to the increased stiffness in prices, which may be considered a shade higher than our previous quotations. The formation of the British ministry has, generally speaking, created a favorable impression, and confidence seems daily to be gaining ground. The demand has therefore been rather animated, and to a good extent; and amongst the sales was a cargo of 1,700 bales expected from New Orleans, by the Osceola, taken at f. 67 all round. At this dull season of the year it is not usual to look for any great activity; but as our stock is far from large, and the internal districts are but scantily supplied, it is more than probable that early in the ensuing year the -trade will becoming forward more freely, and that the transactions will then assume a spirited character. The receipt of the Presidents message, which has long been expected with a certain degree of anxiety, seems to have produced little impression, for, although the tone is not in a conciliatory strain, it has given no rise to any serious apprehensions as to the future. Taking are prospective view of the year that has just closed, we find that the situation of our market has, upon the whole, been unstable; for, notwithstanding the moderate stock of cotton on hand during the last twelvemonth, speculation has, at no period, been extensive, nor of long duration; and if, in consequence of an unusual briskness, holders have had high pretensions, buyers have immediately withdrawn from the field, under the plea of the large stock in. Liverpool, and the un prosperous state of the manufacturing districts. Latterly, the high price of bread stuffs, added to the fears of a death and of a financial crisis, have acted very pre judicial ly to commerce in general; but these were evidently much exaggerated, and the public mind in snow completely recovered from the panic. It must, however, be admitted that if a portion of the working districts have been in a comparatively satisfactory condition, the reverse has been the case with others; and it is only to the trifling importance of a raw i material that can be ascribed the steaminess in prices for some time past.

From the New York Farmer. Mr. Clark, to whom we are indebted for many valuable facts, in speaking of the silk culture in America, divides it into three periods. He says' The first period may be said to have continued from the first introduction of the silk culture in North America, in 1623, to the close of the revolutionary war, in 1783, or for 160 years< The second epoch is from that event to the time when there was in this country public evidence of decisive knowledge of the multicaulis (Chinesemulberryor to July, 1830." The second epoch, then, in the history of the American silk culture, commenced in 1783. Notwithstanding the desolation generally introduced by war, which, where internal, has too frequently a continued effect, the silk enterprise was, though somewhat gradually, renewed. It was precisely at this period (1783) that the legislature of Connecticut, induced by the exertions of Dr. Spin wall and the Rev. Dr. Style S, granted a bounty on mulberry trees and raw silk. In 1789, 300 pounds of raw silk were made in Mansfield, which in 1793 produced 365 pounds of raw silk. In 1810 these wings and raw silk of New London, Mind ham, and Holland were valued by the United States marshal at                           $28,503, exclusive of the amount of domestic fabrics ; and double this entire amount is said to have been man u fractured there in 1825. To popular, indeed, had silk products become about this period, that they were readily taken then as a circulating medium About the period of the last war, a good degree of interest existed, and many were successfully engaged in its culture. Mr. Samuel Chidsey, ofCayuga county, New Work, is said to have raised, manufactured, and sold       $600 worth of sewing silk in a year, and several establishments were in successful operation in Tennessee, Kentucky, and I illinois. To much interest existed at this time, that members of the House of Representatives were strongly in favor of affording governmental encouragement, and a bill was accordingly introduced, and favorably received, recommending the appropriation of                $40,000 for the establishment of a normal school for silk reeling in Philadelphia, for the gratuitous instruction of sixty young men, for two years, in the various branches of reeling, manufacturing, and dyeing silk. For some reason, this bill received no final action until 1832, when it was defeated by a small majority. The third epoch, according to Mr. Clark, commenced at the time when the multicaulis, or China mulberry, became sufficiently known to induce its propagation, or about 1831 32. This was a brief era, characterized by the wildest and most erroneous theories. It would require volumes to detail the thousand and one schemes resorted to for creating and sustaining what has been termed the mulberry excitementmulticaulis speculation. The history of this visionary period is too fresh in the minds of most of our citizens to need review 806 from the Southern Cultivator, A Bri Of Of Story Of The Of  Of Culture In Georgi Ety the Rev. William B. Stevens, of the University of Georgia. [from Harriss Memoirs ofOglethorpeOne of the principal designs which influenced the settlement of Georgia was the hope of thereby creating a silk growing province, where that material, for which England had so long been indebted to France, I talk, and China, could be produced in this colonial dependency, As early as 1609, the subject engaged the attention of the adventurers to Virginia, and in a pamphlet called " Nova Brittania offering most excellent fruites by planting in Virginia" published that year, the writer says: "there are silkwormes and plenty of bulb erie trees, whereby ladies, gentle women, and little children, (being set in the way to do it) may bee all implied with pleasure, making silk e comparable to that of Persia, Turkey, or any other." In 1650, Mr. Samuel Hartlib published a work entitled Virginia Discovery of Silk Worries, with their Benefits" in which he endeavored to show that the raising of silk was a thing very practicable in Virginia, and even asserted that as a staple it might be made superior to tobacco ; in which opinion he was confirmed by the judgment of several others. That they made some advances in this culture is evident from the fact that the coronation robe of Charles I I , in 1660, was made of silk reeled in that colony; and even so late as 1730, three hundred pounds of the raw material were exported from Virginia. Tobacco, however, soon assumed and maintained the ascendancy, to the exclusion of this more useful and beautiful produce. In 1703, Air Nathaniel Johnson introduced the silk culture into Southcarolina, but the astonishing success which rewarded the casual introduction of rice into the plantation, about eight years before, precluded a just interest in the undertaking, and, as a public and recognised commodity, it soon came to naught, though several persons, more for amusement than profit, still gave their attention to it; and, as late as 1755, Mrs. Pinckney, the same lady to whom the province was indebted for the first cultivation of indigo ten years before, reeled sufficient silk in the vicinity of Charleston to make three dresses, one of which was presented to the princess dowager of Tales, another to Word Chesterfield, and the third (says Damsel, who narrated the circumstance) "is now (1809) in Charleston, in the possession of her daughter, Mrs. Sorry, and is remarkable for its beauty, firmness, and strength But notwithstanding these failures and the known difficulty of introducing a new branch of agriculture into a country, as was evidenced by the compulsion which was necessary by Henry I V to introduce it into France against the united voices of the merchants, traders, and even in opposition to the Duke of Fully, and also the indifference manifested in England notwithstanding the able proclamation of King James on the subject, commending its cultivation the trustees for the settlement of Georgia determined to make one more effort, which, if successful, would enrich both the province and the not her country. The views which they entertained, however, of making Georgia sup plant every silk growing country, were extravagant and erroneous. They expected, in fact, to supply all Europe, and to produce an article of equal strength, beauty, and value, with any made, 80 men the continent. The Piedmontese, thought they, who pay half their silk for the rent of the mulberry trees and the eggs of the worm, or the peasants of France, burdened with political difficulty and stinted for conveniences, could not cope with the settlers of Georgia, where the mulberrytrees (for us alba) would grow in the greatest luxuriant e: where timber for their fabrics was no expense; where room was abundant, and the reward sure By this transfer, in addition to a direct saving to England of over 500,000 which she paid for this article to foreign countries, twenty thousand people were to find employment in rearing it in Georgia, and as many more at home in preparing it for market. Among the first emigrants who sailed with Oglethorpe, from England, in November, 1732, was Mr. Mat is, from Piedmont, who was engaged by the trustees to introduce the art of silk winding into the colony, and who, for that purpose, brought with him several I italians and some adequate machinery. White mulberry trees were planted in a portion of land on the eastern border of the city, called the trustees' garden; eggs were hatched, and silk spun " as fine as any from France or I talk." They soon, however, came to a mutual rupture, and the whole process was for a time suspended by the treachery of those employed, who broke the machinery, spoiled the seed, destroyed the trees, and then escaped to Carolina. Sufficient, however, had been wrought to test its value, and they were not discouraged by this in auspicious commencement. The trustees still adhered to their design, and, the more effectually to advance it, required of every settler that there should be on his grant ten mulberry trees to each acre. Mr. Barn use and his wife, both I italians, with their two children, and two other individuals, were now intrusted with this business, in which they were continued six years ; the first two at a salary of 60 per annum, and the last four at 10, besides the rent of a dwelling house and garden. In June, 1734, General Oglethorpe carried eight pounds of raw silk, the first produced in Georgia, to England, which was followed by a small trunk full of the same article on the 2d of April, 1735, and, after being made intoorganzine by the engine of Air Thomas Tom be, at Derby, who said that itcid127proved exceedingly good through all the operations" was sent up to London on the 14th of August, 1735, when the trustees, together with Sirthomas Ljombe, waited on her Majesty Queen Caroline, and exhibited to her the elegant specimen of Georgia silk. 'the Queen selected a portion of this parcel to be wove into a pattern; and, being again waited on by these gentlemen and Mr. Tooth, the silk weaver, on the 2 1st of September, she expressed "a great satisfaction for the beauty and fine ness of the silk, the richness of the pattern, and at seeing so early a product from that colony 7 and to express her pleasure at such a favorable result, a complete court dress was made from it, and on his majestys next birthday she appeared at the levee in a full robe of Georgia silk. In the return of Oglethorpe, in 1735, he renewed his endeavors to bring it into active operation. For the purpose of obtaining a sufficient quantity of seed, he allowed no silk to be reeled that year, but let the worms deposit their eggs. He required, also, that the I italian women should teach a number of the colonists, and thus render general the knowledge they could impart. The Saltzburgers at Ebenezer were the most forward to adopt his views; and on March 28, 1736, Rev. Mr. Bolzius gave one tree to each inhabitant as a present from Oglethorpe, and two of his congregation were instructed in the art of reeling by Mrs. Amuse. But though Oglethorpe808 gave Mr. Bolzius trees, silkworms, and a book of instructions, yet he confesses that he felt no interest in the business, nor inclination to pursue it. In July, 1739, Mr. Samuel Augspourger carried over a parcel of raw silk which he received from Mr. Bones, the trustees' store keeper in Savannah, and which was declared by eminent judges to be "equal to any I italian silk, and worth full twenty shillings per pound in May 11, 1741, Mr. Bolzius, in his journal, states that a twenty girls, during the last two months, succeeded in making seventeen pounds of cochons, which were sold on Friday last at Savannah, for 3 8s." During this year General Oglethorpe advanced to Bolzius 5 for procuring trees, for which sum he obtained twelve hundred, and distributed twenty-two to each family in his parish. In May 1, 1742, fourteen pounds and fourteen ounces were sold, which brought 2 19s. 6d. Nearly half of the silkworms died at Savannah, owing, as was then supposed, either to poison dew or warm weather. In December 4, 1742, General Oglethorpe sent five hundred trees toEbenezer, with the promise of more, if required. The indifference of the good Mr. Bolzius had by this time passed away, and he was now a zealous advocate for its extension. A machine was erected near his house, and two women succeeded very well, by which the people were stimulated to renewed exertions, and a public feature was contemplated. The enterprise of these Germans seemed to excite the envious disposition of Mrs. Amuse, with whom had been placed two women from Ebenezer; but the conduct of Mrs. C. in with holding information rendered their acquirement inadequate, and Mrs. Bolzius withdrew them from her charge. The first parcel of silk made was sent to the trustees, who expressed themselves pleased with its quality. In 1745, the weight of cochons was two hundred and fifty-three pounds, and of spun silk sixteen and three quarters. In 1746, the weight of cochons was three hundred and forty-four pounds, and of spun silk eighteen pounds. Early in this year a machine for winding, and coppers for baking, together with appropriate treatises on the art, were sent over by the trustees, but the people were indifferent and apathetic. The Germans, however, were as active as formerly, and Mr. Bolzius, in a letter to On Lunch, dated May 6, 1747, says, that " the people last winter planted more mulberry trees than for thirteen years before" for which he promised them a bounty of one shilling for every tree which yielded one hundred pounds of leaves. The silk balls raised at this place this year were over four hundred pounds, three hundred and sixty-six pounds of which sold for 36 12s. 10d. The amount raised in the whole colony was eight hundred and forty seven pounds of cochons, and sixty-two pounds of spun silk. In 1748, the Saltzburgers reared four hundred and sixty-four pounds, but their small trees were destroyed, and some of the larger ones injured by the late frost. They, this year, succeeded admirably in spinning twenty-four pounds of raw silk, the want of a chimney and proper basins, which had impeded them before in their rude building, having been remedied. The president, writing to secretary Party n, December 11, 1746,says: " The fundamental cause of its stagnation is, the unaccountable backwardness of some of our dames and damsels to employ themselves in attending to the worms during the time of feeding, which I have frequently taken notice of, and it cannot be imputed to the want of leaves During the same period only thirty-four pounds of spun silk were raised by the trustees' agent in Savannah. Mr. Bolzius, under date of Februarydec. No. 140. 80015, 1749, thus writes: "the weather being now warm and pleasant, themulberry trees have put forth their young leaves, and our people are now turning their minds towards making of silk ;" and then, after expressing his surprise that so few were disposed to this culture, adds: " One reason for this reluctance is ascribed to the circumstance that, by ordinary labor, about two shillings might be obtained per day, whereas scarcely a shilling could be earned in the same time by the silk concern." Even hundred and sixty-two pounds of cochons were raised, and fifty pounds thirteen ounces spun silk, and there were two machines erected in Mr. Bolziuss yard which drew off twenty four ounces per day. In the 29th September, 1749, the trustees promised 2 to every woman who shall make herself mistress of the art of winding in one year. And they also gave Rev. Mr. Bolzius permission to erect ten sheds, with clay furnaces, at an expense of not more than 2 each, and ten machines for reeling, at thirty shillings each, which he says could be made better than those at Savannah for 3: they also sent them ten basins; and the good Germans felt the impulse of this substantial encouragement. In 1750, though the people in other parts of the colony mostly relinquished the silk culture, the inhabitants of Ebenezercontinued vigorously employed and interested in it. In the 2d of June they received ten kettles from the trustees, one of which, and a reeling machine, were given to each mistress in the art of spinning, and two of the best artisans received 5 for giving instructions to fourteen young women ;to each of whom was bestowed 1 for attention and industry. Over a thousand pounds of cochons were raised at Ebenezer and seventy-four pounds two ounces raw silk made, producing (the price being then thirty shillings) over 110 sterling. As illustration of the luxuriant growth of the mulberry, it may be interesting to state that two trees in front of the parsonage, ten years old, measured three feet eight inches in circumference. In December, of this year, eight more copper basins were received, and public confidence in the success of the undertaking seemed revived, notwithstanding Mr. Amuse and family had left the province and settled at Purysburgh, in South Carolina. In the 25th December, 1750, Mr. Bickering Robinson, who, together with Mr. James Saber sham, had been appointed, the preceding August, a commissioner to promote more effectually the culture of silk, arrived in Savannah. Mr. Robinson had been sent to France, at the expense of the trustees, to study the management of features, and tie necessary process for preparing the article for market, and thus, though no operative, was qualified to take the director ship of so important a branch of industry. His salary was 100 per annum, 25 for a clerk, and a tract of land was also granted him, which, in 1763, sold for 1,300. Mr. Robinson brought with him a quantity of silkworm seed, but all failed save about half an ounce. The commissioners determined at once to erect a feature, which should be a normal school to the whole province and it was their opinion that it would be " a sufficient nursery to supply, in three or four years, as many revelers as will be wanted, when we make no doubt of many private features being erected, which can only make their culture a general staple." The f dimensions were thirty-six feet by twenty, rough boarded, with a left or upper story for the spreading out of the green cochons. It was commenced on the 4th of March, 1751. In the 1st of April, the basins were put up, and on the 8th of May the reeling       $8(1 began. To encourage the colonists, the trustees proposed to purchase all the bals, and wind them at their own expense, and paid ficid127omr .d. to 2s 4d, per pound for green cochons. The commissioners separated the cocoonsinto three sorts : 1st, perfect cones ;2d, the spring y and fully; and, 3d, the spotted, stained, and d unions, This management, however, gave great offence to some of the residents in Savannah and Purysburgh, and Messrs. Robinson and Saber sham requested the vice president and assistants to determine the respective prices, and publicly announce the same, which they did on the 26th April, by a proclamation; wherein, by way of bounty, they promised to pay for cochons, delivered at their store in Savannah, the following sums, namely: for cochons made by one worm, hard, weighty, and good substance. 2s. per pound; for the weaker quality, pointed, spotted, or bruised, I s ,3d; for d unions, (those made by two worms) 6d; for raw silk, from first quality cochons, 14s. per pound; for that made from second, quality, 12s; the product of the double cones, is. per pound; and they also offered, if delivered at the feature, for best cochons, is. 6d; for middling, 1s. 8d. ; and for inferior, I s. I d; a series of prices truly astonishing, when we reflect that the real merchant able worth of a pound of cochons is scarcely ever 6d. Experiments were made at the feature to ascertain the relative quantity of each of these qualities in a given weight of cochons, and the results were, that in fifty pounds of green cochons there were twenty-seven pounds of the first sort, ten pounds four ounces of the second, and twelve pounds twelve ounces of the third. After curing or baking, these fifty pounds weighed only forty-six pounds five ounces, showing a loss in ponderosityof nearly eight per cent. Besides the arrangement above specified, the cochons were still further divided for the purpose of reeling into white and yellow, and these again sub divided into five each, namely: 1st, hard and weighty; 2d, little woolly and weaker; 3d, very woolly and soft; 4th spotted and much bruised; 5th, double worms. Mr. Amuse, son, and daughter, who, it appears, gave the commissioners no little trouble by their perverse conduct, returned to Savannah, and were engaged to labor at the feature at three shillings per day; at which Mr. Saber sham exclaims, ' monstrous wages" The revelers now advanced w it h much proficient y, and five of them, on the 16th of May, wound off eleven pounds of cochons each. The proportion of raw silk to the cocoonsappeared, on a variety of trials, to be nearly in this ratio :may 10, 1751, 55 lbs. cochons, 1st quality, produced 117- ounces. 11, l 8 or thread, 18 "a" 13, " 11 " produced 21" 15, " 55 2d " " 109 C" 18, )a) 9 20 2 422, 15 " 1st a 201" 22, 10 2d " 13 The whole amount of cochons raised in the province was six thousand three hundred and one pounds, of ,which two thousand pounds came fromEbenezer, and four thousand pounds were made at White fields orphan house. Two hundred and sixty-nine pounds and one ounce of raw silk and one hundred and sixty one pounds of fiiogee, were prepared, iiotwitlistanding over three hundred and eighty pounds were lost by ver min, fire, and mould. The expense of the culture was large this year, owing to the. 81 1 erection of the feature, &c, which swelled the sum to 608 is. 81d. sterling. The private journals at that day, kept at Savannah and Ebenezer, acquaint us, in some measure, with the arduous nature of the commissioners labors, and the difficulties they encountered from the want of funds, the intractable ness of laborers, the novelty of the attempt, the imperfect sons of machinery, and the bitter opposition of those who should have sustained and encouraged them. The public duties of Mr. Saber sham prevented his constant attention to this business; but the whole time of Mr. Robinson was devoted to the features, directing the sorters, aiding the novices, advising the revelers, and in every way exerting himself to obtain success. His engagement with the trustees expired on the 30th of August, 175 1 ; but finding that his intended departure depressed the friends of the culture, he was solicited by the local government to remain another year, and, generously sacrificing private to public interests, he complied with their request. Mr. Saber sham thus speaks of Mr. Robinson: ' I think him the most prudent, as well as the most capable person I ever knew to undertake such a work, and if he could be continued here, I doubt not but that he would turn out a number of well instructed revelers, who would be able to conduct features at Ebenezer, Augusta, and other parts of the province." To great was the confidence which the trustees had in him, that he was appointed an assistant in the government at Savannah; an honor which he declined, and in the same letter stated: " If due encouragement be not given to the culture of raw silk for the term of at least fourteen years, I positively cannot think of settling in America." These gentlemen recommended the building of a house, sixty feet by twenty-six, as a cocoonery, great loss having been experienced for the want of such a structure. In 1752, Mr. Robinson returned to England, and his place was partially supplied by Joseph Ottolenghe, a native of Piedmont, and a proficient in his art, who came to Georgia on the 18th of July, 1751, and took charge of the feature in April, 1753. In a letter to secretary Party n, dated September 11, 1753, Mr. Ottolenghe says that " there were fewer cochons raised this year, as the worms mostly hatched before the trees leaved, and that 'the people were willing to continue the business" One hundred and ninety-seven pounds of raw silk were made this year, and three hundred and seventy-six pounds in 1754, besides twenty-four pounds of filosele. The people of Augusta became interested in this manufacture, and entered with considerable spirit into the undertaking, promising to send hands to Savannah, yearly, to learn the art of reeling: their enthusiasm, however, soonevaporated. In the 29th of March, 1755, a certificate signed by thirty-nine eminent silk throw steps and weavers was given to the commissioners for trade and plantations" stating that, after examining three hundred pounds of raw silk, imported from Georgia, " we do sincerely declare that the nature and texture is truly good, the color beautiful, the thread as even and as clear as the best Piedmont (called wire silk) of the size, and much clearer and even than the usual I italian silks ;" and furthermore, "it could be worked with less waste than China silk, and has all the properties of good silk, well adapted to the weavers art in most branches n 1755, five thousand four hundred and eighty-eight pounds of cocoonswere raised, and four hundred and thirty-eight pounds of raw silk spun. The good effects of the feature were now happily evident in the increased interest of the planters in the subject, who sent both their daughters and8wtoc. Roi 140.young negroes to acquire the art of reeling. In 1756, the f e thousand e in hundred arid eighty-three pounds and one ounce of cochons were received at the feature, and two hundred and sixty-eight pounds of raw silk reeled The liberal policy of the commissioners, who had no private ends to answer, caused them to recommend the establishment of additional features, and in their letter to the trustees, June 12, 1751, they advise the erection of one at Ebenezer, and another contiguous to Savannah ; but Mr. Ottolengheopposed this course, and abrogated to the one in Savannah the entire monopoly of the culture. Jealousy appears to have been very conspicuous i Air. Ottolenghes character, and his opposition to the Saltzburgers and depreciation of their efforts arose from this suspicious trait. He aimed to render himself solely necessary, and as versed everything which seemed tom imitate with his fancied superiority. This appears not only from letters of Governors Reynolds and Ellis, but from his own correspondence, where this caution and fear of rivalry are plainly discernible. His course gave offence to the Ebenezer people, who had already erected a feature in their village; who had been at a great sacrifice to send their wives and daughters to learn the art of reeling in Savannah, and who had hoped to carry on the manufacture under their own supervision, and for their own benefit. Or. Ottolenghe, however, overruled their views, and required all cochons to be delivered at Savannah, and to be reeled there. Each basin at the filaturehad two apprentices, besides others who were employed in sorting the balls c, and the various operations connected with the trade employed nearly forty persons. In 1757, over five thousand pounds of cochons were received at Savannah, and three hundred and sixty pounds of raw silk spun, which, says Governor Ellis, would have been more if the eggs had not failed; and in a letter dated 11th of March, 1757, he says: 1" The raising of silk seems to be no longer a. matter of curiosity; it employs many poor people, and is approaching towards a staples even thousand and forty pounds of cochons were deposited in the filaturein 1758; but while the friends of this business were rejoicing in the assured success of their experiment, they were saddened by the destruction of thefilature, which took fire on the 4th of July and was totally consumed. -The wound silk which had not yet been shipped, amounting to three hundred and fifty pounds, was saved, but several thousand weight of silk balls, together with much of the reeling apparatus, were destroyed. Another and more capacious building was immediately erected, and was ready for use the ensuing season. In 1759, ten thousand one hundred and thirty-six pounds of cocoonswere raised in Georgia, four thousand pounds of which were from Ebenezer, and the proceeds of their culture alone, for the season, reached 700 sterling. The opinion of those engaged in the culture, as expressed to Dr. Dared Elliott, was, "that it was more profitable than any other ordinary business The cochons delivered at the feature in 1760 weighed seven thousand nine hundred and eighty-three pounds, and there were spun eight hundred and thirty-nine pounds. Mr. Ottolenghe was now honored with the full appointment of "superintendent of the silk culture in Georgia" With a salary appropriate to his station. Give .thousand three hundred and seven pounds of cochons, aid three of. No. 140. 81 hundred and thirty-two pounds of raw silk, were produced in 1761. 0 -eh nor Right, under date 13th of July, says : :the greatest appearance that ever they had here was destroyed in two nights' time, by excessive hard and un seasonable frosts, and there is likewise a de genera cy in the seed, as Mr. Ottolenghe tells me." These frosts occurred on the 5th and 6th: of April. Parliament, this year, made a grant of 000 towards defraying the expenditure the the silk culture, and it was annually renewed until about 1766. By means of this gratuity, Mr. Ottolenghe was enabled to give a high price to the readers of cochons, and thus sustained the encouragement so judiciously commenced. In 1762, fifteen thousand one hundred and one pounds of cochons were delivered at the feature, and one thousand and forty-eight pounds of raw silk reeled, which Mr. O. declared to be the finest and best silk ever produced in Georgia. The year 1763 showed an increase of cochons, but a decrease of silk, there being fifteen thousand four hundred and eighty-six pounds of the former, and only nine hundred and fifty-three pounds of the latter. "The occasion of this disparity was a season of cold, rainy weather towards the close of April, by which the later cochons were injured, and rendered almost useless. There were delivered at the feature, in 1764, fifteen thousand two hundred and twelve pounds of cochons, notwithstanding the season was so unfavorable that Governor Right mentions the case of one man, who ex pe toed to make from five to seven hundred pounds, who only succeeded in raising one hundred pounds of cochons. Right thousand six hundred and ninety-five pounds were sent by the Saltzburgers, and the whole amount yielded eight hundred and ninety-eight pounds of raw silk. In addition to the grant of Parliament, a society instituted in London for the .encouragement -of arts, manufactures, and commerce offered certain premium for the advantage of the British American dominions, among which were -Icid127For every pound of cochons produced in the provinces of Georgiaandsouth Carolina, in the year 1764, of a hardy, weighty, and good substance, wherein only one worm has spun, 3d; for every pound of cocoonsproduced in the same year, of a weaker, lighter, spotted or bruised quality 2d; :for d unions, old" These premiums were to be paid under the direction of Mr. 0., with proper vouchers that the same were raised in either of the provinces specified. It was agitated, in 1765, to reduce the price of cochons from is. to I s. 6d per pound; a measure which produced much dissatisfaction; and, as a consequence, there was a considerable falling off in the amount of balls and silk, only twelve thousand five hundred and fourteen pounds of the former, and seven hundred and twelve pounds of the latter, together with seven hundred and twenty pounds of filosele, being produced. To prevent the depression consequent on this reduction, Governor Right suggested that instead of so much per pound, as formerly, the ten largest quantities should receive, the highest 50, the next greatest parcel 45, and so on, gradually dear easing with the decrease in weight, until you reach the     owes t quantity, to which 10 would be awarded: thus, while the expense would be greatly lessened to the trustees, the stimulus of reward would be sufficiently sustained. This advice was not adopted, though, owing to the ar get remonstrances of those best acquainted with the business, the 8 14 Docno. 140.reduction in the bounty was only 9d. instead of 1s. 6d In the 25th ofAprill765, the following order was published in the Georgia Gazette: "Notice is hereby given to all whom it may concern, that, by direction of tie right honorable the lords commissioners of trade and plantations, the price usually paid for cochons is now reduced, and that no more than 2s. 3d. per pound will be paid for cochons raised in this province, and delivered l at the pub le feature, this season By order of his excellency the governor. Sgeo. Bai Lle, Gcommissar. This bounty was still further reduced in 1766, when, by order of the board of trade, only I s. d. was paid per pound. The dependence of this culture on the weather was sign ally instanced this year, from. the fact that though many who had hitherto raised cochons abandoned it at the reduction of the bounty, yet such a large crop had never been produced before over n twenty thousand three hundred and eighty pounds of cochons being delivered at the feature, which, however, only produced one thousand eighty-nine pounds of raw silk, and eight hundred and fifty pounds of filosele. This amount of reeled silk was not at all proportionate to the weight of the cones, resulting, as Mr. Ottolenghe said in a letter to Oven or Right; October 2, 1766, " to the badness of the seed, a and consequent inferiority of the worms. In 1760, the cochons v weighed only seven thousand nine hundred: and eighty-three pounds, and yet eight hundred and thirty-nine pounds of raw silk were spun; at which rate, the product this year should have been about two thousand pounds. In the 26th of June, Henry Penn an made proposals to the board of trade for carrying on the feature, but they were of a nature not at all advantageous to the culture ; and Governor Right, in his reply, on the21stof It ober, disapproved of the plan, and exposed the fallacy of his scheme, which was in consequence abandoned n 1767, ten thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight pounds of balls were raised, and six hundred and seventy-one pounds nine ounces of raw silksptfri the decrease of cochons being caused, first, by withdraw in of -thePurysburgh cochons, which last year amounted to five thousand five hundred and fifty-one: pounds; and, second, by the ,reduction of bounty; so that v while last year the cochons were delivered in by two hundred and sixty four different persons, only one hundred and sixty individuals were this year devoted to the culture. The silk, however, was of a better quality, and sustained its high reputation in the London market. In 1768 another plan was proposed by Mr. Delamar, in order the more effectually to establish the growth of raw silk in America." His proposal was to pay a bounty of ,20s per pound on every pound of good, clear, raw silk imported from any of his Majestys dominions in America, to be paid on the price such silk might sell for at public sale in London; at the expiration of ten years ten per cent. bounty was to be allowed; the ensuing five years at five per cent, after which time the bounty was to cease. This was the general feature of his plan. It was not, however, adopted, though in many respects its provisions were highly judicious and appropriate: :a. But this branch of industry and commerce was fast waning before the increasing culture of more sure and lucrative products, aid only one handd e and thirty-seven different person brought cochons to the feature this years Governor Right, in his official letter to the Kari of Hilsboroiughd of. No. 140.1JulV1, 1768, says: .am persuaded that few or none i bit the very power sort of people, will con tin time o go upon that article. Several sustntialpersons, who did mean to make it an object when the price was higher, have, to my knowledge, given it over. The reason, my lord, is evident fr people who have their fortune to raise or make will always turn themselves in such a way, and to the raising and making of such commodities, as they think will answer best; and it is very dear to me that those who have negroes may t employ themselves and negroes to better advantage c, than by raising co coins at I.  6d. per pound, although that is, as I have said, 7, 8, or 9d. more: than they are intrinsic ally worthfiCluny, in his "american Traveller" printed in And on, 1769, says: "the climate of Georgia has been -found to agree, in every respect i with the silkworm: Experience, however, proved that the climate was not sufficiently equal be to secure permanent and continued success. Governorwright, in the letter quoted above, says "the variable aid uncertain weather in spring r makes it precarious' and facts amply confirm this statement. Only five hundred and forty one pounds of raw silk were made this year a smaller arm orient, with one exception, than: had- been produced for ten years. In 1769, the quantity was still more decreased, both from the reluctance of the people to raise worms and the unfavorable weather in spring. Govberior Right, on the 20th of The, 1769, says: :he had a most extraordinary prospect till the middle of April, when I thought everythings 'fe i yet we had very cold rains on the 17th and 18th, which were succeeded by hard, black frosts on the 19th and 20th, and destroyed area part of the worms, and will reduce the silk very much The silk business was now on the irretrievable decline, though it still maintained a nominal existence, and received the encouragement of Parliament. i The special bounty which had hitherto been paid on cochons, overall above their merchant able value, was suspended, and by a statute of 9 He ore I H ;c. 38, a premium of tweihtv five per cent from the st of Want ay, !ll 70, to the last of January, 1777; of twenty per cent. from the 1st of Angry, 1777, to the 1st of January, 1784, and of fifteen per cent. from the 1st of January, 1784, to th 1st of January, 1791, on the ad valoremaluae of all silk produced in -america and imported into Great Britain in vessels regularly ha ligated by :a w, was substituted in its place The: inhabitants of Ebenezer resumed the culture, which with; them had long been dormant, and its revival at that time was prince p ally o wig to the influence of a very worthy ran and magistrate, (or.

':I: 1770, they shipped two b hundred d ad ninety one pounds h of ra silk, the result of their own  industry; and as the feature at Savannah was discontinued in 1771, the Saar l of Hillsboroug h, ever anxious to advance the produce, warmly commended the zeal of the Saltzburgers, and directed President lHabersham to distribute "the basins and feels that were left in the public feature to such persons as Mr. Wertsch shall recommend to be proper objects of that bounty ?a? and in the same letter he promised the he would endeavor to procure for them this year "a" small sum from 0 parliament, to be laid out in purchase of utensils for the assistance of the poorjsirt of people in your province." This promise he redeemed .i a, : pop air 'ad th e silk :business become a ti Ebenezi that :r, abeirashaifin : a letter dated the 30th of 'are, d 772, says (did 127) some persons :in a 16 To c. No. 140.most every family there understand its process from the beginning to the end." In 1771, the Germans sent four hundred and thirty eight pounds f raw silk to England, and in 17 72 four hundred and eighty five pounds, all fit heir own raising. They made their, own feels, which were so much esteemed that one was sent to England as a model, and another taken to, the Last I indies by Bickering Robinson. The operations at Savannah were now totally discontinued, though Or, Ottolenghe still styled himself: Superintendent of the silk culture in Georgia" and, in consideration of his long and faithful service in that office, received an an unity of 100. Of  n a message of Air James Right to the Commons House of Assembly 19th of January, 1774, he says: " The feature buildings seem to be going to decay and ruin; may it not, therefore, be expedient to consider what other service or use they may be put to v' And the Assembly answered : Web shall of fail to consider how it may be expedient to apply the feature to some public use." And henceforth it was used as an assembly or ballroom, a place where societies held their meetings, and where Divine service was occasionally conducted. More recently it was converted into a dwelling house, and was thus appropriated at the time of its destruction by fire on the afternoon of March 25, 1839. :thus ended the grand project of raising silk in the province of Georgia for though some few individuals, together with the people of Ebenezer, continued to raise small quantities, yet, as a branch of general culture, it has never been resuscitated. The last parcel brought to Savannah was in 1790, when over two hundred pounds were purchased for exportation at from 8s. to 26s. per pound. In reviewing the causes which led to the suspension of this business after so many exertions and such vast expense, which, it must be remembered; the profits of the culture never reimbursed, we find, first, the un friendliness of the climate, which, notwithstanding its boasted excellence, interfered materially with its success. Governor Right frequently speaks of its deleterious influence, and the fluctuations in the various seasons evidenced, to demonstration, that the interior was better adapted to the auricular: I l part of the business than the exposed and variable seaboard. Mr. Saber sham, in a letter to the Karl of Hills borough, dated Savannah, 24th of April, 1772, thus expresses himself on this point: Upwards of twenty years ago, if my memory does not fail me, Samuel Lloyd, esq, of London, who was one of the late trustees for establishing this colony, and was fourteen years in I talk, and very largely concerned in the silk business, wrotetoiie that the best silk was produced at a distance from the seacoast, owing, I suppose, to the richness of the soil, which made the mulberry leaf more g luminous, nutrition, and healthy to the silkworm ; also to their not being obnoxious to mosquitoes and sand lies, and probably: likewise, to the father being more equal and less liable to sudden transition from heat to cold; and in a conversation this day with I Or: Harvard, of Augusta, he assures me that, from two years' experience in raising cochons there he lost none from sickness, which frequently destroys two thirds of the worms here and he further says that Mr. Ottolenghe told him that the silk reeled from the Augusta cochons 'cid127made te strongest and most wiry thread of anyraisedlin these parts' " . Second the expensive ness of living and the dear ness of labor, which was as high as is, 8d. to 2s per day, whereas 2d. or 3d. was the usual price raid the peasant in silk growing countries. Governor Right, i a let. 817ter to the Karl of Hills borough, frankly told him that, " till these provinces become more populous and labor cheaper, I apprehend silk will not be a commodity, or an article of any considerable amount Third, the great reduction of the bounty, which, being the stimulus to exertion, ceased to operate as an incentive, when from is. 3d. it fell to I s. 3d and finally to a mere premium on the general quantity imported. The poor could not subsist on these prices, and the rich could employ their lands to much better advantage than in cultivating an article which would not repay the expenses of labor; and, lastly, the increasing attention bestowed on rice and cotton sealed the fate of the silk culture, and the planters soon learned to consider the latter of no importance, in comparison to the large and lucrative crops yielded by those more staple commodities. Other reasons might be mentioned, but these sufficiently account for its decline there, and its total neglect even to the present day. During them or us multicaulis epidemic, which spread over our country in 1838, Savannah, it is true, did not escape, and for a time the fever raged with much violence; but the febrile action soon subsided, leaving no permanent benefit, and only a few fields of waving foliage as a deciduous memento of this frenzied excitement. That silk can be produced in Georgia equal to any in the world, does not admit of a doubt; but whether it will ever be resumed, and when, are among the unknown events of the future. From the New York Farmer and Mechanics. In the New York Farmer) Club, November 18, 1845. Of  Of. Mr. An Eppsthe subject of bounties on silk ought now to be take ii up. Our State bounty for five years will expire next June. That bounty is 15 cents a pound for cochons, and 50 cents a pound for reeled silk, the produce of this State. A bushel of cochons weighs from 10 to 12 pounds. This bounty induced many persons to raise silk. If the bounty ceases they will probably quit the raising of it. Some gentlemen, I know, await the action of the State before they engage their capital in the business. Massachusetts and New York are, I believe, the only States of this Union that give such bounties. Other States have repealed their bounty acts. The business cannot yet continue without bounty. We can raise silk, but the first attempts must be fostered and patron ised, or it must fail; and, besides, frost has recently almost totally killed our multicaulis trees, and we have to wait the growth of harder kinds, adapted more to such severe frost as sometimes occurs. Confidence in the ultimate success of the silk staple in America is unabated. I move for a committee of three to prepare a memorial on the subject to the legislature. Dr. Underhillwas the Broussa mulberry killed ?or. Wakermanno, sir. Broussa survives all frosts: we must have that question brought before this club for particular investigation. Mr. Fleetthis is the most. important question that has been before this club for some time. The bounties on silk are of too short a duration. The public has not that confidence in their continuance which is abso52818 lately necessary to induce any prudent man to establish his mulberry trees and his accommodations for the worms, &c. I am sanguine that bounties continued ten or fifteen years would secure the silk culture. I second the motion for a committee. Motion carried unanimously or. Kenmblehow long shall we ask for bounty? Ohio has none Connecticut has none; and they produce the most silk. The bounty is equal to the cost of production. The legislature will not give you ten years! The bounty might become very great. Met the committee report their memorial at the next club. Mr. Meigsi f the State should pay          $5,000,000 for bounty on silk at 50 cents a pound, and the silk raised should be worth what it now is, and doubtless always will be,          $5 a pound, then the benefit to the State would of course be about forty-five millions of dollars. Mr. Fleetthe memorial drawn by the committee should be reported to the next meeting of the club. Seconded by Mr. Feeble. Dr. Underhilli t is admitted that 50 its. a pound for the silk pays the cost of raising. Mr. An Eppstwo dollars will pay for the trouble of raising a pound, after the establishment is ready for it. Mr. Fleetto avoid injurious prejudices, I should prefer a sliding scale of bounties. Mr. Meigsthe infancy of a great staple may be justly compared with that of an animal. You must nurtured and sustain the infant, or you will never have the strong and powerful adult. That is the true nature of bounties. Mr. Emblem am for prudence in our measures: a bounty is a help only; government ought not to do the whole. Now does Ohio manage it For. Underhillthe damage done by recent frosts to the mulberry trees will not be repaired soon; a bounty for five years would not more than repair that damage. Millions of the trees are destroyed, especially where they stood in loose soils. I think that the bounty should be continued for five years, and then reduced a quarter or a half for five more. This club cannot take up a more interesting subject than that of the kind of mulberry best suited to our climate. Broussa stands our frosts perfectly. I italian white is also said to stand it; but multicaulis has been almost annihilated. The fatal blow was struck the winter before last, when frost entered the ground here three or four feet deeper. An Eppstwo dollars pay only for the labor of raising a pound of silk. The business in Ohio ought not to give the tone to the public. Hundred years ago the silk business was struggling in this country. Had it been duly encouraged, it would have been long ago a great source of national wealth. Mr. Wakemanthe silk raised by us has probably, when all costs are considered, really cost us about five dollars a pound. Such time and great ingenuity are requisite to establish the silk business in America. Our first attempts at making cotton cloths were full of difficulties. At first we got 25 cents a yard, then 12, (all said we must fail) then 6; and yet at 6 cents a yard, after numerous expenses in money, and great ingenuity in machinery, cotton cloth is an American article at that very low price.  He are making                $40,000,000 of cotton fabrics; we can do so with silk. But the most important business of reeling silk must be yet established. Some kindscid127
w. 19 of I india silk, for want of proper reeling, are worth                          $2.50. French of no better quality in the cochon, yet by good reeling, brings          $5 a pound. In Ohio, silk is, reeled worth it now, on a small scale. As to multicaulis, the records of this I institute will show that years ago it was declared here that multicaulis would fail, and it has failed. We believe that Broussa will stand it has been examined by us; we doubt not its physical adaptation to our northern climate. The motion that the committee do report the memorial to the next meeting of the club was unanimously adopted. The chairman appointed on that committee Messrs. An Pps, Dinner, and Veins. From the New York Farmer and Mechanics. Of  Of Culturelast stroll of the season among the mulberry patches, cocooneries, andeggeries of Sort hampton. Northampton, November 10, 1845. Dear Of  R: You have been furnished with' several strolls among themulberry patches, cocooneries, and egg series in Sort hampton, with an allusion to experiments in contemplation to show the practice ability, and, if possible, the utility of late feeding, despite the use of old, crude, spotted, or frost bitten foliage; and, if successful, the worms would go up, by or before the memorable powder plot of November 5th ; at which time, instead of going up, they stayed down, and the final e was a total destruction of the whole family, without the intervention of gunpowder or fibrous explosion. Having ever been of the opinion that late raised cochons were of little or no value, the experiment was made, to show, practically, that there can be no use of profit in late feeding, and to establish the fact that our early crop is worth more than all the after crops when the foliage becomes crude andindigestible, A French writer has produced evidence that 100 lbs. of needling foliage will make as much silk as nearly double that quantity of old foliage. The question may be asked, how early ought eggs to be brought out ?AnswerSoon as the mulberry begins to develop e its foliage. Another question: suppose the early foliage should be cut off by frostAnswerThen shift the worms to mulberry paper, or use foliage which had been dried for the purpose; pulverize, moist en, and sprinkle with a little wheat flour or rice flour, (which is preferable) and the worms may be sustained until new foliage appears. This has been successfully tried. An order for Wanton trees or cuttings, and pea nut eggs, has been received a few days since from Him a, Peru, S. A., and n means to preserve the worms, should they hat ch on the passage, for which purpose mulberry paper and dry mulberry foliage will be forwarded. Eggs have been forwarded to the Sandwich islands which did not hat ch until they had arrived at the place of destination, five months' passage or more, where was plenty of foliage. Our motive for ordering northern eggs for Him a is, that they a reconsidered peculiarly adapted to a warm climate, in preference to the product of that climate. President Stiles, in his Silk You anal advocated and recommended frequent change of stock 8 20 a. The eggs which were sent to the Sandwich islands were of the peanuts variety, 3,000 of which, or even less, if well fed, would give one pound of silk; but, when crossed with the native breed, required between 5,000 and 6000 to make a pound of silk, and soon the mixture were like the native, and the same lot of the native eggs became very irregular in the time ofhatchingsome in ten days after being laid, others up to thirty, sixty, ninety, and others even to six months. This irregularity has been very discouraging. Such, also, has been the experience in the West I india islands, as by recent intelligence. The only apparent remedy is the frequent or annual supply of northern American eggs. Eggs sent from here to the south have done well; but when received from the south, the reverse, so far as my experience has extended, from the beginning to the end of the stroll. C. Van Was, Esq. Remarksi t was stated in this paper, a few months since, that northern eggs sent to the south generally did better than those saved there, or southern eggs sent here. This statement has been doubted and contradicted, but we have made diligent inquiry, and have yet to learn an instance where, eggs sent south have failed, where the failure could not be traced directly to some other cause than any injury in the eggs consequent upon a change of climate. We have sent several pounds, during the last year, to the extreme south, and they have done well. They may be safely sent any part of the season, and with great advantage to the grower. A. C. Van Epps. From the New York Farmer and Mechanics. In The New York Farmers' Club. Mr. Veins, from the committee to whom was referred the subject of a memorial to the legislature for renewal of the bounty on the culture of silk, read the following report To the honorable legislature of the State of New Yorkthe American I institute respectfully comes before you in favor of the public, to ask for a renewal of the bounty on the production of silk in this State. The great natural staple of our land yet requires the paternal care of the State. The existing bounty, which expires in June next, has been the means of causing some attention to that important product, but competition of foreign nations, long ha situated to that very delicate and very valuable product, renders, in our opinion, a still further help necessary on the part of government, to carry it from its present infant condition to maturity. The legislature is perfectly aware that silk has long been and will undoubtedly forever be, almost an article of necessity. Very citizen uses it, and must continue to do so ; for it is admitted everywhere to be one of the most beautiful and useful materials for the dress of our race that can be found. As a thread only, it has no equal; and for beauty as a garment, no superior. And it is also now ascertained as a fact, that the United States has a climate too. No. 140. 821 better adapted than any other on the globe for the production of it. It has cost our country a great many millions of dollars to buy it from the old world ; and we believe it to be high time for us to make it, not only for our own immense consumption, but to try to make it for exportation, and thus cause other nations to repay us the tribute for silk which we, for generations past, have paid to them. Difficulties besides competition have attended this new staple of our country. The experiments tried in this new business have some of them failed. Certainly, mulberry trees which came as highly recommended as themulticaulis have proved unable to bear our winters. The multicaulis has failed, to the very great damage of thousands of our patriotic citizens, who had ventured their fortunes in its trial. At it is now well known that other kinds of mulberry trees are capable of standing un hurt our hardest winters. The Broussa is one of them. We would therefore per severe, by all means; and we believe that upon further examination our State government will see the propriety of continuing its bounty for some years to come. Upon much consideration, we have arrived at the conclusion that, if the present bounty should be continued for three years, and then be decreased ten per cent. per annum until exhausted, the production of silk in our State will be so firmly established as no longer to require the parental care of government. If the amounts paid for such bounties should, as we hope they may, become large, it will be a source of high satisfaction to know that our citizens are enriching themselves and the State by the amount of silk produced. And we beg leave to say that bounties for the destruction of wolves andpanthers cannot wisely be considered more advantageous to the State than the production of a new staple of commerce, and lasting value, like that of silk. Your honorable body will, in its wisdom and patriotism, supply those reasons which we may have omitted- Your memorials its, therefore, submit with perfect confidence and respect, for decision, this petition, which was unanimously adopted, and ordered for signatures and presentation to the legislature. In the subject of the best mulberry tree for our climate, although thenulticaulis has failed in some situations, yet the Broussa, the I italian whitemulberry, and the Ll pine, stand our climate well. Mr. An Eppsi have used the multicaulis, the real Chinese mulberryall that we have of this tree are descended from two plants brought from the Philippine islands. There is no failure from cold on the high lands of our country, but, for the last two years, those planted in our low I lands have suffered greatly from severe frost. The stem of the multicaulis is apt to be destroyed by hard frost, but the roots are usually not hurt, and the young shoots the following year bear well. The best method is to cut off the stems with their leaves and give to the worms. They may be cut twice or thrice, and the leaves on the upper end of the stem are not so good for the worms. I cut off the upper six or eight inches; those leaves are watery they will do to feed the young worms. Multicaulis is now almost the onlymulberry used in the south, where it succeeds on low land and high land. Multicaulis has rapid growth, and gives per acre four or five times more food for worms than any other mulberry that I know of except the Broussa. I would, in the fall of the year, cut my stems down to the ground and turn a furrow over the roots. The white grafted mulberry is fine. It is success f ly done, and the result may be examined at No. 337 Roadway, in tis cy i ty A gentleman from Albany proposes to plant thirty, are prof the    (ii an white mulberry. The silk worm is not fond of our American redmiplerry leafkMr. Wakemanthat has been tested by the I institute. Chairmanthe for us oregon a (the Oregon mulberry) is good has large leaves; a specimen of it is possessed (I think) now by Alexanderwalsh, of Lansingburgh. We ought to carefully examine that mulberry. For. An Eppsmr. Clark, of Philadelphia, has published the best treaties ion American silk. I refer members to it for information. Mr. Wakemanon the 19th June, 1828, on suggestion of the late Dr. Felix Rascal is, the American I institute commenced the undertaking to supplyorircountry with mulberry trees. A large amount of the best seed was imported from France by, the American I institute. Dr. Rascal is constantlyrecQ0mended the obtaining a plentiful supply of the leaves before we undertook to employ the silk' worm. In that same year the first multicaulis, was 'imported by Dr. Rascal is, as chairman of the silk committee of the     r nets ten, and shown at the fair. When introduced to public notice, it was not supposed by many, as well as by myself, to be sufficiently hardy to endure our cold weather; and so has it proved generally. We must have a tree better fitted for our climate. It will not answer to have our silk growers liable to the severe disappointments from killing frosts. Theywilbe discouraged. Multicaulis may do for our southern States; but here we must have the Broussa. We obtained this kind from Mr. David Ruggles, of Nbeyburgh, in 1837, who obtained it from Charles Hind, esq, one of the commissioners by whom the late treaty was concluded between the Unitedstates and the Sublime For te. Broussa is in the same latitude as New Work is situated at the foot of mount Olympus, the summit of which is crownedithipperpetual snow. He believed that it was more hardy than either themcid127rcid127s multicaulis or the I italian mulberry. Mr. Hind shipped to Mbi y gales several hundred of the young Broussa trees, all which perished on the voyage. In 1832 Mr. Hind obtained <a name="seeds111"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of that years growth, and gave them to Mr. Ruggles, who planted them, and in 1837 he had 20,000trees. It has proved able to bear our winters. I to leaf is as large as that ofnulticaulis, but thicker more pulp y. It has stood side by side with multicaulis un hurt, while that was Killed by frost. Mr. Ryder tried the white I italian mulberry in Missouri, in 1836. I planted them in a garden of rich soil; the weeds overran most of them. Such as escaped I transplanted, and now they are as large as common apple trees; and I planted slips from them, which have grown successfully. Battle are very find of the leaves, and some of my mulberry trees were cut down by them, but their new shoots are vigorous. I believe there is no multicaulis now living in Missouri more than ten feet high. The cold of our winters, invariably kills the stalk down to the ground every year. As to the white mulberry, I have never yet seen the little ends of its branches hurt by frost. But I still think that the northern part of Massachusetts is too cold for the white mulberry. The red mulberry grows all over the west the white grows well on land of inferior fertility. I tried the multicaulisand .the v white mulberry side by side. Chairrmanthe plan proposed by Mr. An Pps is good, to cut down the stems annually and loose up the roots with the furrow of the sloping, The. No. 140. 823Mr. Hydewe ought not to depend on the annual shoots for our supply of iaeayese .a: . Chairmanthe multicaulis tree never does attain a large size or.

Mr. Wakemanwe must place our reliance only upon such mulberrytrees as are capable of standing all the vicissitudes of our climate un hurt. Lie must have a permanent tree. All the other arrangements mentioned are somewhat troublesome, and therefore very liable to neglect. The Broussais undoubtedly our best tree. Mr. Ruggles thought that the greater solidity of the leaf rendered it fully equal to multicaulis ; that the silk worms would leave the latter, to feed upon the former. I had in my garden a Broussawhich grew rapidly; it was readily propagated by slips. I move for a committee to inquire after and collect the Broussa. Carried.

Approved March 10th, 1845. A. Mouton, Governor of the State of Louisiana. From the New York Farmer and Mechanics. Of  Of Culture. A number of valuable communications have been received since the last number was issued, (several of which are of great interest) from gentlemen at the extreme south. They show an increasing attention to thee culture of silk. The only obstacle named in any of them is the " want of a market and applications have been made by growers in Georgia and Tennessee to send their cochons to our feature. The following, from Thomas Douglas, esq, of Macavriz, Last Florida, to the On. D. Levy, will be read with i much interest. We are happy in being able to inform our friends that branch features will probably be established during the ensuing season in Georgia and Tennessee. Communications from Dr. D. Stebbins, of Pass and Judge Earnest, of Georgia, Mr. Passed, of Alexandria, and others, will appear in due time. In speaking of the Farmers and Gardeners' Convention, and Silk Growers' Convention, in previous articles, we referred to those held under the auspices of the American I institute, October last. A. C. Yav Epps. Macavri Z, Last Florida. Dear Of  R: Although my experiments in the silk culture may be of little value, yet, added to the general stock which is now being gathered up by those who feel a solicitude for the success of this branch of agriculture, they may be of some service, especially to our Territory, in all that concerns which you take so deep an interest. I therefore proceed with pleasure to comply with a request you made of me before you left for Washington, to, give you some information on the subject. The feeding of silkworm s began to attract attention in this region in 1838. New, however, engaged in it. Mrs. D. that year fed a small number by way of amusement, which succeeded so well that we were induced to continue it. In 1839 we fedADoc. N. , 140. 82 about ten thousand worms, and although (from necessity) we kept them in a small close, and badly ventilated room, they were throughout perfectly healthy, wound off well, and made very fine cochons, weighing about 275 to the pound. Encouraged by this, and believing that the culture might be carried on successfully here, become a valuable branch of our agriculture, and bring into requisitions a large portion of our fine timbered lands, I determined to proceed with it; and in the spring of 1840 commenced the erection of a building suited to the purpose, which I have since finished. That spring I had a large crop (or family, as the French writers would perhaps more correctly call it) hat ch out, but, owing to the want of room for them, made only about 40 bushels of cochons. This crop wound off in April. In the succeeding month of May I brought out another small crop, from some choice eggs sent me from the north, which turned out well. In June and July, I brought out another crop of about five thousand worms; these were the second crop of the small white two crop worm, a very hardy and valuable variety; and although we fed them in the attic story of my new cocoonery, amidst the noise and dust occasioned by the carpenters and masons who were engaged in finishing it at the time, they were exceedingly healthy, and wound off in the month of August very handsomely. In 1841 we fed two crops of about 150,000 each; the first in March and April, and the latter, which consisted of the two crop worm, in May and June, and made about one hundred bushels of cochons. There being no ice house in this neighborhood, we could not avail ourselves of the advantage of giving our eggs what is termed a temporary winter, "so as to cause them to hat ch again that season, and were therefore compelled to forego further feeding until the ensuing spring; but during the month of March we brought out a crop of about 300,000, which worked off very handsomely in April and May, from which we made about seventy bushels of cochons. Being too much engaged with professional pursuits to go north to procure revelers, or the necessary apparatus for reeling, and having no knowledge of that matter ourselves, except what we have derived from our experiments, and little time to devote to it, we have most of our cochons, say about 200 bushels, yet on hand. We have, however, with such apparatus as we could procure here, which is by no means the best, reeled off enough to ascertain that our cochons, which I think would not suffer by a comparison with any made elsewhere, will make very fine, strong, and excellent silk. To satisfy you more fully upon this point, I here with enclose you a small sample reeled in my family, and saved a large quantity of eggs; but notwithstanding a large portion of the latter were of the small white twocicid127op worm above mentioned, they did not hat ch out a second time a circumstance for which I am unable to assign any reason, unless it was owing to a long continuance of hot dry weather, which some writers on the subject say will cause that result. An ice house having been established in It. Augustine, I about the middle of July placed a small quantity of my eggs, as sorted, in it, in order to test the fact whether giving them a " temporary winter " would cause them to hat ch, and, being very much pressed with business, paid no further attention to them until about the middle of September, when I took them out and spread them on a shelf in my cocoonery, and in a few days they commenced watching, and we fed them through the months of October and November; they also were healthy, and wound off well. I used no artificial heat, and am satisfied, from my own experience, that toe. I 140 we can i always feed here eight months in the year without it, and in favorablcid127) seasons nine months, during which time we can make four crops, provided: we can manage our eggs so as to cause them to hat ch out when we wish them to do so; and I see no reason why we may not. I am aware that different opinions are entertained on this subject; it is contended by some that retarding the watching in the manner I have mentioned must necessarily injure the constitution of the worm. I do not think so. Provide nice seems in every other respect to have adapted it to the use of man ; its want of locomotion is a remarkable instance of that adaptation. If it crawled about like other worms, we could do nothing with it; and I believe that it is also adapted to that use in the particular that I have mentioned; an opinion to which I am led by observations and experience. This opinion  I know is at variance with that of some writers, and amongst others Mr. G. B. Smith, of Baltimore, whose opinions upon all questions connected with the silk culture are entitled to great weight. He says, " that the silk worm, when left to itself, exposed to the ordinary atmosphere, patches out in the spring, exactly at the time the mulberry leaves open; that it is, therefore, 'an annual insect' and requires exactly twelve months to pass through the various stages of its existence" that if, for example, a silkworm is hatched on the first of May, 1840, the eggs that it would produce would naturally hat ch on the first day of May, 1841. It this I think he is mistaken; and, with all due deference, there seems to me to be an in accuracy between his premises, which are correct, and his conclusion, unless themulberry leaves come out always exactly at the same period of the year, which is by no means the case in this latitude. I never laid by any eggs from silkworms that hatched earlier than about the 10th of February, until last year; yet I have almost every winter had worms hat ch out whenever the temperature of the atmosphere was as high as 700, in the following December and January, which is often the case here. Again, in consequence of cool weather at the same period of the year when the worms were hatched from which they were produced, the watching has been retarded ;indeed, that is the case now. Any of the worms that produced the eggs I now have on hand were hatched before the 10th of February of last year; yet they have not hatched owing, doubtless, to a backward spring, and by keeping my eggs in a cool place. I have also retarded their watching beyond the period of the year at which the worms that produced them were hatched, without any. pre judicial effect, so far as could discover, upon the worm. But the Persians, it is said, possess a variety which produces eight successive crops in the year; and if I am not wrong in relation to the theory above mentioned, it will be a desideratum to introduce this species in Florida, where it will find a congenial climate. I observe that at a silk convention held in the fall of 1843, atNorthampton, Massachusetts, Mr. Samuel Hit marsh, whose experience in the silk culture is well known, stated that he was satisfied that but one cropcotud be made in the year in New England; and the principal reason assigned by him why more could not be raised, was, that the mulberry tree would not afford suitable food a longer period than was necessary for one crop. I use the leaf of the horns multfeaulis, and that affords good forage for silkworm is here at least eight months, and sometimes nine and even ten months in the year. The advantage that I anticipated for Florida from the silk culture, in relation to our pine barren lands, (as they are called) will doubtless be relic. No. 140.82-alized; for although the trees raised upon those lands do not produce so large leaves as those raised on the rich ham mock lands, yet they afford acid127cid127tter food, and the silk made by the worms fed upon them is stronger ad f a finer texture. By the by, I am happy to learn that the experiment &f cultivating sugar upon the pine lands in the interior also succeeds well. The cane raised upon them, although not so large as those grown upon the swamp lands, contains much more sac charing matter to the gallon. There is a great saving of labor, therefore, in handling and transporting it to the mill, and in grinding it. The same result as to silk culture upon the pine lands has attended the effort in Georgia. A writer in the last Georgian' speaking of the experiments made there, says: " that pine lands are suitable for the production of the best qualities of silk, I now consider it as determined, and the fact to be of great importance to the neighboring counties, and especially to Savannah. If the pine country in our rear, which has been regarded as little, more than waste lands, can be made productive, and subsist a dense population, what would now seem the mbstvsiionary calculations of such a change to Savannah and the country at large would fall short of the reality. But I venture to predict such a change, ands that whoever may live to see thirty years hence will see "lower country Georgia silk" quoted in the prices current of Liverpool and Are. I certainly agree with this writer; and what will be true of Georgia will also be true of Florida; and those who live at that day will also see "Florida silk" quoted in the same prices current; but while Last Florida may compete with Georgia and States further north in the cultivation of silk, and that, too, with superior advantages, she will produce several staples in the cultivation of which they cannot compete with her, amongst the more important of which will be that of sugar. And now that the din of war has ceased, and the overflowing scourge that has so long devastated this fair portion of Florida has passed by, we may hope soon to see the country settled: by an industrious, intelligent, and enterprising people. There is no portion of our country (or perhaps any other) that offers greater inducements to the emigration of that class of people than Last Florida. I have visited almost every portion of the United States, and spent many years in the noble valley of the Mississippi, (which might with propriety be called the "garden of the world) while the country there was new, and      an say with confidence that I have seen no country where industry, enterprise, and economy usually met with a better reward than in Last Florida. A catalogue of the crops suited to the soil and climate, and of the spontaneous vegetable productions, would embrace almost everything found at the north, with the addition of many others of exceeding value, not found in colder latitudes. Amongst the last are the orange, and almost every other tropical fruit; and as to the health i ness of the; climate, it is too well established to require any comment. Some portions of the army, to be sure, suffered much from disease during the late I indian hostilities; but I am told that an examination of its statistics will show that it suffered less from that, cause in Florida, in proportion to numbers, than it did in the northern and northwestern frontier during the last war with England. The temperature is a pleasant medium between the extremes of heat and cold. By a register of the weather, kept for two years at Charlotte Harbor, the mercury never stood but once as high as 900, nor sunk but once as lowasP50. :0 Further north the extremes are somewhat greater; but at It. Augustine the mercury seldom rises above 900, or falls below 300. But, to use 828 the language of a writer in a late number of that valuable work, "ThcJournal of the American I institute" there are other considerations of high import to the enterprising agriculturists, in favor of locating in Last Florida. I t, has been satisfactorily proved by the late indefatigable and much to be lamented Doctor Ferri ne, that almost any article grown between the tropics will flourish as well, and in some cases better than in their native soil. And the entire catalogue of spices and other articles, for which we now make long and perilous voyages to the opposite side of the globe, often to unhealthy climates, and always incurring vast expense, can be grown in our own Territory, and furnished at a cheaper rate and in better order than those obtained of the half civilized Asiatic is glanders. In addition to all which, cattle, horses, and hogs may be raised in any numbers upon our fine grazing lands, with little or no attention from man. Our rivers and lakes abound with fish of the greatest variety and best quality ; our woodland with the most valuable lumber. And it requires not, as in colder regions, the labor of one half of the year to provide for the other. When all these things are considered, in connection with the fact that Last Florida already produces three of the most valuable staples in the world tea island cotton, rice, and sugar it will, I think, be readily acknowledged that few new countries, if any other, have ever offered advantages to ein i grants superior to those now offered by Last Florida. But I grave your pardon : you only asked me some account of my operations in the silk culture, and I have spun out what I fear will be a tedious article. I am, sir, yours, &cTHOMAS Douglas. I on. 9 . Levy. From the Collar Farmer. Of  Of Culture. Since the explosion of the for us multicaulis speculation, the silk business in Kentucky has not advanced with very rapid strides. Some of these persons who took hold of the business as a business, and investigated the subject properly, are now, by their careful, slow, and patient progress, demonstrating that the pursuit is both safe and profitable, and easily connected with other farming business. Mr. John Pain, of Meade county, called on us the other day and made a statement of his experience in silk culture, the results of which are gratifying. He states, that on the 20th of April last he commenced feeding twenty thousand worms upon the foliage of the white or I italian mulberry, and, three weeks after, he commenced feeding upon the multicaulis. About half the worms were destroyed by the late frosts, and but two bushels of cocoonswas the result, making two pounds of beautiful reeled silk In the 20 thou May he commenced feeding a second crop of twenty-five thousand worms entirely on multicaulis, and lost one third of them by mice and birds. Your bushels of cochons was the result, three and a half bushels of which produced three and a half pounds of silk, and the remainder ten ounces of eggs. The third crop of twelve thousand worms he commenced feeding on the 26th of June, one-fourth of which died of the muco dine, a disease which he checked effectually by sprinkling cold water upon them. This remedy Dec. No. 140. 829 deserves to be generally known. The result of this crop was two and a half bushels of cochons, two bushels of which produced two and a quarter pounds of reeled silk a better product, it will be seen, than the first crop. He fed the foliage of only one quarter of -in acre of trees, planted in 1840 and 1841, and he did all the work himself alone. He gives the pecuniary result as follows 73 pounds reeled silk, sold at 5 -a-                $38.754 ounces eggs, at                                                                $12 (market price) -48 00 Total -86 75 or. Pain states, that besides attending to the silkworms, he attended to his other farming business about as well as his neighbors, and raised, among other things, twenty acres of oats, which produced three hundred bushels, worth at least fifteen cents per bushel; making forty-five dollars. The twenty acres of oats thus produced forty-one dollars and seventy-five cents less than the half acre of mulberries. He further says that it would take him four days or more with his team to haul his crop of oats to market, while he could take his crop of silk, of greater value, under his arm, without difficulty, and walk with it. The twenty acres devoted to oats constituted the very best portion of his farm, and the half acre devoted to mulberries is the very poorest. Mr. C. says that the season has been very unfavorable for the silk business, and that generally a better result may be relied upon, Mr. Pain used a log building, thatched, but he thinks that open sheds are preferable, and he is now erecting one seventy feet long for next seasons operations. Nothing is so injurious to the worms as confined air. His worms have always done as well on the I italian mulberry as on the multicaulis. He cuts the twigs- but does not pluck the leaves, as by this means the tree is kept down to its convenient stature and form, sustains no injury, and a much larger amount of foliage can be gathered in a given time thinks it better to gather them after the dew begins to fall; and thinks that his success depends very materially on the fact that he has used eggs which, produced the Chinese pea nut cochons. Though he has saved no more eggs than he wants for his own use next year, (as he means to feed four acres) he is willing to part with a few thousand eggs, a thousand in a place, for the purpose of aiding in the introduction of an improved stock in the country. They can now be forwarded by mail, and we are authorized to say that orders addressed to him, post paid, at Brandenburg, Kentucky, enclosing twenty cents for a thousand eggs, will be attended to. Mr. C. says he has lost many eggs by keeping them in ice, but has been entirely successful in keeping them under ground in a saltpeter cave which he has. It would perhaps do as well to have them in a glass jar, well sealed with wax, so as entirely to exclude moisture, and placed in an excavation some six or eight feet deep in the bottom of an ordinary cellar, where water can be excluded, or even suspended in a deep well. If we add that Mr. C. has found it advantageous to change his worms occasionally, when feeding, from one place to another, we have probably given, all that is at all peculiar in his management, and all the principal points which can be of value to those who have read the popular treatises s pon the subject. Of course no sensible man would propose to make the silk business takecid12780 the place of all other branches of husbandry. But it no doubt deserves a place among other branches. It is simple, and can be carried on successfully by women, children, and the aged and crippled. But little land is required, and the poorest appears to be as well adapted to this culture as the best, A man having a few acres of poor worn out land in our mountain counties, with a large family of children, could not do better than to occupy a portion of his soil with the mulberry. There is a certain market for all his cochons and reeled silk in this city and elsewhere, and prices are far more uniform and fixed than those of almost any other article of produce. There is a demand at the silk factory in this city for more than can be produced for some time to come in this State. Saw silk is now imported from Europe in large quantities, to be manufactured in this country. Besides, the imports of manufactured silk amount to several millions. There is no danger that the business will be over done. To teams are required, and there is no branch of farming that can be carried on with so little capital. Cuttings and roots of both the I italian mulberry and themulticaulis can now be procured for nothing, or next to nothing, and they can be cultivated and propagated as simply and certainly as the current bush. It may be added that the perforated cochons, not wanted by the manufacturer, can be carded and spun in the family, and constitute art important material of domestic clothing. S. -a. From the New York Farmer and Mechanics Mportant From Georgi Asi  Of Wellropes And Oxchai Of. We regret that the small space necessarily devoted to this department obliges us to withhold from the public many valuable communications from practical silkculturists. We shall endeavor, however, to give the substance of all letters of importance designed for the public eye. The following extracts are from our friend Judge Ernest, of Bacon, Georgia. This gentleman has long been identified with the interests of this enterprise in the southern sections of the Union, and deserves the thanks of all for the perseverance he has manifested in prose cuting the business, in defiance of all opposition; and we can but hope that the fact is beginning to be realized, that silk may be produced at the south with far less expense, and greater profits, than any other crop. As in Georgia, so in every part of our country, people wait for a market, and nothing of importance will be accomplished until measures are matured and carried into operation for purchasing and reeling all the cochons that can be produced. Since we have been agitating this question, we have been gratified to find our efforts seconded by the proprietors of various agricultural and other publications; and it is our intention to press the measure upon the attenltibof the public, until it secures the support its importance demands. Judgeernest says: "I consider your plan for a feature and market the most important step that has been taken in our country, designed for the advancement of the cause. There was more silk made in Georgia five or six years ago than there is now; and the reason is this: the people could do nothing with their silk (cochons) after they had made it, and consequently abandoned the business i I have been offered several lots of corns for nothing, which have refused, because I had more of my own than I could dispose of, unless have better means for manufacturing. Saw silk accumulated on my hands to such an extent, that I made a well rope of silk, 40 feet long, and an ox rope, bag strings, &c; and all because there was no market. I intend to make a favorable impression on the minds of people here in regard to the matter shall make all the silk I can, turn it into cash, and tell them about it. I have accomplished much in this way already. If I find that there are going to be more cochons than I can work up into sew in. I shall prepare to re el only. I told an acquaintance yesterday that I should purchase cochons, and he promised to make all he could. He is a man calculated to carry anything he undertakes into effect. Several others also speak of going into the business. If I can raise a good crop again, I think the question will be settled in this neighborhood, and then it will go like fire in a prairie. I have always been successful, even when I knew less of the business, and had less inducements to prosecute it than I now have. I have 8 or 9 acres of trees, five years old, and room in abundance; so that my future prospects, compared with the past, are extremely flattering. I have done much under very unfavorable circumstances, and from this I infer what may be done under those more favorable. When I commenced the silk culture I knew nothing of the business, and in my isolated condition Had difficulties to encounter that persons in more favorable situations would hardly dream of. In addition to all the difficulties necessarily incident to the business, I was obliged to encounter at every step the opposition of almost every person with whom I was conversant. I am sure I have made the business profitable. We sell our silk to persons who could purchase at bacon, if it were for their interest to do so, and at prices to us satisfactory. Persons residing in Bacon frequently purchase silk of us for their own use. Am confident that the United States must some day become one of the greatest silk producing countries in the world. It is impossible for countries where land is so costly as in Europe to compete with us in the production of silk, or anything else that grows out of the ground. It is a long time since I have heard any one express any doubts on these points. But when will you get a market has been the question; a question which I have been unable to answer. If successful in accomplishing present plans, I can furnish a market until the business is too deeply rooted to be easily checked and this I will certainly do resigning no flattery, sir, allow me to say that   think you deserving the thanks of all the friends of silk culture throughout the entire country. It is very desirable to improve the condition of a solitary individual; but   am confident that you are in a fair way to benefit a great many persons. I do not pass a day without seeing some person whose condition might be improved by the silk culture. We have no bounty in this State, but we can get along without it. If we had a bounty, the business would make more rapid progress; but if it can get along without artificial means, it will always be more healthy and permanent. I have the satisfaction of knowing that although I have heretofore stood alone, or nearly so, the friends of the enterprise are now rapidly multiplying. I know it can be made more profitable than any present pursuit here. 1 would rather raise silk, than cotton 0 ti 20 cents (and it brings only 4 cents) per pound. Our people hang to their old habits, but this cannot be done much longer. If they see me making more money at the silk, they will want to have a hand in it From another letter, dated March ll th, we extract the following. It 832 will be seen from this that Judge E. has this season adopted the system of open feeding, and we predict an increased return for the same amount of later heretofore bestowed. I need, this is certain. Will not Georgian snow take hold of the business ?a? A market is secured to them, and every circumstance seems inviting. While we are shivering with almost January weather, (march 20,) they have the breath of our summer, their eggs are watching, and their foliage fine and abundant. While we, in many cases, are confined to one or two crops in a season, they can feed from April to November. Y. E. Under the latter date, (march 11,) the writer says" I have some fears that our mulberry leaves will get killed, and that we shall lose our worms, for they are already watching, and have been for several days. We are doing all we can to retard them, but shall not be able to do so much longer unless the weather changes. This is one of the most forward springs I ever saw. I have some mulberry trees in my yard which are now a fine shade. The leaves are abundant, and almost as large as my hand. The plum trees and black merry bushes are all green, and stock is doing pretty well in the woods. These things are rather alarming, but we hope for good. I have one cocoonery 20 by 30 feet, two stories high; another 18 by 34. To these 1 am attaching sheds 16 feet wide. I leave the lower stories open. The only thing necessary to success, that 1 lack, is a nice house for the preservation of my eggs. The weather has changed for the better. It is cold enough to freeze if it were not cloudy k and our worms have ceased hatchingFrom the New York Farmer and Mechanie. Of  Of Cultureaddi Of   Onal Parti   Culars. We have more than once referred to the efforts making by Judge Ernest, of Bacon, Georgia. Too much credit cannot be given this gentleman for his perseverance in this cause; and we rejoice to learn that his every effort is crowned with success. His feeding this season commenced about the middle of May. In a letter bearing date May 2 3d, he says: "I have not made much silk this year: nevertheless, think I have made a favorable impression upon the minds of the people, because I have been completely successful with what silk worms I had. I have fed this year, for the first time, in an open building, and am well satisfied that silk worms do much better when fed in this way. I had no more eggs than I should have hatched and fed; but heretofore I have made too much silk more than I could manufacture; and fearing that I should not get machinery in time, and that the same would be the case, I have chosen to feed but few, and disposed of a good many eggs; and in attempting to retard the watching of some, I raised four or five ounces. We have made, we think, thirty pounds of silk, and have already reeled seventeen or eighteen pounds. I have heard of only one person who got eggs of me, and he has been successful, and will continue to raise cochons if I would buy them, and that he was a man calculated to carry the thing to perfection; but, un c. No. 140. 83 fortunately, some of his domestics came across the eggs, and, thinking them of no value, threw them into the fire. He will go on next year. I also mentioned that Dr. Inn, of Monroe county, that a fine field of mulberries of twelve acres. The doctor has been feeding silk works for several years; and, to my great astonishment, has been unsuccessful. I was the more astonished because he had great zeal, and appeared pleased with the business. I could not account for his lack of success until last week, when I received from his brother an account of his management. He had fed all the time in a close garre t. This solved the mystery at once, and I sent him word that if he would come and see me, I would instruct him to feed worms successfully, and he has promised to do so; so that I think there is little doubt but he will go into the business again; and if he does, and follows my directions, he will certainly succeed; and he can carry it to any extent, for he is rich, and, 1 understand, would delight in it. I informed you also, I think, that Major Smith had a fine field of mulberrytrees, and that he has been endeavoring for several years to get some person to make silk for him; but at the time I wrote, I had been told that he had cut down his trees, and planted the field in corn. This, however, was a mistake. He had cut down his trees because they had got out of the reach of his stock, and he still wishes to get some person to attend to the business for him. The silk business will, sooner or later, be carried to a great extent in Georgia, but how long it will be before this time arrives, I cannot tell. Great numbers are already convinced that it can be made more profitable than anything we are doing, and yet few seem determined to go into it. This is strange, but it is certainly true. Exgovernormcdonald is a great friend to the silk cause. He is a great jurist, and his business and knowledge extend all over the State; and from him I expect to gain much information of the business in different sections of the State. I labor under many disadvantages, being alone. Were there others, we could have an ice house, which a single individual can hardly afford hence I must confine myself to a single crop. 1 have had eggs sent from the north, but they did not do well. If I have too many eggs, they are lost; and if too, few, there is no one to supply me. With all these disadvantages, I make the business profitable. It is painful to think what great benefit might result to the country from the silk culture, and then see how little attention the subject receives. If people differed with me, I should neither wonder at them nor blame them; but they do not. Admitting thepracticability and the importance of em barking in the- enterprise, theyleavita We have, however, a few practical men among us; and during my feeding this year, I have had: many visitors, and all seemed pleased with the business. One man came eighty miles, another thirty, and a third more than twenty; and they were moved by something more than mere curiosity, took poor lady in this neighborhood has made some cochons, and, to her great astonishment and joy, I gave her                          $2.50 per bushel for them; and I have already paid her                                                                     $10. The is much delighted, and says she will brag about and show her times to every body. The effect will be good. The could not have made half this at any thing else and this she knows. There are many such poor families amongst us, and if they can be persuaded to go and do likewise, it will be well for both themselves and the country. I should not be surprised if there were cochons enough raised 538 34 within reach of me next year to keep two or three feels in operation all summer, or perhaps all the years correspondent" furnishes us with another " god return." He says: "<A person purchased of me a few silkworms' eggs, for fifty cents. They hatched July 4th, and in four weeks wound their cochons, of a very superior quality, measuring five pecks, which weighed thirteen pounds to the bushel. He sold one bushel for            $4, and used the residue for eggs, which are worth          $5 or   $6. He is so pleased that he intends enlarging his business will procure more trees, and try again.

Such are a few of the favorable results which have come to our knowledge all conducted with reason ; and hence followed with success, as all such efforts must be. We are informed by a note from the editor of the " Alphadelphia Does in" that their association will commence their arrangements next spring for making the silk business a regular and permanent pursuit, and that they have every convenience for making it extensive and profitable. He would refer similar associations to the German society, at Economy, to show to what extent it may be carried, where not less than 500 to 600 pounds of reeled silk have been produced in a single season; and this they manufacture into the finest and most beautiful fabric s thus rendering it not merely an ornamental, but one of the most lucrative pursuits of the community. Now that there can be no longer a doubt as to the sensibility and profit of the silk business, how long will men refuse, as many do, to embark in it, for no other reason t that hat it was once connected with speculation andhumbuggingA. C. Van Eppsstroll Among The Mulberry Trees In Northampton, In August And September, 1845."I n the midst was a spacious cocoonery, filled with an interesting family of silkworms, of every size and age, between the egg and cochon, taking a hasty lunch at the hands of the attendants, who estimated them at one million. Although the family was so numerous, each appeared perfectly satisfied with the fare from the larger and the field, furnished by only two attendants, to collect, prepare, and distribute the food to this numerous and interesting family: such was the order, regularity, and system adopted, that the whole process was as regular as clock work. After passing through and inspecting the premises, a second stroll was% made, in another section of the town, into an extensive Wanton mulberrygrove, which had grown the present season from three to seven feet, loaded with luxuriant foliage, sufficient for another million of worms, and. was. 835 introduced to another interesting family of youngsters, not of so numerous or of so large a size as some in the million are, yet, as a whole, quite as interesting to behold, for they were in the last o various stage; and some had commenced their lunch, soon as liberated from the shell, upon themulberry paper where on they had been placed, instead of fresh foliage from the tree. It was a pleasing sight to see how readily they would pass from the common paper, on which they were hatched, to the mulberry paper. This paper had been made of mulberry foliage and bark, un bleached, for the purpose now used, and appeared to answer the purpose for which it was designed. If this late experiment should prove successful, cochons may be exported about the time that the New England silk convention shall hold their annual meeting, on the first day of October, 1845; but, should the weather prove adverse, a delay might extend to the time of the national silk convention on the 9th of October, or even later. Another experimental crop has been in contemplation for matriculationupon the new mode, about the 10th or 15th of September, and, if not prostrated by General Frost making an attack upon the mulberry patch, maybe expected to go up about that season of the year when Buy Takes laid his powder plot, on the memorable 5th of November, or some part of the month so fatal to English hypochondria is. I have witnessed the incident, middle, and closing stages of feeding silkworms, and the great abundance of Wanton foliage that could not or had not been used for feeding worms the present season, but which might and ought to be used for making mulberry paper, which is decidedly preferable for the steel pen, and also for the deposit e of silkworms' eggs, and for young worms when liable to premature watching, or to obviate the destruction of forage by frosts, in which case it is thought that the dried leaves might be used to finish with, being pulverized, moistened, and sprinkled with wheat or rice flour. Forms have been so fed with good success in the spring season. A large quantity of surplus foliage will be preserved for useful purposes, and also thousands of cuttings and eggs. It is desirable to see the final e of cocoonery operations; therefore, a stroll was made to an egg era place where silkworms' eggs are saved for future use and I had the pleasure of seeing a grand display of sheet after sheet, suspended and covered with silkworms' eggs, for removal to the reception room; such were the quantities exhibited, as appeared sufficient to formulate the whole of New England, and a surplus for the sunny latitude for which northern eggs are peculiarly adapted. Some were deposited on large thick sheets, to absorb any possible moisture others on very thin, pliable sheets, for mail convenience. But the most interesting sight was where the eggs had been deposited upon sheets of paper made of mulberry foliage, that, should the worms be hatched premature ly, they would have a mulberry substance to nimble upon, being prepared for that purpose. It was "interesting to witness how readily the young worms, soon as hatched upon common paper placed over the mulberry paper, would attach themselves to the latter. The experiments now in progress may be of some benefit to new be dinners, who may be supplied gratuitous ly with cuttings to commence operations another year, if taken away before November.

To business can be prosecuted with profit without a well regulated systeniof operations. This is pre eminently important in the production of silk nothing can be done without it. We have seen farmers with from one to three hundred acres of the finest land in the world, whose annual returns from the same were barely sufficient to meet the demands of the tax gathered, and provide a comfortable subsistence for their families. We have seen in the same vicinity men with two thirds less, and of precisely the same quality, not only meeting all the demands of the world upon them, and securing means for the support and education of their families, but yearly to add materially to the stock of funds accumulation g for a "rainy day." Now, why this difference The reason is obvious: one conducts his operations with neither system nor intelligence, while the other employs both. The same difference is observe able in the culture of silk. We have been particularly convinced of this in preparing the matter for the forthcoming reports of the silk convention held at the American I institute in October last. Any cases are related where the writers had plantations varying from five to ten and twelve acres of mulberry trees, from which they had secured scarcely cochons enough to pay for the cultivation of the soil. The failures in such cases are usually attributed to the kind of mulberryused. Others, with the same varieties and similar climate and soil, state that from one and a half to three acres they have realized from fifty to over one hundred bushels of good cochons. These lavish their praises upon the same mulberry which the others condemned. The facts in the cases were, probably, that the trees of the former were entirely neglected, or indifferently cultivated, producing small innutritious foliage, while the latter had their trees planted on good soil, free from grass and weeds of all kinds which are exceedingly poisonous to the foliage of the mulberry) and kept in a good state of cultivation during the season. The first step towards success in the silk culture is a supply of perfect eggs; that is, eggs from healthy worms, properly taken care of at the time of laying, and secured in ice until needed for feeding. The care of the miller we shall refer to at the appropriate season. The saving of the eggs is a subject of immense importance, and has called forth various and conflicting opinions; some contending that the watching process cannot be retarded without serious injury to if not the destruction of the worm, while others maintain that the constitution of the worm is not in the least affected by it. We concur in the latter theory, and believe it accords with the opinions commonly entertained by silk cult wrists of the present day. In many instances persons have lost their eggs by placing them in aniicehouse; hence the lingering prejudices against this course. These failures have been owing to one of the following reasons, viz: Either they were not placed in the ice until they had passed through the incipientprocess of watching, or else they were not sufficiently imbedded in the ice as wholly to exclude the warmth of the spring and summer atmosphere. It is an easy matter, when filling your ice cellars, to prepare a place for the box or trunk containing your eggs. A hole should be left near the middle of the cellar large enough to allow the box to sit in, and leave a space of m few inches on each side. This hole should extend down at least four feet. a. 837Your box, having been placed in the bottom, should be covered and surrounded with straw. In taking out the eggs during the summer, it should always be done in the coolest part of the day, and the box never removed from the ice. When the eggs are placed in the box, they should be folded up in several packages, and well surrounded with cotton patting. In this way we have kept our eggs until August, and found them perfectly dry and fine, watching in about twelve days after their exposure. N. The eggs should always be placed in the cellar before the first of March. The safer and better way would be to get your ice in the latter part of January, and put your eggs in when the weather is extremely cold. In removing them for feeding, they should be gradually exposed ; not permitted to receive all the whole warmth of the atmosphere before the third day. The second thing in importance is, the mulberry plantation from which you are to collect your foliage. Any failures doubtless are to be attributed directly to the want of good, healthy foliage. The trees should be planted in rows, far enough apart to admit of easy cultivation. The ground should be kept perfectly free from all foul weeds, and as loose as possible. It should be among the last fall labor to throw up a furrow towards the roots of the trees; and in the spring return it as early as possible, that the roots may receive the benefits of the first warm rays of the sun. Provided with eggs and foliage, we must next provide a place for feeding. The simplest protection that can be provided, to shield from sun and storms, will be found the best; and we should advise every person to adopt, without delay, the open system of feeding. A shed of the following description will answer every purpose, far better than any enclosed building that could be constructedSFor three acres of trees it will probably be found necessary to raise a tent or shed seventy-five feet in length by twenty in width. The cheapest building of this description we have seen was made by placing in the ground three rows of posts the desired length the outer rows eight feet above ground, the middle thirteen and covered with common boards. The sides and ends were made of coarse muslin curtains, each about ten feet long, attached to rollers, so that the entire building could in a few minutes be exposed to as pure and free a circulation of air as in the open field. I none end of this tent should be finished off a nursery room, for watching and bringing forward young worms, and also a bed room for the principal fee der. In this can be used Hills ventilation g cradle, or any other apparatus for feeding desired. The nursery should be furnished with a stove for raising the temperature in damp, cold weather. Artificial heat may frequently be employed to advantage (particularly in New England) previous to the third mounting, while the worms require but little space and air. We would here caution growers against noise. Very preparation requiring pounding or jarring should be attended to before the worms are hatched, that every thing in and around the building may be perfectly quiet throughout the whole feeding. The feeding frames which we use, and prefer to any other fixtures we have seen, are very simple, combining all the advantages of< Hills ventilation g cradle" with none of its disadvantages, saving much time and some expense in their construction, besides being a sure defence against mice, rats, ants, and other enemies of the silk worm. Should any of our readers indeed to adopt Our plans, the following description Will be sufficed 127) the first place, attach the pieces of timber designed for suspending the frames to the rafters, allowing them to come down to within two feet of the ground. These should be about seven or eight feet apart at the top, and four or five at the bottom, which will cause the frame to enlarge in nearly the same proportion with the worms, and thus prevent their becoming too much crowded. This is the chief excellence, we think, of Hills cradle. Cross pieces should be fastened at the lower ends of the upright timbers, on which to lay boards to receive the worms from the nursery. About two inches above these boards should be placed sticks, one inch square, resting on pieces running length wise at the sides. These, at first, should be six inches apart, (after a few days' feeding, one half can be drawn out) and in feeding, the branches should be laid between them, until they are filled up to the top, when they should be laid across. After two or three days 3 feeding, the boards and dry branches should be removed from under the worms, and they left to feed on the branches above. If care is taken to feed no more than is needed, the brush will remain very open, allowing all the pieces of leaves and the excrements from the worms to fall directly through to the ground, from which they should be often swept out, furnishing a free circulation of air from beneath. At the sides and ends .of these frames it is necessary to have something to keep the branches in order, and prevent the worms from falling off. These may be made of narrow boards or baths; between these and the brush most of the cochons will be placed, as it secures the worms from the light, and furnishes them with places for fastening their f loss, whenever they have finished eating and are ready to spin. These directions, of course, are applicable only where i ranch feeding is practised. Cocoons should not be gathered until dried this is, in six or seven days from the time the worms begin to spin. Thosedsigned for eggs should be selected first, taking such as have been spunyhehmb most healthy worms. These should be closely f lossed and spread omit thin on the shelves in the nursery. We now come to the destruction of the cry sales, and the curing of thecid127ccoons, upon which the value of the silk must depend. We cannot dwell upon this point with too much care. We have received at our feature cocoonstt had been almost ruined by the means used for stifling the cry sales. Our standing offer is from                          $2.50 to                $3.50 per bushel; yet we have hadcocoons sent us which would not pay the expenses of reeling and transportation. Among the means resorted to for this purpose alcohol is doubtless the best as it not only destroys the chrysalis, but leaves the fibre of the cochon in fine order for reeling, and is supposed by some actually to add to its original beauty. Not more than half a pint (some use only a will, others a pint) is needed for a bushel of cochons. They should be placed for this purpose in a tight box ; first a layer of cochons, (very thin) then a slight sprinkling with alcohol, and so on till the box is filled, which should tie ii be nailed up tight. After remaining in the box about twenty-four hours, they should be removed and spread out for drying, which will take several day, even in very warm weather. If the cry sales are not entirely dry, they undergo a putrefaction, which frequently injures the silk, and riders them very offensive to the reeled. Persons designing to send their cocoonsto or feature are requested to adopt the above method; and as soon as dried the cochons should be forwarded, as it is exceedingly hazardous duroc. No. o 140 chasing when they have been lying some months, and become very dry. Applications are now pending for several hundred bushels, and we know not what to answer. We can only say to all, as we have said to some send your cochons if you please; we will do the best we can by them, and pay you all we possibly can afford. In conclusion, we would say per severe, and success is certain. The silk cause has never been half so flourishing as at the present time. We will, as we have before said, pay, all we can for your old cochons, and warrant you a good price for your coming crops, be they large or small. A. C. V. E. The Of  Of Cause In The Ohi O Valley. We believe it is not generally known to what extent the culture of silk is carried on here. It has had no " multicaulis mania" to interrupt its progress, and hence has gone steadily forward until the present time. Farpersalong the Ohio have hit upon the true principle the one by which we gain our supplies of butter, cheese, land, &c, &c; that is, each producing a small quantity at least. In passing through that beautiful valley during their delightful summers, it is becoming quite a common thing to see the females and the smaller members of the family gathering the foliage, and carefully bringing forward a family of silkworms. It is found profitable, either on a small scale or an extensive scale; and we have been told that more can be made from a given quantity of land, in raising cochons at                          $2 per bushel, than wheat at                                                         $1. The same is doubtless true of the entire South. If we are correctly informed, there is not less than 50,000 bushels of cochons now annually raised in the valley of the Ohio. Should we name any 'course as more likely to succeed than any other, it would be that of Mr. Bliss, in his report to the Ohio legislature. He recommends every farmer to have his patch of mulberry, and every year to make it a point to raise at. least ten bushels of cochons. This will most certainly be the practice when features for reeling are established. A. C. V. E. Mulberry Trees, Of  Lkworms, &c. Messrs. Fleet & Starr: There are many species of the mulberry, but the Ll pine is to be preferred to any other, and was very highly valued by or. Hit marsh, who imported it. The rhulberry leaves are composed of five distinct or different substances the solid or fibrous, the coloring matter, water, sac charing, and resinoussubstances. The fibrous, the coloring matter, and the water, excepting a very small quantity, cannot be said to be nutrition to the silkworm. It is thesaccharine matter which nourished the insect; that enlarges and forms its animal substance, separating itself gradually from the leaf, and, attracted byth6a annual organization, accumulates, clears itself of all that is foreign, tit sown nature, and by degrees fills the two reservoirs or silk vessels, which form the whole internal cavity of the silkworm i Such depends upon the proportions which the different elements of which the leaves are composed 8 40 bear to each other. Cases may occur in which a large quantity and weight of leaves will minister very little serviceable nutriment to the silkworm. The Ll pine mulberry, planted on high land, exposed to cold dry winds, and in light soil, produces the most healthy and nutrient leaf, and the largest quantity of strong silk of the purest and finest quality. The less nutrient substance the leaves coat ain, the greater quantity must the silkworm consume to complete its development. The result is, that being obliged to perform an undue amount of labor in consuming a large bulk ofinnutritious foliage, the worms become fatigued, enfeebled, and certainly more liable to disease than those are which eat a smaller amount, which they would do if the leaves were more nutritions. The small silkworm, or the eighth crop, is the best sort; this is a very superior species it furnishes superior silk, and of a fine texture. Cocoonery and mulberry plantation he have a mulberry plantation of 15 acres of trees, and a cocoonery on it, 100 feet by 25, and one plantation of 20 acres; cocoonery now in process of erection for feeding this season. Feel, and reeling The greatest defect in American raw silk is, that it is badly reeled, owing to its having been done by awkward and inexperienced hands. Seeing the necessity of a public feature, to which all who growcocoons could resort, we were induced, for the advantage of all, to establish a dilatory of 8 feels, for the reeling of all cochons which are good, and the chrysalis stifled by my method. My re el possesses many advantages over every other re el. I have made several improvements on the re el since     sold four to Mr. An Pps. I make the re el larger for the skein to feel the silk on ; have sold 12 of the feels to go to South America, and one to wanton, China. Mr. Valentine, an English silk manufacturer in this town, procured some of the silk reeled by me on this re el, (which he considered superior to any other which he has known, for even ness, color, and finish to send to his friends in England, as its success is improving the silk manufacture. Sort hampton stands first upon the list among silk growing and silk manufacturing towns in America. The Sort hampton Association (silk factory one hundred feet long and four stories high) promises to do much for the advancement of the silk business, as well as the prosperity of the town.

Of  Of Culture. The following letter from S. A. Elements, of North Ran by, Connrecticutwill be read with interest. It shows with what reception the improvements in feeding meet in our oldest establishments. This is the true plan, and must eventually be the only plan of rearing the silk worm successfully. The old school system may and frequently does succeed, but is always attended with immense cost compared with the new, and shows that our climate is so well suited to the growth of the worm that it will grow under almost any circumstances. Mr. Elements says: "by grandfather planted on his farm a small orchard of the white mud. a. 841 merry, 50 or 60 years ago, from trees obtained from the minister of the parish, who raised them from seed furnished hi m by President Stiles, of Pale college. A few of these trees, as large as good sized apple trees, are now standing, and yield abundant foliage. Twelve or fifteen years ago my father planted an orchard of about three acres with white mulberry, in rows about one rod apart, and the trees three feet apart in the rows. The open ground between the rows having been cultivated each season, the trees have flourished vigorously, although the soil is of an indifferent quality. Silkworm S were fed from the old orchard sometime previous to the last war, and the silk made into sewings, stockings, &c, in the family. During the last ten years, we have fed more or less, and always with good success in rearing the worms. We think there is no more difficulty in watching a crop of silk worms, and carrying them through safely, if the requisite care is bestowed, than there is in raising poultry. The care chiefly necessary is, to keep the eggs in a cool dry place, secure from ver min, until they are wanted, then expose them to such heat as will bring out the young artist; feed him plentiful ly while he is disposed to eat; let him alone while he is mounting; and, above all, dontsuffocate him by want of air. We have obtained the best cochons from early feeding, and have attributed it to the foliage being fresh and better adapted to the nature of the worm than late in the season. Until the last year we had followed the old Connecticut custom of plucking the leaves from the trees for feeding, but the trees having grown so large that it was difficult to get at them for this purpose, and the tops having become so thick as to need p runing, we cut off the branches a few feet from the trunk, and stripped the foliage from them. Either of these methods, however, is unnecessarily expensive. We are now cutting out the tops of our trees, leaving the bare trunk and two or three feet of the principal branches, which are within reach from the ground, and intend, hereafter, to feed entirely from the young shoots, which will be furnished in abundance. As the shoots are taken off, others will put forth, and thus there will be a supply of fresh, tender foliage until late in the season. This seems to reform the apparent difficulty in making as good cochons from late as from early feeding. From observations made at the cocoonery of the Sort hampton Association and elsewhere, we are convinced that the best mode of cultivating the mulberryis to plant them in rows about three feet and a half apart, and as thick as they can grow in the rows. The trees are kept headed down by cutting off the shoots several times in the season, as they spring from the ground. In this way the weeds are easily kept out with the cultivate or; the foliage is obtained with little labor, and probably in greater quantities than if the trees were planted at greater distances, and permitted to form trunks. A neighbor of ours has cultivated the multicaulis in this way, and fed from them for several years with entire success. I instead of feeding with the shoots, however, he gathers the leaves as they put forth, and every spring cuts down the whole top to within a few inches of the ground. By spreading the litter from the hur does upon the orchard, he has sensibly improved the condition of his soil, which was sandy and poor, and thus increased the quantity of foliage each year. The silk he produces is manufactured into sewings in his own family, and returns him at the rate of                                                                         $100 per acre. Another neighbor, who cultivates the multicaulis with like success, fed from one tree one season, and found that, weight for weight, the while mulberryproduced much more silk than the multicaulis. We have tried the different kinds of worms, and like the pea nut best, as affording very fine 8 42 strong silk, and perhaps equal in amount to any other variety. Some silk growers in this vicinity prefer the mammoth sulphur, as it feels more easily, and, although the silk is of a coarser quality, it answers very well for sewings. It is to be regretted that the fine lustrous silk which we can raise in this country should meet no better fate than to be made into sewing silk, for which, abroad, only the third rate silk is used; but we are compelled to endure this until our people learn how to re el the splendid fabric of our silk worms in the way it deserves. The silk re el* invented by Mr. Liver. Hayne, of Sort hampton, Pass, for compact ness of construction, ease in joining the fibres, and the superior manner in which it leaves the skein for the hands of the manufacturers, I think superior to the Piedmontese, or any other re el I have seen, and well merits the examination of all who are interested in reeling. What I have penned [is first rate practically, and naturally worthy of imitation. E.] may be of less value to others than to myself; but whatever may be the hesitancy now shown to engage in the silk business, I am convinced that branch feeding (in open sheds) is destined to insure its triumph; and certainly I know of no one who has had experience enough to give weight to his testimony, but will agree with me that silk culture can be made the most profitable branch of husbandry pursued in our country, cotton and sugar (of which I have had an opportunity for demonstration, both at the south and West In dies) not excepted."

In making our proposed tour through these sections of the Union, we have concluded to begin with Mississippi, rather than at Economy, Pennsylvania. The view we shall give will be an imperfect one, and not calculated to give a full representation of what is being done here, from the fact that a great majority of those engaged in the silk culture have never reported themselves, either to the Silk Culture Convention or to private individuals.

Of  R: Your address to "silk growers, &c" reached me a short time since through due course of mail. I will now endeavor to comply with your wishes. The lady of my nearest neighbor, W. R. Fibres, commenced last year to rear the silkworm. Being of an experimental turn of mind, she resolved to try whether the trouble of feeding, fires, &c, &c, might not be avoid able; and, as her wont, no sooner said than done.

I visited my friend several times whilst the worms were feeding, and know certainly that they were thus exposed to all weather, with no other protection, and that whilst they were there we had a very hard rain, with two exceedingly cold days for our latitude and the season wind blowing constantly for two days, very keen, from the northwest. With all this, the worms, in a short time after the weather became pleasant, were larger than those kept in a house with fire. This experiment of my sister in law proves most conclusively to my mind that worms will bear any degree of cold that we have in our climate at that season and her spirit merits all commendation. We feed a few worms, only to keep up seed, and, as usual, in an airy room, without cutting or being particular to have dry leaves gathering with dew on them; we cleared our frames oftener than usual, using no lime, and were more successful than heretofore. I send you specimens of our silk not prepared with the most remote idea of sending from home, much less to such a spot, and to such people. You will make due allowance for our never having seen reeling or twisting; we have no machinery save that used on an ordinary plantation a common large wheel, and a re el used for hanging thread. We use the thread we manufacture, either to make fishing lines, or our ladies use it in their business, or to make lace for "ed going" or " inserting." We find our thread far stronger, in proportion to size, than that we purchase of foreign make, and more even. Or machinery is too rude to offer them in competition with your northern articles, nor do I intend it; my intention being to give you something that will show the strength, and that my adopted State should be represented badly rather than not at all.

V. 84 4 icons enough were made in the valley of the Ohio to keep 200 feels in constant operation during the year; from which we concluded that not less than 50,000 bushels of cochons were annually produced. This conclusion was based on the following calculation : We suppose the feels to operate 300 days during the year, and to turn off 174 lbs. of silk per day, which would give 52,200 pounds per year. Allowing each pound of reeled silk to require 1, bushel of cochons, we have fifty-eight thousands even hundred and twenty bushels of cochons. This calculation is a perfectly reasonable one, i and will be found, by experience, to fall within the truth. We called the quantity 50,000 bushels, which we confess seems like exaggeration, but the source of our information is a reliable one, and the statement must be set down as true, until shown to be otherwise, for a proof of which our columns are open. Since the publication of the above, no little surprise has been manifested, and we have been met by numerous exclamations like the following: 6 I s it possible! 50,000 bushels of cochons !a! What can possibly become of the silk? I s it exported, or are there private features and man factories to consume this vast amount of silk ?a" We confess our ignorance of the disposal of the cochons, or raw material. We have stated our authority and drawn our conclusions, and leave our readers to investigate; remarking that many inquiries have been forwarded to our feature from the west and southwest, asking for a market for cochons. To far as we know, no distinct establishments have been opened there for reeling ; and, judging from nearly 100 letters we have seen from silk cult wrists in those sections, we believe by far the largest proportion of these cochons were worked up into sewings, &c, in the families of their producers. Owing to the imperfect ion of their machinery, a large proportion is worse than lost. Mr. Will (whose factory is by far the largest at the west) says that he works up only 1,000 bushels per year. We hope shortly to be able to announce the establishment of features at different points along the Ohio and its main tributaries, of sufficient extent to reeled very cochon produced. A small addition to our pecuniary facilities is only wanting to enable us to carry our plans into full and successful operation. Any gentleman disposed to aid in this way can learn particulars by calling at the American  institute and inquiring of its officers, who are acquainted with our plans, and who are quite as much interested in their success as we can be. Among the innumerable benefits this institute is conferring upon the country should be named their exertions to advance the culture and manufacture of silk, We have been indebted to them for valuable counsels, and important facts. They have just placed at our disposal a large number of letters received at the last annual silk convention, held at the repose tory of the I institute in October last. These contain matter of vast importance connected with the experience of the last year, which, on many accounts, is the most important in our history connected with silk. It was the intention to have embodied these letters in a report similar to the previous year, but this has not been done, and we shall commence next week the regular publication of them in the silk department of the " Farmer and Mechanics, "copies of which will be sent to silk growers generally; and as this valuable journal is to be the regular depositors for information on silk, and is the organ of the American I institute, containing the proceedings of the Are Hers' Club, we hope every person receiving a copy of this will not only become a subscribe r himself, but induce others, if possible, to do the. 85 same. Mr. Fleet is the oldest agricultural editor in this State, and no other has such abundant facilities for the collection and diffusion of useful information. We shall next week commence a tour of examination in the Ohio valley; beginning near its rise, at the establishment of Miss Rapp, at Economy, Pennsylvania. S A. C. V. Of Epps. Of  Of Conventi   Of. Reply of Dr. Daniel Stebbins, of Sort hampton, Massachusetts, to a circular of the American I institute, inviting his attendance at the convention of silk cult wrists, &c, held during the late Hair, dated Sort hampton, October 2d, and addressed to the secretary of the I institute. He says in account of the situation and public duties requiring my personal at, t ention, it is extremely doubtful whether it will be ad missile for me to accept of your kind circular invitation, and I must be deprived of the pleasure of participating in the enjoyment of that interesting meeting. But I have done, and shall continue to do, all I can to advance the cause in some other way to stimulate others to improve the opportunity. I have caused public notice of that convention to be extensively circulated in the papers, with the time and importance of the convention. Perhaps in this way I shall have rendered as much personal service as could have been reasonably expected of a solitary individual. I labored incessantly last winter to obtain the grant of a bounty from our legislature, to encourage the growth of silk in this Commonwealth; and through the aid of kind friends, a bounty of ten cents was obtained on cochons for the term of three years. I had hopes that the bounty would have excited an interest throughout the Commonwealth, to commence anew or recommence the business of growing silk. But my anticipations have been sadly disappointed. Various causes might be assigned : the previous and extensive destruction of trees, in consequence of the tree speculation, so that only a few trees escaped, and those in the hands of individuals who were not influenced by the d elusive prospect of immediate wealth. Another cause may have deterred others, who had some remaining trees on hand, the foliage of which was injured or destroyed by early spring frosts at the very time that farmers should be about their spring work, and could not wait for the reproduction of foliage; and there may have been other causes; but these alone were sufficient. Trees may be reproduced, and another spring frost may not occur next year. But we very well know that when any business has been long suspended from adverse causes, and other pursuits adopted, it is very difficult to persuade people to return to former occupations, unless by the strongest inducements of more immediate reward than can now be guaranteed. As in every other great undertaking, we want the long pill l, strong pull, and pull altogether" and the same exertions in the silk culture. The spring frosts did not materially injure the foliage of my trees, on account of the favorable location. Although I have 10 to 12 acres of the best variety for growing silk, my 8 46 health and other business requirements prevent my personal attention to the business. The present year I leased to the Messrs. Elements, of Southgranby, Connecticut, who will attend the convention and relate their own story. There has been some silk reeled, and a large quantity of silk worms eggs left in my care for another year; and a plenty of good cuttings will be preserved. Before the Messrs. Elements 'closed their business, I had foliage sufficient to feed one million of worms. I have now in the care of another person 200 000 or 300,000 worms to test late feeding upon crude and frost bitten foliage, for we have had severe frosts and sudden changes, with the mercury suddenly dropping from 600 or 70 down to 40. I have no confidence, however, in this late crop, and am confirmed in the opinion of an early crop being the most safe and sure, so as to close up the business as early as practicable in the month of July. I am peculiarly favored with a location to keep my eggs, and have now on hand several ounces of last years production, and there is no more appearance of watching than at the time they were laid, more than a year since ; and to test these, I have brought out 15,000 to 20,000, which hat chin 5 or 6 days, appear well, and, as the fishermen say, " kicking." They eat well; and I shall try the effects of un propitious weather and crude foliage. The crop of 200,000 or 300,000, hatched beginning of September, appear rather to rapid on cold mornings, but, by the aid of moderate artificial heat the chills are removed, and they begin to eat late in the morning, and can take only three meals in the day. They have not yet had the ague, but I am daily expecting to find them defect. The silk statistics of Sort hampton, as taken this spring by a resolve of the legislature, are as follows being furnished therewith by a person who took the list There are three silk man factories, with a capital of                                                              $14,000. Men males and forty seven females employed 75 to 100 lbs. of American silk, worth                  $500. Over 6,000 lbs. of sewing silk and twist manufactured, worth              $41,500. I immense quantity of silkworm eggs raised for market by private individuals. The weight of cochons and quantity of reeled silk for 1845, not yet ascertained. The New England silk convention convened the 1st instant, according to previous notice, to receive written communications, to be forwarded to New Work; but none presented for that purpose. Delegates were appointed (one from each of the New England States) to attend personally, or appoint a substitute. Since writing the above, I am notified of a public meeting, at 10 clock a. m, on the 9th of October, of which I am secretary, and my services on that occasion and day cannot be dispensed with, as business of the whole county will come before the meeting. Therefore, please accept of my best wishes for success. Very respectfully, yours, D. Stebbi Of. Since writing the enclosed, I have received a letter from Mr. Chamberlain, of Him a, Peru, South America, who last autumn called on you for the report, not then out; he wishes to obtain one if practicable. He took out a. 84 7 quantity of machinery; lost their ship, all his Wanton trees, and pea nut eggs; wishes me to send enough of each to get the variety. About this time hoped to get up his machines, and then: inform me of the result of his enterprise. He had made some silk, &c, of which I think there were samples on the card I sent you last year. His letter is dated Him a, May 24. Expects agent to come out, and can take any thing. Days there is quite an interest taken in raising silk intima ; but most people are too timid to undertake a new business ; that the climate is, above all others, fitted for the cultivation, and eventually will be as profitable as are her mines. Mr. N. Stores, a native of this place, has resided in Jamaica, with Of  Hit marsh, of Savannah, Georgia; is acquainted with the cultivation ofmulberry trees; do not know that he ever fed worms in Jamaica, and south. D. S. We would call the attention of northern leaders particularly to the subject of winter and spring frosts, which have proved so disastrous, and blasted the prospects of so many, who, in a more propitious latitude, might have exceeded their own desires. We must take measures to secure the roots of our trees during the severity of winter, and retard our eggs beyond the season of spring frosts. The months of June, July, and August maybe relied upon. A harder variety of mulberry than the multicaulis might be adopted to advantage: say the white mulberry grafted, a nursery of which may be seen at 337 Roadway, owned and for sale by L. P. Finniels, by whom they were imported from the Evenes mountains, in France. The statement was made several times, in the course of the Hair, that the United States produced, last year, 397,000 lbs. of silk !a! or about 400,000bushels of cochons. The fact must be very far from this. We very much i doubt whether the aggregate would exceed, or even reach, 20,000 bushels there is the proof ?EDI Of. Of  Lkletter From Of. Stebbi Of. Owing to the crowded state of our columns, we defer matter intended for the present number, and give only the substance of a communication from Dr. Stebbins, when we should have been pleased to publish it entire. His ideas on all questions relating to silk are practical to an uncommon degree, and we shall hope to find in him a regular and permanent contributory to this department. We know that his counsels in this cause are cheerfully given, and assure him they are highly appreciated, while wear offer to him, at all times, a space for the expression of his views. His letter, from which we now extract, may be resolved into the following brief conclusions. During the ruthless destruction of mulberry trees, following in the wake of the excitement, he has been steadily cultivating them with great care and attention, presuming that they must be wanting, at no distant day, to replace those destroyed ; and he has now ten or twelve acres of the best varieties of trees, with which he has been experimenting, to show up thepracticability and utility of the silk culture 8 48 2. He concludes, from his experience, that, in New England, the one open and early crop system is the most safe 3. That the early foliage may be used for feeding, the after foliage for paper, and the inner fibrous bark from the s talks (which should be headed down annually, in order to produce large leaves) for cloth, or a quality of paper peculiarly adapted for lithographs and bank bills 4. They suffer for want of skilful operators to carry out the plans decided to be the best 5. He has preserved, for the present season, to accommodate new be dinners, some thousands of young Wantons and Asiatic trees and cuttings, and eggs from selected cochons. Among the older trees are seed bearing Wantons, Asiatics, and Alpines6. The friends of the silk culture in Massachusetts have presented petitions to their legislature, praying for a bounty for the encouragement of the business in that State; and he has, with others, addressed members of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States for the same object, but, " economy and prudence in expenditures being the order of the day" has little hope of encouragement to a branch of industry every way calculated to increase the productive ness and contribute to the independence of our country. (now much better would be the effect upon the country, and how much more it would savor of wisdom and Bible principles, to appropriate the money of the people, now employed in preparing ships of war, creating fortifications, purchasing ammunition, and " paying off" the navy c, for the encouragement of the production of silk jar. S. concludes by remarking that there are in the town of Northamptonthree silk factories, numerous plantations of mulberry trees, and the only thing needed is a supply of enterprising young men to conduct their feeding, and open establishments for the exclusive business of reeling; and adds, as a final e, some remarks in praise and for the encouragement of the New York Farmer and Mechanical l of which are duly appreciated. Hope his measures for giving " a good circulation" among silk growers, and other of our New England neighbors, may prove successful. V. E. Of  Of Conventi   Of. Mr. E. S. Bartholomew, of Sort land, Chautauque county, New Work, t under date October 2d, in anticipation of the convention, says: " I learn by the last number of the Cultivator that a silk convention is to be held in connection with the approaching anniversary of the American  institute. It would be highly gratifying to me to meet with you on that occasion, and participate with the friends of home industry in their deliberations upon this great and important national enterprise the growth and manufacture of silk. I am a silk grower, and it affords me great pleasure to see institutions of so high standing and character devoting a portion of their time to collect and disseminate information upon subjects of direct interest to the nation c' I commenced the growing and manufacturing of silk in 1844. In the spring of 1843, a gentleman having a nursery of the I italian mulberry, wishing to eradicate them, gave them to me. I transplanted them 7000- 849 1 ti all. In the spring of 1844, I put out an acre of mule icaulis, and, on the last of May, commenced feeding. I raised 58 pounds of cochons, which, after de ducting one bushel for eggs, yielded me 6 is. 1 oz. of reeled silk this g: made into sewings, for which I found a ready sale." This season I have grown 150 lbs. 14 ounces of cochons. First crop weighed 12 lbs. 8 ounces to the bushel; never have seen larger ones." Before commencing, I obtained one of the reports of the silk convention of 1843, and read carefully all the letters detailing the experience ofthcid127imany who corresponded with the convention of that year. I came to the conclusion that the nearer I approached dame nature in the treatment of the worm, the better. Following up this conclusion, I erected me acocoonery 20 by 24 feet, with large doors covering the entire sides, hung on hinges at their upper edge, so as to swing outwardly and form an owning. I leave these open all the time while feeding, and close only when cold and rainy; have ventilators to use at such times, and a stove to maintain a uniform temperature. I feed from seven to fourteen times per day. Myrdtles are, the more air the better, strict cleanliness, and abundance of room. By: observing these rules, do not lose 10 per cent. I now have machinery in operation for making sewings. I am satisfied that the multicaulis and early, feeding will be attended with success. I am of the opinion that very many destroy most of their worms by allowing their eggs to become rfoistin -the ice house, or place of keeping; they should invariably be kept dryaridcid127cid127bol. I keep mine in a tin box perforated in the top for the admission of air; this I place within a tea chest, with the lead in, which also prevents moisture, and place them in a cavity in my cellar. If the worms could be fed all at a time, early, they would do much better, and make more silk at less expense. I use the earth for my floor, and, in case of two great heat irrigate with water The drought and intense heat of the present season have caused much disease in many parts. For several days in succession the heat continued intense, with little or no circulation of air, and the worms died by hundreds. I tried he experiment of a cold water bath, and found it to answer a good purpose. I sprinkled it on them gently with a small corn broom. I am satisfied that cold water is not detrimental, either as a bath or on foliage if not applied too often. I shall continue to enlarge my operations and form a market for cocoonswhich I shall prepare for market in raw silk. I can grow and re el ready for market at                                                         $1.56 per pound. Feeling is perfectlysitiple and easy, as well as all the modes opera n di of the silk culture. Daily in this neighborhood have entered into the business and failed. Right feeding, and only twice a day : why not ?REMARKS. It is with great pleasure and satisfaction we give the results of this gentlemans introduce tory movements. He has reviewed the experience of the past, and turned it to a most profitable account. His experiment, it is true, has been on a small scale ; but what he has done in this, he eanproportionally equal when extended to any number of acres; and we repeat what we have often said no branch of business can possibly be undertaken with greater certainty of success than the production of cochons, all things considered. It may be introduced in Paine and Vermont, " Texaranid Oregon" and almost every other section of this continent; and that, too with profit, The different is in favor of the warmer sections but only m 548 50. the length of time which may be devoted to it; for silk, like wool, becomes coarser as we approach the equator, and vice versa. Mr. B. refers, in his letter, to the experiment of some of his neighbors and their failures, adding as the cause, " close feeding, and twice a day." " Why not' he may well say. The fact that they produced a single cochon is evidence that the silkworm faithfully performs her task, and only needs natural facilities to enable her to perform it well. In conducting this business, we shall always observe the same difference which is observe able in other pursuits. One farmer, for instance, will be highly successful in every movement upon his land; another, with precisely the same soil, naturally, and the same facilities for rendering it productive, will scarcely create a subsistence for his family. In visiting these farmers, we find the former, with his laborers, gathering alluvials from the low lands of his farm, which he is industrious ly depositing over its entire surface, while untold quantities of the most enriching substances lie undisturbed on that of the latter; while he goes on from year to year adhering to the old routine of sloughing, sowing, and consuming. To in the culture of silk. One fee der patches his eggs and needs his worms through, in about the same time that would be required for the worm to pass through all his changes, in a state of nature; while another, in the same neighborhood, will pursue a course which prolong the existence of the worm to twice its natural length. The result of the former treatment is a full sized, healthy worm, and a firm, heavy cochon. In the latter, precisely the reverse a small, feeble worm, and a cochon scarcely worth the reeling. Should we make a personal inspection of the operations of these men, we should find, in the former instance, a well cultivated orchard, a thoroughly ventilated cocoonery, and the worms supplied regularly, both day and night, with good nutritions foliage, and as often, at longest, as once in three hours. In the latter, we should probably find an orchard which had been a stranger to the plough or he, it may be for years the cocoonery a confined "garre t or bedroom" and the worms supplied with foliage poisoned by the influence of grass and weeds, at the same hours that the fee der takes his own food. I instances of this kind are constantly coming before us. We now recollect one directly in proof of our statements. , During the present season we furnished one man with eggs, which in due time hatched and commenced feeding; we then supplied another individual with eggs of the same lot. The difference in watching was about two weeks. The former of these had to bring his leaves over half a mile, and would bring at once sufficient for several feedings, and keep them wet and cool. To preserve their freshness, the latter took his leaves directly from the tree, and supplied as often as once in two or three hours. The result was, the latter completed his feeding in twenty-six days from watching, and about as much in advance of the former, as he had " the start" of him in the commencement. It is in consequence of these differences that we receive at ourfilature such a variety of cochons. Two lots were brought us, not long since, produced from the same variety of worm, and fed from the same variety of mulberry; the one full sized and perfect, yielding 20,ounces of silk per bushel, while the other required double the number to make a bushel, and gave not more than 14 ounces of silk the fibre scarcely exceeding in strength the spiders web. The causes of the difference were precisely what we have named. Equal variety exists in curing the cochons and transporting them, to which we shall hereafter allude. We wish particularly to call attention Doc. No. 1 a .85 to Mr. Is .pcoonery. The plan is a capital one. We have used canvass for the sides and ends. His arrangement we think preferable; it shield s more perfectly from cold, and, as he says, forms an owning in hot weather. These things all come into account at the north: at the south they are not needed. We shall ere long present a review of the proceedings of the Nationalconvention of Farmers, Gardeners and Silk Culturists, so far as they relate to silk, and exhibit the present aspect of the silk cause, as represented in that convention. A. C. Van Epps. New York Of Lature, 19 Stanton Of( -november 10, 1845. Letter From Of J. W. Chappell, Of Of   Of Ngston Cou Ntyanother Year Of Success. What farmer, of Livingston county can show a better return from a like number of acres ?of   Of, Of   Of Ngston To, N. Y., November 29, 1845. Dear Of  R : Our crop of cochons the past season amounted to about 700 pounds, produced from less than four acres of land. They were raised at three crops. The first hatched the 8th of June, and spun their cocoonsthe 13th of July. The second crop spun the 18th of August. The third crop did not finish spinning until the 9th of October. This last crop was the best crop of the three. A fire was kept in the cocoonery most of the time during the feeding of the last crop, keeping the temperature at about 70' Fahrenheit. Our worms are fed from five to eight times a day, being careful to feed fresh and tender leaves to the young worms, and mature leaves to those that have passed their third and fourth mounting. Our worms are cleaned every day, from the morning they hat ch to the day they commence spinning. We use the multicaulis mulberry exclusively for feeding, and consider it as hardy a tree as any variety in this country. Our plantation consists of about 200,000 of these trees, planted on high and dry land. Nothing has been done to protect them during our severe winters, and I am not aware that we have lost, during the seven years that we have had them in cultivation, a single tree. We have reeled most of our cochons, and have now on hand (and for sale) about 70 pounds of excellent raw silk, and have 20 or 30 pounds yet to re el. It is expected that the bounty, which is about to expire, will be renewed at the next session of our legislature. Met the State grant a bounty for the term of ten years, to continue five years, at 15 cents per pound for cochons, and 50 cents on reeled silk, and the next five years reduced to ten cents oncocoons and 30 cents on reeled silk, and it cannot fail to cause the permanent establishment of this business in our country. A large number of persons in this section of country are awaiting the action of the legislature upon this subject before they shall engage in the business. Hours, &c, -JAMES W. Chappell. A. C. Of, Erpps Is 982 a. New York Of Lature, 19 Stanton Stdecember 10, 1845. Dear Of  R; Hours of the 29th multi mo came duly to hand. 1 learn withmpph gratification of your continued success in a branch of business which, I verily believe, must eventually become one of the most important, in, our country. Your success is the legitimate result of a steady perseverance and determination to triumph, which few have manifested. I regret that so large a proportion of those who have embarked in this. enterprise have done so through merely speculative motives, with little real interest in the work, and no fixed determination to test it fairly, and prosecute it to complete success. I have, during an experience of many years as an instructor, held up to my students the great motto, What man has done man may do" and so would I say as respects the production of silk in the United States. What France, I talk, or any other country, has done, America may do. If I talk can produce silk to the value of                $40,000,000 annually, it would be a label upon American skill and ingenuity to say we cannot do the same, and as far sur pass as our natural facilities, such as climate, soil, &c, sur pass hers. This we can do; and, with enough to follow your own example, we shall do in less than a quarter of a century. You have learned through the public prints that the subject of silk has occupied the attention of the Farmers' Club of the American I institute, at its last two sessions. Thee: meetings are to me a source of decided interest, and I doubt not their beneficial influence will be extensively felt. It is a most fortunate thing for our country that there is in this metropolis an association like this, to collect and disseminate all the important facts in relation to the agricultural and mechanical world. The subject of bounties on silk has been duly considered, and a committee appointed for the purpose reported at our last meeting the form of a memorial to the legislature, asking a continuance of our present bounty. Energetic action on the part of those interested in this business, in securing a large number of signatures, will probably secure our object. I think a petition so evidently in accordance with the public interest cannot be refused by our representatives. The subject of themulberry was under consideration at our last meeting, as you will see by our reported proceedings. It was contended by some that a variety of themulberry more hardy than the for us multicaulis must be adopted in our northern States. The late extensive destruction of this tree would seem to demand this. I have repeatedly recommended it, but I am not prepared to go to the expense, and exclude the multicaulis altogether. I should suggest the propriety of substituting for the name for us multicaulis that of the Chinese mulberry, which is its real name. I believe a lingering prejudice against this tree has much to do with the extensive denunciations we meet with. Your own abundant success, and that of others much farther north, prove the entire safety and practice ability of using the foliage of the Chinesemulberry in feeding our worms. I contend that it is perfectly safe on high and dry land, in any section of the United States ; but it cannot endure one winter where the water is allowed to remain about the roots. My opinion on the subject .of the mulberry has been repeatedly solicited by persons about to engage in the culture of silk; and I take this occasion to give expression to my i views more fully than I did when the subject was before our club. I repeat, this isundqertbedly the Chinese mulberry; and the disciples of Confucius very
pi6pily ~a" i but (did 127) the p prosperity and solidity of an empire hitherto 'lthoutpralalel 'to' the benefits derived from this tree. It was first iritrbducd- as a the 'cross a, another valuable variety of the mulberry, which' ranks inst to the Chinese in the quantity of foliage it produces, and which isctsidecid127Od such harder, and in this respect has the advantagethroghthe age cy of the American I institute, in 1828, about ten years after its discovery by Or    Perollet in the garden of a Chinese cultivate or at the city of vanilla, capital of the Philippine islands. This disfriguishedjlbotanist was sent out by the government of France on a voyage of research i to the ;was of Asia in the year 1818, and returned in 1821, bringing with him, ibesdes158 other species of living plants, what he termed the multicaduismanystalked, or mulberry with many stems and which he termed, i way' of eminence, the Chinese mulberry. It originated in the elevated regions of China, and always prefers and flourished most luxuriantly on similar locations. It was thence rapidly disseminated over all the plains neariltje seashore. From Wanton it was introduced into Vanilla and all the islands of the Asiatic Archipelago, so general was the belief in its superiority over all others then employed. The reception of this tree was alike flattering. In less than two years from the introduction of the first t he iii to' the United States, millions of money were invested in it. Silk companies were formed in almost every city and village in the land, and many of them with immense capitals. Extensive cocooneries were erected, with little or no adaptation to the end in view. Under this excitement, trees were multiplied with incredible rapidity, until the country was literally in undated. The "i mulberry fever" as it was termed, saw its day, and then care on. a reaction. Thousands of flourishing nur series were torn. up -of l burst, i and in. a few months nearly all were destroyed. To great had bbcderh the prejudice against the multicaulis, that it was next to impossible t beohvinea man who had been "bit" that it possessed any value, or that it as fit for any thing but to be burnt. Had the trees left in the cotiuhttr by' thisexcitmeint been carefully his banded, we should now have been be- to 'yefrsfairtheradvanced. I instead of this, we are raising but little more 'silk now than at the commencement of the revolutionary war. Damn of the opinion that three quarters of all the cod owns r now tied are the product of the Chinese mulberry. Clark, in his work' or the tiiLilecid127rytree, claims- for it the following advantages, as comrpatrd with i the the, viz last. It is full as hardy as the white 2d. One pound of its leaves contain as much nutiiitive matter as r a pocid127Tcid127hdand a half of the white 3d. The silk made from it is of a finer texture, and more lustrous 4th. I to leaves are so large that a pot und can be gathered at half the expense and trouble that a pound of white mulberryleaves require 5th. It can be cultivated with infinitely greater despatch: than any ether kind. I fully concur with him in the 4th and 5th, but think he t may bet mistiknin the other respects for which he claims superiority. In he principal advantages to which this tree is justly stiff id, arecid127theabufidance of foliage it yields the first year, and 'the exceeding ease and cheapness with which it may be gathered. The difference in favor (cid127f his, in my view when compared with any other I have been, is as five to line besides, it is so well adapted to the system of green feeding now ,being adopted. I am told thattheBrou4ssa is as easily propagatetdfrtom itcid127ttings854 yields as abundantly and as good a leaf, and, besides, will endure our winters where the Chinese will not. If such be the case, then I think we may well give it our attention. The advocates of the Wanton claim the same advantages for that. I am disposed to attribute the varied results of the experiments that have been made more to the place and manner of feeding, after all, than to the variety of the mulberry used. In no other way can I account for the difference, under similar circumstances. These differences must soon disappear under the modern improvements now entering into the culture of silk, and, with the same fore thought as other business, meet with a like success. We must not depend upon other nations for an article so extensively used amongst us, and which we are so well calculated to create ourselves. I know many instances where arrangements are making to enter into this business, both at the north and south, and believe we shall ere long proclaim to the world our independence of all nations, not only for thenecessaries but the luxuries of life, I am, sir, very truly yours, A. C. Van Epps. James W 6 Cappell. Clai Rmont Mulberry Nursery, &c. Fri End W. H. Starr: The paper thee published, entitled the Newyorkjarmer and Mechanics" which thee has been so good as to send me, has been received, and is, I think, calculated to do much good, especially in advancing two of the most important pursuits now being established in our country. In reading the paper, I was pleased and interested by the very extensive information collected and published on the silk business; showing the immense expense incurred by the British government in bringing the same to its present very profitable standing. Their silk goods are now the admiration of the world, notwithstanding they are unable to produce the raw material for want of a con geniality of climate. With a little experience, the production of cochons in our climate is as simple and easily accomplished as that of wool or flax. Ligatures are indispensable, and will require time for their permanent establishment. The reeling of silk would afford pleasing employment for the females of our country. As nursery man, in the years 1837, '38, and '39, I raised and sold of the white mulberry trees and cuttings to the amount of                                                                $15,374. I raised, during the same time, considerable quantities of cochons of first rate quality, notwithstanding our inexperience. I should have continued the business but for the want of a feature where to dispose of my cochons. Silkreelingmust be a distinct branch of the business. I understand that there are such establishments in New England. I trust to see our stores, at no distant day, filled with fabrics of domestic make, so rich and good as to render us independent of all foreign nations, giving pleasant and profitable employment to various classes of our population. Robert Of  Nclai R. Clai Rmont Nursery, Nsear Balti   Moremonth with, 1846. a. 855REMARKS. It is to be regretted that persons possessing the facilities and practical skill of Mr. "sinclair should, in the infancy of the enterprise, be obliged, from any cause, to vacated the field; but more especially is it to be lamented at this particular crisis, when the ranks of the silk cult wrists are so broken and the cause struggling for existence. In a previous communication, Mr. Sinclair describes his establishment and operations as follows, which we insert for the information of any one who may turn their attention to this very favorable opening for prosecutingthe silk culture; which advanced age dis qualities the proprietor from further attending to. We understand that Mr. S. would be glad to negotiate with some person qualified for the business, and would offer favorable terms. We extract as follows: "I have a large stock of multicaulis and other mulberry trees, and a house, 42 by 30 feet, two stories high both stories and garre t well shelled, with a suitable cellar to preserve and cut the leaves in n 1841, had 83 bushels of cochons raised in it sulphur and pea nut mostly the former. In 1842, I let the house and trees .to a person on shares, who made about 16 pounds of reeled silk, and upwards of 100 ounces of pea nut eggs. The present season I managed it mostly myself but, owing to many other engagements, I made only one crop, amounting to 34 bushels of pea nut cochons, which was as many as the house would hold at one time. To regulate the temperature, I have a small tight room in the cellar, with a stove in it, which enables the manager to warm the house by means of suitable conductors to convey the heated air into the different parts; but I find, in our climate, this trouble and expense maybe avoided, by commencing about the first of the 6th month, after the chilly, damp weather is past. My glass windows are in one frame, and hanged so as to open or shut as the weather requires; and also Venetian shutters, so constructed that each sat, working on its own pilot, can instantly be changed from the broad side to its edge only to the light, admitting or excluding light and air, and heat which I find very convenient. I prefer the pea nut and multicaulis to feed with. I think the white I italian equally good, but the tedious gathering is a serious objection. I think it best to cut the leaves very fine until after their second mounting; then, to save time and expense, feed with branches. When ready to spin, it is best to remove them to clean shelves, and feed them plentiful ly with leaves f cut, it will be better; all which will prevent their becoming sickly, and spinning in their own: dirt. 'his is the period in which most failures occur, and may be easily prevented by a little extra attention for about a week, and the profit and success much depends upon it. At the second mounting, I have observed that only one half or two thirds mount the first day, and the balance the next day. I find it much the best, and saves trouble afterwards, to keep these separate." , Of found but little difficulty in raising good silk the first season, without any previous experience, and it may be raised to good profit, if manufacturers will continue to give four dollars per bushel for good cochons; and it is well suited for families consisting of some women and children. I apprehend much wealth will ultimately come out of raisingsilkMr. Sinclair says the business would have been continued, had there beenM5i6
a market. This is but one of many instances of the abandonment of this business, when it had been most favorably introduced, on account of the a name difficulty. We are happy to inform all such that there is now in operation in this city a a feature for silk reeling, where cochons are part ased at fair prices. Silk growers would do well to avail themselves of its advantages, as their cochons, if cured and carefully put up in barrels, may be sent a considerable distance. A large crop of last year has been i fo, raided from the south of Georgia. This establishment is at 19 Stanton, street. Of  Of In Turkey. The original man factories of silk were established before the conquest of Constantinople, at Broussa, from whence most of the raw silk is still obtained, the abundance of mulberry trees in its neighborhood being favorable to the, nurtured of the silkworm. Little Broussa silk is, however now sold in the i silk bazaar of Constantinople. Within the last ten or fifteen years, since the several treaties made with the Sublime For te, the home silk trade has diminished, fifty per cent. A large supply of imitation goods is received from England, France, and I talk, and the richer articles, principally manufactured at Lyons, have completely superseded those formerlycid127eceived. from Broussa, or manufactured at Scutari and Constantinoplewhites Three Years in Constantinople.

Ameri Can Of  For. -geoffrey Hutchinson, a farmer of Long I s land, well esteemed here, is now visiting our city with specimens of sewing silk, reeled and manufactured by his daughters from cochons produced on his farm from the morusmulticaulis. We be speak for him the favorable regard of all who consider how vast ly important it is, in a national point of view, that our people should learn to grow an manufacture their own silk. It will require skill and patience to effect this, with some patriotic sympathy on the part of 'the wealthy and discerning; but the silk culture will ultimately be established and flourish here. Mr. Hutchinsons appears to be an excellent article which all who want sewing silk will do well to buy for their own sakegsHe will submit it to the judgment of our principal citizens. For the New -work Farmer and Mechanics, Of  Of. Dear Of  R: Although I have of late witnessed much that is interesting to me in this fertile region of country, (might be called the garden: of the east) I shall only state a few leading facts, from which you may possibly judge of what is being done along the valley of the Connecticut. Omitting, however, to say anything of the vast fields of broom :corn, that make so good a return i for money and labor expended, I will just remark that the silk interest, which has for so long a time received attention from some of the more enterprising and intelligent part of the community in this region, is not by any means dead only restethsoon to start with a double certainty of success, promising as sure a profit to the grower as anything he can raise. There are now two man factories of sewing silk and twist in this place, one of which I had time to visit only ; and another being built, and to commence operations in the spring. Most of the silk used is imported in the raw state, as ccooons enough cannot be obtained of American growth. 'Sewing silk and twist from the factory of Messrs; Hollandconant is pronounced, by the tailors and merchants of Boston, to be equal to _the best I italian, and is preferred by some, and is under contract for three years. This speaks volumes in favor of Yankee enterprise. Mr. Holland has a very simple silk re el for family use, with a traverse motion for thespoolingis easily kept in order, and costs only about five dollars. It is the best and cheapest I have seen. He also makes a silk sinner for five dollars per spindle. For family use, generally, put three spindles; it operate swell and easy, and is of the same principle of those in use in his factory. I find that orders are continually being received for mulberry seed and eggs to go south. I believe it is a well authentic a ted fact that eggs from the' north are much the most sure in a southern climate. 'or.

From the New Took Farmer and Mechanics. Letter From Samuel Barrett, Esq, Of French Creek, Of Rgi Of A. In detailing his experience of the last season, Mr. Garrett expresses great confidence in the silk business considering it an enterprise of great national moment and individual advantage. He has not done much the present year; but this little has increased his confidence in, and more fully assured him of the entire practice ability and ultimate success of, the whole enterprise. He has been gradually multiplying his trees for years, with a view of entering largely into the culture when they shall have arrived at maturity. He further says: "giving at a great distance from any silk grower, I have found it extremely difficult to obtain eggs. I have for a year or two been much retarded on this account. The past season I placed my eggs in an ice house in March, after considerable warm weather, and feared, in consequence, they might be injured. I exposed about half an ounce of these on the 8th of May." The foliage had then become quite large and abundant. In the 16th we had a severe frost, which killed all the foliage, except here and there a leaf which. had been concealed by the grass. In the night of the 24th we were visited by a second frost, cutting off what had started since the 16th. Again, on the 3.1st, another quite as severe as either of the others. I still kept my worms alive on a few frost bitten leaves, but they did not spin, or but few of them, although they did not appear to be diseased." I exposed another crop of eggs June 23 done ounce. They hatched in 14 days. During the 1st, 2d, and 3d ages, many of them died. The remainder appeared healthy, and wound superior cochons in 28 days. The variety the Air abel I names" I fed five times a day, and exposed them freely to fresh air. The heat was a part of the time intense. They made me 40 pounds ofcocoons, weighing 250 to the pound, The mortality among my worms I attributed to a natural imperfect ion (9) of the egg, or injury sustained by placing them in ice after the watching process had commenced. Good attention and thorough ventilation alone saved any. I have this season- tried an experiment the raising of the multicaulisfrom the buds. About the middle of May, I planted a small patch of ground with multicaulis branches, which had been buried during the winter in the open field. When I planted them some of the buds had grown an inch, so that, in handling, hundreds of them broke off. Small fibres of roots had started opposite each bud. I prepared and furrowed my ground, making the furrows to feet apart, and laying in the branches without vacancy throughout the whole length of the furrow, laying at least two branches side by side. They came up directly and grew most luxuriantly, notwithstanding it was extremely dry. The frost killed all up at the 1st of June. Wishing to ascertain how many leaves I could gather from the patch, 1 have just gathered them from one row; I found them to weigh 30 pounds, which being a fair average, the forty rows (saved from the frost would produce 1,240 pounds of leaves. Fifty pounds are allowed to subsist 1,000 worms. According to this calculation, the forty rows would feed 25,000 worms, which should produce at least 6 pounds of reeled silk, and possibly 8 pounds. I measured the ground carefully, there being 30 square rods. At this rate I could produce from one acre 6,613 lbs. of leaves and feed 132,000 worms; giving 33 pounds of reeled silk, worth                                                            $165, or. 859.at          $5 per pound. This is the product of one acre of multicaulis of the first years growth from the buds. The land on which they were planted was thin, and had been but slightly manured the last year for corn." I once almost doubted the statement of Rev. Mr. Lane, that he had obtained 2,200 pounds of leaves from a quarter of an acre. I no longer doubt its correctness. I have in all about two acres of trees, consisting ofCantons and multicaulis. Half of them are from two to three years old. They occupy land which would produce 20 of 25 bushels of corn to the acre, and I can now gather at least 4 tons of leaves. Remarks. The failure of Mr. Garrett is but one of many from the same cause. These disastrous frosts extended over the entire south. Southern silk growers generally have depended upon a single crop, from the fact that they could not preserve their eggs. In Georgia, the silkworms had just commenced feeding, when their food was totally destroyed, arid many thriving plantations of trees, which afterwards yielded an abundant crop of good foliage, sufficient to have made hundreds of bushels of cochons, were entirely unemployed. Had it been known in time that the dried foliage of the mulberry, when moistened and sprinkled with rice flour, would answer a good purpose, and that eggs could' safely be sent from the north during any part of the season, and were preferable to those saved at the south, the crops on feed at the time the frosts occurred might have been saved, and all the after foliage turned to silk. The suggestion made by Dr. Stebbins, of feeding worms from dried leaves, we deem practicable; and we advise leaders generally to preserve foliage in this way, that they may be prepared to meet emergencies which have proved so extensive and disastrous during the present year. A gentleman who has recently made a tour through Europe informed us, a few days since, that when in Switzerland he found the inhabitants prosperous ly engaged in feeding silkworms from dried foliage, brought from mulberrygrowing countries. He represented the worms as appearing finer and making superior cochons. We should also advise persons at the south engaged in the silk business to secure their eggs during the fall and winter previous, that all their foliage may be employed. Orders for dried foliage, mulberry trees, or cuttings, and silkworms' eggs, will be promptly attended to by the subscribe r. A. C. Van Epps. From the National I intelligence r. Of  Of Culture In The Uni Ted States. Messrs. Gales & Seaton: In your European correspondents letter of August 20, published in the I intelligence r of September 13, I find the following paragraph: "I n the Journal des Debts of the 12th instant there is a column of American statistics derived from the last report of your Commissioner of Patents. Towards the end, it is said that the culture of the mulberry and the raising of the silkworm have utterly and ruinous ly failed in the United 860 
aStates. :met France' it is added, 'cease to fear American coipetitiontheUnion will be for her an immense market' -he- may hope that' the silk case is not so forlorn with you. What are the natural obstacles to perseverance and success ?"I assume the duty of answering the very interesting interrogatory at the close of this paragraph. There are no natural obstacles to perseverance, much less to success, in the silk business in the United States. The obstacles to its progress at present are purely artificial and ephemeral. Have had my eye upon this subject now twenty-one years. That I might be a disinterested witness even in the public opinion, I have kept myself clear of any pecuniary interest in the culture of silk. I have witnessed its progress, its experiments, its successes, and its failures; have scrutinized all the details of each and all; and have never yet found the slightest reason to doubt its ultimate successful establishment as one of our main staple productions. The reason of its apparent depression at this time is to be found in the very place where it should be most rationally looked for. The late speculation in mulberry trees, called the multicaulis speculation, which I never failed to oppose, and which I never in the slightest degree advanced, caused expectations of profits from the silk business that were not only unreasonable, but wildly extravagant. The failure to realize these expectations by the many that began the culture of silk, and although a reasonable profit was at hand, induced its abandonment by thousands. They expected to realize a thousand dollars from an investment of capital and labor that in any other agricultural employment would have been satisfactorily compensated by fifty or a hundred. Disappointed in this extravagant expectation, they abandoned the enterprise. Another obstacle was found to its progress in the go ahead character of our people, and their want of foresight. They raised large quantities of cochons before there were means provided for their conversion into any useful article, and had not atieiiceto preserve them till these means were provided. This was a great error, and placed one of the most insurmountably obstacles in the way of our progress. Met everybody understand that the late multicaulis speculation had nothing to do with our capability to produce silk; that the true friends of the silk culture were always opposed to that speculation, and did all they could to restrain and suppress it, (the writer of this among them) but that it had the effect of proving conclusively that the United States, from 32 to 44 degrees of north latitude, (longitude without limit) is well adapted to the silk culture, equal in climate to China, superior to China in the enterprise, industry, and intelligence of our people, and superior to France or even  talk in every requisite for the successful culture of silk. I may not live to see it, but the time is not far off when even France shall be supplied with silk from this country all Europe of course. The germ of this great interest is already firmly imbedded in our physical condition, and nothing can arrest its steady progress to an overwhelming extent. The time will come when even cotton will be second to silk on the list of our staple productions. But, before all this can happen, our people will have to learn to be satisfied with moderate but remunerative profits, and to gather these in particles so small that the common or un practised eye would scarcely discern them. They must also learn to make up large results from shall items. Did it fever occur to you; Messrs. Editors, that the great difference between our toe. A. 140 8Qnorhersr and i southern people consists in this particular feature a they of thecid127unorth ~are satisfied min collecting .large sums from the congregation of extremely i small items, almost ultimate atoms; while they of the south: can never contemplate with composure anything less than a crop of a thousand bales of cotton, that is to yield them twenty to thirty thousand dollars Even these latter, with big eyes, can only see a large cotton field of one huandredeto a thousand acres- the individual plant itself is too small for their vision* They forget that it is only from the aggregation of the products of these individual plants that their hundreds of thousands of bales are made up. Now, silk is a peculiarly small article small, I mean, in physical proportions; but there is no article so well adapted to aggregation into large rise of value. Please say all this to your much respected correspondent in Paris. Well him that the self complacency of the Journal des Debts is misplacedandbidthat Journal and the people of France, and those of I talk with them, beware f American competition" in the production, of silk. Respectfully, Of Deon B. Smi  Of. B Aihpiore -a. September. 13, 1845. From the New York Farmer, and Meeihanic. Of. Stebbi Of And Northampton. We are pained to learn that our friend, Dr. Stebbins, has been confined to his, room for more than a month past with serious indisposition. A lettercid127from him, dated the 8th instant, states that he is so far convalescent as to resume correspondence; and, as a matter of course his first word is about silk i We are fearful, when we consider his advance in life, and the greatmeitaas. well as physical activity which has ever characterized, him, thathhoiwill fall before the great work to which he has devoted himself shall have been accomplished. But we hope that some satisfactory evidences may appear that .his labors have not been in vain, and that his works will follow him. From the letter above alluded to we extract as follow Some two years since, the Rev. Mr. Jerkins, with bishop War Yohannan fromrOroomiah, Persia, visited this country; they also visited this place. I made a list of inquiries, for Mr. Jerkins to answer after his returntoPersia, respecting silk. I also furnished the Rev. David Stoddard, of this, place, a young man of fine talents and energy, with a list of questions, to :a sweat his. leisure. I have received from him a letter, dated Oroomiah, July 25, 1845, (of which I have written a sketch to Mr. Wakemanaccompanied by nine samples of silk made in Persia; and when he shall visit he .silk districts, or meet with gentlemen of intelligence, will give me the result. He ;has also sent specimens of the white and black mulberryfoliagenot equal in size to our Wanton, Asiatic, or Broussa, either of whichsustaisour winters .better than the white. The Wanton retains its verdurelongerandin greater perfection, than any other, and by a variety of experimeststitisshown that the same, quantity of foliage will make more rawsilkjtti, :any other variety. This, is the genuine tree used in China, aecoQrng to the testimony of Dr. Parker and a China man, when here. Theeaxaminfiandd recognised it at once. The blossoms for seed appear before 8 62 the foliage, like the p each, and very near the ground. Only a few are seed bearing; and should the season be favorable, I may have a good gathering. The Asiatic, like the black and white, have fruit high up on the limbs. The Wanton has been found to develop e its foliage earlier than any other variety. It has been found that the foliage of standard trees will become diminutive in size, when compared with those headed annually( Joseph Clark, of this town, (one of the pioneers, with president Stiles and Dr. Aspinvrall, in the silk cause) sowed his white mulberry trees in drills, and kept them in a bushy state, and usually cut the branches with a scythe or sickle, in all weather; and if in the middle of the day, in dry weather, usually sprinkled the foliage with water. It is well known, that by heading down mulberry trees in the spring, the quantity of foliage is greatly increased, and the quality improved n referring to the State bounty, Dr. S. says: "I do not regret that the Massachusetts bounty is put at ten cents per pound on cochons only, nor that it is only for three years. At the expiration of this time, it may be revived with more ease than if it had been fifteen or twenty cents. The legislature wish to be governed by economy, and show themselves sparing of the peoples money; however, the policy is not wise The European governments have expended millions to establish the culture, and are now satisfied that silk is one of the greatest sources of revenue. A like policy here would be productive of similar results The doctor then very appropriately adds : " But what is the use of having mulberry trees of any kind, quality, or size, and what the advantage of legislative or individual encouragement, if nobody can be found to improve and render* them productive? From present prospects, Sort hampton may be in a bad fix the coming season. The cultures t at the community has left them, and another large grower, having a great offer at Boston, will leave us in the spring, and my in firm health forbids my personal attention. A fine opportunity is here presented for some person of enterprise to come forward and make his selection. If no one should appear, (a half dozen are needed) you need not expect much from Sort hampton to e ke out at the next silk convention. But I am in no way disheartened, come what will; and, if my life and health are spared, shall do what I can to keep the silk ranks full. There is an abundance of young and old trees, cuttings, and eggs, preserved for many be dinners; but it is painful to see the apathy prevailing. Any are so eager to acquire wealth, that they cannot be content with the ordinary course, but must have railroad speed. Such a spirit must not enter the cocoonery ;but patience and perseverance will be crowned with success. That America will yet become a silk growing country, is not doubted by our best men ; but when ?a? Prejudices are being left behind; and let the friends of the cause look steadily to the time when silk shall become one of our great staples, and let us keep doing; examples of perseverance may workwondersNothing gives us more real pleasure than the perusal of communications of this tried and devoted advocate of the silk cause in this country. While hundreds who arose in the time of the mulberry excitement manifesting great zeal, making great speeches and writing extraordinary things on the subject, have fallen with its fall, he has remained steadfast, and may justly be considered a "standard work the American text book containing all. 86 that is important and reliable on the silk question. We feel honored in being made the recipient of his favors: may they be frequent and long continued. It is, indeed, a subject of regret that Sort hampton, standing, as she has, prominent in the silk enterprise, should at this time be deprived of two of her most efficient men. Mr. Hayne has conducted the silk department of the " Northamptdn Association" with great perseverance and effect; and his absence must seriously cripple their further movements, and sensibly retard their progress. Mr. P. has incurred some prejudice on account of his connection with " anew re el" which has been considered an improvement, but which has been adopted by some to their serious injury. We have had something to do with this ourselves, but are far from attributing any blame to Mr. Hayne, and believe that, under some circumstances, it may prove all he believed it to be. I instead of reeling in long skeins, as is customary, this re el runs the silk on bob bind containing about two to four ounces each. In cases where manufacturers do their own reeling, we deem it of value, and so recommended as chairman of an examining committee of the national silk convention held in this city in 1844. We understand that Mr. P. is now in this city, with a quantity of fine sewings of his manufacture. There his future movements are to be, we are not informed. We direct particular attention to Dr. Stebbinss remarks in regard to the mulberry, and advise silk growers to furnish themselves with the Wanton variety as probably best adapted to our country, particularly the northern sections. It appears to be as readily propagated as the multicaulis, and as well adapted to branch feeding, which are the chief advantages claimed for this variety, and which have been considered so great, by some, as to entitle it to the undoubted preference. Our review of the silk business will be resumed. I tis discontinued for the present to give place to the above, as bearing a more intimate relation to the business at the present time. A .a. Van E Pps. New York Of Lature January 8, 1846. Of  Of. Report Of Hon. P. H. Green. We have before referred to the following report of Vol. Green, who hast his year been conducting his operations in Paine with admirable success. This report was made to the He iv England Silk Convention, held about one year since, and has been published by this State, in connection with the report of the National Convention of Silk Growers, held at the American  institute in October last. It is one of those careful, wisely conducted experiments, which always insure success. The opinions of the writer on artificial warmth cannot be so readily adopted. We doubt not their adaptation to the latitude of New England, but further south the open system is doubtless the system to insure the greatest results; and even in Newengland, we think midsummer feeding would prove quite as successful in open and in close buildings. We concur most fully in the great importance of governmental encouragement, in order to establish the silk business upon a firm foundation. Some general provision should be made, and every State should have its bounty, and every agricultural association its premium, for cochons and reeled silk. We have no doubt of the ultimate success of the business without such aid; bat should every State follow the example 8 64 D .i To- 140iSof crew Work, Paine, and Delaware, and given fifteen cents per pound oncocoos iraisedrin the State, the results would be astonishing- and we suggest the idea here that the friends in each State get up a memorial to the irrespective legislatures praying for such a provision, and for its renewalianthose nearly: expired, as in New Work. But to the report :the silk culture in the United States attracted my attention some two or three years ago, since which I have not been an indifferent observer of what has i appeared in the; public .prints, and other publications relating to the subject . These, with other evidence, have convinced my mind that, at nodistanitperiod, silk v will rank among the most important productions of our country. Being desirous of obtaining practical knowledge, early last spring  leased, in this: town, (sort hampton, Massachusetts) about five acresiof4and, four of which had, five years before, been planted with from twelve tofouxteeni thousand Ll pine, Asiatic multicaulis, and Wanton roots and cuttings i- Two places were fitted up for feeding-one put under the care of a person M who had fed ,several years, and acquired the reputation of being. a good. fee der. To i information, _would 'be conveyed by detailing .the facts f attending this attempt; it is: therefore only necessary to add, that it disappointed- both; the i fee der and myself. The other was reserved for myselfanddithei result more than met my expectations, being wholly unacquainted with! the business. A ,full regeneration for the labor and other outlays were not among my most sanguine thoughts of course I am not greatly disappointed; still I may, I think, truly say, that had the other feeding succeeded a swell as that under my own care, although no profit would have been realized, an encouraging return would have been made. Three ounces of eggs i were hatched, and- the; worms carried through- feeding principally without loss, except at the time of winding, when the weather was extremely cold and unfavorable; notwithstanding, I had two hundred lbs. of good cochons from three ounces :hatched. It is deemed unnecessary to trouble the convention with detail, and I will therefore only sub join the result of my observation and experience from this feeding, and what has be end owe and is now doing in other countries not so well situated probably a sour own. I have therefore come to the conclusion, that with the intelligence and means practised here, silk may be made an advantageous crop even- in Massachusetts. The culture of silk in France was established bytheAbounty of government, and is now a source of great national as well as individual wealth; Nothing is hazarded in saying, if it is established here it must be done by the united effort of government and individuals. Since the discontinuance of the bounty, thousands of mulberry trees have been dug up in thiscid127) and neighboring towns ; and, without prompt action on the part! of the legislature, thousands are now destined to the same fate The above, as will be seen, was addressed to the New England Silk Convention. The letter of this gentleman to the National Convention is of great length; and, as a part of it is a re capitulation of the above, it has been omitted. A. C. V. Of t was my design to feed three broods of worms in succession, so as to have the last brood wind up by the middle of August. In accordance withthisplancid127cid127) took 4th roe ounces of eggs from the cellar when the temperature was 6 Fahrenheit, 4 placed them. in a room where it was 60, on the 13th of May: on the 1st i removed them to a room where the temperature was. 86 5 regulated by artificial heat, and ranged from 620 to 730, until the 27th, when the watching commenced 2 8th, 29th, 30th, and 3 1st, all hatched, or nearly so. While the temperature was at 700, or over, the young worms were active, but became somewhat to rapid when it was 640; ranged from 650 to 700 until the 3d of June, when the whole were placed in the cocoonery. In the 4th, temperature down to 460, worms quite to rapid; supposed it all over with them; but revived on the 5th, when it was 700, and went through perfect mounting, perfectly healthy; continued so through the 2d 3d, and 4th; changed them after each mounting, excepting those put intothe cradles, which were placed there immediately after the third mounting, and were not again changed. Some hundreds of the worms fell into the troughs of the cradles when first put into them ; supposing them to be lost, no notice was taken of them till the third day, when it was deemed necessary to wash them out; accordingly, a but of water was turned into the trough at the upper end; of course the worms were carried out at the other end. This immersion, as well as fasting, had not, as was expected, deprived them of life; indeed, it had made but little change in their appearance ; they were therefore all secured, by placing a si eve at the lower end of the trough, placed on dry shelves, and food given them; and, in order to ascertain whether the wrenching and fasting would have any unfavorable effect, a particular place was assigned them; they went through feeding in all respects as the others, and made as good cochons. Judging from this and other facts that subsequently came under my observation, I feel warranted in saying, although wrenching worms for a short length of time before the fourth mounting may do them no essential injury, yet nothing can be more fatal than to keep them in a wet or damp place, particularly when about forming and completing cochons. Forms hatched May 28th and 29th were put into the cradles and on the lower shelves in the left; the last hatched on the upper shelf, near the roof; as they approached towards maturity, it was found that all were too much crowded, and about one third were removed to the shed. All continued healthy, and about the first of July commenced winding. In the morning of the 4th, the temperature was 50; on the 5th, 48 ; and several succeeding days about the same. This was a severe shock to the worms; indeed, it so paralyzed a portion of them (probably from 10 to 20 per cent) that they seemed to lose the power of making cochons, grew chubby, and died. It was apprehended that the left, in warm weather, would become so hot as to have an unfavorable effect on the health of the worms. But, instead of this, the least loss was on the upper shelf, where the last hatched were placed, and spun as early as the first hatched, and made quite as goodcocoons. From the fact that the worms, while young, were not injured by being subjected to a temperature of 460, and about the same, at a more advanced age, had such a paralyzing effect that a considerable portion never recovered, it is inferred that a warm temperature is more essential during the last than first age of the worms. The product of the, first three ounces of eggs was two hundred pounds of good cochons. It is deemed proper to mention that the lower story of the building is separated from the upper only by a partial floor, so, as to give a free circulation of air through the whole house. The windows have sliding shutters below, and in the left a door at each end, but no windows or other openings in the roof; also, chloride of lime was placed, in small quantities, in all parts of the building, and fine un s lacked lime sifted through a bag, made of coarse cotton 556< C. No. 140.loth, .on the worms, :in et, damp weather, immediately: &after feedingoThis not only absorbed the dampness, but is believed' to have contributed to this general good health. I round, by experience, that the chrysalids could not be destroyed by theorise of charcoal. A description of the plan, manner of fitting up, c is not thought necessary. The experiment was, however, conclusive, and it is confidently believed that whoever makes the same attempt will find (hat a portion of the chrysalids will not be destroyed. A better mode of destroying them, and which proves effective, as well as every, way satisfactory, is one recommended by Mr. Anne, a distinguished French chemist, which is as follows: Dispose the cochons in a wooden box, in a stratum of six inches deep; upon each superficial square foot of these sprinkle half a pint of alcohol from a water pot, so as to distribute the liquid equally over the cochons ; then form another stratum over these, and a further quantity of alcohol applied, and so on until the box is full; then let them be closely covered and left twenty-four hours. I instead of a box, I used a barrel that had contained alcohol, cut a space ten inches square in the head, nicely fitted a board with lists on each edge, so that when it was down all the air was excluded from the barrel. This did the thing perfectly. With regard to the succession of crops, before mentioned, the eggs reserved for them were placed in a cellar where the temperature was 540, and, according to the opinion of some writers on silk culture, they would it watch without being exposed to a temperature above 600. Contrary to expectation- as soon as the mercury went up to this point, the eggs hatched; this, too, when I was wholly un prepared for them, having neither feed, space, nor time to attend to them; of course they were lost. Not willing to relinquish my plan altogether, about two thirds of an ounce of eggs were procured, which hatched the 2 3d and 24th of July ; these went through their first and second mounting on the sixth and twelfth days of their age, without any loss; third, nearly as well ; fourth, not so successful, the weather about this time being rainy and extremely cold for the season, with constant and sudden changes, which produced torpidness of the worms, from which they never recovered ; a considerable portion of them formed cochons, but few w perfected them. The first part of the season is unquestionably the best time for feeding; still it is believed, with proper attention to selecting feed, congenial temperature, say about 700 or above, (natural best; but if this cannot be had, artificial, for later crops) may be successfully used. Such has been said and written about open feeding; no matter how open, provided all other requisites can be had. In the humble opinion of the writer, whoever expects to produce a good crop of cochons from worms subjected to wet or damp atmosphere for any length of time, and to a temperature below 65 degrees, will be sadly disappointed. In Lombard y, I talk, and France, the great silk growing countries of Europe, the temperature in cocooneries is not only regulated with great exactitude, by artificial means, bat the atmosphere corrected from time to time as occasion may require. :;I n those countries the feeding season lasts but six weeks, and is ascertain there as any other agricultural product. There, the leaves from trees (not annually cut down) are used; of course, but one crop can be produced. This is no objection to a succession of crops in New England, where the trees are cut down in the spain, early shoots cut and fed to the worms, and later are constantly springing up, suitable for feeding. That the United States are at no distant period to be. a. 87 come a great silk growing country, is more than probable; that New England will share largely in the product, is not so certain. While the foreign producers and others interested are watching with eagle eyes the progress of silk culture in this country, at all times prepared to over stock the market with raw silks, and 'constantly doing so for the express purpose of checking its culture here; while not one in five of our citizens who engage in it are regenerated for their labor and other outlays; while thousands of mulberry trees in this and neighboring towns have been dug up, and thousands more destined soon to share the same fate; and while the subject requires systematic investigation and revision, as well as simplification, it cannot be reasonably expected that individuals will make the necessary advance to compete successfully with such formidable obstacles. Remarkable Success In Pennsylvani A. We last week referred to Mr. Sunmeys operations in Manheim, A. We have now the particulars, under date of August 21, as follows." We have been doing very well this summer; much better than could be expected under more favorable circumstances. Our trees were all, or nearly all, planted and re planted last spring. We have now between twelve and thirteen acres of young trees, from two to six feet his lo from which we have now fed and gathered over fifty bushels of cochons, besides those now ready to gather, spinning, and coming on; so that we have the prospect of making one hundred bushels of cochons this season. We keep the small worms in the louse; but, after the third or last mounting, remove them to the open shanties, where they require no more cleaning, but plenty of foliage, and branches or straw to spin in, "messrs. Arson & Vice, of Lancaster, may not reach quite one hundred bushels of cochons; Mr. Were, between sixty and eighty ; and Mr. Chris man, from twenty to thirty bushels, which we intend reeling here2The gentleman last named commenced last year, and made 8. bushels. The farmers in this neighborhood are rapidly following Mr. Summeysexample; and if they follow his plans fully, we predict for them like encouraging returns. We see in this one place now probably two hundred and fifty bushels of cochons at least, We can call to mind several other places where some one farmer has thus commenced the culture of silk in this simple, natural way, and by his example induced his fellows to do the same; and this is the way new pursuits must be introduced. Met those, therefore, who are convinced that the thing can be done, make themselves the fist advance, and they will not long be alone; and let all engaged in or commencing the business bear in mind that at the New York feature there is always an amount of cash in deposit e for every bushel of cochons offered and we intend in a few days starting out on a thorough tour through the country to collect the precious materials; and hope, in anticipation of our call, that every grower will have his cochons thoroughly cured, carefullyflossed and as sorted, in readiness for barreling for transportation to Newyork. We want 1,000 bushels, immediately. A.  C Van Epps. New York Of Latura, Aligtwt 30, 1845.868 a. Of  Ssi  Ssi  Ppi Agai N. The following statements are from Mr. W. H. Fenton, of Raymond, Mississippi. It is mainly through such limited experiments that the large quantities of cochons in our country are produced; and if we are able to supply our demand for silk by our own production, it will be by small quantities being raised by nearly all our farmers. In France, and other silk growing countries, this is the case. There, it is quite as uncommon to see a farm without its mulberry orchard, as it is here to see one with. They raise but one crop, so that their feeding season is only of about six weeks' duration. As soon as the cochons are cured, every bushel is carried to the features and exchanged for cash. In most parts of our own country, three, four, and frequently more feedings may be made in the season, with results quite as favorable as one. It will be a most happy circumstance for the United States and their population, when farmers generally make it apart of their summers business to raise at least a small quantity of cochons. We deem it the duty of every person, and particularly the conductors of the public press, to urge this measure upon the attention of our people. If the quantities of trees amongst us are improved to good advantage, it will take but a few years to provide a full supply. There are now many plantations unoccupied, and their owners without eggs to use their foliage; and it was with the desire of providing for the employment of these that we proposed in our last number to furnish such persons with eggs, and receivecocoons in payment at the end of the season; and we trust the proposition may be improved. Mr. Fenton says: " My object in feeding worms this season was only to obtain a stock of eggs for the next, and to make such experiments as to the manner of rearing the worm as would throw light on future operations. In the limited experiment of this year, I have not been able to arrive at any satisfactory results as regards the profits of the business. It was not to be expected, nor was it a question with me. I have considered it as already settled that it is the best mode of regenerating labor under certain circumstances ; i. e, where the laborers are un fitted for field work. My worms consisted of three varieties the light yellow, deep yellow, and white. Not having as yet reeled any of the cochons, my preference for the white is merely for its beauty and size; and most of my eggs saved are of this variety. My worms were all mixed together upon the shelves, and      cannot therefore say which were the most healthy. I lost probably not more than a hundred by disease, out of about 10,000; and that loss was, I think, occasioned by the crowded state of two of the shelves. My feeding was altogether from the wild mulberry, but of various kinds. One kind      find near my house, which I think far superior to the multicaulistheleaves are very large, very thin, tender, soft, and flexible; the young branches have a velvety appearance, which distinguishes it from any other    have seen. It however remains to be seen whether it can be easily propagated, for in this I think the grand superiority of the " for us" consists. My opinion is decidedly in favor of using cut leaves entirely, in all stages and as I have no doubt this opinion coincides with that of the best informed, it is unnecessary to state the reasons for i the saw last season at Newark, in this State, some fine experiments with cut leaves, yet could not be induced to substitute it for open branch feeding, on any consideration ; besides being with three quarters more cost and. 86 labor, the chances are all in favor of the "new w school" plan, because it is natures plan, which is reason enough for its general adoption, however successful isolated cases on the other may prove. Of tried various experiments with regard to spinning. The Greek mode is to pile up mulberry branches on the shelves, crossing them in all directions, and leaving the worms to spin among them, as they please, and where they please a bad plan, for obvious reasons, to every one who has tried it. I tried two kinds of frames, made of s awed baths. By crossing the baths, boxes are formed of an inch square. Other frames were made by placing them in only one direction, thus forming grooves. This plan I find to be the best, as they are much easier made, and answer the purpose equally well." My expectations are fully realized. I did not expect that this year would show me what would be the profit arising from the business; but I did expect that I would show the practice ability of employing time to advantage, which would otherwise have been wasted for want of ability to attend to any other employment he have maintained, and do still maintain, that there is abundant un productive labor in the United States to produce cochons equal to our entire consumption. Esi  Lkoperati   Ons And Results Of The Present Season. We have been favored with a few statements from gentlemen who have been, to a greater or less extent, engaged in the rearing of the silk worm and every item of experience corroborates most fully the opinions advanced in our last remarks in this department, viz: That to succeed, some degree of common sense as much, certainly, as in raising a crop of corn, <a name="potatoes1452"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, or wheat must be used; that farmers need no more expect a favorable result when their plantations are uncultivated, and hard, unnutritious food given to the worms, than to receive an abundant crop of corn, or any other grain, where the seed is sown on soil imperfectly ploughed, and afterwards left to contend with grass and weeds, until the time of harvest. We must have more consistency in this respect, before any great advance can be made. To show the importance attached to this subject by the best fee der sin the world, we here give the substance of a statement made by an I italian, now a resident of this city, in relation to the course pursued by his father. He mentioned particularly one orchard of 10,000 trees. These were transplanted when about one inch in diameter, and six feet high. Preparatory to setting them out, the ground was laid out as follows: The rows were about fifteen feet apart, and the trees the same distance apart in the rows. Poles were then dug for the trees, about six feet square and two deep. The best portion of the earth thrown out was then returned to the bottom, to the depth of two or three inches, when the same depth of manure was thrown in. This is repeated ; and when the hole is half full, a smell conical pile of earth and manure is made in the middle, on which the tree (the roots having been carefully dressed) is placed, with a post at its side to support it. The remainder of the soil, with equal quantities of manure, is then returned. In three years these trees were nearly six inches in diameter, with large, beautiful tops; and then they commenced picking the foliage for us. a. Were, th ground is prepared as for corn, and the trees laid down or set in the furrow, and generally without maturing, where they stand from year to year, in many instances, without receiving the slightest attention. The fallacy of attempting to feed silkworms from the foliage of such trees needs no proof; and yet, from these very cases, discarding those that have proved successful, our cause has been judged and pronounced un feasible, and the destruction of vast quantities of mulberry orchards li as been the consequence. In most cases where the trees have not been well cultivated, the hot, dry weather of this summer has rendered the leaves utterly worthless, and time and means devoted to feeding them have been worse than thrown away. An instance: A gentleman, practically acquainted with the silk business, in giving us his experience, says left the city of New York about the first of May last to take charge of a plantation in Men rico county, Virginia. An extensive business had formerly been carried on here, and I proceeded with the hope of giving a new impulse to this business in Virginia, and securing an ample compensation to myself. The plantation once consisted of 30 acres, with a large cocoonerycontainingl4000 feet of shelling, in which had been fed the worms from 50 ounces of eggs at a single crop. The orchard is now reduced to about 4 acresmulticaulis) and has not received any cultivation in three years. When  arrived, I found that, contrary to my expectations, I should be under the necessity of feeding such foliage as these would produce, and in an old fashioned cocoonery, too. My first inclination was to return to the "land of the free." Having with me several ounces of eggs, however, I determined to remain and make the attempt. Another quantity of eggs soon came ; but with them the commencement of an extremely dry season, which has almost literally "burnt us up" and given a September appearance even in June. I need not add that my expenses, not counting the loss of time, have exceeded several times all I shall realize from my cochons. I conquer most fully in the last article in the "silk department" of the Farmer and Mechanics, and wish it might be read and observed by every person a tall concerned in the culture of silk. -for the proprietor I have the highest regard, and I shall ever cherish the recollection of happy months spent in his worthy family. My confidence in the silk business remains unimpaired ; and 1 believe that Virginia possesses all the natural facilities for becoming one of the greatest silk growing States of this Union, and equal to any equal extent of country on the globe; but I rejoice that, like everything else, the business must be conducted with system and consistency to insure success. Were this a plantation of my own, or should I again have charge of it, my first move would be, early in April to take up all the trees thoroughly, break up and prepare the land, increase its extent by six or eight acres, and re plant the trees. In the middle I should have a place for a tent or shed, 150 or 200 feet long. With such an establishment, I am confident I should make more clear money than could by any other means be produced from any other 50 of the 500 acres of which this farm consists. a. 87TProm the N, Y.: Farmer, Mai Of. The following appears in the Lincoln Telegraph, Path, August, 7, 184, :a* Of  Of Culture. I This product is not only attracting the attention of the legislatures of many States, but individuals, in all parts of the Union. It has been predicted by men of sound judgment and forecast that, at no distant period, silk would rank among the most important productions, and we see no reason to doubt the correctness of the prediction. It therefore becomes a question worthy the consideration of every agriculturists in New England, particularly in Paine. Should it be found that our soil and climate are adapted to its culture, surely an important article will be added to our product. Nothing is hazarded in saying that the mulberry tree flourished well ih1aine. This we know from several years' personal observation; so the foliage can be produced in any quantities; and the success we have witnessed in this town the present season leaves no doubt that a profitable crop can be produced. In the case alluded to, probably better cochons, and a more healthy brood, could not be reared anywhere. Therefore, two facts seem to be established beyond a question, viz: that foliage of the best quality can be produced abundantly in Paine, and our summer is ample for the health and growth of the silkworm n I talk and France, the great silk growing countries of Europe, the crop is made in six weeks from the time of watching the eggs. [west fee der stake their worms through in twenty-six days from watching; in which case the feeding is kept up every two or three hours, day and night. E.] It would seem, therefore, that all that is wanting in Paine is practical knowledge which is not difficult to obtain for the farmer to add a rich item to his products. The experiment we allude to, as coming under our personal notice in this town the present season, has been conducted by our fellow citizen, On. P. H. Green, who deserves great credit for the deep interest he has taken in this enterprise, as well as the large amount of scientific and practical knowledge he has made himself master of, touching this whole ,subject. We hope Colonel Green will push his experiments another season to a still more magnificent extent. We are satisfied that no man is more peculiarly qualified as a pioneer in an undertaking which really promises so much for the future glory of the Statethe opinion of the editor of the Telegraph respecting the qualifications of Colonel Green to pursue the culture of silk can be readily endorsed by those acquainted with his views, experiments, and close observation, during his first season of feeding, and more particularly described in his able report to the New England silk convention, and the national silk convention of the American I institute, in New Work, in October last, He has in Sort hampton a quantity of superior silkworm eggs, in fine condition for feeding. Colonel Green is a warm advocate for the application of artificial heat in cocooneries, to obviate the effects of sudden cold and chills. He are informed that last year he rented one of Dr. Stebbinss plantations, inNorthampton, where he made the experiments alluded to in his report, Persons in Paine desirous of commencing the business will do well to center with Vol. G., as his close observation of the nature and wants of the silkworm render him pre eminently calculated to impart instruction, We872 shall expect a particular account of his operations for this department soon, Success will always attend such efforts. We have on hand further interesting matter for next week. Met all contribute their experience; for in this way alone can we fix upon the best system, and adopt it in practice. A. C. Van Epps. Of  Of Culture In South Caroli   Of. In a letter from Need ham Davis, of Barn well district, South Carolina, relative to silk, he says: "the prospect of silk in this section of the country is poor indeed. The long warm spell through February and part of March brought out vegetation rapidly the silkworms hatched out early, and were prosperous until cold weather set in, destroying, in many places, peaches and many other fruits, and cutting down corn and much forward wheat killing mulberry leaves. Any silkworms were lost. I stripped bark from the mulberry tree; I took young twigs from them, and fed my worms with them. What few cochons 1 have made are firm and of good quality. New worms are diseased not an average of five in a thousand. I shall soon state my method of rearing silkworms. I mean to convince our citizens that they can raise silk to advantage; that the old and the young members of a family can be profit ably employed at it. And hundreds will yet come into the business for their own profit, and the good of the countryMULBERRY Trees. We are happy to learn that the mulberry plantations of our friend Or. Stebbins, of Sort hampton, are not included among those destroyed by the frosts of the last winter, as we had been informed, but are all under the superintendence of Mr. S. A. Elements and brother, late of North Ran by, Connecticut. It the west the destruction of mulberry trees has been much greater than was at first supposed. The orchard from which we did our feeding last year shows no signs of life yet, and it is feared the roots are killed. Had this been a destruction of fruit orchards instead of mulberry, the sympathy for the loses would have been very great; but as it is, few regret the loss. Said a gentleman from Moreau, a few days since, "' have lost all my trees, and it calls forth scarcely a passing remark from my neighbors. Had I lost                 $500 bank stock, I should have had sympathy enough. I should, however, have regretted less the loss of.               $3,000 bank stock than this The following letter is from Dr. Stebbins, under date of May 30th. The views of this gentleman are highly practical, and the country is much indebted to him for his uninterrupted devotion to the silk cause during the many difficulties which it has had to encounter, and we trust he may live to see the day of its triumph. Northern eggs are doubtless far better adapted to the south than those preserved there ; and although we intend to do our principal feeding at the south, we shall feed here for eggs. A. C. V. E. Dr. S. says: L The season is yet rather unfavorable. We have had several frosts, which formed ice of the thickness of window glass; that of the 24th and 25th was rather severe for tender foliage. We have the bent. 87 e fits of a bounty on cochons to encourage the growth of silk. It was hoped this encouragement would induce many new be dinners to undertake, but have not such evidence as is desirable. Another year, however, may show its fruits. When any business has been neglected or abandoned from any cause, it is often difficult to resume it courageous let A few out of this Commonwealth have awaked on the subject, in consequence of reading the ' Silk Question Settled' I have furnished to order several parcels of young needling Wanton trees and cuttings, and silkworm eggs of the last years crops, to individuals in the State of New Work, and others more remote, and am making calculations for another years supply, although I have not disposed of all my former stick, which can be retained until August before used( A gentleman from Vermont, with cochons and reeled silk, is here, and wishes to insure a market for the new crop. I showed him your offer in the June number of the Farmer and Mechanics. He thinks the offer too low to send so far, and wishes for a midway market in the Connecticut valley; says there are many in Vermont who feed worms, and want a cash market. Cocoons have been sent here, but they do not like a barter trade By accounts from various sections of country, it appears that the seasons are more irregular than in some former years, attended with sudden changes of atmosphere, and unfavorable for the silkworm. It is a question worthy of consideration, whether we may not yet find it prudent to adopt the European practice of artificial warmth in our cocooneries, to obviate the effects of sudden changes of weather. Even the favored south may yet find a benefit of some apparatus to regulate the temperature of the cool, damp evenings, and the use of wires with reference to the effects of electricity." Difficulties have occurred in Jamaica, (W. I.) where the nights are comparatively cool and moist, where it may be necessary to resort to means for regulating the temperature of the evening air and moisture. A person who has fed worms in Jamaica has this day suggested to me that artificial warmth may obviate difficulties and prove highly advantageous, and also using silkworm eggs from America, especially those raised in New England, in preference to any which have been propagated in the island. Thecreolizing system has not answered the expectation. Such was the result of experiment in the Sandwich islands, where the experiment was made of crossing the American with the native or China eggs. In our own country, would the northern eggs be better adapted to the south than eggs raised south ?a? I have had silkworm eggs from the south; and especially some sent me by the unfortunate Dr. Ferri ne, from I indian Key, Florida, proved a failure, from whom also I had a great variety of <a name="seeds112"><mark>seeds</mark></a> which had not been sufficiently acclimated according to his most sanguine expectations ; but all the <a name="seeds113"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, plants, cuttings, and eggs, sent from here to him, fully answered the expectations' It is well now n that Mr. Hit marsh introduced a species of mulberryseed from I talk, gathered near the Alps, and here called Ll pine mulberry. From this seed he raised large quantities of needling plants, and transferred them to Jamaica for feeding worms upon its foliage, and, after a few years use, found the leaf too hard and crude for the worm; and it is now understood that he has rejected them entirely, and has substituted the multicaulisand Wanton as more congenial to the silkworm: A person who took with him Wanton needlings from this town to Jamaica informed me that they flourished astonishing ly, and grew in one season to 8 such a height as -required heading down every three months. Such wasthecaso in the Sandwic4hislands. As with fruits so with the feed for silkworm is; there may be different degrees of goodness in the foliage, as the good, better, and the best. I have tried almost every variety, and have the vanity to believe that by actual experiment I have discovered the most profitable varieties for feeding worms adapted to this or any other climate." If our farmers should adopt the sentiments of Men. Tallmadge, as expressed before the Farmers' Club, 'that silk is the most interesting subject that could be brought under the consideration of this nation that no country on the globe, except China, can compete with the United States who could decline a trial of its merits, not only to insure personal prosperity and wealth, but to open an immense source for national revenue? The above sentiment is worthy of him who uttered it, and of every patriot in America, and should be promulgated throughout the whole length and breadth of the land From the Paine Farmer. Of  Of Culture. Our operations thus far have been on a small scale, but we believe that, under o judicious management, the rearing of silkworms may be extensively pursued, even in this cold region of frost and snow, with as good a chance of sue ness as in the culture of corn, wheat, or any other product of the farm. We have five hundred whitemulberry trees of eight years' growth, whichecupy one fourth to ana ere of warm; sandy soil, that was cultivated, while the trees were small, in <a name="potatoes1453"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, beans, &c; only ten common cartloads of stable manure having been applied since the trees were put out. Have a fewihtundred of the muiticaulis mulberry also, but have used none of the foliage for feeding worms. Think they will not flourish well here. In 1843 we fed 12,000 worms, which spun good cochons, but accidentally lost 5,000 of them by fire. From the remaining 7,000, which weighed 28 lbs, we manufactured 1,000 skeins of sewing silk. In 1844 we fed 20 000, but, from a want of experience in preserving eggs, the worms were unhealthy, and made poor cochons: manufactured 500 skeins of sewing silk, and seven handkerchiefs, worth                                                         $1.25 each. The past season we fed 2 2000, which did well: made 2,500 skeins of sewing silk, 12 handkerchiefs, that were pronounced " good" and sold very readily at                                                         $1.25 each, and a mantle of superior texture, worth five or six dollars 2500 skeins of sewing silk, at 83 per hundred -a-      $75.0012NOTE.-I t is to be remarked that the cistern bottoms resulting from this crop have not been re boiled by the planters as heretofore has been the case; they have been bought up by the refine is at higher rates than the planters could realize by working them over. This item is estimated to be equivalent to 5 per cent. addition to the number of hogs heads of sugar, and would swell the crop to full 200,000 hogs heads. A large quantity of cane has been sold in the field to make plant for new plantations; a considerable quantity was lost by overflow in the summer, and some for want of fuel to work it. There has not been the usual quantity of molasses made in proportion to that of sugar, owing probably to the cane having acquired a higher degree of maturity; and it is supposed the average yield has not exceeded 45 gallons per 1,000 lbs. of sugar, or, in round numbers, about 9,000,000gallons. It will be observed, from the foregoing statement, that there are in operation in this State 76 2 sugar mills, of which 408 are worked by steam engines, and 354 by horse power; the number of planters about 900;,some of the smaller estates joining their neighbors in one sugar house. There will be a large increase of sugar plantations in this Statewithinthe next two years. Preparations are making for full 60 or 70, the low prices of cotton having induced many growers of this staple in the parishes of Joint e Couple, West Baton Gouge, I be r ville, It. An dry, Opelousas, C, to turn their attention to sugar. P. A. Champomi  Of. New Orleans, April 21, 1845.  When I published the preceding statement of the crop of sugar in Louisiana for the yea' 1844 45, I had only in view the one object of obtaining the correct details of the crop, in which I succeeded to my entire satisfaction ; but i gave little or no attention to other points connected' with the actual on edition and future prospects of the culture of cane. It Wasotcid127i until i as making up for publication the details I had connected as to the crop, that it occurred to me to make any remarks on the two points of the number- :of proprietors of the existing plantations, and the probable number of hew ones then just opened, or opening; both of which     was, under the circumstances of the case, compelled to do by a rough and, vague estimate, principally founded on information received from (cid127ithersSince then, however, I have devoted much time and attention to both thee points ; and having found by my particular investigation that my previous estimates were very erroneous, I deem it a duty to correct the errors, particularly as my publication has been extensively referred to and quoted : authority through the Union. For the then existing 76 2 plantations, I estimated there were 900 .proprietors : instead of 900, however, I find there were 1,200 on the old plantations, being distinct families, or heads of families, who are the owners of these estates, and principally depending on them this entirely exclusive of overseers, sugar makers, engineers, carpenters, coopers, blacksmiths, &c, as we f as all other families vi wo are connected with the culture of cane in this. State. Fly error was still greater in my estimate as to the new plantations.

It thus appears that in these 17 parishes there are 367 cotton plantations which have been changed into sugar estates, eat even this does not show the :full number, as many other small cottncgrowers have also abandoned that culture for sugar; but not having the means to erect sugar works themselves, all grind their cane at the mills i of their immediate neighbors, and these small estates are not reckoned among the 367nvewplantations. In the, three other parishes, Her million, Lafayette, and It. A dry, where there were 25 old plantations, I have not investigated the number of new ones, but, from the information I have obtained there must be to 30, or even .more. In the parishes of Rapides, Avoyelles, Calcassieu, Catahoula, and Concordia, arrangements were being made for more than 200 new sugar plantations, but the most part of them have been suspended, and cotton, will be mostly cultivated on them for another season, until the action of Congress respecting the tariff is ascertained. Still there are, however, 70 to 80 that are actually opened and going in t operation in those five parishes, and all those who suspended the change of their culture are fully provided already, even at great cost, with seed cane for planting. Of the above named new plantations, but a certain number will produce more cane than they will respectively require for re planting this season, and add but a little to the present crop. But a very large number will be in full operation for the next crop of 1846 47, and all of them for the crop of 1847 48.  Seventy-two engines for sugar mills have been introduced in the State this year, coming from the man factories of Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Louisville, New. Work, Philadelphia, and Richmond: some very costly onescid127rom New York and Philadelphia.

New Orleans, November 24, 1845. From the Planters' Manner. The Sugar Market. The 1st of September being the commencement of a new commercial year, the New Orleans Price Current, in accordance with custom, takes a90
retrospect of the most important business operations of the New Orleans market during the season which has just terminated, and offers some remarks upon the prospects of the opening year. We give the remarks on the sugar market, which i must prove highly interesting to our planters  n our annual report of 1st September last we stated, in reference to the then growing crop, that up to that period the prospect was of the most flattering character for its early maturity and unusual abundance, and we have now to remark that the result has well maintained our expectations, as a continuance of highly favorable weather throughout the season enabled our planters to make the largest and best crop ever produced in Louisiana. In regard to the amount of production, we have already given it in a former number, and again avail ourselves of the published statement of Mr. P. A. Champomier, who gives the product of each plantation visited, and the result is 191,324hogsheads, which Mr. C. estimates to be equal to 204,913,000pounds. Besides this, Mr. C. states in a note that the cistern bottoms resulting from this crop have not been generally re boiled by the planters, as heretofore has been the case* They have been bought up by the refined sat higher rates than the planters could realize by working them over. His item is estimated to be equivalent to 5 per cent. addition to the i number of hogs heads of sugar, and would swell the crop to full 200,000 hogs heads so, according to this best available authority, we place the crop of 1844 at 200 000 hogs heads equal, in round numbers, to about 215,000,000 lb sand exceeding the crop of 1842 (previously the largest) by 60,000 hogs heads. The first arrival of the new crop was on the 3d October, establishing the early maturity of the cane, the first receipts of the previous year having been on the 22d October. Some few small sales of the earliest arrivals were made at 6 and 6- cents, but prices soon gave way as the receipts increased, and by the latter part of October the extreme rates were 4- arid i cents. The market continued generally dull, with increasing stocks and declining prices, until the early part of November, when the demand o opened with some activity, both for the north and west, at an extreme range of 34 and 5- cents. For more than a month subsequent to this period the market continued irregular, though generally much depressed under a large accumulation of stock, when about the middle of December an active demand again sprung up, principally for shipment to the north, at 3 and 51 cents. A period of dullness again ensued, and by the 1st January prices were down to 2- and 5- cents extremes on the levee, the market continuing extremely heavy until late in the month, when some speculative movements at the north, based mainly upon the very large deficiency in the crop of Cuba, (said to be about 600,000 boxes, or considerably more than the whole crop of Louisiana) gave a renewed and more active impulse to the demand, and extensive purchases were made, principally on speculation arid for shipment to the north, at 21 and 5- cents on the levee. At this point, also, large operations were entered into on plantation, and a number of crops were disposed of at prices ranging from 21 to 4 cents, the prevailing rate being 31 cents for fair crops. At the commencement of this demand the market, as regards prices, had reached about the lowest point of the season, and here began the upward impulse, which, with a generally good demand, gradually carried prices up to 51 and 7 cents on the levee, and 51 and 6 on plantation, a point which they reached about the middleofApril, the great bulk of the crop having passed into second hands sometime previous. Were, in consequence of unfavorable advices from the north, a. 905 a reaction took place, and the market remained in a very dull state, with gradually declining places, until the latter part of May, when they had again fallen to 4: and 61 cents on the levee, and 51 and 6 on plantation. From this period excessive dullness prevailed up to the latter part of July, when improved rates at the north directed orders to this market, particularly for the ordinary to fair qualities; and these, acting upon a reduced stock, again produced a reaction in prices, which have since materially advanced, the closing rates being 6 and or cents for fair to strictly prime, the common qualities being all disposed of; and the whole quantity in the State is now estimated not to exceed 2,500 hhdsThe crop, as above stated, with a stock on hand 1st September last estimated at 2,000 hogs heads, makes a supply of 202,000 hogs heads, the distribution of which may be stated as follows : Exports, including those from Attakapas, equal to 107,000 hogs heads, western States 70,000; domestic consumption of the city and of places in this 'and neighboring States, furnished in small parcels, of which there is no record, 12,500;taken for refining in the city and State, 10,000; stock now on hand in the State 2,500; total, 202,000 hogs heads. This statement we are persuaded approximates to correctness, though as regards all the items except the first we are left entirely to conjecture l estimates, as there are not, nor in the nature of the trade can there be, any positive data for the quantity taken by the west and south. It will be seen that of the amount exported, the Atlantic ports have taken 101,000 hogs heads against 30,000 hogs heads last season n regard to the growing crop, we understand that it is not generally considered as far forward in its progress by some two weeks as it was last year at the same period, a circumstance which may prove of serious detriment, though we are happy to have it in our power to state that from present appearances the promise is flattering for an abundant yield; and should the weather continue of as favorable a character as it was last season, there seems a strong probability that, what with the extension of cultivation and the improved modes of culture and manufacture, the coming crop will bathe largest in quantity and best in quality of any yet produced in Louisiana. With all this flattering promise, however, it should be held in remembrance that the cane culture in these latitudes is very precarious, and an early frost or a severe hurricane might blight the present encouraging prospects of the planter to a serious extent. As an evidence of the remarkably fluctuating character of the production, we annex a statement of the crops for a series of years, by which it will be seen that while the crop of 1834 was 100,000 hogs heads, the succeeding one, that of 1835, fell to 30 000; and further, that the last crop exceeds the one immediately preceding it by 100,000 hogs heads :drop of 1844 -200 000 hogs heads 1843 -100, 00 1842 -140, 000 1841 .90, 000 1840 -87, 000 1839 -115 000 1838 -a. -70, 00 1837 -65, 000 1836 -70 000 1835 -30 000 906 :of.

Nevertheless, the extension of consumption in our own country, and the opening of ptheEnglish markets at a reduced duty, will be likely to protect this important staple from so great a depression as would otherwise be consequent upon a large productionNEW Orleans, March 1, 1845. Dear Of  R: I do hereby certify that the annexed statement of my last crop made on Turtle Drove plantation, and which it is your intention to have printed in the report of the Patent Office, is true and correct; and I do further say that your apparatus has exceeded, in all respects, .my expectations. I have, in consequence, contracted for another apparatus for another ,plantation of mine, and with which I intend to make my next crop into loaf sugar. Very respectfully, yours, T. J. Packwood. Mr. N. Of Lli   Eux. N. Of Lli   Euxs Patented Apparatus And Process. Turtle Drove estate Statement of the sugar crop, 1844 45. The total crop amounts to 829 hogs heads, to wit: 128 hogs heads obtained by the old set of kettles, and 701 hogs heads by the new apparatus. The 128 first hogs heads have been sold here, in November and 1)e-cember, 1844, at the average price quoted for fair sugar during the same period in the New Orleans price current. The same average price ought to be taken, in consequence, for the following months, as a correct expression of the prices which the owner of the plantation should have obtained for his sugar. Would he have made his entire crop by the set of kettles, and without using the new apparatus? Such are the prices adopted in the following statements, to establish a fair comparison between the proceeds of the two processes. The 701 hogs heads by the apparatus are represented, by 177 hogs heads sold at New Orleans in November and December, 1844,and January and February, 1845.202 shipped for different places, viz :new Work, 10 hogs heads, sold at 6( cents to.

U Ttjcker: The plants we cut and mat lay in .beds duridngtheautumn, usually in October, previous to the sugar making season, andbefoiEthe canes are injured by frosts. Often the unripe tops, which would otherwise be thrown away, are windowed for plants. The best plants canewusjlyply save for Plaits, because they are the easiest, put up and the quest planted; for time and' saving of labor are money. Besides, by planting the whole stalk, it grows more vigorously than the tops especially in a dry season. After the sugar making season is over, (which usually is about the first of January) we prepare our land designed for cane, by sloughing and narrowing, breaking it from four to eight inches deep; the stiffer the land, the deeper the sloughing is necessary to protect it from drought. Thus prepared, the ground is laid off in rows, with a two horse plough, about six feet apart, (some plant as close as four feet) In these furrows a double mould board plough, with one horse, is run, in order to clear the furrows of lumps and sons, and also to deepen and widen the fir rows; as it is necessary r to 'it the plants several inches below the surface, otherwise the cane would require too' much hilling, especially the second and third years. The plants are now taken from these mats, and the leaves stripped off, plate do in carts, carried and tapped out on the prepared land, and laidlepzhAwise in the furrows. We plant three canes side by side, or triple s one say one and a half is sufficient. The closer the rows, the less each would require. We now pass along with a cane knife, and cut the cane in pieces, say from two to three feet in length, in order that the canes may lie more level, and because more eyes will ve get ate. Being thus placed, a. 911 they- are covered with aplougihto the depth required, from one to three inches, over which a light harrow may be passed. Any prefer to cover with the 'he. Soon as the freezes are over in February, the cane is ploughed, running the bar each side the cane, and throwing the furrowsfrorriit; the cane, beginning to come up; is scraped, (so called) if covered, to deep; the earth :is taken i ff, usually with a he, sometimes with a harrow or other machine, and cleaned. fro    m grass and weeds. In a few weeks it is again ploughed and hold, and again, when necessary, a little earth put to it whtenreqruired. The cane by April or May has come up thick in the rows, but usuallynotisothick but that the s talks, when about a ft a fo and a half or two feet high, send out many new stools or shoots from the bottom of the stalk, and, if they come out early, grow and mature equal to the main stalk. I tis usual to give it three or four workings, and in the last to hill the cane three or four inches, and sufficiently high to protect the lower eyes on the s talks from freezing in the winter. Those eyes ve get ate next season, and produce nearly equal to the first season on fresh land, and so again the third yea, and often longer. Lane is injured by hilling before the stools are sufficiently high, and should receive the last working soon after it is about three feet high, in order to afford more time for ripe king. After this period, say in June, it grows very rapidly ; the joints begin to appear, and the lower joints begin to risen to sweet en and by the middle of October usually ripe n from two to four feet from the bottom, and continue to risen i about a join t (or six inches a week, till they are cut for the mill, ortiHthe freeze comes; or till they are cut to window, in order to securetheimfrom an anticipated freeze. About the middle of October we commence making sugar. Each hand takes a row ; first cuts the tops of the s talks off just below the green: leaves, and drops them on the ground or lays them in window, if designed for plants ; then, with the knife, (the blade of which is about 18 inches in length and two inches in breadth the dry leaves are stripped from' the s talks, and the cane is cut close to the ground; the left hand at the same time has hold of the canes thus cut, and places them in small heaps, convenient for loading into carts, drawn by horses, mules, or oxen. Other hands load the cane, and it is hauled to the mill. The cane fields are all ditched, usually every acre in width, with cross ditches about every five acres. To water is allowed to remain on the surface. The cultivation is as simple as that of broom corn, and the young shoot far more vigorous. C. Lane s talks usually grow from 6 to 9 feet high. The leaves shoot up two or three feet higher i Lane ri pens in favorable seasons within 12 or 18 inches of the top. You will perceive we plant one third of our cane land or crop yearly, two thirds coming from the rations. Of. Of   Llotson. New Of Ver, Of, August. 1844. Fro mi the Florilaedit. Flori Of Sugarletter From F. P. Of  Llerwe have been shown a specimen of sugar manufactured by F. P. Miller, esq, of jefferson county, (referred to in the letter below) which is by 912 far the finest sample of Florida sugar we have ever seen. It is nearly equal in whiteness to the Havana box, and is superior to the sugar brought here from New Orleans. Had we the capital to erect proper works, sugar would soon become no small item in our exports. As it is, however, our planters will soon be able to manufacture not only sufficient for their own use, but to supply the demand of our home markets. The annexed letter from Mr. Miller, which has been kindly furnished us by Sov. Moseleyfor publication, contains some hints which may be useful to those engaged in the cultivation of the cane. We would respectfully suggest to those of our planters who have had experience in the manufacture of sugar, to communicate the result of their observations to the public. We should be happy to extend the use of our columns to any one who would favor us with articles upon sugar, as well as upon. the culture of tobacco, &c. Jefferson County, September 1, 1845. Dear Of  R: In a communication which I received from you a few days since, you requested me to furnish you with an article on the cultivation and manufacture of sugar. I have had some hesitancy in complying with your request, only from the fact that my opinions would possibly differ with some of the farmers of the country, and some, too, of experience. But, after giving the subject due consideration, and thinking I might be of service to some in my communication, I have yielded to your request and, so far as I am capable of giving my opinions, you shall have them freely. As I am more accustomed to using my farming utensils than wielding the pen, and knowing better how to make sugar than to describe the operation, you must allow me to give my opinions in my own plain way. In the first place, I prefer the ribbon cane for this climate, for the reason that it will stand the cold spells, which we are sometimes subject to in the fall season, much better than the green. I have noticed in some crops that I have made, where my cane has been mixed, that the green cane has soured after a killing frost, when the ribbon cane would be perfectly sweet. This I consider a great advantage, by giving the planter more time to gather in the other products of his farm. The sample of sugar which I send you was made from the ribbon cane after a severe freeze, which I consider a good test of its preference. I have been accustomed to banking my seed cane in love, flat beds, say about four feet deep, with the roots inclined downwards, and leaving them entirely uncovered with earth until after the first frost, or until the blades are entirely dry. The advantage to be gained by this mode of putting up seed cane I consider a great one, from the fact that the cane will remain in a warm, moist state during the winter, and the roots and eyes will not only be perfectly sound by the usual planting time, but will have put forth their sprouts, and secure to the planter an earlier and better stand. The usual mode of banking up seed, by drawing the bed to a narrow ridge on top and covering with earth before the blades are thoroughly dried, causes the cane to beat, and consequently a great many of the sprouts will perish from dry rot. The kind of soil from which I raised my cane last year is of good quality pine land, about fourteen or fifteen inches deep, of a very light cast, z and has been in cultivation several years. Lane should never be planted on first years ground, from the fact that the juice extracted from it will not grand late, The most f for able tinge for planting, in my opinion, is. 13 about the middle of February, provided there is a suitable warm spell; for    consider the cane to be doing much better by remaining in bank, where it will sprout and remain sound, and not exposed to the cold until the earth has become a little warm. My own observation has convinced me that cane planted about this time will grow off faster, be equally as forward, and the stand much better, than when planted earlier. I have usually planted my cane four feet between rows, and very thick in the drill; a stalk of cane six feet long should lap or be touching. The seed should be planted deep, and covered with a turning plough. The first working which it receives should be done with the hoewhatis commonly called by the farmers "flat wedding." This will break the crust which may have been formed on the surface of the bed, and forward its coming up. The first sloughing I usually give my cane is with the turning plough; but after it becomes of any size, I use the sweep. The usual time for laying by is the first of June; but should it be growing rapidly, Would advise later and deeper sloughing, which will check the, growth and cause it to mature better. It will have been noticed by all who are in the habit of using it, that the sac charing matter is greatly increased after the growth has been checked by the first frost, and until then should never be cut for grinding. I am convinced that a great many of the failures in making sugar are caused from the fact of the cane being topped too high, and consequently a good deal of the juice is extracted from cane that is not matured. The best criterion to be governed by is from the blades drying up, and leaving the stalk exposed only so far as the cane is matured ; and I make it a rule to cut my cane at the joint above the first green blade, by which means you are certain not to have any cane un matured. I have found a great advantage in cutting my cane and exposing it to the sun about two or three days before grinding. A good deal of the watery particles will e vapor ate, without any loss of the sac charing matter. The process of boiling will depend a great deal upon the quality of the cane and its maturity. A person would learn more from seeing a few boilings taken off than from all he might hear or read on the subject. In the first place, I would advise the use of lime, which assists a great deal in clarifying, and causes the grain to be much firmer. My plan of using is to mix a half gallon of the cane juice with a half pint of lime ; after setting a while, pour it off. His quantity should be put into a hundred gallons of the cane juice. It is best not to commence swimming until it is nearly in the act of boiling, at which time most of the s cum has risen to the surface, and is much easier taken off. There are so many marks by which the sugar maker as certains when his boiling has arrived at the sugar state, that it would be difficult to describe them all. I will give one or two which I consider most certain. It is known by all who have any experience in sugar making, that as the boiling approaches the sugar state the f roth or foam is greatly increased, and the bubbles become much smaller, by constantly dipping up and pouring it off from the cooler. It will be seen that the quantity of liquor or sir up decreases very rapidly after the boiling has turned down this should be continued until there is but a small quantity of sir up left, which will be seen in the drainings from the cooler. Another criterion to be governed by, is, when it is ready to be taken off, the bubbles, instead of rising and falling out from the centre, will turn in; when it should be taken off and put into the cooling vessel as soon as possible 58 914 a. With regard to the process of dripping, I would say that it is all important to have the molasses well drained from the bottom of the barrels; to effect which, it is necessary to have two or three holes bored in the bottom, into which should be inserted s talks of cane, which will gradually wither and leave the orifice larger at the time when the draining is most needed from the bottom. The hoops should be well loosened after the sugar has been in the barrels a few days. In conclusion, I would say, that I believe as good sugar can be raised here as in any country, from the fact that I have seen samples of sugar made in this country that would compare with the best quality of imported sugar; and, if not cultivated as an article for market, should be made by all the farmers for their own consumption. Hours, truly, Franci     S P. Of  Ller. Sov. Am. D. Moseley. Consulate Of Of   E Uni Ted States, Singapore, December 17, 1844. Of  R: I am indebted to the kindness of my excellent friend, Francismarkoe, esq, of the Department of State, for a copy of your report on patents, to Congress, at the early part of the present year, which I consider a most valuable work, calculated, as it is, to circulate precious information to the great mass of our people without any expense. Is, besides notices of patents, you have embodied useful notes from many experienced persons, I have thought that some account of the Chinese manner of sugar cane cultivation might be agreeable to you; and, should      be correct in this supposition, you are at liberty to make any use you may think proper of it. The cane is topped off in the usual manner with us, and the upper end is lopped off until cut quite into the solid part, when the heart or with of it is yellowish and substantial, in order to produce lateral shoots, and prevent sprouting at the end ; the lower leaves are then removed ; and, if the tops are gathered on the day of cutting, they are allowed to remain overnight in the open field, that the sugary sap may somewhat dry up, and be pervious to the water into which they and others, previously cut, are put to soak for twenty-four hours. This process, they say, prevents destructive insects being engendered. After twenty-four hours soaking in water, the plants, which, for the convenience of handling them, are tied up with cane leaves into bundles of about thirty plants, are laid, standing upright and compactly pressed against one another, in a square hole, about six inches deep, and of any given size; when quite full, the mould at the four sides is raised up to near the height of the mass, and muddy water is then thrown on the top till quite drenched ; a layer of cane leaves, mixed with dirt, is now spread on to prevent sudden evaporation of the water. For four or six succeeding days considerable quantities of water are thrown on, but without disturbing the top layer. At the end of that time the top and sides are removed, and the eyes of the cane plants are seen to have sprouted out one half to a full inch, and they are now carried in baskets to the furrows prepared to receive them. By this treatment not a single. 915pilant is lost, and they are as far advanced as those plants which have been otherwise planted full three weeks before. Their mode of planting is as deserving of attention, and is the : their furrows are hardly four inches deep, and in the afternoons only they plant into earth made quite fine by being well worked. The prepared plants, are carefully laid almost flat. the lower ends only dipping in the ground, leaving the young shoots quite un buried; when, in a week or two, the new plants are observed to shoot up with great vigor. Manure, which has been plentiful ly prepared by burning the dried cane leaves and weeds gathered in hillocks in various parts of the field, mixed with mould, which is burnt with them, is laid in small quantities on the buried end, and not on the whole plant; about a double handful of this manure is laid on each. It is carried very readily in baskets, which are slung to a pole or staff, in the Chinese manner of carrying burdens, across the shoulders, which is familiar to most persons who have seen Chinese prints; and it is wonderful to see the effect produced in a few days : they, prefer to lay it on in dry weather. When the plants are a month or six weeks old, and the weather likewise dry, liquid manure, composed of the discharges of the body, the washings of pigs ties, indeed all the odds and ends about the house, (which are carefully collected in tanks) is carried in the like manner, in pails, and lad led out in small quantities on the young canes. A month later they require wedding, and perhaps burnt manure, a second time; and they are finally moulded and shoed. Owing probably to the usual dampness of this climate, they begin early to strip the canes, and never allow the dead leaves to remain. These are gathered and burnt to manure, as before said. Thus each field is made to provide itself with a plentiful supply of that (to them) indispensable article; for they never allow their ground to remain fallow, nor do they practise rotation of crops. But, by following this simple mode, their plantations far exceed in luxuriant e and abundance of canes any thing I ever saw in the whole range of the West In dies, beginning with Barbadoes, down to the fertile plain extending along the whole southern coast of Porto Rico. There are never less than fifteen large Haiti canes in the stoles, and even thirty. Some skill and considerable practice are required to make the burnt manure good in their estimation; for, unless it be quite black, they think little of it. To effect this, some pieces of stray wood are piled up, set on fire, and then grass or cane leaves, partly dry, are laid on then a little earth; as this slowly consumes, some ten or twelve hours later an opening is made at the base of the hillock, and more grass, leaves, andSnould are laid on the red hot ashes, and the pile is made again to assume la conical form ; and so on, for a day or two, until a sufficiently large mass of manure is provided, to be at hand when wanted; nor is their process a slow one, as might be imagined; for, although the planted canes are ripe in thirteen months, here, under the equator, one cooee, or laborer, raises two and a half acres of canes. The rations ripe n in ten months; these are slightly, manured with burnt manure. The he is their 64 ly implement. I have often paused in wonder on seeing the most luxuriant fields standing in sandy ground, apparently without a particle of soil, and made to grow thus by the process above indicated. The business of growing and manipulation g are separate among the Chinese. Were contracts are made by the sugar mill owners, with the sane growers, to convey their canes to the mill, manipulate them into 916 sugar, and pay them at rates varying from one to one and a half Spanisihdollar per pick l (133 1 pounds English) of sugar in the raw state ; that is, with the molasses included made therefrom; the grower receiving a monthly advance of two Spanish dollars for his support, which is retained, with interest, at one per cent. a month, from the proceeds of the sugar made from his canes. The ground may belong to either party, without in any way affecting the contract; but generally, it belongs to the mill owner. This latter furnishes the means of conveyance. All the implements for manufacture, and the laborers in and about the sugar house, are at his own expense; which is not excessive, as a first rate boiler (Chinese is hired for from eight to ten dollars per month, and other laborers, of the same nation, at from three to four dollars, and found in nothing. In fact, all servants are paid wages, and are not found. The process of boiling is after that of the West In dies, as all the works are carried on by Europeans. But, instead of our copper swimmers, maybe seen occasionally, as a substitute, a sort of si eve, with a long handle, and ladies, made in a conical form, from the bark of a palm, s ago, or cocoa nut tree, which appears to answer their purpose quite as well as the most expensive copper ones. Their manner of putting the sugar from the cooler, quite liquid and hot, into bastard moulds, as the refine is with us call their large earthen moulds, is, I think, a far preferable mode than, as in the West In dies, to allow the sugar to crystallized in the cooler, and put it into large hogs heads on the following morning. The Chinese make much less molasses, and the sugar has a larger and brighter grain, by their process. Two strikes are usually run into the cooler, when, on being stirred two or three times, it is allowed to crystallized, which it does in a very short time; and the next day but one, when quite cool, the cone s are reversed on a table, the cane stoppeds or corks are removed, a small quantity of water is poured into the vent, now open, to facilitate the separation, and, in a minute afterwards, the cone or mould is lifted up, leaving a perfect loaf of hard sugar, which is broken up, and carried and put in draining cases, under which are laid troughs, which convey the molasses into vessels disposed at their lower end to receive it. The Chinese are said to be a people without genius, and I am strongly inclined to that opinion ; but, instead of flights of fancy, or of the imagination, they have that which -works quite as well a great deal of shrewdness and observation, based on good sense; and we have much to learn from them. I shall be very happy to receive future numbers of your valuable reports, through the friend I have before indicated, and, indeed, as many papers on southern agriculture as you may wish to get rid of; for much of my time and attention are given to that subject. If I can be agreeable to you in any way, in this distant country, I pray you to indicate the manner, and command me. I think we have met formerly ; but time and distance, as they increase, obliterate much of our earlier recollections. I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant, J. Balesti   Of. Of on.

917MAPLE Sugara New Element. To the Editor of the Tribune :he are just through our annual sugar, season, and all feel satisfied. The crop is large, very large more than in any year for some time. Very farmer has enough, and many have made one, two, or three tons. Arrangements have been made to give more particular statistics of the amount. It is becoming of great importance to the State, and more interest is taken in improving the quality. But my object at this time is merely to call the attention of scientific men to the nature of a substance found in the sugar. The sugar makers have always noticed that a kind of grit settles in the sugar and molasses after it is made. This varies greatly in quantity in different years. The present year the quantity is are. When the sugar was manufactured chiefly in the woods, it was supposed to be ashes or dirt, deposited during the process of evaporationtbutthe quantity is the same when the sap is elaborated in the house, and cleansed with the greatest care. From a small quantity (perhaps 50 I is obtained nearly a will of this substance. When tasted with the sugar, it simply appears like sand; but upon dissolving the sugar, and repeatedly washing it with water, I obtained a substance nearly white, and with a very pungent, alkaline taste. The presence of ammonia in sugar is mentioned by Lie big and Johnston, in their works upon agricultural chemistry; but, if I understand their remarks upon the subject, they refer only to a gas which arises during the process of evaporation. But here is a tangible salt, and of sufficient quantity to be of some interest' Will some one, through your paper, give an account of the nature of the substance, and thus satisfy the curiosity of many of your readers, and perhaps add a new fact to the researches of science ?of Son To, Vermont, April, 1845. Maple Sugar. As most persons who have not informed themselves on the subject imagine that we are indebted to cane sugar for our main supply, and that male sugar is a petty neighborhood matter, not worth the figures employed to represent it, we propose to spend some space in stating the truth on this matter. We will exhibit, 1st, the amount produced; 2d, the proper way of manufacturing it; 3d, the proper treatment of the sugar tree groves. We shall confine our statistics to the most important northern and western States 1. New York produces annually -10 048 109 lbs. Ohio -663, 3863. Vermont -4 647, 9344. In diana -7 277 95 "5. Pennsylvania -2 657 55 "6. New Hampshire -a- -1 162, 3687. Virginia -154 1835 "9 18 8. Kentucky -137 78$ 5 lbs. Michigan -1 297 84 "total of nine States -22464799Residue thus : Add for Paine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, Tennessee, I illinois, I own, Missouri, and Wisconsin -20 30, 85324,495,652 I is. Something should be subtracted for be et root and corns talk sugar. But on the other hand, the statistics are so much below the truth on map le sugar, that the deficiency may be set off against be et root 'and corns talk sugar. That the figures do not more than represent the amount of map le sugar produced in these States, may be presumed from one case. I indiana is set down at 3,727,795 lbs; but in the four counties of Washington, Patrick, Money, and Harrison, no account seems to have been taken of this article. In Marion county, four of the first sugar making townships, Warren, Lawrence, Centre, and Franklin, are not reckoned. If we suppose these four townships to average as much as the others in Marion county, they produced 77,648 lbs; and instead of putting Marion county down at 97,064 lbs, it should be 174,712 lbs. It is apparent, from this case, that in In diana the estimate is far below the truth; and if it is half as much so in the other eight States enumerated* then 22,464,799 lbs. is not more than a fair expression of the map le sugar alone. Louisiana is the first sugar growing State in the Union. Her produce, by the statistics of 1840, was 119,947,720, or nearly 120,000,000 lbs. The States of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida, together, add only 645,281 lbs. more. Lane sugar in the United States -120593001 I is. Table sugar in the United States -244 95 652 "thus about one-sixth of the sugar made annually in the United States is made from the map le tree t It is to be remembered, too, that in You* Dr. J. C. Jackson puts Vermont at 6,000,000 lbs. per annum, while the census only gives about 4,000,000.t The data of these calculations, it must be confessed, are very uncertain; and conclusions drawn from them as to the relative amounts of sugar produced in different States are to be regarded, at the very best, as problematical. We extract the following remarks from an article in the Western Literary Journal, from the pen of Charles List, an able statistical writer: " It is not my purpose to go into an extended notice of the errors in the statistics connected, with the census of 1840. A few examples will serve to show their character and extent. In the article of hemp, Ohio is stated to produce 9,080 tons, and In diana 8,605 to as, either equal nearly to the product of Kentucky, which is reported at 9,992 tons, and almost equal, when united, to Missouri, to which 18,010 tons are given as the aggregate. Virginia is stated to raise 25 594 tons, almost equal to both Kentucky and Missouri, which are given as above at 28,002tons. Now the indisputable fact is, that Kentucky and Missouri produce more hemp than all the rest of the United States, and ten times as much as either Ohio, In diana, or Virginia, which three States are made to raise 50 per cent up more than those two great hemp producing States." The sugar of Louisiana is given at 119,947,720 lbs, equal to 120,000 hads; 160 per cent more than has been published in New Orleans as the highest product of the five consecutive years, including and preceding 1840.( But what is this to the wholesale figure dealing which returns 3,160,949 tons of hay as the product of New York for that article a quantity sufficient to winter all the horses and mules in the United States !other errors of great magnitude might be pointed out; such as making the tobacco product of Virginia 11,000 hads, when her inspection records show 55,000 hads. thrown into market as the. 919isiana it is the staple, while at the north map le sugar has never been manufactured with any considerable skill, or regarded as a regular crop, but only a temporary device of economy. Now it only needs to be understood that map le sugar may be made so as to have the flavor of the best cane sugar, and that it may, at a trifling expense, be refined to white sugar, and the manufacture of it will become more general, more skilful, and may, in a little time, entirely supersede the necessity of importing cane sugar. In diana stands fourth in the rank of map le sugar making States. Her annual product is at least four million pounds, which, at 6 cents a pound, amounts to 8160,000 per annum. A little exertion would quickly run up the annual value of our home made sugar to half a million of dollars. Table sugar now only brings about two thirds the price of New Orleans. The fault is in the manufacturing of it. The sac charing principle of the cane and tree are exactly the same. If the same care were employed in their manufacture, they would be indistinguishable, and map le sugar would be as sale able as New Orleans, and, if afforded at a less price, might supplants it in the market. The average quantity of sugar consumed in England by each individual is about 30 lbs. per annum. Marion county contains about 20,000 inhabitants. At 30 lbs. per head, the sugar consumed annually is not less than 600,000 lbs, and for the whole State24000000 lbs, reckoning the population at 800,000. There is annually produced in this county about 175,000 lbs. of sugar; leaving about 42 5000 lbs. to be purchased, which, at an average of five cents per lb amounts for this single county to                            $21,250, a sum well worth saving, and, by a little attention to the making of domestic sugar, very easily saved. I T. Maple Sugar Maki 1. Greater care must be taken in collecting the sap. Old and half delayed wooden troughs, with a liberal infusion of leaves, dirt, &c, impart great impurity to the water. Pain water, delayed vegetable matter, &c add chemical ingredients to the sap, is troublesome to extract, and injuries the quality if not removed. The expense of clean vessels may be a little more, but with care it could be more than made up in the quality of the sugar. Any are now using earthen c rocks. These are cheap, easily cleaned, and every way desirable, with the single exception of break age. But if wooden troughs are used, let them be kept scrupulously clean 2. The kettles should be scoured thoroughly before use, and kept constantly clean. If rusty, or foul, or coated with burnt sugar, neither the color nor flavor can be perfect. Vinegar and sand have been used by experienced sugar makers to scour the kettles with. It is best to have at least three to a range. All vegetable juices contain acids, and acids resist the process of crystallizationcrop of that year. Who believes that 12,233 lbs. of pitch, resin, and turpentine, or the tenth part of that quantity, were manufactured in Louisiana in 1840, or that New York produced10093991 I is. of map le sugar in a single year, or twenty such statements equally absurd, which     might take from the returns or. List will find, in the appendix to Dr. Jacksons Final Report on the Geology of Newhampshire, a statement that Vermont makes 6,000,000 lbs. of sugar annually. If this be so, we may, without extravagance, suppose that New York reaches 10,000,000 lbs. To far as we have collateral means of judging, the amount of map le sun ar is under stated in the census of 1840.920 for. J. C. Jackson* directs one measured ounce (one-fourth of a will) of pure lime water to be added to every gallon of sap. This neutralises the acid, and not only facilitates the granulation, but gives sugar in a free state, now too generally acid and deliquescent, besides being charged with salts of the oxide of iron, in so much that it ordinarily strikes a black color with tea. The process of making a pure white sugar is simple and un expensive. The lime added to the sap, combining with the peculiar acid of the map le, forms a neutral salt; this salt is found to be easily so ruble in alcohol. Dr. Jackson recommends the following process : Procure sheet iron cones, with an aperture at the small end or apex; let it be coated with white lead and boiled linseed oil, and thoroughly dried, so that no part can come off. [he do not know why earthen cones, un glazed and painted, would not answer equally well, besides being much cheaper] Met the sugar be put into these cones, stopping the whole in the lower end until it in entirely cool. When remove the stopped, and pour upon the base a ,quantity of strong whiskey or fourth proof rum ;t allow this to felt rate through until the sugar is white. When the loaf is dried it will be pure white sugar, with the exception of the alcohol. To get rid of this, dissolve the sugar in pure boiling hot water, and let it e vapor ate until it is dense enough to crystallized. When put it again into the cone moulds and let it hard en. The dribblets which come away from the cone while the whiskey is draining may be used for making vinegar. It is sometimes the case that whiskey would, if freely used in a sugar camp, go off in a wrong direction, benefiting neither the sugar nor the sugar maker. I f, on this account, any peter another mode, let them make a saturated solution of loaf sugar, and pour it, in place of the whiskey, upon the base of the cones. Although the sugar will not be quite as white, the drainings will form an excellent molasses, whereas the drainings by the former method are good only for vinegar. I I . Care Of Sugar Orchards. It is grievous to witness the waste committed upon valuable groves of sugar trees. If the special object was to destroy them, it could hardly be better reached than by the methods now employed. The holes are carelessly made, and often the abominable practice is seen of cutting channels in the tree with an axe. The man who will murder his trees in this tomahawk and scalping knife manner, is just the man that ,is op meant when he made the fable of a fellow who killed his goose to get at once all the golden eggs. With good care, and allowing them occasionally a year of rest, a sugar grove may last for centuries 1. As soon as possible get your sugar grove laid down to grass, clear out under brush, thin out timber and useless trees. Trees in open land make about six pounds of sugar, and forest trees only about four pounds, to the season. As the map le is peculiarly rich in potash, (four fifths of potash exported is made from sugar map le) it is evident that it requires* Appendix to Final Report on the Geology and Mineralogy of New Hampshire, page 361. This admirable report is an able exposition of the benefit of public Tale surveys. If those who drink whiskey would pour it on the sugar in the refining cones, instead of upon sugar in tumblers, it would refine them as much as it does the sugar, performing two valuable processes at once. a. 921 that substance in the soil. Upon this account we should advise a liberal use of wood ashes upon the soil of sugar groves 2. Tapping trees Two taps are usually enough never more than three; for though as many as 24 have been inserted at once without killing the tree, regard ought to be had to the use of the tree through a long series of years. At first, bore about two inches ; after ten or twelve days remove the tap, and go one or two inches deeper. By this method more sap will be obtained than by going down to the colored wood at first. I state, upon the authority of Am. Ri pure, a Shake r, of Banter bury, N. H., that about 7 lbs. of sugar may be made from a barrel of 20 gallons, ar 4 lbs. the tree for forest trees; and two men and one boy will tend a thousand trees, making 4,000 lbs. of sugar 3. We would recommend the setting of pasture lands and roadsides of the farm with sugar map le trees. Their growth is rapid, and no tree combined more valuable properties. It is a beautiful shade tree; it is excellent for fuel; it is much used for manufacturing purposes; its ashes are valuable for potash, and its sap is rich in sugar. There are 27 species of the map le known; '1 of them are indigenous to this continent. All of these have a sac charing sap, but only two to a degree sufficient for practical purposes, viz : ace r saccharinum, or the common sugar map le, and ace r fig rum, or the black sugar map le. The sap of these contains about half as much sugar as the juice of the sugar cane. One gallon of pasture map le sap contains, on an average, 3,451 grains of sugar; and one gallon of cane juice, (in Jamaica) on an average, yields 7,000 grains of sugar. But the cane is subject to the necessity of annual and careful cultivation, and its manufacture is comparatively expensive and difficult. Whereas the map le is a permanent tree; requires no cultivation ; may be raised on the borders of farms without taking up ground, and its sap is easily convertible into sugar, and, if carefully made, into sugar as good as cane sugar can be. Add to the above considerations that the sugar making period with us is a time of comparative leisure with the farmer, and the motives for attention to this subject of domestic sugar making seem to be complete. From the Culivator. Maki Of Sugar From Cornstalks. A short time since, I met with Mr. Adamss account of his experiment in manufacturing corns talk sugar, undertaken from the inducements offered by the New York State Agricultural Society, and for which they awarded a him a premium of one hundred dollars. I was much interested in its perusal, as it strongly reminded me of the difficulties and discouragement s experienced in the earlier stages of the same inquiry, when experiment was the only available source of knowledge to which we could turn for assistance in our exertions. As I have pursued this subject with unabated confidence and reasonable success, since its commencement, my experience may perhaps be useful to Mr. Adams and others engaged in perfecting this important and interesting manufacture. Before proceeding further, I must find a little fault with your agricultu92
ral society. I to premium was offered for the "maximum quantity of sugar made from an acre of northern corn." It appears to me that the great object to attain is a plan by which sugar may be made profit ably. It is very possible to expend more labor in the manufacture than the article would be worth; such a plan would of course be worthless practically, whatever might be the amount produced. Secondly, in planting corn for sugar, I should prefer seed that had ripened in a more southern latitude, as less liable to run to ear early in the season. In raising this crop, the great end to secure is the perfect growth of the plant in every particular, except in the formation of its seed. To plan ever yet tried has succeeded completely in effecting this object. Those s talks which, from some cause yet unknown, have shown no disposition to form grain, are always far more juice, and yield a much larger quantity of sugar than those from which the ear has been removed. As soon as this hitherto accidental condition of the plant is brought, by persevering efforts, within our control, I confidently expect that the corns talk will not merely rival but exceed the sugar cane in the amount of sac charing matter it will yield. The past season, a small lot of corn was planted in rows, three feet apart, and about six inches asunder in the row. As soon as the tassels appeared they were pulled out. The result of this experiment was encouraging, but not entirely satisfactory ; another lot of corn, growing within one hundred yards, was allowed to tassel, and this perhaps caused the partial failure. In order to try this plan fairly, the corn should be grown distant from any other, and the tassels pulled out before any of their pollen has been shed. Very thick planting, in order to prevent hearing, is objectionable, as it renders the crop more liable to be prostrated by storms; and the s talks being small, the labor of handling them is increased : they should not be less than one inch in diameter, or about the size of broom handles; the distances in planting, in order to produce this size, will vary according to the quality of the soil. Whatever plan is adopted to prevent hearing, it must be attended to, or the sugar of the stalk will be expended in the formation of grain. When the corn is ripe which will happen about the usual time of cutting corn cut off the tops at the point where the ear generally forms the, leaves on the stalk below this are few in number and mostly dead they may be sufficiently removed by simply passing the knife from top to bottom on each side of the stalk. By pursuing this plan, the formidable labor of stripping the s talks, which has been complained of, is greatly lessened, and the whole business put in a practicable shape. The method of curing " tops and blades" is so well understood by farmers, that nothing need be said about it here. Experience has proved that the extras of this crop the tops, blades, crushed s talks, &care worth more, when properly secured, than the whole labor required ingrowing and manufacturing, provided this labor is economized in the way pointed out. In the list of plants cultivated for forage, there is not in the whole world ai a other one that is equal to this in the amount of nutriment which it contains. It is well worth cultivating for the fodder alone; the s talks therefore cost nothing. Very farmer may see, from this, (if he chooses) how to steer clear from his grocer y bill. The mill for grinding, best suited for the farmer, is a simple one, and need not cost more than                                                                     $10. The boiling apparatus should consist, first, of two defeating kettles ;S
23they may be of cast iron, and capable of holding as much juice as the mill will press out in fifteen or twenty minutes; these kettles must be placed so that a quick and strong fire can be made under them, and so arranged that they can be emptied at a moments warning. Second : two or three evaporating pans; a single sheet of Russia iron, bent up six inches at the sides and ends, and riveted, makes an excellent pan of this description. Third : two copper or tin pans for finishing; these should be flat bottomed, six inches deep, and so arranged that they can be removed from the fire instantly when the charge is finished. They should never have much over two inches in depth of sir up placed in them at one time, and should each be of such a size that a charge of three or four gallons will not fill it deeper than this. The difficulty of manufacturing sugar to the best advantage has always been considerable. This has grown out of the foreign substances always found connected with it in the juices of plants. Sugar is one of the most easily de composed substances in nature. The juice of a plant may be very rich in sugar, yet, when slowly elaborated, the residue will not show a single trace of sac charing. In the process of vegetation, as the plant approaches maturity, sugar is changed into starch. In the germination of the seed a contrary change occurs, and starch is converted into sugar. I took a portion of sprouted corn and macerated it in water until the sugar was extracted; the liquid then strikingly resembled, both in taste and smell, the juice of corns talk after it had been clarifyed; it was then set toe vapor ate over a slow fire; it gradually grew darker in color, and in a short time it appeared very much like be et juice. Before the evaporation was finished every particle of sugar had disappeared, and, from being sweet and pleasant to the taste, it had become black, bitter, and nausea us. The same experiment was repeated under the same circumstances, except that a small portion of starch was added to the water; in this case the sugar was not de composed, but retained its distinctive qualities throughout evaporation. The chemical reasons for this it is needless now to discuss; the simple fact, and its application, are sufficient for our purpose. Heat flour consists principally of starch, and was used with good success, though perhaps pure starch would be better. One pint of flour was mixed with two gallons of skin milk, and one pint of this mixture was added to thirty gallons of juice. These proportions are not given as best, for many more experiments will be necessary before they can be determined accurately. As the juice comes from the mill, it should run into a receiver which will hold just enough to fill one of the defeating kettles; while in this receiver the mixture of flour and milk, and also the necessary quantity of lime water, must be added and well stirred in. It is then poured at once into the defeating kettle and heat applied; a very firm thick s cum is by this means separated, and the juice becomes clear; it is next run through a flannel s trainer into one of the evaporating pans, and the boiling kept up briskly. Take a shovel full of red hot coals from the furnace, and, after blowing the ashes off, throw them into the pan; as you put in more juice, add more coal; as the pan becomes filled with coal, take out that which has been in longest. From this pan the juice is run in succession through the others, (straining it when convenient) until it is finished. Of. Webb. Of Lmi Ngton, Del, March 14, 1845.924 a. From the Cultivator. Cornstalk Sugar And Molasses, Of. Tucker : An opportunity offering, I am induced to send you samples of sugar and molasses from the juice of corns talks. It is now about seven weeks since this was pressed and boiled. You will perceive that granulation and drainage are tolerably perfect. 6 88 pounds of the crystal liable sir up was made from one measured acre; and, had it not been for some loss sustained at the first boiling, I believe the amount would have been 700 pounds. Over 100 pounds per day were made at four successive boilings. I believe it is in the power of any farmer to make abundance of sugar and molasses for his own use. The apparatus is simple, and within the reach of almost every one; all that is needed is a mill to crush the stalk sand express the juice, and three common iron kettles, set in a brick arch, for boiling. Either is there any mystery or difficulty in the process but what a little experience would enable any one to overcome. The principal things to be attended to in the boiling are, to be careful to skin, and get the juice well clarifyed before it comes to a boil; some milk and flour, as recommended by Mr. Ebb in your July number for 1845, facilitate s this very much. Some clear lime water is also necessary. We have found that using the cream of lime, or the lime mixed up in the water, prevents the fecculent particles from coming to the surface, and makes it necessary to strain, and occasions much trouble and loss; on the contrary, the clear lime water does not have this effect. It is also necessary to boil as rapidly as possible; the quality of the article and the crystal ligation depend altogether on this; and, lastly, it is necessary to know when it is boiled sufficiently to grand late. We have this year boiled without a thermometer, and found no difficulty, by attending to the directions given in statements formerly published and re published in the reports of the Commissioner of Patents. One of my neighbors has erected a mill, &c, and is at this time engaged in boiling. I believe he will fail to make sugar, but is making a satisfactory article in the way of molasses, and I have no doubt will succeed another year. Hours respectfully, John Beal. Netw Harmony, I A., October 14, 1845. New Harmony, I A., December 22, 1845. Dear Of  R : Hours of the D instant reached me by the last mail. I cheerfully comply with your request to furnish you with a statement of myth is years experiment in the growth and manufacture of corns talk sugar also, a sample of the sugar. This years experiment has been still more successful than the last in the quantity per acre, and, I believe, some little improvement in the quality. I planted a measured acre, _d the yield was 6 88 pounds of the crystal liable sir up; and had it not been for some loss sustained at the commencement in trying some new experiments that were unsuccessful, it would have reached 700 pounds. The continued culture of corn for this purpose is now a settled point with me, being well satisfied that it is here equally profitable with anything else grown in general. I say in general, for there may be some years when particular articles may be an exception. a. 925,I n consequence of this opinion, I endeavored, in my last communication to the late Commissioner t: i institute a comparison as to the expense of raising corn and sugar. From some errors, either typographical or original, that statement was altogether incorrect, which 1 will endeavor to correct in the present communication, although, owing to the present high price of corn, it will not contrast so favorably for the sugar. I think it is a fair estimate to value this sir up at 5 cents per pound, seeing that sugar ranges here from 8 to 12 cents, and molasses from 40 to 50 cents per gallon. The cultivation of each, up to the time of pulling of the ears, is the same; the pulling of the ears I offset by the pulling of the corn 6 88 pounds of sir up, at 5 cents -a-                $34.40,Deduct, for blazing, cutting, and getting s talks to mill 1 man, 8 days, at 50 cents per day -a-           $4.00Horse, hauling the same 2 days, at 25 cents per day -50 Grinding, man and horse 8 days, at 75 cents per day -6 00 Boiling, 8 days, at 50 cents per day -4 00 duel -00 interest and repairs on fixtures -3 oo 19 50 met value of sir up -14 90%Corn, 50 bushels, at 25 cents per bushel -12 50Deduct for hushing -1 00 met value of corn -11 50 Balance in favor of sugar -a-               $3.40By a reference to the statement of Mr. Tillotson, in the report of the Commissioner for 1843, it will be seen how much the expense may be reduced on a large scale. It will also be seen by Mr. Is statement that his product was 200 gallons of the sir up for the 4 acres, or 50 gallons per acre. By dividing 88 by 12 pounds, (the weight of a gallon of sir up) it will be seen that my yield was over 57 gallons per acre. I am by no means satisfied with the drainage. The molasses, though clear, and not so high colored as ordinary molasses, is still much thicker, and will not flow freely from the sugar. It generally comes cool weather within a few weeks after the boiling; this is much against the drainage. If it could be kept in a temperature of from 70 to 80 degrees, I think the process would be much accelerated. Small quantity (about 6 or 7 gallons) was put into a tapering vessel by itself ; this was drained in a few weeks, and during the continuance of the warm weather, and the sugar was of better quality than usual. The sugar sent you was from this drainage, but from the bottom of the vessel therefore, not as fair as the upper& portion. Some sugar and molasses have been sent to the editor of the Albany Cultivator, some notice of which has, probably been given in the December number of that excellent periodical. Respectfully yours, John Beal. Ll on. Edmund Burke926 a. Appendi X No. 14. From the Cultivator. Culture Of Carrots And Oni Ons. Of. Edi Tor : Having had good success in raising carrots, onions, &c have had a desire to make my mode of raising such vegetables public, a sit differs in some respects from the modes usually practised in this country. But when I considered I was not well skilled in writing articles for publication, I was led to hesitate, until I reflected that language the vehicle by which our ideas are communicated may be compared to the carriage which conveys the produce of the farmer to market; and when I remembered that it matters little whether the carriage is constructed with two, three, four, or even five wheels, so long as the produce is easily, expeditiously, and safely conveyed, it gave me some more confidence. And then, again, I received additional encouragement by some remarks of a correspondent of the Albany Cultivator, who, after speaking of the reading of agricultural papers, says: "his reading gives an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the practical experience of farmers. It is much to be desired that more of this class of farmers could be induced to give their views. There is too frequently a reluctance to writing. This reluctance should be overcome. It is not expected that plain farmers should always frame sentences in the style of literary writers, nor is this necessary give us the facts in an intelligible manner." And so I am encouraged to proceed. And to commence, I will state the amount of carrots and onions obtained, and then some of the means used to obtain so large crops. But, before proceeding, I will remark that I have no doubt that in several respects my mode of management may be improved upon. Of carrots, I had at the rate of twelve hundred and nine and a half bushels to the acre, large measure, and of onions six hundred and thirty bushels. The land on which these crops grew being of a full middling quality as to richness was ploughed early in the spring, at a time when the ground was in a sufficiently dry* state to pulverize. It was then harrowed several times over; then ploughed a second time, in such a manner as to have not reading of the team upon it. A row of boards to stand upon while sowing the seed was laid down on one side of the ground about to be sowed. With a common hay rake, six or seven feet in breadth was soon made sufficiently level to sow. A line, fastened to two stakes, was stretched to mark the place where the first row was to be sowed. When, with a common garden he, a place near one inch deep was made for the <a name="seeds114"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. The onion <a name="seeds115"><mark>seeds</mark></a> were then sowed very evenly and expeditiously, with a contrivance which I will hereafter describe, and covered with the he. Thexthe line was moved fifteen inches to mark out the place for the second row. The boards were then moved over the row that had been sowed, so that* As there is often too much moisture in land to plough it early in the spring, and as carrots, onions, and par ships need to be sowed early, it would doubtless, in many cases, be well to ridge the land up i a the fall. a. 27 the second row could be dug out, sowed, and covered, as was the first. The line was then moved to mark the third row, and the boards were also moved over the second one, which was already sowed. In this manner I proceeded until the whole was finished and the ground presented a beautiful le el and mellow appearance, as if a light roller had passed over it, without having the appearance of being trodden down, as is often the case where men walk upon the ground. The carrots were sowed in much the same manner as the onions, with the exception that eighteen inches space was allowed for the rows, instead of fifteen. A small quantity of plaster was sowed with the <a name="seeds116"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. When the carrots and onions were up sufficiently high to he, I commenced at one end of the rows, and hold in as far as I could conveniently reach. Two pieces of board, each near three feet long and ten inches wide, were placed in two of the rows I had commenced hoping, and which     wished to finish. I then stepped on one of the pieces of board, and he don as far as I could conveniently reach; then stepped on the other board in the adjoining row, and hold an equal distance in that row. When, with my he placed against a nail fastened near one end of the board, I moved the board I had just left, about two feet in advance; then stepped on it, and moved the other board in like manner. When I hold two feet ahead, moved my boards again, and so proceeded on to the ends of the rows. This process, although not quite as expeditions as without boards, not only left the ground in a very mellow state, but many of the fine lumps were broken which, by the common method of hoping, would not have been. The land presented, after this process, the appearance of having had a roller passed over it, and I think it was better fitted to withstand a drought than it would have been if left in a rough state. The onions were hold three times, and at each time when the ground was in a sufficiently dry state to pulse rise. The carrots were hold in much the same manner as the onions, and, in addition, the ground was loosened up between the rows with a dung fork, just before the tops became so large as to prevent such an operation. The earth was not heaved up with the fork, as is commonly done in preparing beds for sowing, but it was barely loosened by running down the fork and giving it a cry. Some of your readers will perhaps think I am particular in describing my mode of procedure; and to such, if any there are, I would say, it was by attending to the small matters as well as the large, that, under Providence, I was enabled to realize so large a result. The implement I have referred to for sowing the <a name="seeds117"><mark>seeds</mark></a> I will now endeavor to describe. The bottom of an old fashioned coffeepot was knocked out* The pyramid al shaped top was soldered on fast. A hole near one third of an inch in diameter was made in the extreme end of the top for the <a name="seeds118"><mark>seeds</mark></a> to run through. The whole was then inverted, and a handle near two feet long was nailed to one side to hold it by when in use. The <a name="seeds119"><mark>seeds</mark></a> about to be sowed were thoroughly mixed with sand that was dry, and had been sifted to free it from lumps, small sticks, &c. In account of its simplicity and cheapness, on account of the even and sure manner in which it distributes the <a name="seeds120"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, and on account of its being well adapted for sowing short rows as well as long ones, it is well calculated for extensive use* Wythe by, I do not use coffee, as I deem it (unless in sickness) an unnecessary, and, to many, a hurt full drink 9 28 a. I will also describe a simple, cheap, and useful instrument that I used to dig my carrots and par ships. It was made out of a piece of large sized wagon tire about fifteen inches in length. One end was sharpened, and the other slit down near three and half inches. The part on one side the slit was left straight, to he inserted in the handle. The part on the other side was turned down horizontally, to place the foot upon when the instrument was in use. With one of these implements a man will dig, in a given time, one quarter more of par ships or carrots than he could with a common spade. S. S. G. Sandi Ake, December, 1845. Large Crop Of Vegetables.

In its wild or natural state, the cranlbrry is found in wet situations in boggy grounds, in damp sandy lands, and on the low margins of ponds and streams. It will live and grow in comparatively dry soils; but it will not bear fruit without its roots are immersed in water at all seasons of the year. Soil and situation The first object of the cultivate or should be to select the ground for his cranberry yard. Very wet situation is riot suitable. The soil must either be sand, mud, pe at, or a mixture of these. There must be an abundant supply of water at all seasons of the year. If the ground is so situated that it can be flooded during the winter and spring, it is better; but it is not indispensable to success. The ground must be saturated with water, either from springs, running streams, or the draining from higher land. In the low, sandy margins of ponds the water is not much affected by the season; a sufficient supply of moisture will ascend, because the little spaces between the grains of sand act as so many capillary toes for the ascent of the water; but when the margin is compact earth or unmixed pe at, the dampness will not, on that principle, rise to the surface. In a selection of a situation for his cranberry yard, the cultivate or must observe first, whether the soil is of a loose, porous character, easy per me able to water; and, second, whether there will be an abundant supply of water in the dries t seasons. If either of these two requisites is wanting, it will be useless for him to attempt the cultivation of the cranberry.  Planting and culture- In boggy grounds it is advisable to retain the tops of, and cover the surface with beach sand, if it can be easily procured; if not, with any sand that does not contain loam or surface soil. Until recently, the common method of setting out the vines was, after the ,bog was covered with sand, it was marked off in parallel rows, like a field of corn, and sons of vines set from three to four feet apart each way. The usual method now is, to set in drills about two feet apart. The vines are separated, and only two or three upright s talks are set together, and are placed from six to twelve inches apart, length wise of the drill. In wet and barren sandy land the expense of setting out the vines is much less than on dogs. Cuttings from any part of the stem will strike root, and may be used where it is difficult or expensive to procure a sufficient quantity with roots there vines cannot be procured, cranberries may sown. It is not certain but that sowing will ultimately prove to be the cheapest and most expeditions method. We know of but one instance where cranberries were sown. That experiment was successful, and the ground is now thickly set with vines. The best time for setting vines we are unable to state. The commonpActice has been to set them at any time, when the wear would admit, S- ;930 from November to March. The spring we should think was preferable for sowing. During the first season after they are set, vines frequently put forth numerous runners, four or five feet long. The next year the runners put forth upright bearing stems, which produce cranberries on the third year. The vines do not usually become so thick set as to cover the ground before the fifth year. Manure is worse than useless, and any vegetable or animal matter that will cause ferment at ion is injurious. As a general rule, the more barren the surface soil, the better is it adapted to the growth of the cranberry. The growth of the grasses in such situations will be feeble, while the cranberry, obtaining its sustenance mainly from water and the atmosphere, grows luxuriantly, and will ultimately kill out the grasses and obtain complete possession of the soil. During the first three years, it is better to pull out the grasses than to wait for the cranberry vines to overcome them. Bushes must be carefully removed as fast as they spring up, because, if suffered to grow, they would do great injury. To other attention is necessary, excepting that good fences must be maintained around the vines to prevent the depredations of sebaceous animals. Profitsone bushel of cranberries to the square rod may be considered a good crop from vines that have been set five years, though we could cite particular instances in which three and four bushels have been gathered. Raising cranberries is like every other business in life: if a man judges rightly, is prudent and industrious, he will commonly succeed; but if he depends more on good luck than on good management, in nine cases out of ten he will fail. The cranberry fever is now running high among us, and almost every man you meet exhibits some symptoms of the disease. That fortunes are suddenly to be made by all who embark in this business, we do not believe; but that large profits can be obtained from vines set in good situations, such as are above described, there is no doubt. The experiments of Captain Henry All, Hiram Of all, and Peter All, of Tennis, of Captain Edward B. Wallet t and Edward That cher, of this town, and many others that could be named, prove that the raising of cranberries, in good situations, is a profitable business. We know that some of the opinions which we have given in this article will military against the theories of a few of our friends; but we cannot help it. We have carefully examined almost every cranberry bog and yard in the county, and have carefully compared the information thus obtained, and we know that our opinions are corroborated and supported by all who have had the largest experience in the business. We do not wish to discourage any from planting vines: far from it. We say, go ahead. All we wish is, to discourage men from running blindfold into a business respecting which all the necessary information can be so easily and readily obtained. New York Farmersclub. We extract the following from a conversation at the meeting of the Club, as reported in the New York Farmer and Mechanicgen. Of     handle re present to the Club cranberry plants, (some with their. 931 great crop of fruit on) at the request of Mr. Sullivan Rates, of Telling ham, Massachusetts. A few years ago he first exhibited this fruit, produced by his new method transplanting from low grounds to high. His success has been complete: he has gathered from one acre, about 400 bushels ofcranberries in a season! He plants them, in drills, 20 inches apart; in hills, 7 inches. The soil must be such an one as does not bake. Chaiirmani took from swamps on Men. Johnsons place some cranberry plants, and planted them on ground 80 or 100 feet above the swamp they thrived, and their fruit was so close together that one could hardly put a finger in without touching the cranberries. It is a highly profitable crop. I am of opinion that five hundred dollars might be obtained for a full crop of one acre. Men. Chandlermr.

For the North Carolina War. aBRI Nkxleyvi Lle, Hali   Fax To, N. C. Dear Of  R: In your first number of the North Carolina Farmer, I see you publish an extract from the American Agriculturists, on the culture of the vine and wine making, &c. While according due merit to that piece, as to many particulars, and while allowing that, as to kind of grapes and mode of making wine, they may do in northern latitudes of our country, I am bold to a ver that the system, as such, will not do south, for I have experimented on it without success; and I have known a number of others likewise to have failed, so far as that system is concerned. For instance, the     s abel la grapes, after a few years' culture in our soil and climate, will rot in the vine, in a majority of seasons, in spite of remedies; and the quantity of sugar will not do to save the wine in our hot climate. Either willelrmentation, with but straining, generally succeed. But, without further remarks on particulars at present, I send you the c New York Farmer and Mechanics" in which my uniformly successful process of wine making, with sugar, is detailed. I would add, that if brandy is added, (as I make a part of my wine therewith) a fourth of good spirits is not too much to insure the safety of the line, as all as to give it a good body, seeing American grapes are not asaccharine as European. I need, if vine yard business is pressed in our State, the best use of spirits, (apart from medicine direct) I consider, is to in ix it with grape juice for wines, and thus render its qualities not of the same fiery, intoxicating nature. As to kind of vines, I will communicate again for your valuable periodical, if you think best to insert this and the extract named. In the mean time, yours, with all due respect, Of  Dney Weller. From the Farmer and Mechanics, Of Neyards And Temperate Wse Of Of Nes. Messrs. Edi Tors: Through a desire of being humbly instrumental in promoting the temperance cause of our country, by discouraging the use of ardent spirits, I was induced to undertake the vine yard business as an incidental agricultural employment, on my plantation, in this part of Northcarolina. To far as tried, the experiment has answered my expectation for, the substitution of unequivocal ly pure and health full American wines, I have found, answers all the medicinal purposes of an alcoholic stimulant, where such is required to be used, without the in flaming ad insidious use of ardent spirits. My wines in this region are now preferred by many, as a family medicine and for communion occasions, to those of foreign countries, of doubtful purity; and we find that the wines mentioned as blessings in the Holy Scriptures were those of Palestine, not exotic. His. 93 affords a good hint for Americans no longer to expend millions for foreign wines, when our own soil and management are capable of as good, if not better. I need, from the general principle that Providence, in the way of food and medicine, generally supplies, of spontaneous growth, every region of the world most suitable for the inhabitants of such region, we might argue that the very luxuriant growth of the vine in most pars of our country indicated it to be wrong for us to depend on the east for grape es vines, or wine. He that as it may, I may be permitted to state and that from the best information, as I think, on the subject, as well as from twenty years of experience that this part of our country is as well calculated, in soil and climate, for vineyards and wine making, as any part dfEurope. According to the best accredited information, I have made, I heel reason to believe, more wine from an acre, or at rates of more, than has been made in France, or other wine making countries of Europe. And, am not alone in considering the wine from my vineyards as good as the foreign; fr, not only in this region I have this testimony fro i reliable sources, but from different parts of the country whither I have sent m wines, both north and south. For instance, I lately had a letter from a gentleman in Watched, Mississippi, saying that my wine was highly approved by gentle r rien there. I have exceeded my expectation not only in quality but quantity of wines from my vine yard, aid in seeing others em barking in the vine yard cause, and therefore look forward to the time when our country generally may have her supplies of wines at home used, generally, in lieu of ardent spirits. by enlarging war r after year, I have now about six acres of vine yard; some vines small yet, but a portiononcanopies, or one continued spread of branches and foliage above and all completely clear beneath, six or eight feet high, except the posts to support the scaffolding. From former yield and ratio of increase, I calculate on upwards of forty barrels of wine the coming vantage. The severe frost on the 8th of April last did not injure my prospects of a grape crop; though most all peaches, pears, and apples, and other fruit were destroyed. As North Carolina ex celled, according to the last governmental census, in the agricultural product of wine, and as I have reason to believe mine is the most productive vine yard in the State, I hope it will not be deemed presumptuous for me to give to the public, through your columns, a uniformly successful mode with me in making a good, well keeping, stared vine. I say sugared, because (a fact owing perhaps to the very luxuriant growth and abundant productive ness of vines in our country) the juice is not so sac charing as in Europe, and the weather is also warmer, so that some ingredient has to be added generally to insure the keeping of the wine. A safe quantity of sugar is two pounds to the gallon, but more or less according to the kind of grapes, and their ripe ness when gathered. The following is an outline of the process 1. The grapes, gathered and cleaned of all but sound and ripe ones, are ma shed, with us, by a machine of two rollers, turned by handle s 2. The mass is then folded in a sheet, within a crib, under a press, and the juice extracted, in the same manner as cider 3. Over a tub, and on a frame, are placed several folds of woolen blanket, (to be washed or renewed when imperious by sediment) through which the juice is measurable purified by straining, as it were, into the vessel. -4. Add immediately two pounds or more of sugar per gallon. If want 9 34 king a very fine costly wine, take the best double refined loaf sugar, beat up. But the common brown will do for a very good wine, of less delicate flavor 5. In to a clean wine case, new or second hand, fungated with a sulphur match, put your juice thus prepared, and no further process is needed after putting away your case, banged up, into a cool place or a cellar. The wine may be left on the lees, to be drawn off for use when wanted, by a s pilot, so high as to be fairly above the lees or settlings; or, without any artificial firing, it may be racked off the following fall or winter, when a gallon or more of settlings from moderate (because strained as above stated, and thus kept from running into the ace to us state by too violent) ferment at ion will be found. My Scuppernong, so much commended abroad, (as by members of the American I institute, according to the statement of For. Boswell) is made precisely as above stated, with the double refined sugar. But, to make a dark red wine of colored grapes, after washing I put the mass into an open headed case, covered with a blanket, and let it ferment till the skins, &c, float on the surface, and draw off that underneath by as pilot near the bottom of the case; strain it as above stated, and then put in, the sugar, and turn it into the case, and the after treatment is as that stated before of the wine not fermented with the skins, &c. If sugar enough be added of good quality, and strained as just stated, there is no danger of the wine running into the ace to us ferment at ion. A few words as to the temperate use of wine, and I close this communication, now longer than intended when I began it. The Scripture, properly understood, I consider the true criterion of the proper use or the abuse of any blessing of Heaven; that is, of temperance or intemperance. The express and implied direction to Timothy, as to wine, may be viewed as a very fair general exposition of the Bible doctrine on the subject. Timothy was to use a little wine for his stomachs sake and infirmityes. Now, a fair implication is, that if his stomach or infirmityes had not required it, it would not have been his duty to have had recourse to wine a tall. And a fair inference therefrom, and that which accords with the strongest light of experience, is, that to those in perfect health the stimulant of wine is needless; and if any anything needless be resorted to, it is in danger of becoming pernicious at length. Again, if a well man habitually drinks wine, or any other stimulant, he anticipates every good effect it might have when he becomes sickly or in firm. To, it is a most wretched policy, to say the least, for the young and healthy to practise taking wine, or any other stimulant; according to the striking moral in the account that a certain well man took medicine to become better, and, while dying in consequence, dictated his epi tap, viz I was well: I took medicine, and here I am n haste, yours, Of  Dney Weller.

To danger of bleeding at these times and these last named vines especially should have plenty of room to expand, say thirty feet apart; not too great a distance when considered that ere long, with good attention, they will form a thick, complete canopy, at that or even greater distance.

C., June 6, 1846. For the American Farmer. Of Outli   Of Of Of Ameri Can Of Neyard, From The Start. Of. Edi On: The following outline is the result of years of successful experiments. Select the best tested American grapes, particularly such as are found to mature well; whether the vines are young or old; if you wish such as will bear forthwith, take those well rooted, of several years' standing in the nursery 2. Plant in the manner of fruit trees, ten feet each way, except theScuppernong: twenty feet for them. Grim in the summer or early in the fall, tying up one or two main stems, un checked in length, to stakes, for a year or so; after which, insert a post, with two clefts nailed each side of the upper square end to hold rails orscantling for making the frame for the out spreading canopy of vines above. After the vines have started over said frame, no more trimming is necessary, except it may be to cut off any straggling branches under the canopy, that all may be kept clear beneath for say six or seven feet high 3. As to soil, any will do, with proper management. I have the finest of good bearing vines in almost all kinds; from the light sandy to the stiffclayey. And as to strength of soil, there is more danger of having land too rich than too poor, as to the bearing properties of vines. As a general principle, ground that will bring good corn is plenty rich for vines, provided you dig or plough, or both, some depth and width, when the vinesse t, and put manure or surface soil, at the bottom of the opening, and then cover with common earth before planting, that no manure or too rich soil may come in contact with the roots, to endanger their safety in case of a drought the first season after planting 4. The best mode of keeping up due fertility of soil is this, viz: In connection with never suffering your vine yard at any time of year to be 9 36 Doc. No. No. 140.come grassy or weedy, to be particularly careful to scarify the ground; and, after fall frosts, let no leaves or litter from your vines blow off or become incorporated with the soil beneath the ca no pies. Satires mode of keeping up and increasing the fertility of woodlands taught me this mode, and the very best, too, of maturing vineyards, or what is more than equivalent thereto 5. The foregoing is the whole secret of having a first rate vine yard, the ripe fruit of which is the most health full as well as pleasant, and can be enjoyed for several months in the year; the wines from which are in no danger of adult e ration; and, as to a family medicine, according to the voice of experience and of most eminent physicians, the very best single healing one in the Bacteria Medical; and also an anticipate or of disease in sickly places and seasons, when taken temperate ly say after dinner. A few additional little matters, and I close this offhand, hastily written articles. I tie my vines with elm bark, which, being got in spring, is at any season ready when soaked, and out lasts any strings I have ever tried 2. In a wet season I insert posts, with what we call wobbers; that is, apiece of wood say three feet long, sharpened at one end, and a strong peg inserted through the other end for raising it by a stake or crow bar, when driven into the ground by a- paul or beetles. In to the hole made thereby insert your post, say two or more feet deep. Posts at any time can be renewed, when giving way, by dropping up the part of the canopy above. Posts of any lasting wood had better be charred at the little end, so as to stand inverse ly from the way they did when growing as a tree. According to statements I have read in agricultural periodicals, they will last much longer when thus inverted, or standing, as it were, upside down. Pardon the hasty and desultory style of this communication, and believe me ever yours, and a hearty well wisher of all deserved success in your a vocation in the best of all arts and sciences, as that of agriculture is the foundation of all the rest. Hours, &can  Dney Weller. Bri Nkleyvi Lle Hali   Fax To. N. C., Kept. 16, 1845. Of Ntage Of Ohi O. I promised you an account of our vantage. It is over; and after all complaints of the rot, and dropping of fruit, and the lamentations of the hard working German women, who do most of the work in the vine yard in the summer season, my tenants have cause for gratitude, not complaint; The promise of the crop early in the season was without a parallel. Their expectation was 500 barrels of wine. They have made upwards of 300. The mash was very rich, and the wine promises to be of fine quality. More is said of the quantity of wine raised in this country than is true. The balance of the State, I venture to assert, has not produced an equal quantity. But the cultivation of the vine is fast extending on the Ohio; and one or two years more, and I trust the same remark would not be true of this country. I am also extending my vineyards. As an inducement to poor Germans, a. 937 will give the result in a single vineyards that of Tuferbers. It is situated four miles from the city, on Old face creek. It is a rich, steep, stony hill. It resembles the hill of the I irishman" To steep, that before you get up on the one side you are half way down on the other." It was a hard bargain to the tenant. To trench, bench, and wall the south side hill, was worth                    $300 per acre. After three years' trial I parted with him. I then took the present German tenant. He was very poor, but strong and healthy his wife a match for the wife of my other German tenant, who, when she died, told me "he might just as well have lost his horse." He had also full grown boys and girls. I made a hard bargain with him. Round him to trench and bench six acres of the worst ground in three years, and plant it in grapes, and put out fruit trees. I was to have half of the proceeds of all the wine and fruit. Space was allotted to him to raise cabbage and <a name="potatoes1454"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> for his family and pasture. I was careful not to make an attempt to climb the hill for the three years, or go near it, fearful of disappointment. Judge my surprise, at the end of three years, to find six acres handsomely trenched and benched, with their walls and vines in fruit. Reaches and apples were this season a total failure, and he had his grapes only to rely on. This is the only vine yard at which a few I s abel la grapes remain. To encourage him and the other vine dressers, I let them have my share of the wine at a reduced price. For the Catawba, he was to pay 75 cents per gallon; for the Gape Heavy, or Schuylkill Muscadell, 62 a cents per gallon for the I s abel la, 50 cents per gallon. The whole of his enclosure does not exceed thirty-five acres-nine acres of it in grapes. He has sold his wine of this vantage, for cash, for                                                         $1,779.41. At the price my share was sold to him, it came to      $713.75, and left him, from the vantage, the net sum of                                                         $1,065.66. I trust other poor Germans may be excited by his example. The thirty-five acres cost me    $630. There were some vineyards in the neighborhood more productive than any one of mine, as they suffered less from late frost and the rot. N. Longworth. I Nci    Nnati   , October 7, 1845. From the In diana Farmer and Gardener. Longworths Ohi O Grape, &c. In our last we gave an account of a Herbemont grape at Madison, In diana, supposed to be identical with Longworths Ohio. We have received from Mr. Long worth a statement which puts all aback again. We have both grapes in our garden, and hope to be able to compare them the ensuing season. Of    Nci    Nnati   , April 24, 1845. To the Editor of the In diana Farmer and Gardenerdear Of  R: Your correspondent, Mr. Morrison, is in error in supposing the Ohio grape and Mr. Fitzhughs Herbemont the same. The latter grape I obtained from Mr. Herbemont many years since, with samples of 9 38 his wine, which were not good. Mr. Sitz hugh, of Madison, sent rise a sample of wine made by him from this grape, of fine quality and greatly superior to the samples of Mr. Herbemont, and satisfied me that our climate was more suitable to the cultivation of the grape than South Carolina. The sample of the Herbemont sent by Mr. Sitz hugh was examined by the society and pronounced the Herbemont Madeira. It is a fine table grape, entirely free from the hard pulp common to most American grapes, and superior for wine to the Ohio grape, but the bunches are much smaller. The Ohio grape has borne well with me, in my garden; but at my vineyards, in the High Hills, it bears badly. I have never seen it injured by frost. An account was published a few years since of upwards of three thousand gallons of wine to the acre, made by Herbemont, from his grape. Such statements are ridiculous. He had four or five vines that covered his house and porches. The s talks covered but a few feet of ground, and, so measuring, he had more than 3,000 gallons to the acre. In his vineyards he never raised 200 gallons on an acre. The Catawba grape is a good table grape, though not entirely free from a hard pulp; but as a wine grape, in our climate, I consider it superior to all others capable of making a wine to rival the best Lock and Champagne wines and that Major Drum, in introducing it, has left a mine of wealth to the people of the Ohio. I make this remark, as a gentleman from the east observed to me a few days since that it was understood I gave the preference to the I s abel la. The latter grape succeeds better [at the east] than with us. I deem it a poor table grape, and worthless for wine, and have extirpated it from all my vineyards. With two pounds of sugar to the gallon, it makes a pleasant sweet wine. Hours, with regard, N. Longworth. Select Ameri Can Grapes In The Bri Nkleyvi Lle (NORTH Caroli   Of) Of Neyards. Our successful experiment of grape culture and wine making is mainlyattributable to the system being American throughout; and, as to the kinds of grapes, not only, after trial, rejecting foreign, but also such native as are not profitable in most respect. In ca no pies supported by posts ten feet each way apart, and all clear beneath, for passage of wind, persons, or teams, might be seen, a month since, a complete spread or sheet of grapes, so thick in many places is to yield at rates of a thousand and more gallons of wine per acre. And now, after having made our barrel of wine a day for some weeks past, and entertaining visitors, sometimes more than twenty a day, the vineyards are very full still, and a stranger might conclude that few grapes had been abstracted, and those only from some vines. But, designing a mere list of most select vines, with a passing remark or two, we proceed at once to enumerate, first, such grapes as are good and profitable in every respect, and from most of which we make not only gallons but barrels of wine annually, of late years 1. The white Scuppernong, the noble native of our own State; but north of latitude 37- degrees, of no peculiar excellence. a. 9392. Sellers Halifax, a native of this county, but calculated, so far as we have learned, for any part of Our country. But of a large number of vines from the seed of this grape, one we call the Halifax needling promises, according to best judges, to be inferior to none in every respect. its culture is yet limited. Fruit like the Catawba, but sweeter 3. Line harbor; so called from its very large leaf, as well as extended growth, and consequent peculiar fitness for harbors 4. Somerville5. North Carolina. This is late in ripe king, and its peculiar excellence is foi wine, not table use 6. York Madeira 7. Fragrant. This delight fully per files the air around, when ripe. The above kinds have all large ferries, and average the I s abel la and Catawba in size, and consequently are not subject to depredations from birds. We have several other fine sorts of like sized grapes. But we proceed to those of intermediate size (or that, say, of bucks hot) in our first class, viz 8. For tons Virginia needling, called after the late Dr. Norton, of Richmond A. This we find one of the finest in all respects, as for table use, wine making, productive ness, (capable of 2,000 gallons per acre) and free from rot 9. Running ham. This is also a grape from Virginia, most excellent for eating, and with one difficulty only as to wine qualities, viz: on every race me some small green grapes are interspersed among the ripe ones. But, to obviate this, we omit picking out the green ferries, and make the wine in the way the late Mr. Herbemont made his Madeira, or a white wine, from his colored grape; that is, by putting the grapes unna shed under the press, and, after pressing, the ripe grapes only are found ma shed by pressing 10. Woodson, also from Virginia; much later ripe king than the Running ham, and not so good for the table 11. Senior, a grape f a grade smaller merry among the first of peculiar excellence in ripe king here. In the fine vine yard of Mr. John Garter, near Richmond, Virginia, he showed me, some years since, the Lawrence of France, imported by him as identical with the Senior. If Mr. Garter is not mistaken, this is a foreign grape, only not subject to rotating in our country. The juice is very strong, and, as the late Mr. Herbemont observes, capable of making a good keeping vine, without the addition of either spirits or sugar. But, omitting further enumeration of excellent grapes of intermediate size, we proceed to the second general class, viz: of some kinds excellent in many respects, but exception able on account of pro density to rot, (at least at the south) small ness of merry, &c, and therefore no dependence on them for a wine crop; though a few of each are retained in the vineyards as a variety .of fruit, and in contrast, and for visitors. Among a considerable number of kinds in class second, the following are here noticed 1. The Catawba, the favorite grape of Mr. Drum, Georgetown, District of Columbia, and now, I see from agricultural periodicals, mostly cultivated in the northern and middle States. But its prone ness to rot on the vines renders it a very uncertain fruit in the south, and the older the vines the worse; so that some, as I learn, in this State and Virginia, have given up vine yard culture in despair of profit, whose principal vines were theCatawba; and 2. The I s abel la; and no effectual remedy have we found for this tank 40 realizing casualty, but that of cutting down, in the fall season, most of the vines of these sorts, and grafting on their stocks some of the first general class, as good at least in every respect, and far better as to certainty of a well matured crop. Three years since we procured a kind of Catawba said not to rot. The young vines of what we call A tons Catawba, so far, have matured their fruit 3. Colesvine4. Alexander 5. Constantia, or Heavy. This last is that chiefly cultivated by the Swiss settlers in In diana. But, however succeeding with them, when the vines are young, at least, it proves here one of the rotating kinds; although it, a swell as all just named, produces fine large fruit when happening to mature. This second class now continued with grapes of intermediate size; as 6. Herbemonts Madeira. This, as seen in the columns of the C American Farmer" was called the Warren, or Warren den, ere it received the above name from the late excellent Mr. N. Herbernont, of Columbia, Southcarolina, who gave it notoriety. It appears to be of foreign extraction, from the shortness of the vine joints, and especially its prone ness to rot. Mr. Herbemont himself calls it a tantalizing grape; because, as he states, just when giving promise of an abundant yield, (once he made at rates of more than 2,000 gallons per acre from it) its frequent habit is to begin rotating without any assign able cause of too wet or too dry, or the like 7. Longworths Ohio. The distinguished agriculturists, Mr. N. Long worth, near Cincinnati, sent me, a few years since, some cuttings of this, by mail, in a newspaper; and, by grafting, I have cultivated it to some extent. But here it is of no peculiar excellence, and, I find, prone to rot, though Mr. L. informed me it had proved a most excellent variety in his locality. We have procured from nearer and more distant parts of our country a considerable number of other kinds of intermediate sized merry, and exception able in some respects; among which I name 8. Baltimore needling 9. Glands Madeira or red English 10. White English 11. Enfield12. Hunter ville, &c and also several varieties of small merry and small yield, though otherwise fine. Three only of these we add to our list of the 2d class, viz: 13, Oil cox; 14, Guinards native; 15, the Elsingburg. We have under trial a large number of needlings; and of those procured from everywhere we could hear of a good native, and may give the result in due time. Of  Dney Weller. Bri Nkleyvi Lle, Hali   Fax To, N. C., Kept. 15, 1845. Culti   Vati   Of Of The Grape. James Locke, florists, of King King, New Work, writes to the New Yorkfarmer and Mechanics, under date of August 4, 145, as follows When you were last at my place, you requested me to send you a written statement of my mode of treating the grape vine. In the first place, a. 941 dig a hole two and a half to three feet deep, according to the length of the vine never less than two about three feet square. My reason for doing so is, to get the roots beyond the influences of the sun, as they are naturally inclined to approach the surface, causing the vine to throw out an unusual quantity of foliage and fruit; and when the dry season commences, they feel the drought immediately. After the vine has been established for three years, I dig down and cut off every root from the main body. In doing so, I dig a trench each side of the vine a foot deep, from two to three feet wide, and fill it up with all sorts of rubbish, such as pea brush, bones, shoes, &c. I chop up all my vine trimming in pieces of about eight inches in length, and throw them in the trench. I then throw the ground taken from the ditch over the whole, then cover the surface, as far as circumstances will permit, with long litter, pea brush, &c, in order to exclude the sun as much as possible. By excluding the sun the ground becomes moist, and is pierced with thousands of angle worm holes. Whenever we have a shower, the rain filters through, and is carried down those holes to the roots. I do not think it necessary for the sun to touch the earth at all and this I think I have fully proved. I have one grape vine that I planted in the rear of my kitchen, which it afterwards became necessary to occupy for a wood house. Not liking to cut it away, I bent it down and laid the floor over it, so that it has been with the roots entirely under the building. Very year this vine produced as much fruit as it is capable of sustaining. It has a northerly exposure, and the grapes are usually the first ripe on the place I do not think the merry quite as large as those that stand in a more open exposure; but the flavor is equally fine. I have one vine that has a we sternly exposure, planted shallow, and the surface not covered' this dry weather, the fruit has entirely perished. The next vine to it was planted in the same exposure and same depth, but was afterwards filled in so as to bring the root about three feet under the surface, which was not covered with rubbish; the fruit has not wilted, but is not near the size of those viies which had a covered surface. I have one perpendicular harbor run ruin due north and south, and from t the to of the harbor I have conducted several viies east and west. The fruit on the vines running west ripenstn Y days sooner thacid127n A those runing east. I have changed the vines, and te result was the same. I occupy no more ground with that harbor than the mere width of the post, which is about seven inches; and I cultivate on l each side of it, close up to the post. I do not think it necessary, in order to cultivate grapes to any extent, to occupy any more space than the width of the' post. I think the vine is all the better for having any sort of a green crop on the surface near it, so as to exclude the sun. If I were going to set out a vine yard, I should set a row of posts six feet part, then another row of posts parallel to them, thirty feet distant from t. first row .i I would then plant a vine at each post, and conduct a No. 12 fe from the top of one past to the other. i I then could use the intermediate 6 ground :for any short crop of garden vegetables I wished. Theywouild all do well, and, by training a single vine up the post, across the ire, I would get full as many grapes, if not more than when the whole harbor was occupied; and the wind has no effect upon it, the wire being so flexible that they do not suffer as n such as those that are trained on a harbor. -the posts right to be high enough to drive under with a horse. S. My time of trimming is late in the spring; at least I never commencetrinniiming until the vines will bleed freely, which a great many people con 9 42 side r a great detriment; but the li I cut out old wood, I always cut it three or four feet longer than I intend it shall be, so that when the first cut becomes gummed over I cut away some more, to give the sap a free passage. I will venture to say my vines are the largest in the State of Newyork, for their age. The great difficulty with me is, that they are so loaded with fruit that I am obliged to pick off large quantities when green. In consequence of the superior flavor of my grapes, owing, I think, to the surface of the ground being covered and tilled, I have li o trouble in selling them in advance, as I have now done for the last two years. Messrs. Hope, corner of Chamber street and West Broadhvay, have engaged them. In trimming, I suffer no old weed to remain that I can possibly remove, and trim the ones I wish for bearers entirely smooth. I also make a second trimming in the course of the season, by removing the middle growth. For the Farmer and Mechanics. Grapes. Of. Edi Tor: I have just read in your valuable paper an article on the culture of the grape, by James Locke, of King King. Mr. Locke appears to attach much importance to deep planting, or compelling the roots of the vine two feet below the surface. Dr. Under hill, too, favors the same opinion. I s not this altogether at variance with agricultural chemistry? Such is my i impression from reading Lie big, Johnson, Ana, and others; but, independent of these, I know from experience that it is altogether wrong. It is an old fashioned practice in England to make vine borders of prepared com post to the depth of six feet. I have had occasion to over haul these several times, and invariably found the bottom of the border totally unfit for any plant to live in. Men years past I had the first opportunity of seeing the grape vine in its natural state; and, being passionately fond of growing the grape vine, I examined them closely, in the woods, on the banks of the Hudson. I have dug up dozens of them, and invariably found their roots within six inches of the surface. From the past seasons experience, I am more than ever convinced that to plant the grape vine deep, or, which is the same thing, to fill up sd as to bury the roots two feet below the surface, is detrimental. In the situation I now am, I have the charge of three vineyards; in the first of which the vines (six years age) were planted too deep consequently did not thrive well; to remedy this, fresh com post was added the next season, but without benefit; another gardener came-two or three in fact and (a" a curse, by the way, to most vineyards, this repeated changing) each of them took the same course; so that the roots (that is, the original roots) were buried all of three feet below the surface. When I came this past spring, I formed up part of the border very carefully for fear of injuring the roots, but was surprised not to find any within reach. I then took a spade and dug down two feet, six feet from where the vines were planted, and there found some brown looking roots, which I traced to their extremities, and found that the whole of last seasons formation had delayed. I then gave up all hopes of perfecting a crop of grapes; but, luckily, there was a small space of about four feet in width from where the vines entered the house to the blue that had been filled up for salad, &c, and into this border the vines had rooted from the stem. a. 943With these roots, well fed with gun no, liquid manure, &c, and with the few roots made from the stems on the outside of the house, "near the surface" I have ripened a crop of grapes averaging twenty pounds to thereafter being the first crop of grapes ever brought to maturity n i this house since the vines were planted and some of the fruit judged of sufficient merit to take the second premium of the State society. I visited the vine yard of Dr. Under hill about four years since, in company with another gardener, and thorough grape grower, too, and it was the impression of both that the grand secret of the doctor ripe king his grapes so uniformly was a remarkably light sandy soil; the roots near the surface, and yet prevented from being scorched with the sun by a liberal application of swamp much as a top dressing apparently not intended as a manure, but to preserve a uniform temperature in the soil. Putting off the roots of the vine does not prevent their finding their way to the surface; it may do so for a short distance, but it should be borne in mind that the vine is a great r ambler, both top and bottom; and, after cutting off all the roots two feet below the surface, it may still be a fact that thespongioles, on which the vine depends for nourishment, are found close to the 'surface, though it may be at a distance of fifty feet from the vine. I Mr. Is plan of training and p runing the vine I like very much; I believe it to be the only plan of growing the native grape so as to obtain fair i bunches of well favored fruit, but think the less he crops the intermediate space the better. For the, first three years after planting, two or three rows of <a name="potatoes1455"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> might be taken off; but after that, keep the surface covered with much, and the cultivate or freely at work. Very respectfully yours, G. K. Newark, September 20, 1845. From the Visitor. A !of to te- .a. some lid ,s now route   sat down to tell you something about my grape vines, and now I will stop rambling and do so. Having a spot on the south side of my house which I thought would be favorable to the growth of grapes, in the fall of 1842 I erected an harbor by setting posts, leaving them eight feet out of the ground and fifteen feet from the house. In the tops of the posts one end of a sixteen foot scant long was rested, the other end resting against the house, sixteen feet from the ground. These scan things were crossed with two inch strips, about two feet apart. The upright posts were also crossed in the same manner as the top of the harbor. Early in the following March     dug a trench at the foot of the posts, two feet wide and three feet deep. I then filled it half way up (eighteen inches) with system shells, and the remaining eighteen inches with loam taken from the commons near the city. In this loam I immediately set my roots, having vines attached to them of about two feet in length. Directions were then given that all the waste water from the kitchen dish water, soap sums, &c should be daily thrown around them, which was done. One of the vines blossomed and bore the first summer; but an unlucky boy, strolling into the garden, broke off all but a few grapes, which ripened, and were found to be delicious. Their growth this first summer varied from five to ten feet in length, besides throwing out great numbers of lateral branches. I did not trim them 9 44 at all the succeeding winter. Early in March last, it being the second spring only that they had been in the ground, they began to put forth. I do not remember the time of their blossoming, but in July the neighbors began to pick, and pronounced them ripe. This, however, was not the case. The vines then, notwithstanding the severe drought which had prostrated almost everything around us, presented as beautiful an appearance as I ever beheld. Thousands of branches and ten drill had put forth, the leaves were large and fresh, and the fruit hung under the trellisworkin delicious and tempting profusion. The branches were not so numerous as I have often times seen them, but they were twice as large as any other that I saw during the summer. One vine, however, of the big ness of amass finger, contained one hundred and twenty bunches, all perfect, and of extraordinary size and flavor. These were the I s abel la; the Catawbasdid not yield so abundantly, and the Sweet water not at all, as yet. The latter had not the advantage of the trench and the system shells, but in other respects were treated the same. During the extreme dry weather I occasionally threw fresh water upon the vines from a watering pot, and from a large syringe where they were high. In this my first attempt at raising grapes, I have been highly gratified and, from the experiment, I am satisfied that the vines require a great deal of water, but in small quantities at a time, and that it should never stand long about the roots. The system shells serve as a drain to carry off water which might otherwise remain too long; and as it perforates among them, it carries down the fine mould, which the small delicate roots soon find, and thus, below the effect of drought, find a never failing source of nourishment and support. In the autumn I throw around the roots a thin coat of coarse manure, old bones, and chips. A gentleman in Rochester, New Work, who has a fine grape by, informed me last summer that he put up grapes for use in the following manner Place a layer of cotton in a barrel, and then select such grapes as are perfectly ripe, and lay them upon it; cover them with another layer of cotton, and so continue till the barrel is full; then place the barrel in a dry place, out of the way of frost, and they come out through the winter in all the pulp y lusciousness of a bunch freshly plucked. 'A portion of these grapes, thus preserved, remained upon the vines till into October, when they were as rich as any foreign grape that I ever tasted. I am confident that most of our grapes are eaten before they are ripe. I intended to have made the experiment of putting them down in cotton, but they proved too tempting to remain on the vines in sufficient quantities. A neighbor has made it, however, and I expect soon to learn with what success. I think the vines should be trimmed early in January. His climate is highly favorable to the culture of the grape, and nothing is wanting but a little pains to produce them in any quantity. I should be glad to know how attempts to cultivate them succeed in New England. Truly yours, Of  Mon Brown. As yet, little has been done in New Hampshire to advance horticulture. Even the profits and the gratification from the production of that excellent fruit, the apple, are as yet but beginning to be realized. The best methods of cultivation are yet little understood. Our soil and situation are most favorable for the apple. We believe the time is coming when the p each. 945mnay be common. Years and plums will also adapt themselves to our climate. There are kinds of our own native grape which, by cultivation, may here be made equal to the I s abel la, the Catawba, or the Sweet water. Met Mr. Crowns mode of thorough cultivation be marked, set in a note book, learned, and longed by rose" by men of curiosity and leisure, and we dare say these northern latitudes will secure to us abundance of grapes as good for use at least as the Smyrna grapes, for which those who get up genteel entertainments pay an expense of thirty-seven and a half cents per pound a price at least four times as great as any food to paper the fastidious palate should cost Editor of the Visitor. Nati   Of Grapes For Of Of. The following is extracted from a letter of a gentleman in Alabama, whose name and residence are not given. It is possible that some of the native grapes, much inferior to the Catawba in flavor, may prove to be the best for wine. The wine grapes of Europe are generally very inferior a stable grapes. A gentleman in Mississippi City cultivates a small native grape which is said to make an admirable wine' I make, annually, for my own use and to scatter among friends, from seventy-five to one hundred gallons of wine. I prefer it for a summer drink, using no spirits. The red wine was made from our native uncultivated grape, which a bounds through this section of the country; some of the finest varieties of which I am cultivating, previously having determined their qualities as regards producing a good wine There is an astonishing variety in the product of our native grape, all of which are cultivated with great ease, and exhibit, on cultivating, an improvement hardly credit le." Among other properties possessed by our native grape, the quantity of venous matter they possess is most remarkable. A bushel of bunches, as pulled from the vine, will give three gallons of the wine I sent you; and, after undergoing a second operation, about one gallon more of a lighter but most agreeable wine. It would take a third pressure to produce the meager drink with which they in part feed the peasantry in France, &c, Who tend the vantage. I anticipate most agreeable results from the cultivation of our native fruits, based on the trials I have already made." The white wine I sent you is from an American grape, acclimated to this section of the country many years ago. It is a reddish colored grape, resembling the Catawba, exquisite for the table, a great bearer, and hardy. Was regards the cultivation of the grape, and wine making, I have effected one most desirable object, viz : doing away altogether with that great expense, of which so much has been written and said. The ground in which my vines stand and bear produces me annually two other crops say a crop of I wish <a name="potatoes1456"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and, after they are matured and taken from the ground, another crop the same year of the variety of the red sweet potato a most valuable variety for stock, and most productive. My mode of supporting the vine is simple, efficient, and economical. The manure given to the I wish <a name="potato1042"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop is: ample for the vines, and applied in the best possible way. The superiority of the grapes I produce, as regards quantity and quality, has been often loudly remarked by i our own citizens andforeigners60946 a' I have a splendid collection of the apple, all acclimated. The cider apple is, perhaps, the most beautiful tree of the kind you have seen ; a most free grower, and prolific, bearing annually full crops. It is the best apple to hang on the tree, and the freest from rot, I have ever seen. It cannot be surpassed in the Union. It is a native of Alabama, produced from repeated planting of seed, and grafting and re grafting, for the last twenty five years vine yard at maturity say the fourth year would be good for from five hundred to seven hundred and fifty gallons; the seventh, for one thousand gallons; the Scuppernong much more to the acre." My mode of planting and cultivating the grape half the quantity per acre and the annual crop mentioned, please me better. Round with us is plenty, and <a name="potatoes1457"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are as essential to our comfort as wine. In fact, in every species of cultivation I am every day more convinced that mixed dropping is the true mode of employing soil and labor. In this way the expense and labor are singularly decreased in proportion to the product By giving the vines room, I insure heavy crops of grapes and rich fruit. I tend, prone, &c, with satisfaction; the first with the plough, and a little with the he while making the <a name="potato1043"><mark>potato</mark></a> crops. The room enables me to gather the fruit with ease, and readily employ the tr ellis in cultivating the grape. In all respects it is the best. Our native and such other grapes as I cultivate prefer it. This append age to the vine yard costs me about five dollars annually per acre, including p runing. I cut down sassafras or cedar trees say nine and ten inches in diameter into posts eight feet; point the butt end; put the small end in the ground, ten feet distant; nail on the sides baths about two inches square, just as split from the cy press log, and my tr ellis is done. My tying the best I have ever found) is the bear grass, found readily in the woods profusely scattered in spots: shrunk over the fire when green, it becomes a soft, pliable tying. Thus you see I am all economy, and no part of the  indians gun' cost more than it came toSUCCESS Of Ameri Can Of Neyards. Messrs. Fleet & Starr: Seeing some disquisitions lately in your valuable periodical on the manner of planting the grape vine, I concluded to forward you a few thoughts on that and like matters. Notwithstanding exceptions, (and they made evident in the given cases) it way be laid down as a rule, that success in any branch of agriculture, as well as in most other pursuits, is the best prima face evidence of right procedure therein; or, that there is an intimate connection established by Providence between the attainment of any object of enterprise and all the steps that lead thereto. To apply this rule to my vineyards: After some dozen years of culture, I have, most flourishing and prolific, six acres of vines, old and young, part of which the older) form a continuous canopy, say eight or ten feet high over head, and underneath nothing to intercept the passage of wind, teams, or people or nothing to be seen underneath but the main stems of the vines, from tea, to twenty feet each way, and posts ten feet apart. The planting of all my. 94 7 vines was on the principle common with my other procedure on the farm i ri that respect, viz : in reference to the fact of all the vegetable creation having tap and lateral roots, and that both must be sustained in some appropriate way, that the desired end of prolific issue in ay be attained. Some plants may be called tap rooted because mainly depending on tap roots, as cotton, turn is, &c; others lateral rooted, because mostly sustained by their lateral roots, as corn, &c. But both kinds of roots must, as a general rule, have their office sustained, or no adequate success will be had in their culture; but, so far from a culture exactly adapted to either, in my experience 1 have had desired success in a method common to both: for instance, while I raise turn is by putting manure in drills and bedding thereon, and then planting. 1 have done the same with corn, and had like success, with this difference only with turn is, to have the bed raised with an eye to drawing dirt from them in cultivating; and corn, with a hollow rather when planted, Except it be in a low or damp location. But it may be laid down us a rule, that no planting or culture should be so deep as to neglect the existence and sustaining of lateral roots near the surface, or near enough thereto for the guns heat to have its genial influence. To with vines and trees. You even do a violence to their nature to plant or cultivate them too deep, which violence will be revenged, generally, by a small or no yield at all. The general rule for planting fruit trees will aptly apply to that for vines, viz: to plant an inch or so deeper than they stood when growing in the nursery. I say in the nursery, as to vines as well as trees, for I consider (and practise) that grape vines should first be cultivated in the nursery a year or so before eligible for setting out in tire vine yard. The Scuppernong, not growing from cuttings, I first root by layers, and then make them well rooted vines in the nursery ere planting in vine yard, or selling. But other kinds of vines cultivated first in the nursery by cuttings, often being thickly set in drills three feet apart. Wythe By, fall planting is decidedly most success fill for cuttings. Frequent discouragements in vinejrard culture arise from attempts to start vineyards with cuttings, and not well rooted plants. And whatever is said of European culture of short distance apart and humble height, and of servile imitation of foreign modes in our country certainly the American mode of 10 or 20 feet apart, and say 30, 40, 60, or more, length of branches on scaffolding, would seem to make an up hill business of beginning a vine yard with cuttings. Plants as well as animals are of gigantic growth in America, compared with eastern size. And no success has yet been attained, and I predict never will be, by thwarting instead of aiding nature in vine culture. Hence the reiterated abortive attempts of foreigners to succeed with the vine yard business in our country. All attempts at planting vines very deep, or cutting off upper roots and the like, will generally prove worse than useless trouble in America. All the disturbing of lateral roots of my vines is that of the mere surface ones, by shallow working with cultivates, harrows, and the like, to prevent the undergrowth of anything, and to incorporate all fallen leaves with the soil beneath the ca no pies, as equivalent to natures plan of keeping up the fertility of the woods. But, to conclude these hastily written and desultory remarks, I: will state t briefly the yield of a quarter of an acre of vine yard nearest my house, and managed, from the start, according to the above hinted American plan. The kinds of vine are mostly Scuppernong, with some of ^my Halifax, For tons V. needling, and Running ham, besides; grapes gathered and shaken, (the Scuppernong grapes by holding a large sheet948p underneath the ca no pies, and shaking the branches above with a formed, stick ,when all ripe ones fall) to make wines quantity not calculated precisely, but say several barrels. The following drains upon said quarter were had for more than a month, viz: Visitors daily therein, to pluck the fruit on the advertising terms of 20 cents each entrance, and com mutation for companies, (par taking standing on fixtures, to reach the grapes above) and grapes gathered to carry away at prices of 40 cents per gallon. Frequently 20 or 30 visitors a day; and at one time 60, and at another 95 white persons, besides colored servants, mostly par taking of the fruit of said quarter of an acre. When the 95 had eaten abundantly and retired, some of the company went back to see the change of appearance. as to fruit on the ca no pies, and reported they could not miss the grapes, or was no perceptible alteration as to appearances of branches well loaded everywhere. In short, the calculation is, that from visitations and sales of grapes, and product of wine, this quarter acre yielded at least 50 dollars profit the season, or at rates of the interest on 800 dollars, or more than 3,000 dollars the acre. This statement, to those not conversant with the prodigious bearing qualities of a well managed American vine yard, may appear incredible. But the same statements in other periodicals, as the Cultivator, read in my region, would jeopardy, my vera city if not true. My list of vines you may see in the November number of the Albany Cultivator" which list have the goodness to transfer into your columns, as if for you written. Train the grape juice through several folds of a woolen blanket, and then add at least two pounds of sugar per gallon, and my word for it, a good wine will be the result and better for some tastes, at least, than if a fourth of spirits be added, and one pound of sugar per gallon.

Presi  Dent: Upon referring to some memorandums of my father, I find amongst others the following account kept of the produce of his vine yard since 1837. As a number of our members are cultivating the vine, I thought it would be interesting, as it is difficult to obtain a statement of the kind kept minutely for a series of years. It shows the actual produce, and the certainty of the crop before any other fruit in this latitude, and the difference between the Catawba and      s abel la as to the yield and certainty; the I s abel la having borne a first rate crop for nine successive years the Catawba failing occasionally, from rot and the effects of insects. The vine yard has a southern exposure, fronting on the Ohio riverwasplantedwith rooted plants in 1834, and contained at that time 1775 vines, placed in rows four feet apart, and three feet distant in the row ; the ground being previously trenched, and the stones taken out to the depth of two feet. In the fall of 1837, the first crop was picked, as follows 164 bushels grapes, from which ere made 6 67 gallons of wine. At this time there were. a. 9491,125 I s abel la and rape vines, yielding 113 bushels, making 469 gallons, arid 650 Catawba, yielding 51 bushels, making 198 gallon s 1838, vantage, September 10, produce 327 gallon s 1839, do September 5, produce 440 do 1840, do September 20, I s abel la 240 do 1840, do September 20, Catawba 45 do his year (1840) most of the Catawba rotted on the vines.

The quantity eaten by three families is not taken into this account. The ground has always been thoroughly hold in the spring, and kept free from weeds; never manured until last winter, when the ground was covered, and dug in the spring; and from the result this season, it would pay well, as the vines are in better condition than they ever were after yielding a heavy crop. The vines have been trained to stakes, and the bearing wood cut out, after having borne one season, leaving two shoots, trained the same season-one to form the bearing hoop or bow, and the other cut to two eyes, to prop agate wood for the next year; the vine never having but the hoop and the two eyes left for fruit each year growing at the same time. This year the ends of the vines have been dipped and the suckeds taken out four different times1The following estimate I have made from what it has cost this year, and is not far fr man the actual expense, although the labor has been done by the 9 50 hands doing the other work on the farm; and in making wine, extra hands were always employed. By planting cuttings, and preparing the ground by sub soil sloughing, when it can be done, would lessen the expense. The price is what the wine was sold at from the press the season, and is a low estimate.

It will be seen that the greatest number and variety of the specimens examined were from the several vineyards of N.

Mr. Not tier and Jacob Yes or, esq, who have lately acquired a good reputation in this department of horticulture, were next to Mr. Long worth in the number and variety of specimens furnished. These, with the single specimen of Dr. Flag g, and the two specimens of Dr. Smith, confirm, the opinions of the committee, that the pure juice of the grape, when judiciously managed, will furnish the finest kind of wine, without any addition or mixture whatever; that no sac charing addition is necessary to give it sufficient body to keep for any length of time in this climate. In confirmation of this opinion, we would state that two of our German friends who were present informed us that they had taken, on different occasions, specimens of the wine of this country to Germany, and submitted them to the judgment of various connoisseurs in that country, by whom they were highly approved ; the principal or only objection being that they were too strong to compare with the fine kinds of the lightest German wines. Taste for the wines of this region appears to be well established, since all that can be produced finds a ready market at good prices; and the committee are of opinion that the period is not distant when the wines of the Ohio, will enjoy a celebrity equal to those of the Rhine. D. B. Lawlei K, S. F. Foote, M. Flagg, Jacob Resor, Eli   Sha Bri Gham. From the Cincinnati Farmer and Gardener. Culture Of The Grape. As public attention, at the present time, seems to be somewhat enlisted in the culture of the grape, and as its success is pretty well established in the vicinity of Cincinnati, where it is rapidly extending, a brief sketch of the most approved mode of establishing a vine yard may be acceptable to some of your readers. The first step, then, is the preparation of the ground. The sides or tops of limestone hills are generally chosen for the location, where the water runs off readily. South and south eastern exposures are the best in this climate. Three modes of preparing the ground are usually adopted here. The first consists merely in deep sloughing, with a common plough, as for <a name="potatoes1458"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and making the surface fine and mellow with the harrow. The second method goes one step further, and a second furrow is cut in the bottom of the first; in the bottom of the second furrow a sub soil plough is run, which breaks the ground, altogether, to the depth of sixteen or eighteen inches; it is then harrowed and prepared as in the first. The third method is by thoroughly trenching with the spade, to the depth of not less than two feet. If the hillside is steep, (say at an elevation of twenty or thirty degrees with the horizon) terraces are also raised from two to four feet in height, and extending up the hill from twenty to sixty feet each, according. 93 to the activity of the surface. By this last mode, the top soil is all thrown into the bottom of the trenches, and the sub soil, which is generally clay by, thrown upon .the top, and left sufficiently smooth for planting. There stones are found in 'the soil, they are thrown out on the surface, as thetreniching progresses up the hill, and if in s sufficient quantity, are laid up in walls to support the terraces. The terraces are made to run horizontally along the hill side, or nearly so, with an open ditch, for a drain, at the upper edge of each terrace, and a similar horizontal ditch as often as once in eighty or a hundred feet, where the ground is not terraced. These drains should lead to the lowest point in the vine yard, where a suitable drain should be constructed down the hill to carry off the surplus water in heavy showers, and may be covered like a cut vert, or left open. In each case the vines are planted in rows, four feet apart if to be worked with the he and spade, and from five to six feet if to be worked with the plough or cultivate or, and should always run horizontally with the terraces and drains. The distance between the vines in the row varies from two and a half to four feet, according to the mode of training which is to be adopted. Cuttings of the vine, with three or four eyes, are sometimes planted, at proper distances, in the vine yard ; but the usual practice is, to plant them first in a nursery, in rows, about eighteen inches apart, and from four to six in a row, to strike root; here they are to be well cultivated, and allowed to grow one or two years, when they are taken up in the spring and planted out in the vine yard. The fourth year from the cuttings, (that is, after they have had three summersgrowthtwo in the nursery and one in the vine yard) they may be allowed to bear a lull crop, or nearly as much as they ever should be allowed to bear thereafter; which is about one-fourth of a peck of grapes to each vine. One acre of ground, planted six feet by three apart, will contain about twenty-four hundred vines; consequently, will yield about one hundred and fifty bushels of well as sorted grapes, which will make three hundred gallons of wine sometimes a little more. In acre of good ground, well trenched, and planted with Catawba vines, after it has acquired six or seven years' growth, may be made to yield a much greater quantity; and some small vineyards below Cincinnati, on the hills of the Ohio river, have produced at the rate of eight hundred gallons per acre; but the vines were planted four feet each way, making twenty-six hundred and forty vines to the acre; but the proprietor admitted that his vines were injured by overbearing, and that his wine was inferior in quality when allowed to produce that quantity 1 give three hundred gallons as the full average quantity of wine made to the acre in the neighborhood of Cincinnati. Of course, much variation will depend upon the manner of establishing a vine yard, and its subsequent treatment. The comparative merits of the different modes of preparing the ground for a vine yard cannot, as yet, be settled by experience in this part of the country, as the oldest vine yard, I believe, has not been established more than twelve or thirteen years. Vineyards planted at Heavy, in In diana, by the Swiss, merely on deeply ploughed. ground, failed in fifteen years. When the ground is ploughed eighteen inches deep, it may bear tolerably well for twenty years; but a vine yard planted on ground well trenched two feet deep, and properly drained and cultivated, may be expected to last fifty or one hundred years perhaps more. The crop, also, is much more cer954 stain when the ground is well trenched, not being so liable to suffer from draughts or rainy seasons. The advantages of deep trenching have become so apparent to those who have had the most experience, that nearly all who can afford it are now preparing their ground in this manner, although done at an expense varying from eighty to one hundred and twenty five dollars per acre, according to the character of the ground. This, with the addition of twenty-four hundred vines, at sixty dollars per thousand for one year old vines, (the customary price in this market) with the cost of planting, will make the expense of one acre, exclusive of land, stakes, &c, at least three hundred dollars, or, without trenching, about two hundred. S. Mosher. From the Boston Cultivator. A Day Of The Reybolds' In Peach Harvest. Desirous of affording our readers the means of forming some idea of the magnitude and importance of the p each business of Delaware, we lay before them the details of A day spent at the Reybolds' in p each harvest he took passage from Philadelphia by the steamer Pioneer, at Arch street wharf, at 7 o clock on the morning of the 29th August, (Reyboldswharf adjoining being full to overflowing with his empty baskets in transit u) passing the teamer Napoleon, which had arrived at the railroad wharf on the Camden shore, and was discharging her leading of 3,000 baskets of Key bold peaches for the New York market. During the passage to Delaware City we were continually passing boats of different descriptions loaded with peaches for the Philadelphia market; reaching the wharf at 11 o clock, 40 miles below Philadelphia, where it was with difficulty that we could pass along it, for the rows of baskets of Reybolds peaches, three tiers in height, and extending about one hundred yards in length, flanked with carriages, from the six ox and six mule wagons, counting their 125 baskets each, to the single horse cart or dear born, with its score or two, awaiting their turn for unloading; re loading with empty baskets and driving furiously back for more a scene which bade defiance to imagination. Were we found the Reybolds loading a sloop, which' departed for Philadelphia with 1,230 baskets, only to make room for the Cohansey steamer, on board which were placed 1,000 baskets more; and then they began to prepare the evenings loading for the Napoleon, that had returned from Philadelphia during the day, on which were put 1,700 baskets from the orchards of Messrs. John, Philip, jr, William, and War ney Key bold, when she proceeded to the wharf of Major Key bold, which is situated in the midst of his orchards, to complete her loading another 1,490 baskets starting for Philadelphia so as to be again in the market before daylight next morning, with a total of 3,190 baskets. The details of this days shipment, therefore, are as follows :in board the sloop -1 230 baskets. In the steamer Cohansey -1000 in the steamer Napoleon -3190Total baskets -5 420. 95 from the Key bold p each orchards only. These all reached their destination before daylight next morning, consigned to Mr. Anthony Key bold, by whom they were disposed of before 11 o clock, at from 16 to 31 cents per, basket, containing about 31 pecks each. From the books of Major Key bold and his sons was ascertained the quantity of peaches sent to market to the 29th August, inclusive, viz Major Key bold, from his Maryland and Delaware orchards 31,145 baskets.

Were we saw three steamers loading with peaches at the same time, while the empty return baskets had numbered 16,000 within the last 24 hours. Major Key bold has it in contemplation to start a large steamer with peaches direct to Boston !a! Success attend him n conclusion, we would add, Mr. Philip Key bold, jr, is extensively engaged in the nursery business, n more particularly in the raising of p each trees, of which he has from 60,000 to 80,000, 5 feet high and 2- inches in circumference, from the seed the present season; and, from the facilities which he enjoys, as well as the peculiar care and attention employed, those requiring the very finest varieties, so as to form succession al orchards, may depend upon a supply of trees true to character and of " most magnificent proportions." It is worthy of remark that the largest p each ever raised in England, by the most careful culture, measured 12 inches in circumference, while in the orchards of the Reybolds, the present year, one has been found to measure 11 inches in circumference, and hundreds from 10 to 11,in the open ground, and the largest crop, perhaps, on record the third in succession. At the conclusion of the harvest, we will endeavor to present our readers with the sum total of peaches sent to Market from Newcastle the present season. James Pedder. Phi Ladelphi A, September 1, 1845.956 a. From the New York Farmer and Mechanics. New York Farmers' Clubtuesday, May 20, 1845. The ever New hall, e squire, vice president of the Massachusetts Of r ti cultural Society, in the chair. Peach Trees. Mr. Wakeman1 present a paper on the p each tree, from my worthy friend George F. Hopkins. The well known havoc made by its enemies upon that delicious fruit tree renders every suggestion for its defence and conservation most acceptable. The letter recommends tobacco tied around the bodies, and the application of alkalies, of whale oil, and of blacksmiths hinders, to the roots. I noticed a case in Philadelphia of a tree on the roots of which hot water had been poured, and soot and lime applied' and the tree bore good fruit every year for twenty years. I refer to Mr. He Jesters statement, at a former meeting, of his success in consequence of placing anthracite coal ashes around the roots of p each trees. Vol. E.  Clarklime recently burnt, placed at the root of a tree, has the effect of killing worms; many of them are dissolved, when in contact with the lime; being moist, they afford the means of their dissolution. Common taney, planted next to the roots, is said to keep off the worms. When. lime is sprinkled at the root, it must be wet either by rain or by hand. I know of no better remedy. Mr. Wtakemani ought to mention that the tree in Philadelphia was, annually whitewashed. Than Campbell, esq applied quick lime to the roots of ten p each trees, annually, since 1839, and those trees are healthy. I planted taney at the roots of twenty p each trees: they were not attacked by worms. The worm bores a hole through the bark at the edge of the ground; its eggs are hatched in June, and I have taken thirty worms out of the bottom of a single tree. The trees protected by taney give me full crops of fruit (and fine, too) annually. Men p each trees, to which I applied nothing, all died the third year. Colonel Traverse planted on my farm, in Jersey, 900 p each trees. I treated them every way ashes, lime ; I cleared the roots and had 120 left. One near my home I cultivated as I would a cabbage, leaving no grass or weeds near it; that one is a healthy and vigorous fruit bearer cultivation does that for it. The tree, and all plants, must, like animals, have good and proper food. The g rub worm does not mind ashes, or lime, or sal the will crawl out of it; and I have tried, by wrapping them in these substances, to kill them, and they dont mind it. I tried it on both taken alive from a dead horse ; the both were not killed by it, nor by any of the articles given to a horse as remedies for both. This animal does not die, either in or out of a horse, by being enveloped in the articles. As to the p each trees wrapped a bandage and a mat over that, around the body of the tree, just under the for king of the branches, yet the worm ate down to the ground. All the remedies applied at the roots of the trees were, 1 have no doubt useful to the soil; they in vigor ate the tree, but they do not kill worms. Mr. Wakemanthere may be some ingredient in certain soils, which mixed with soot, ashes, or lime, may be disagreeable to the worm. At all events, we are looking for useful results in all our inquiries. Contradiction is itself often highly useful, in bringing out the truth which we desire. Chairman have adopted the following plan for my p each trees, during the last four or five years, I bore a piece of sheet lead, about six or seven. 95 7 inches wide, and place around the bottoms of the trees, putting the locid127eredge of the lead about an inch in the ground. I then fill the space between the tree and the lead with anthracite or wood ashes, or with sand. My trees so treated are healthy and bear well. Colonel Traversmr. Woolseyput wooden boxes around the roots of his p each trees, aid filled the space between the box and the tree with charcoal; these trees, he says, lived twenty years. Chairmanmr. Rose takes tarred paper, puts it around the tree, six, eight, or ten inches above the ground; takes it off in the autumn ; he also gives his trees special attention ; his peaches are excellent. I applied the lead plan to at least forty of my p each trees. Mr. Down send, of Astoria. Vein a on a visit to a friend in Norfolk street, n this city, last summer- I was struck with the fine healthy look of a p each tree in the yard. In inquiry, the lady of the house told me that every spring she poured a tea kettle of hot water upon the trunk of the tree, which ran down to the ground. This has been done for fifteen years, and the fruit was always good. Colonel Clark have no doubt that lime in the boxes would have a good effect; when moistened, it is powerful enough to affect the hand, and will destroy insects. Than Campbelllime would certainly prevent the approach of insects, I apprehend, and prevent its depositing its eggs. I recommend a sprinkling of lime once a week around the roots of p each trees from the beginning of April. Liver Smiththose insects which injure fruit deposit e their eggs in the fruit itself. Time does not reach or prevent that. When the insect is hatched, it then descends the tree and enters the ground. Colonel Clarkthe curculio preys on pear, plum, and some other trees, but does not touch the p each. The worm which destroys enters at the bottom of the p each trees, and bores between the bark and the wood. From the Southwestern Farmer, of July. Culti   Vati   Of Of Frui T Of The South. We will now examine into the cost, and look at what might be reasonably counted on, as to the profit of this culture. Fruit trees would cost, on an average, delivered on the farm, we will say 40 cents each. If planted 25 feet apart each way, 69 trees will be required, which are worth                            $27.60. The cost of cultivation, interest, and rent of land, will be paid for the first three years by the corn crop, so many hands not being required, and a profit realized by the sale of fruit, as well as the use of hands for the winter months at least. We will set this down, though, at only a stand off, and begin when the fruit is the only crop 35 acres land, worth say                                                                     $10.00 per acre=                 $350, interest 8 per it,                           $28.00Fruit trees -27 60 " 828, 'a) 66 24 pair of choice mules and wagon 300, c 24 00 fire of six hands,                                                                    $150 each 900, ' 72 00 good, clothing, doctors bills, taxes 240, " 19 20 sloughs, tools, &c, wear of gear, mules, &c. 100, " 8 00 taking, in all -a-                         $2,718 " 217 449 58 a.

Of Mustard. From the Ohio Cultivator. Mustard Crop In Ohi Opri Ces Offered For The Seed In Phi Ladelphi A. We have made inquiries respecting the success of our friends who attempted the cultivation of mustard seed in this State, the present season, and we learn that although some failed entirely, owing to the frosts and drought, the majority have succeeded remarkably well, considering the unfavorable ness of the season, and their want of experience in the business. The following are the principal lots or. Parmelee, Duncans Walls -27 acres. Mr. Tucking ham, Putnam -9 "or. Fly, Chillicothe -15 "or. Yers, Wanton -7 Three or four smaller lots, say -12 "taking in all seventy acres; and there may be other lots in the State, of which we have not heard. Mr. Parmelees crop is about as good as last years ay fourteen bushels per acre. Mr. Buckinghams is nearly as good. Mr. Flys, and the smaller lots, were somewhat injured; we have not learned the amount of the yield; probably not over seven to ten bushels per acre. This will give, for the whole amount, seven hundred bushels. We have just received a letter from Messrs C. J. Well & To, of Philadelphia, in answer to one from us, in which they generously say, that although the market price for seed is not well established, (and it may range lower than last year) yet, inasmuch as they may have been instrumental i a inducing some Ohio farmers to engage in its cultivation with the expectation that the same price would be given this year that was paid Mr. Parmelee last year, they now offer to pay that price (eight cents per pound in cash) for all Ohio seed that may be sent to them of as good quality (as heavy and clean) as was Mr. Parmelees last year ; to arrive at Philadelphia not later than the first of November. For seed of a less perfect quality they will pay a proportionate price; and to avoid any dissatisfaction, they offer to let the weigh master send us samples of the lots that arrive, and have us compare with seed of Mr. Parmelees last years crop, and say what deduction ought to be made in the price. The seed should be packed in good strong flour barrels, and shipped by way of Pittsburgh. The cost of transportation from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia is sixty cents per hundred weight. The Messrs. Well also inform us that they have shipped for us a box of small canisters of mustard, manufactured from Ohio seed, which we may distribute to persons engaged in its cultivation, and such others as we see fit. We will do so, with pleasure 9 60 a. From the Ohio Cultivator. Sales Of Ohi O Mustard Seed. Statement of the amount of Ohio mustard seed purchased by C. J.

Phi Ladelphi A, December, 1845. Dear Of  R: In compliance with your request, we hand you the above account of our purchases of -ohio brown mustard seed, of crop of 1845, up to 1st inst. There are several lots we are advised of on the way, not yet received. The quality of several of the above lots was much inferior tour, Parmelees last years crop; but, in a market with a limited supply, we asked no deduction, except in one case, the grower preferring to send sample before sending his seed, to know what deduction from our published offer we would expect. In that case we claimed one half cent per pound, which was satisfactory to the grower, and thus we have not been compelled to trouble you with samples for you to assess their value. We would, however, recommend farmers to clean their lands more thoroughly, and to deliver their seed in good order, fully ripened ; as, in a full market, many of the crops we have taken as prime would fall below that quality, and of course would have to be sold at a reduction from. market value of truly prime seed. We regret that all your farmers did not take advantage of our offer, made through your paper of September 15th, but sent their crops to other markets, two of which you will observe we have purchased in New York at 7 cents, New York price. We felt disappointed that our old " pioneer" Mr. Parmelee, should not have brought his crop direct to us and obtained Philadelphia price, as we expected from the tenor of a letter we had from him in August last, that his crop would have been better than last year; as he then informed us " that he had the same land again planted with mustard seed, and had expended                             $250 extra expenses in cultivating it" and that' the gathering of his crop was a four weeks job for twenty men' We expected that the result of such a crop would have shown our farmers that American soil and American labor will produce profit ably a crop of brown* This seed was raised by Thomas New, Muskingum conntyEditor Ohio Cullivatior. 61 mustard seed. You will observe that we have only the product of his brown seed. We learn that a portion of his 27 acres was planted with yellow or English seed, which explains why his crop has fallen off from last season. An you learn and inform us of the result of his yellow seed To what cause may it be attributed that he was at so great expense over that incurred by his neighbors in cultivating and harvesting the crop ?he suppose probably the yellow seed was the cause; or, perhaps, the planting the seed for two years on the same land. If this latter is the case, we should recommend no farmer to do it, for they not only incur a large amount of labor, but produce a seed much inferior to that raised on land planted with it for the first time; as Mr. Is crop was much inferior this year to any other crop we have purchased. We had intended to have given you the number of acres planted by each person we have purchased seed from, but we found we could not obtain it, and as the spring was so unfavorable to all crops, no certain data could be obtained from it. Very, respectfully, yours, &c. J. Fell & Br1o. M. B. Batehi Of, Esq. Remarkswe have not room nor time at present, but in our next, or the following number, we shall give some account of Mr. Parmelees operations, and we fear it will be our duty to show that his statements to Messrs. Well & Fro, and to others, have not all been in strict conformity with truth and fairness. It seems to have been his desire, from the first, to dissuade all others from engaging in the culture of this crop, in order that their competition might not tend to reduce his profits. We have little sympathy with such a spirit among farmersd. Ohi O Mustard Seed Cropi Of Culture. The amount of brown mustard seed raised in this State the past season we should judge was over 1,000 bushels. Of this we have before shown that Messrs. Well & Brother, of Philadelphia, purchased 76 o bushels, for which they paid, in cash,                          $2,669.78. These gentlemen were prepared to have taken a larger quantity at the same rate, had it been offered to them. The price paid by them for good seed, sent direct from Ohio, was eight cents per pound. Some that was sent to the New York market they bought at seven cents the average weight per bushel is 52 pounds) Quite a number of those who attempted its culture last year were unsuccessful, owing to the remarkable character of the season, and their want of experience. We presume a much larger quantity will be raised the coming season; but we are not sufficiently informed as to the extent of the demand at the east, to judge whether an" material reduction of price is to be anticipated from this increase of supply. We believe, however, that large quantities of the seed are annually imported for the Boston and Newyork manufacturers, and that no fears need be entertained of g putting the markets at present; though it is possible that a slight reduction of price may have to be submitted to hereafter. In fulfilling our promise to give full directions respecting the culture of mustard seed, we offer, first, the following experiments and observations by 619 62 He. No. 140.a very intelligent young farmer of Muskingumcounty, who has had one yeas experience in the business, and has derived some little advantage from' l| now ledge of the practice of Mr. Parmelee, who resides but a few his distant. We expect to be able next month to give a detailed account of Mr. Parmelees mode of culture, written by himself. In the cultivation of mustard seed. Fri End Bateham : In accordance with your request and my promise, made some time since, I will now give you an account of my last years experiment in the culture of brown mustard seed, together with such observations and suggestions as I think may prove serviceable to those who may desire information on this subject. The field that I sowed with this crop last spring was 10 acres; soil, alight rich, sandy loam, excepting about one acre, which was clayeytheprevious crop wheat. In one half of this field I applied, early in the spring, 100 two horse wagon loads of manure, and 600 sheep had been kept nightly on the lot for a month previous, so that it was well enriched before sloughing. By the 9th of April the soil was ploughed, harrowed, and rushed smooth, ready for sowing. I then with a small he made drills or trenches one inch deep and two wide, two feet apart; then, with a cup of seed in one hand, I sowed it by taking as much at a time as could be held between the thumb and finger, and scattering it along the drill, as near as I could judge, one inch apart. (I used about a quart of seed to the acre) A little practice enabled me to drop the seed quite regularly, and almost as fast as a horse would naturally walk before the plough, or at the rate of two and a half or three acres per day. The seed was covered to the depth of one quarter to one half inch, by having a boy draw a brush over the drills. The weather being very dry, and also cold, the plants did not make their appearance till 10 or 12 days after sowing; they then grew very rapidly for about two weeks, when the drought again stopped them for near a month. During this time the ground was kept clean of weeds by he and hand. The first time cleaning was 1 days' work. To have done it, in the best manner would have taken 18 days. Being somewhat at a loss to know whether to thin my plants or not, I rode down to Mr. Parmelees great field for information. I there found that his plants were at, least a week ahead of mine in growth, and that they were standing more than twice as thick in the rows. He had also made every alternate row one foot apart instead of two, so that he I fad about three times as many plants as I had to the same ground. After the first cleaning I tried using a shovel plough, but it covered weeds and plants together. I then made a small cultivate or, having five teeth, like little shovels, the size of ab mans hand ; this was the thing required, as it cut off the weeds and mellowed the soil without disturbing the plants. With this I went over the field three times in two weeks; then followed with the shovel plough, twice to a row, with boys to pull weeds out of the rows and uncover any plants that got buried. This left the field clear, of weeds, and finished the work till harvest. Not being quite certain as to the proper time or best manner of harvesting the crop, I again went to Mr. Parmelee for information; I there found that he delayed cutting till the ponds were dead ripe and the s talks nearly. 96 3 dry. It was then cut with sickle the kind with smooth edges, sometimes called grass sickles in this countryEditorand laid in small heaps for several days, to dry. 1 waited till my crop became sufficiently ripe, and had some knives or sickles made for the purpose, of a form that   found was quite an improvement on those sold at the shops. I give you a rough drawing of one, which will explain it. The handle is two feet in length, and of size to suit the hand. The blade resembles a sickle, but is less curved. The edge forms a regular half circle, say 12 inches in diameter, and the thank is so formed that a straight line drawn length wise of the handle would strike the edge at the middle of the curve, (as shown by the dots in the above cut) by this means, when using the knife, it is drawn with a sloping cut, instead of square across the s talks, as is usually the case with the common sickle, thus making easier work and causing less jar and waste of seed in cutting. At first, I cut, during all the working hours of the day; but perceiving that the seed shelled out much worse after the dew was off than before, I hired half a dozen hands to work for me at six and a quarter cents per hour each morning, from daylight' till the dew was of, during which time we cut about an acre each morning costing about                                                         $1.50. The cutting was, done from the 1st to the 10th of August. After leaving the s talks in the field till perfectly dry, I hauled them to the threshing floor on a s led, having a frame on top covered with canvass, 14 feet long and 12 feet wide, so as to catch the seed which shelled out. The threshing floor consisted of canvass, 12 feet wide and 20 feet long, surrounded on three sides with a strip of brown muslin, two yards widecid127supported by stakes) At the open end of this floor a sufficient number of sheets were spread to contain the s talks as brought from the field. In threshing, the s talks were laid head to head, in two rows along the floor 8 to 10 inches thick, then beaten with green hickory poles, 10 or 12 feet long, (we found them better than flails) till free from ponds and seed, Women threshed in this way, and raked off the coarse chaff, as fast as a r an and two boys brought the s talks on the s led, the distance varying from 10 to 40 rods. We threshed in a week the product of the field, amounting to about 50 bushels. After taking off the coarse chaff, which was easily done with a common rake, the seed was spread on a dry floor, where it lay for a month, being stirred three or four times a week to facilitate its drying the chaff and dust which remain prevent it from heating or becoming mildewed) When thoroughly dried, I cleaned the seed with a common fanning mill, passing it through twice, and the tailings three or four times. Observationsthe improvements that have been suggested to my mind by this experiment, are the following 1st. That the crop should be sown on sandy bottom soil, which is mellow, and not liable to suffer from drought; and sufficiently rich to afford nourishment to the plant and seed without the application of manure, as I have discovered that manure has a tendency to cause an excessive growth of s talks, with but little seed 9 64 2d. That it is better to have the rows arranged as Mr. Parmelee does the spaces alternately 1 foot and 2 feet wide; and the <a name="seeds123"><mark>seeds</mark></a> should not be dropped in a single line or row in the drills, but scattered along so that the young plants cover two or three inches in width in each row, thus :2 feet space 1 foot space. This will require about two quarts or three and a half pounds of seed per acre. -standing thus thickly, the s talks will be smaller and shorter than when thin, but a greater amount of seed will be obtained from the ground without any additional labor. D. It should be sown as early in the spring as the ground can be got in good order. Spring frosts will not injure the plants, and an early start will do much to protect them against injury from drought 4th. The utmost attention must be given to killing the weeds as soon as they make their appearance, and keep them out of the crop during its growth; otherwise the <a name="seeds124"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of weeds will become mixed with the mustard seed, and greatly injure its value 5th. After harvesting the crop, the ground should be thoroughly harrowed, which will cause the shelled <a name="seeds125"><mark>seeds</mark></a> to ve get ate. The plants will grow till frosts, when sheep should be turned in to eat them off. If this is not done, the mustard will be troublesome to any succeeding crop; and even with this precaution, some will appear the next year. Hours, &cPHI Of. Putnam, 0., January 22, 1846. Of. Parmelees Statementst Exami  Ned. In our January number we intimated that, in our opinion, some of Mrparmelees statements in regard to the culture and sale of his mustard seed have not been in strict conformity with truth and fairness. We greatly dislike to have any thing to do with personal disputes and accusations it too much resembles the conduct of partisan editors to suit our taste; but, in the present case, justice to honorable friends, to ourselves, and to a large number of our readers, seems to demand a few words from us in reply to statements made by Mr. Parmelee. Met us hear them. The first is a communication in the Panes ville Gazette, as follows :messrs. Parke & Bennett : Having observed in a recent number of your paper, and in others, notices respecting the cultivation of mustard, the tendency of which seems to be to get up a mania on this small article amongst cultivates, and to tempt to disastrous enterprise, Think it not amiss, for one, to hand in to you my experience in that way the last season, I planted twenty-eight acres with brown, and two acres with white must. 965 hard seed. Of the former, the yield was 805 bushels, and of the latter 15 bushels; in all, 320 bushels from 30 acres. The expense of the crop, delivered in New Work, was ~ll 89. For 289 bushels I received                                                         $1,117. The article being plenty, owing to a great influx of foreign seed, and most of it very beautiful and of superior quality, I was obliged to submit to a reduction of one cent per pound from the price obtained last year. For the white mustard seed there was no demand. One cultivate or from the northern part of New Work, with a large lot of some hundred bushels of white mustard seed, and a beautiful article, could not effect a sale of the whole at five cents per pound, which would be at the rate of two dollars and fifty cents per bushel. Comparatively, I consider the result in my own case fortunate, as several undertakings of the same kind around me proved entire failures owing, I judge, to the neglect of seasonable and thorough tillage. I have no doubt but the farmer who should apply the same labor in the careful drilling and hoping of wheat, upon the same land, which he would find it necessary to expend upon the same number of acres of mustard, would find himself much better compensated. J. H. Parmelee. Duxcans Falls, ,november 28, 1845. The next is an extract of a letter written by Mr. Parmelee to Messrs. C. J. Well & Brother, of Philadelphia, in August last, inquiring whether they wish to purchase his crop of seed. After stating that the quality of the crop is about the same as last year, or superior to it, he says : "up propos, while I write and perhaps you will doubt it here comes an agent from a house in Boston, proposing to buy my crop. He will give me eight cents per pound, less the cost of transportation to Philadelphia. I told him that, as we had some dealings, I preferred to sell to you, and that perhaps you were expecting the offer; and that I thought you would give me half a cent more a pound for an article that you know to be well saved, and not likely to sweat and heat. I want that much more to compensate me for extra trouble on account of the season. *a* *a* *a* He will call again. It may not be amiss to say, that the in gatherings of my crop is a four weeks' job for 20 men, and three weeks afterwards a man must be employed to shovel it up thoroughly, every day, as it lays in thechaffThe letter of which the foregoing is a part is the one to which allusion is made by Messrs. Well & Brother, in their communication published in our paper on the first of the past month. A full copy of the original has been furnished us, with a number of others relating to the same subject, by the Messrs. Well, at our request. This letter and the article from the Gazette we think are characteristic of their author. They are evidently dictated by the same spirit that induced him, a year ago, to complain bitterly of the Messrs. Well for allowing anything to be published respecting his large and profitable crop of mustard seed, and also of us for giving information respecting the mode of culture, &c, through the columns of our paper; thereby inducing a number of others to compete with him in the production of an article for which our country has hitherto been, and is still, mainly depend ant on Europe !a! Met us now briefly examine one or two of his statements He says, in the Gazette, that the yield of his recent crop of brown seed 66 was 305 bushels, and that for 289 bushels he received                                                         $1,1j17. Now, by referring to the table of Messrs. Well & Brother in our paper of last month, it will be seen that they paid him, through their agent in New Work for 15,843 pounds, (05 bushels) at seven cents per pound. (his would amount to                                                         $1,112; not go 77, as stated erroneously in the table) Behave also a copy of the letter of the agent in New Work, showing that the whole lot (82 barrels) of Mr. Is brown seed was purchased by him and shipped to Philadelphia. Again : He says he was obliged to submit to the reduction of one cent per pound on the previous years price, (8 cents) owing to the article being plenty, and a great influx of foreign seed. This is sheer game on, and contrasts finely with the story of the Boston agent offering him eight cents per pound. Besides, our readers are all aware that Messrs. Well & Brother made a standing offer, through our columns, of eight cents per pound for all good Ohio seed that might be sent, if shipped direct to Philadelphia and the only reason why he and one or two others were obliged to accept of a lower price was, because they chose not to comply with this liberal offer, but took their seed to the . New York market, and, after trying in vain to obtain a higher or as high price for it there, c offered to sell it to the . Messrs. Well at the price offered by them in Ohio; but, like highmirfded and honorable men, as they are, they very properly told them, since they had not seen fit to comply with their offer, but had taken their goods to other markets, they might sell them in those markets for whatever was then and there the market price. Another reason, we are informed, why Mr. Did not receive a higher price for his seed, was, its quality was much inferior to his previous years crop; part of it being unripe, and a part of it sprouted. To far from an unusual influx of foreign seed having caused a decline of price, it will be seen, on referring to our paper of January 1,the Messrs. Well expressly declare that the supply in market was limited he come now to the extraordinary statement, that "the in gathering of his crop was a four weeks' job for 20 men." To show how much truth there is in this, it is only necessary for us to say that we have recently seen and conversed with several of the men who were in his employ during the whole time, and they informed us that 20 men were only employed for 10 or 11 days, then 12 to 16 men for 9 or 10 days, then 4 men for 5 or 6 days in taking and shovel long the seed; making in all about 380 days' work, or 100 less than stated by Mr. P. When, too, it remains to be shown what kind of days' work these were. We learn that the laborers were all Germans, who reside at Taylorsville, seven miles distant from the mustard field ; that they had to row in a boat that distance down the river, and back, each morning and evening, so that their usual time of commencing labor was 8 o clock, and of leaving, 4 to 5 o clock; thus losing, as all must perceive, the best portions of summer days for labor. They were paid at the rate of 50 cents per day, dinners found, or 56 cents without l dinners. a. 967APpEND I X 6 to. 18. Of The Culture Of' The Madi A Sati   Of, A New Oleagi Nous Plaattranslated from the Journal des Connaisances Usuelles et Pratiques for 1841, by E. Goodrichsmith, of the Patent Officewe reply to the question addressed to us on the subject of the usefulness of the media saliva, by the following note The plant called media saliva is a native of Phil i. It was formerly known under the name of mad i; it belongs to the dycotyledonous plants, with corymbiferous flowers, and of the class and order diognesia polygamiasuperflue. There are three species noticed, which are probably only varieties of the same type, viz : the media saliva, the media mellow a, or wild mania, and the media viscous a. This plant has been cultivated from time immemorial, in Phil i, for the sake of its oil, which, in the preparation of food, and for economical purposes, rivals the olive oil, although it has a less agreeable taste than this latter. The root of the plant is a tap root, whitish; the stalk is sebaceous, fibrous, branching, about the height of a metre to a metre and 90 centimetres; it is furnished with numerous alternate leaves, linear lance o late, pointed, very perfect, from 10 to 15 centimetres in length, resembling those of the rose laurel of a deep green, covered, as well as the stalk and branches, with short, whitish, coarse hairs; the flowers are yellow, nearly sessile, aggregate at the extremity of the branches, or in junction of the leaves to the stem; the call x is spherical, egg shaped, hairy, with small linear leaves; the flowers are numerous, hermaphrodites, three toothed; the <a name="seeds126"><mark>seeds</mark></a> about a centimetres and a half in length, covered with a blackish thin skin, and which becomes gray on being dried, convex on one side and flattened on the other; in this covering there is a bitter principle, which imparts to the oil of this seed a disagreeable taste for persons not accustomed to it. The media imported from Phil i by the Jesuit Father Neville had been already cultivated in Europe about the year 1760; but its culture was abandoned, doubtless because at that period the plants which required careful cultivation were little known in general culture. The last year, new efforts have been made to introduce into our agriculture this oil plant. These attempts have best succeeded in Germany and since then, the agriculturists in the east of France have, in various places, sought to introduce it as a plant more easy to cultivate than thecolza, rape, or poppy. The advantage offered by the media is, that it is not difficult in the choice of soil, remains only three months in the ground, and can therefore be sown as late as 15th May a very important particular. The oil of this plant is rich, of good taste when fresh and cold pressed, after a slight washing of the seed with acid elated water; when used for the manufacture of soap, it makes a solid soap; it burns well, and is as good for cooking as olive oil 968 a. Culturethe period most favorable for sowing the media in France appears to be from the middle of April to the 20th of May; it is sown, broadcast, in a well prepared mellow soil, the quantity of seed being 10kilogrammes to a hectare. As soon as the plant is sufficiently high to be easily distinguished, the seed is thinned out, and then, by pulling up at the first hoping, not more than one plant is left for 28 centimetres in all directions. After a month, it receives a second hoping; and a third, too, if necessary. The seed springs up in about 10 to 12 days. The third hoping is an expense and practice which is very useful, as it consolidated the plant and gives it a new force, and causes it to seed. While this hoping is going on, the plant, just before it flowers, exhales a peculiar noxious, disagreeable odor, and a viscous greasy matter exudes from it similar to chorophylle, and which sticks to the clothes of the laborers; it is removed with difficulty let only can make it disappear. Some have sown it in a hot bed, and pricked it in 33 centimetres apart. This method is longer and more troublesome, but has the advantage of a remarkable increase in the abundance of seed. Harvestingthe harvest takes place 90 to 100 days after it is sown the moment is chosen when the flowers appear to be well furnished with seed, for they bear seed while not ripe, and before the flowers have disappeared. The seed should be gathered after the plantation has been examined and the flowers opened; a part of the seed not ripe grows better by drying the plant after cutting the stalk. The plant should be cut rather than pulled up; it may be cut either with sick les or scissors, as is done in p runing trees. The s talks are placed in bundles, joining them head to head, and inclining towards the foot. When the plant is dry, it is placed on vans, to carry it to a cart provided with a cloth. All these operations must be performed with care, for the loss of the seed lessens the profits of its cultivation. If the plant has been well cultivated and gathered carefully, from 13 to 1 600 kilogrammes of seed are obtained from a hectare. Birds and poultry are delighted with the seed; it is necessary, when ripe, to keep them away, for they destroy more than they consume. When the plant is got in, it is allowed again to dry before the last <a name="seeds127"><mark>seeds</mark></a> are ripe, that they may be more easily detached by threshing. The odor which is exhaled, and yet more the hairs which are on the plant, prevent a careful threshing, because the operations are inconvenient it is necessary, therefore, to watch with attention this work. The seed is exposed in a heap in the granary, where it soon takes a deep gray color. It produces, in that state, nearly 28 kilogrammes of oil to 100kilogrammes of seed. A hectolitre weighs from 50 to 51 kilogrammes. The oil, when expressed cold, is from 13 to 161 kilogrammes for 100kilogrammes of seed, and, when expressed hot, from 11 to 12 kilogrammesfor 100 kilogrammes of seed. In the extraction of the oil The oil of the media, very rich and taste less, at first, leaves a taste afterwards which is very disagreeable : a very simple and convenient method of taking away this taste of the oil, which is to be used for food, consists in washing in warm acid elated water the seed of media. Method of obtaining the oil of the media saliva, "without its bad taste To water of the temperature of 40 to 500, (probably Reaumur) is added. 99 a centi6me of sulphuric acid ; the grain is washed in it, then rinsed off with clear water, to take away all the acid, when it is left to dry, in order afterwards to extract the oil. Obtained in this way, the oil has no other taste, and is good for using with food, and very superior to nut, poppy, cold ac, oil. To give it the taste of olive oil, we have only to add 1 kilogramme of olive paste, free from water, in 50 kilogrammes of the media oil, and filter it after a month of maceration ; then it may be used for salad, so as to deceive amateurs. This oil burns well : it lasts longer than that of col nail, and is easily purified by washing in acid elated water. From what has been said, it may be concluded that it is profitable to cultivate this plant, which is only three months in reaching its entire development; which, in the ground, is exposed to none of the chances of theColza, so difficult to cultivate, so fearful of the frost, and so often destroyed by the fly, which never attacks the media. If a hectare produced no more than 1,200 kilogrammes of seed, and 400kilogrammes of oil, this plant would afford a large profit to the cultivate or. We hope that this notice will engage the attention of cultivates who have not yet attempted the culture of this plant, and induce them to make the trial. The s talks, &c, of the media cannot be used except for burning or to make a good manure by their decomposition. M.

Deaa Of  R : Your letter of nest came to hand on Saturday; lit being much engaged, I had not leisure to give the subject matter that attention i its importance required. The be ne plait was introduced into the West I india islands from Africa, and subsequently in some sections of the United States. South Carolina and Georgia, I believe, are States in which this plant has been cultivated. The seed yields a great abundance of oil; and so great is the product, that I am unwilling to state how much oil is produced from a huidrledpounds of seed, fearing the proportion would appear so large as to be almost incredible. The plant is useful as a medicine, and I enclose a small printed sheet which I obtained from Mr. Thorburns seed store, for your information on that head. More than twenty years ago I purchased several cases of the oil of the be ne seed, from Messrs. Buy dam & Wyckoff, merchants, (then doing business in South street, New Work) made from seed sent to that house from a correspondent in Georgia, or South Carolina. The seed was sent to a linseed oil mill in this vicinity, where it was crushed and pressed. A portion of the oil was obtained by cold pressing, the residue by hot pressing. The cold pressed oil was light colored and flavor less; the hot pressed was a little colored, and had the peculiar smell of nut oil. I purchased this oil at a low price, for the purpose of making soap; but, finding it contained too much mucin age, I was induced to make sale of it to the house of Clark & To, druggists, Maiden Lane, New Work. The Messrs. Clark paid me two dollars per gallon foi the cold pressed, and 90 cents per gallon for the hot pressed oil. Mr. Wyckoff used the cold pressed oil for table oil, and found it excellent. The plant is easily cultivated, and yields abundantly in seed, but requires a warm latitude. I will send you, the first opportunity by private hand, some of the seed for distribution; and I will examine among my oil samples for a sample of the oil, which I will also send you, if I find, after being kept on hand i more than twenty-five years, it is a good sample of the article.

It has been supposed that the lives of a great number of children have been saved by it, wherever it has been used. In some instances it has been administered with perfect safety to infants only a few days old. a. 971NEW York Farmers' Club. December 2, 1845. A communication was read from Paul Duggan, esq, Professor of the Arts of Design at the I institute, now at Curagoa, transmitting with it a parcel of be ne nuts. Mr. Duggan states that the botany cal name of this oil nut is guilandina morning a of Linnmes. It is of the family faguminosa. It is a native of the I indian Archipelago is grown also in some, parts of the British I india peninsula; that it was introduced many years ago into Curaeoa, but only lately considered of value. The trees from which these nuts were taken are not fully grown, being only three years old. The oil of this nut is slightly colored has little smell. It should be free from color and without smell. The oil from the be ne nut does not conceal is excellent for the movements of the watch, and for machinery. The abraded parts of machinery moving in it are precipitated in it; and when applied ti paper or other substances, this oil will so perfectly e vapor ate as to leave no residue. New York Farmer and Mechanics. Bene Of L. To the Editors of the . New York Farmer and Mechanicgentlemen: The oil of be ne seed is a valuable article. The seed yields very abundantly in oil, and the plant is of easy cultivation. Some years ago, Messrs. Buy dam & Wyckoff, then doing business in South street, received a large quantity of be ne seed from one of their correspondents in South Carolina or Georgia. The seed was sent to an oil mill here for pressing. The oil made from this seed was part of it produced by cold pressing, and the residue by hot pressing. The hot pressed oil possessed the flavor of nut oil, and was slightly colored. The cold pressed oil was color less and without smell, sweet, and was a good table oil. The oil was un sale able here, and I purchased the entire lot at a low price; but finding that it was not a good oil for making soap, in consequence of the mucillage it contained, I sold it to the druggists. Messrs. Clark & To, then doing business in Maiden Lane, purchased the cold pressed oil at                          $2 per gallon, and the hot pressed at 90 cents per gallon. I noticed that a sample of be ne oil had been presented at the last meeting of the Farmers' Club, which prompts this communication. I have, among my oil specimens, the expressed oil of the face, the poppy seed oil, oil of cotton seed, oil of the palm, cocoa nut oil, ground nut oil, oil of the olive, and oil of the castor bean. These oils are variously affected by cold, and all of them become ran did by age and change of temperature. The poppy seed oil is often sold for olive oil; but for many purposes it is unfit for use, in consequence of the mucillage it contains. Place this oil upon a heated iron plate, and it will, in evaporating, coat it with a varnish; it is, therefore, unfit for oiling wool. Hours, &c. Meri 972 a. Appendi X No. 20. Broccoli   And Cucumberc. Culti   Vati   Of Of Broccoli  . Astori A, Angry, 1846. Of  R: The cultivation of this most delicious and beautiful vegetable is less known and less attended to in this country than its merits deserve. It is just as easy to grow as a cabbage, and comes into use when most of the summer vegetables have passed away. Any soil that will grow a cabbage, or a cauliflower, will grow a brow coli. It requires, however, to be richly manured; and by far the best manure is from the cow yard. This is equally true with respect to the cultivation of every species of cabbage and let tube. All these plants feed grossly, and will not refuse even fresh cow manure. It is well to know this fact, because sometimes, in the absence of other manures, it may be convenient, if not absolutely necessary, for the gardener to use it; and if he had his choice, he could not select better. The red cape brow coli seems most congenial to this climate. The seed should be sown about the middle of May, in a shady border, if convenient; for the plant is naturally hardy, and thrives best in cool rather than in hot weather. To soon as the plants shoot up to the height of two or three inches, they should be planted out in rows six inches apart, and four inches in the row. This will give them ample space to grow straight, stock y, and strong. When grown to the height of seven or eight inches, they will be of suitable size and strength to trans plant into the ground prepared for them, fresh manured, and fresh dug a spit and a half deep, with the manure turned in as near the bottom as convenient, to guard against the drought of August and September. The roots are sure to find their food. Give the plants a liberal space in rows three feet asunder, and three feet in the rows, for the leaf grows longer though narrower than the cabbage. The last season I planted out mybroccoli upon the same ground that I used in growing cauliflowers; and, by fresh maturing and fresh digging, obtained two full crops. They will begin to fruit the beginning of October, and continue fruiting until the middle of November. Cry as the season proved, I grew last year at Astoria, New Work, the finest brow coli I ever saw. Any of the heads measured two feet seven inches in circumference, with a fine solid compact pulp. I attribute this unusual growth and health fulness of the plants more to the character of the manure and depth of digging than to any other cause. The natural moisture of the manure was checked in its evaporation by its depth in the earth. I believe there was not a plant that did not fruit. If the main stalk, after cutting off the head and trimming the leaves, be left standing, fresh stems with small heads will shoot out round the top, very fine and tender. If the autumn proves dry, fork up the earth between the rows. It is far better and less labor than to use the water pot. A skilful gardener will watch his opportunity, and seize a wet day for transplanting; but, if he doubts the continuance of wet weather, it is a good and always a successful plan to mix mould and manure in a bucket of water, and immense the. 973root0 of the plants before setting them. Follow this plan, and you will not lose a single plant, wet or dry. Your obedient servant, Juni Of Smi  Of. On. E. Burkeextract of a letter from James Coppuck, dated Count Folly, N.

Last fall I planted a few cucumber <a name="seeds128"><mark>seeds</mark></a> in the following way, as directed by a friend, with no other view than the mere product of fruit: "I dug a circular pit about 8 or 10 inches deep, 2 g feet diameter; this I then filled to within 3 or 4 inches of its top with a mixture of one third earth and two thirds how pen manure, over which I placed an inch or two of earth, forming a concave hollow; around the periphery I planted a few <a name="seeds129"><mark>seeds</mark></a> thus, 0: as shown by the dots around the circle. When the plants had grown to a proper size, I then placed around the bed a support of sticks diverting from the centre in a vertical direction of about 350 or 400 thus, so that a person might readily pass around and under the vines to collect the fruit. I observed that the vines running south produced by far the most fruit north, but few; whilst those running east and west, each an intermediate proportion. This was steadily so from their flowering until frost 6 One bed of this size will produce from 8 to 12 and 20 cucumbers a day; and, if the fruit is not suffered to get old on the vines, it will bloom and keep vigorous the entire summer.

I have tried a great many kinds of let tube, but have found none to come anything near the quality of this kind.

I have also sent you three <a name="seeds130"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of the African pump kin. I had a few <a name="seeds131"><mark>seeds</mark></a> sent me last year, (spring) but, by neglect, they were not planted until late in the season, and consequently had not time to mature its fruit.

The <a name="seeds132"><mark>seeds</mark></a> sent you are a part of those sent me from Africa: the seed did not mature in those I raised last year. Cultivate like the common pump kin.

Appendi X No. 21. I Of I G. From the American Agriculturists of November 1845. Culture Of I Ndi Of. It being quite out of the question to make a living in my neighborhood by cotton planting, I am turning my attention to something else. Sugar is the first article to attract attention, as it is extremely profitable. but it requires a fortune to begin with, and is out of my reach. I indigo, I have thought, might answer; but, from a small trial I have just made, it does not appear so. My little trial, it is true, is not a fair test; but, such as it is, you shall have it. I planted, early in the spring, a piece of new ground in indigo, on which nothing had ever previously been planted; and after leaving plants enough to give me seed for another year, cut and measured a piece of the following dimensions, viz: 1,176 links of the English surveyors chain, by 150 links, which, multiplied into each other, gives 176,400; dividing this by 100,000,the number of square links in an acre, it gives somewhat more than one acre and three quarters. From this I cut weeds to fill four troughs or vats, which, after being filled with the weed, held 120 gallons of water, which, after sleeping about seven hours in the daytime, or eleven hours at night, I drew off into another vat, and beat from forty to fifty minutes, when I found that it would readily settle, and put in the lime water (about one quart) for that purpose, keeping the f roth down, of course, with oil. In this last trough or vat I had two s pilot holes, one above the other, and from one     allowed the far greater part of the water to run, and then drew out the indigo and the remainder of the water in a rather coarse cotton cloth, placed in a box with holes in the bottom of it, the cloth acting as a s trainer, and the holes in the bottom of the box letting the water run from the indigo. His put in a press for twenty-four hours, in a wooden frame placed on a bench, with grooves, or rather saw cuts, across it, to allow the remainder of the water to run out. I now took out the indigo, still wet, cut it in pieces, and dried it in the sun; out of the sun it appeared to be impossible to dry it. When the indigo was taken out of the press, each making averaged about seven pounds, or twenty-seven pounds in the whole. I have just now weighed it, when perfectly dry, and the whole weighs only three pounds. Now, at this rate indigo Would be rather worse than cotton ; but I have not given it a fair trial. It was planted too wide apart, and not cultivated as it ought to have been, in consequence of the cold and wet spring drawing my attention to work of more consequence. A neighbor of mine, an old indigo planter, has just one acre of ground in indigo; he has cut his first crop from it, and assures me that he has made fifty pounds from it, and expects twenty-five pounds more from a second cutting. From the samples of indigo I have seen bought by my neighbors, most of whom spin and weave, f am quite certain that it is much adult era ted with some other substance; and they assure me that it is sometimes so bad it will not dye at all. Mr. An dry, my neighbor above spoken oft has sold what little he
75made at     $9.25 per pound, or half a dollar per pound more than the usual retail price of the imported indigo. I send you samples of both his and mine, which I will thank you to give to some d yer to ascertain the value of, it i your market, and also a few small lumps of blue, which is three parts starch. Mr. An dry says that I do not beat my indigo long enough, and lose by it in that way, and that I sun it too much, and make it too light. He smokes his, but I cannot clearly comprehend what good that does. It appears to me impossible to take in and secure a crop of more than one and a half acre to the hand, and this planted at three different times, that it may ripe n gradually, and not all at once and, indeed, not so much in ra wet summer, of which we have too many, sometimes raining for sixty days, with no more than two or three days' intermission, which nearly destroys cotton crops, and might be even worse on indigo. The purport of this letter is to elicit a detailed and full account, from some practical indigo planter, of the whole process of making it, as well as to ascertain the price at your market of such qualities as I send you. All the accounts that I have seen on the subject are meagre indeed; nothing at all calculated to make an indigo planter. Phi Of   P Of Nfree. Acid 127) Of Ver, Of, Ll gust, 1845. We have but recently received the samples of indigo spoken of aboveand1not being acquainted with any practical cultivate or of it, we handed them over to Mr. Cartridge, an extensive dealer in dye stuffs in the city, for information. The following is his reply. It must be premised that he puts down the wholesale prices the samples might probably bring in the city; whereas Mr. In free speaks of retail prices in the interior of the country. We shall feel grateful to any of our readers who can furnish us further information on the culture of indigo in this country. We do believe it would pay the southern planter well, if he only knew the proper method of cultivating it. Dear I : I have examined the samples of indigo sent you by P. In free, esq. The fine samples mixed with starch may be worth about 30 cents per pound for blueing clothes when washed. The squares sent loose in the box, and full of white, or rather drab colored specks, might sell at 50 cents per pound. The sample from Mr. An dry could scarcely be sold at 50 cents, but might bring more, if, on trial, it should work better than its appearance indicates. The sample of Mr. In free is much inferior to all the others, and I much doubt if we could persuade a regular consumer to buy it at any price, as it has evidently been injured in the making. The best violet and blue Bengal indigo is selling at about                                                         $1.40 per pound. We are selling prime consume able quantities of Bengal at from                                                         $1.15 to                                                         $1.20. Crime Guatemala is selling at from                                                         $1 to                                                         $1.10 per pound; one pound of the latter being worth at least twice as much as any sample sent in the box, judging from appearances. There is certainly something wrong in the manipulations of all these indigo makers. Query 1st. To they not leave the plant to pass its period of maturity before cutting ?a? Mr. Dalrymple informed me that it should be cut when in full flower; another Last I india maker, that it should be cut before the flowers come out in blossom. They all agree that if left too long, the indigo produced will be less in quantity and of inferior quality 9 76 a. Query 2d. To they not cut the plant too soon after rain ?a? for it appears that it should have several days of dry weather before cutting. Query D. To they not ferment too much, or too little ?a? In making indigo in the Last In dies, they judge of the sleeping by the color and the smell of the liquor. Sometimes it is complete in six hours, at other times it requires twenty hours. This variation in the ferment active process may often arise from the state of the weather before cutting; for, if moist from rain, the, ferment at ion will certainly proceed more rapidly than when the weather has been previously dry for several days. It may be influenced also from the state of the plant when cut; whether it has arrived at full maturity, as described by Mr. Dalrymple, or whether cut before bursting into flower; as the latter would undoubtedly ferment more rapidly than the former, the condition of the plant being more succulent. The state of atmosphere during the process of sleeping must have a decided effect in either hastening or retarding the ferment at ion; for when it is clear and dry, the ferment at ion will not be so rapid as when it is hot and moist. I tis in this operation that more skill is required than in all others; and unless the operator understands this point, and attends particularly to it, no profit can be derived from the manufacture. Some of the best indigo I ever used in England was made in South Carolina, by the late General Made Hampton, who informed me by letter, many years since, that the art of making was lost in this country. I presume, however, that it may be recovered again by repeated experiments. In Mr. In frees letter he states that the seasons are often very wet, it sometimes raining for sixty days in succession, with only two or three days intermission; now such a season must be too moist for the indigo fera. With regard to the beating, it must be continued until all the green particles have become sufficiently acid sized to precipitate; for whatever portion remains in a green state will be lost, this portion being so ruble in water. Of Lli   Of Partri Dge. Mr. Allen. From the American Agriculturists, February, 1846. Culture Of I Ndi Of. I noticed some letters in your last volume upon the culture of indigo and as it is one of the subjects to which you originally invited my attention, I will proceed to state, as shortly as may be, what I learned in my youth upon this matter. My father grew indigo, as a crop, until I was sixteen years of age, and was considered to have made a good article. The laborers are divided into gangs of ten, and are expected to cultivate 30 acres to the gang. The soil should be moist, whether loam or clay, well drained, and divided by small trenches 24 feet apart. The indigo is drilled 14 inches between the drills. The seed is very small, and should be soaked for a night, then mixed in dry ashes or sand, and sown along the drill carefully and regularly. Your quarts of seed, carefully sown and well mixed in ashes, are enough for an acre. In this climate the seed should be sown in the first week in April. When it first comes up, it resembles v white c lover or ulcer ne, and should have the grass carefully picked by hand from the drill. When it is an inch or two high, it must be needed. 77 between the rows, and the soil loosened about the roots. ; Three weddings are enough before the first cutting, which should commence about the first week of July, or as soon as the indigo begins to throw out its bloom. S^: I indigo vats. For every set of ten hands, there should be what are called a set of works. These formerly cost about                                                                         $100 or more, and were a vat or tank, made of plank two inches thick, well joined. This vat (a) is 20 feet square, stands upon posts 4 feet from the ground, and is kept tight by wedges driven intothe sleepers upon which the plank rests. The vat is 3 feet deep, and is called the steeper. Alongside of it is another vat, (b) 20 feet by 10, occupying the, space between the bottom of the steeper and the ground, into which the water is drawn in which the indigo is stepped when ready to be beat, or churned, as we may say. At the end of this last vat, a small tank or case (e) must be placed, to furnish lime water in the process of beating. The liquor is drawn from the steep era) by a s pilot at the bottom of the vat along the better, (b) Length wise of this is stretched a beam, (c) resting :on its upper end, and revolving, on journals, and furnished with cross arms, to the ends of which are fixed open buckets without bottoms, containing about two gallons each. Two men, standing on this beam with ah and spike fixed to the long learn, alternately plunge the open buckets right and left, thus churning the liquid until it begins to show a blue feu la, which is produced by small quantities drawn from the lime case, (e indigo, is so easily injured by the sun after being cut, that the cutting begins and ends in the afternoon. As it is cut by the common sickle or reap hook, it is carried either to a shed or conveyed and placed immediately in the steeper, where it is carefully spread. When the indigo is placed in the, steeper from 2 to 2, feet deep, pieces of scant long are placed across the indigo weed to keep it down, and from rising as the water is pumped upon it out of the reservoir. This operation should be accomplished about sunset4ada steeper of this size usually takes about an acre of ordinary indigo weed to. fill it. The time of sleeping is usually from 9 to 10 hours, depending upon the temperature of the water. The warmer it is, the sooner the process is over. But when the water assumes a light olive color, it is time to draw the water into the, better, and the process of beating comme     n ces, which is continued until the fluid becomes lighter in its general shade, and blue feu la begins to show in the water; which the sooner begins from small quantities of lime water having been let run by a s pilot, from the lime water case, from time to time, during the process. After the. feu la shows itself distinctly in the water, the vat is left to repose for four hours, when the water is slowly drawn off by holes at different heights62i978 so as to allow the indigo to subside to the bottom. As soon as it has done so, it is carefully collected into bags, which are hung up to drain. Wheasufficiently drained, it is placed in boxes two feet by one foot, to dry under gentle pressure. When sufficiently firm, it is divided into squares, by a rule and some sharp instrument, and placed under the shade to dry commonly in the upper story of a house. The varieties of indigo were produced by the time in sleeping, in beating, in living. The shorter sleeping and less beating produced the f latent, or light blue indigo. But in looking back upon this process, I am astonished at remembering the indifferent and often turbid water that was used in sleeping the indigo, which must have injured its quality. In the dyeing houses of England a filtering apparatus is made, by four boards nailed together, 20 feet long and a foot square, which is filled with coarse sand or fine gravel, with the ends stopped by two other boards with very small holes in them, and the water used is drawn through this wooden filter, from the reservoir out of doors to the vat within the house, which purified the water. This could easily be done here. Again, the frequent rain showers that occur in our common summers must have often disturbed both the process of sleeping and beating, and thus injured the indigo. From all these causes, the warm process first introduced by Dr. Anderson, of Had ras, and described by him in the Annual Register of Calcutta, and given in a note appended to Bryan Edwardss History of the West In dies, must be altogether preferable. This process is under cover, and it is only stepped two hours, the water being heated to 160 degrees. A house 30 by 20 feet would contain two sleepers 10 feet square, and two b eaters 5 feet by 10, the heating apparatus being placed between them, and would, as I think, take off twice the quantity of indigo in a day, besides continuing the process after, by the usual one, when the nights had become too cold. In Georgia the I indigo gave two cuttings, and usually 60 pounds of indigo, in the two, to the acre, which for three acres is 180 pounds to the hand. With the warm water process, I see no reason to doubt we would have three cuttings, better quality of indigo, and probably more of it; and this or. Anderson stated is the case. My indigo house has been built now two years, and I have only been prevented by the un toward seasons of the two years past from carrying out his plan. The following is addressed to yourself and Mr. Cartridge, whose communications upon this and other subjects I greatly value. Why not throw steam into your steeper for 10 or 15 minutes, and then pump the water from your tank? What is a little curious, steam allowed to pass off at the boiling point just heats to 160 degrees, the very point which Dr. Anderson found the proper temperature for extracting, or, as I would say, taking of the coloring matter from the weed. Again, we find, in all applications of steam, it acts more promptly and more perfectly than water, as witness the Turkish bath. By this process much labor would be saved in heating theater. We would have also an exact measure of heat, and experience would soon give the due measure of time. Nothing but my age and infirmityes, combined with two bad seasons, have prevented my carrying at the experiment; but I would be gratified at having Mr. Cartridges opinion upon the subject n .on: the subject.

Gobdriah Smith, of the Patent Officeon The Of Ganti   C Spurryby M. Bossi  N. The spergula maxim a (D.: Rechenbach) is an annual, and indigenous to Your land and Livonian, and grows there spontaneously; its s talks are about I metre to 1 metre 40 centimetres high, while those of, ordinary scurry do not exceed 60 centimetres, and those of the small from 15 to 20 centimetres. At the height of one foot it shoots forth 5, 6, and sometimes 10 stems; its growth is as rapid as that of the common scurry, and we cat easily obtain two harvests in a year. Like the latter, it furnishes, when green, an excellent fodder, which is peculiarly adapted to much line, the talk of which it increases at the same time that it improves the quality. The fodder is equally acceptable to sheep and swine, with which it agrees excellent ly. When, in the first harvest, it is left to seed, the <a name="seeds133"><mark>seeds</mark></a> which disperse themselves are sufficient, after one sloughing, to procure a very good autumnal pasture, which lasts till December, or even sometimes later. It is one of the first of the green fodders which is gathered, and which is enjoyed the longest period. The culture of this plant, when not left to bear seed, improves the soil, or at least does not exhaust it. I to seed, like that of flax, must be renewed from time to time, so as not to deteriorate. The gigantic scurry best succeeds, in my opinion, on sandy soils; but it grows vigorously on the poorest soils, as also on good ones, provided they are not too strong. I have observed that it succeeds best when sown in April, when the soil is well dried, mellow, and carefully harrowed before sowing. It is an excellent preparatory crop for rye, as it can be cut, then ploughed and manured, in season ; or, better still, sow scurry a second time, which may be cut green time enough for sowing rye by Michaelmas day. I have not manured for scurry myself, but it succeeds best when a slight manure is given to the soil. It must not be cut too soon, because the gigantic scurry grows with vigor during its flowering season. It is very useful to destroy the parasite herbs, as it grows very rapidly, and these plants do not begin to flower before the spergula maxim a is ready to cut. For my sowing I have employed for a morgen (25 to 30 acres) from 4 to 5 kilogrammes of seed. I believe that in fertile lands 3 to 3- kilogrammes would be sufficient. It was in 1839 that M. Malpeyre, s en, and myself, obtained the seed. He cultivated it by comparison with the common scurry sown in July, beside it, at the same period. The gigantic scurry reached to the height of about 1 metre, while the common scurry only reached that of from 15 to 25 centimetres. Experiments were tried again in 1840. Notwithstanding the great drought, I obtained in my fields of Him ones (seine and Rise) then most satisfactory results. Down in April, the s talks which I presented to the 9 80 a. Royal Societies of Agriculture and Horticulture of Paris, and other learned societies, were from 100 to 110 centimetres long. M. Descolombiers, president of the Agricultural Society of the Allied, and of the agricultural committee of Bourbon lArchambault, did me the honor to write me June 28, 1840, as follows: "I have read, monsieur, with the greatest pleasure, in the Propagateur duCantal, that you have the spergula maxim a, which I have vainly attempted to procure anew, having lost it 15 years since. If you can give me a small parcel to sow by the first rains of August, I shall hope to obtain a crop of seed in this autumn, if the frost is delayed, and I shall be most grateful for the favor." I ask you also to allow me to re publish in the journal of the Agricultural Society of Allied the article which you have addressed to M. Richard, editor of the Propagateur du Want al, on that interesting plant, which yielded 600 kilogrammes of dry straw on a little more than 6 acres straw which my cattle ate eagerly, and equal to the best hay received the following letter from the same zealous and persevering agriculturists, dated the 18th of February, 1841: " My scurry has reached the height of 60 to 65 centimetres, and given plenty of seed, though the weather has been very unfavorable; for the ordinary scurry, sown beside it by way of comparison, has only reached to 15 or 20 centimetres. M. the Marquis of Faint Georges, my brother in law, who, very little favorable to scurry, showed himself distrustful, having noticed the contrast, proposes also to sow the spergula maxim a the next spring on a great scale hope, then, that new trials will serve this year to sustain our experiments ; and if, as I believe, the gigantic scurry may be easily cultivated in France, it will be for agriculture a great reliance; for, what we want in autumn especially is green fodder.

Breckdear in: I observed an article in a late number of your valuable paper describing the system of managing milk in Devonshireengland, viz. "whether intended for the c turn or otherwise, it is scolded immediately as it is strained from the cow; after this operation it does not, sour so soon, even in summer; and, if it is intended for butter making, you i have sweet milk for family use after the cream is taken off. In winter, such cream will net require more than 15 minutes churning to bring it into butter have no doubt, sir, but the above system of management will produce all the results there stated. It will also cause the cream to rise more rapidly and in greater quantity. Even warming the pans into which the milk is put will produce the latter effect, but in a less degree. But, sir, is it equally tried that such a system of managing milk would produce good butter Will it not be paler and softer, and, from the greater quantity of ca seine or cure which will be produced by such a system, will it not be more liable to become ran did, if kept for a length of time, than if the milk had not been scolded 3 .;I t is certainly very important to know the different modes of managing the dairy in different countries, and in different parts of the same country for in my opinion, there is no art in agriculture so shrouded in darkness as that of battermakingif the butter generally found in the markets is a proper criterion to judge by. But there are so many circumstances which affect the quality of butter, that it would not always be advisable to adopt the exact practice of another country, or of another district of your own country, nor even that pursued on another farm in your neighborhood. In different seasons, also, the same farm will produce a different quality of butter. The constitution of the cow, the condition she is in, the kind of treatment she receives, the breeds he is of, the kinds of pasture and other food she eats, the length of time sheisfrorm calling, whether she is milked twice or three times a day, and whether the hands of the milker are clean and free from all taint all these things affect the quality of butter. The quality of butter is also affected by the state of the milk at the time the cream is taken off, i. e. whether it is sweet or sour; also by the degree of sour ness of the cream or milk at the time of churning. It is also affected by the regularity of the stroke in churning; for if the stroke be quick and irregular, the butter will be paler and softer, and not so rich as if the churning had been done more slowly and regularly. Churning after the butter is separated from the milk or cream, though it may add a little to the weight, has a bad effect on the color and texture of butter. Such also depends on the temperature of the milk or cream at the commencement and during the whole process of churning; much upon whether the buttermilk is properly expressed, and the kind and quantity9
of salt used, and whether it is properly mixed with the butter that is, thoroughly and equally. Such also depends on the degree of sweetness in which the dairy utensils are kept. I do not mean cleanliness alone, for they can be clean without being sweet, although they cannot be sweet without being clean. The state of the atmosphere, and the purity or impurity of the air with which the milk and cream come in contact, also affect the quality of butter. The quality is also affected by the portion of milk or cream from which it is extracted; whether from the last portion of milk drawn from the cow, and whether from cream that has risen in the first six, eight, or ten hours, or from that of a longer period. The above is the substance of several of the most important circumstances that affect the quality of butter. ?a? To go into detail would extend this to too great a length. I shall therefore only further add, that all these, and soie other things, have to be taken: into consideration by the i successful dairywomanir; to that much more depends' upon her ability to form a correct j judgment of the method best adapted for her own dairy, than upon her adopting strictly the system n f any other person or place. Such has been said and written against touching butter with the hand while preparing it for use, as the heat of the hand injures the butter, &c. Now~ , sir, I do of pretend to be sage enough to enter into the philosophy of this i controverted point, but I will state what I know, viz: I know that it i the general practice in Ayrshire (a county in Scotland much famed for the good quality of its butter and cheese) to c lap the butter with the hand in i order to express the buttermilk, and to mix the salt thoroughly through it with the hand; to take it out of the c turn with the hand, and to pack itntito pots or fir king with the hand. And, notwithstanding this handling Doubt not the butter generally made in Ayrshire would find a ready saleinBoston market. I also know that the best butter I have eaten in this country was made after the Ayrshire manner, and in the months of Juneindjuly of the present year ; and the whole process, from taking it out of the c turn until it was packed into the pots for winter use, was done with the bare hand. I i ave seen different plans of working butter besides the i hand; such as wooden clappers, wooden presses of different shapes and powers, and also cloths for absorbing the buttermilk ; yet I consider the bare hand to be superior to the whole, especially if the butter is to be kept for winter use, because the use of the hand is the most certain way of getting out all of thebutterinilk. "any people, who disapprove of working butter with the hands, are in favor of washing it with water; but in my opinion, it ill be more injiuedby th latter the by the former tea tmentrThere can I be no doubt but the hand is naturally warmer than either word or cloth, i and when it becomes too warm' the butter will adhere to it but there is a preventive of this warmth, viz : to: plunge the hands in Arm *W her before you begin to c lap the butter, and, while the operation is going op, have s id e cold water at hand to dip the hands into; and if they still come to warm, then wash the mi again with warm water and repeat the washing aide cooling as often- as required.

The milk should neve st for than forty eight hours, for, if properly treated all the oily partidcid127e his will rise b teatime. When the milk is s dimmed every monricid127g and fiigcid127the cream in the cook must be thoroughly stirred with a wooden spoon before and after each addition.

I would use no saltpeter; no pick le .a; either anna to, nor carrot juice, as color is of little importance if the flavocid127) b good ; and boiling water gives an oily taste, and so do the hands, which is hold never touch the butter. Working a second time, after the salt has lain ;in it for i some hours, has good effect, as it frees th butt   er fro an all watery particles, and gives it almost the consistence of wax. 'for working butter effectually, I know of nothing equal to a simple machine, which I will attempt to describe, and which any in who understands the use of tools can make in a few hours. It may not be new to you, but as I have s en no no ice or allusion to it in your former m numbers, si venture to : end it, accompanied by a rude drawing, to make my description more intelligible.

The tells of a visit the children made to a dairy, where the maid put three gallons of cream into a c turn, and, after churning for three quarters of an hour, produced nearly three ponds of butter. This was pressed to get the milk out, and then often washed in fresh waters, after which it was laid upon a flat dish, and cut into small pieces with a wooden slice, i, order to have the cow' hairs picked out, which had fallen into the milk. Any of these hairs stuck to the edge of the slice, and the rest she picked out with her fingers !a* *a* *his "picking out" is an improvement upon the method said to be practised in one of the western States, from whence the story is told of a traveller who requested his hostess to send the butter and the hairs to his table upon separate plates, as he preferred mixing them for himself.

The temperature of the milk apartment, if possible, should never be above 65 degrees, nor below 45 degrees. Met kettles should not stand in the dairy room; neither should churning, cheese making, or cleansing milk vessels be done there, but in a convenient room near by dream may be kept good much longer if it be kept in a white oak vessel, with a tight cover, and a fauces or tap near the bottom to draw off the milk when it settles, before the customary daily stirring. The quality of the butter is much improved by this management. If the milk be not drawn off, and it be churned with the stream, the butter will be longer in coming, and it will show specks of sour cure, taste like cheese, and will soon becomerancid, Utter will come quickly at all seasons of the year, if the cream be, of a temperature of from 60 to 75 degrees ; to this end, use hot water in winter and ice in summer, but never add either to the cream in or out of the churnldtkPure salt crystallized into perfect tubes. All other forms ofcrystallizition found in common salt arise from impure ties; those of a needle shape in Liverpool bag, or blown salt, indicate the presence of lime, magnetic, &c. Bosom and Flaubert salts are frequently found in small quantities; in the process of making salt they crystallized last. When water is added, or on exposure to damp air, they dissolve first; hence washing sat purified it. One great cause of the failure in making good butter maybe raced to the use of impure salt. Lock salt and the large lumps of Turks I s land salt washed, dried, and finally pulverized, are preferable to <all other kinds, being highly preservation, and i hardening the butter, so that it will be sooner ready to work over98
in warm weather. The Liverpool bag or blown salt, the Saline salt in small bags, from New Work, and the fine part of every kind of imported salt, contain a great portion of impurity : they are not preservation, do not hard en the butter, and give it a bitter taste. Less than one ounce of pure salt is sufficient for a pound of butter many put in half; an ounce. In all cases leave out sugar and saltpeter in the manufacture of cheese, a preference is sometimes given to Liverpool bag or blown salt. This salt contains salts of lime and magnetic, which attract moisture from the air, and have the desirable effect of softening the cheese ; and the pungent, bitter taste which they impart to it, is an improvement in the estimation of some. General Remarksthe cream should not rise more than 36 hours: it should be sweet when taken off, and sweet when churned; yet there is a degree of maturity to be acquired by keeping. The kegs for packing butter should be made of white oak, bulging in the form of cases, for the more perfect exclusion of air and convenience of transportation. If the butter is not to be sent to a warm climate, or a foreign market, let the bulging keg shave move able covers, to accommodate inspection ; they should be soaked in a strong bring, made also of pure salt, in order that justice may be done to the purchaser in t are; and to save the butter from being spoiled to the depth of one or two inches all round, from its contact with dry wood. In ease the wood is anything but white oak, there is danger of its giving an unpleasant taste to the whole. For the convenience of families, the size should vary from 25 to 50 pounds. A large keg of butter is exposed to the air for a long time while on breach in a small family; the bottom, in consequence, becomes ran did. The consumer will cheerfully pay an extra price for 100 pounds of butter packed in four kegs instead of one. To salt should be put on the sides, bottom, or between the layers. If the kegs are made with covers, put a cloth over the top, and cover that with pure fine salt. Deep a cloth wet with strong bring over the butter while the keg is filling, to exclude the air. The practice of washing butter is not approved of in Europe ; it destroys its fragrance and sweetness by dissolving the sugar of milk, which, it is said, is always present in good butter. It is practised in Holland when the article is designed for exportation to I india; then the operation is performed with cold, strong, limp id bring, made of pure salt and pure water. Later that has lime in it will not answer, as the lime is readily absorbed by the butter. To exclude the air more effectually during the process of putting down, let a little melted sweet butter be run into the cavity where the bottom head and states come together; then, after each layer is completed, let the dairy woman pass her finger round so as to press the butter hard and close against the side: : From the Albany Cultivator. Connecti   Cut Cheese Dai Of Of. In our late excursion through Connecticut, we were glad to find satisfactory evidence that the character of that State for the manufacture of good cheese is still maintained. The two principal cheese neighborhoods which we visited were 'os hen and Winchester. The first of these towns, a. 99 became famous for its cheese at an earlier period than any other section of the country; but, though the place still holds a prominent rank in this respect, we are, inclined to think, from what we saw and heard, that, for general reputation, the sceptre has departed from" Os hen, and is now held by Winchester. From Mr. A. Miles, of Os hen, a large dealer in cheese, we obtained some facts in regard to the quantity annually made there. The average quantity e exported from the town is about 500,000 pounds. The quantity of butter sold is small, being only about 40,000 lbs. per year. Cheese has fallen much in price within a few years, owing to the increased quantity thrown into market. It sells this season, while new, at five cents per pound at home, or within the town. The average quantity made per cow is not known but may be estimated at 300 to 350 pounds. :some good diaries make much more. Mr. Lawton sold last year an average of 403 poundspeircow; and, with what he kept for his own use, probably made 425 pounds per cow or. Lewis- M. Norton, of Os hen, was the first manufacturer of what is called pineapple cheese, in America. He commenced making this article in 1808. He had at that time no knowledge of the mode in which it received its peculiar form and qualities. He saw some which came from England, and set himself to work to imitate it. His first trial succeeded so well that he was encouraged, to per severe, and he has so perfected the whole process, from the "running up" of the cure to the sale of the cheese, as to entirely distance all competition. Mr. Norton is this year using the cure from ninety cows for making pineapple cheese. The principal portion of this cure is bought of hislieighbors, for which he pays them the same price per pound that commonnewmilch cheese brings, which is five cents this season; so that those who sell him their cure save all the labor of pressing and curing their cheese, besides gaining considerable from the greater weight of the cure. The cure is kept for twenty-four hours before it is made into cheese. The advantage of this is supposed by Mr. Norton to be, that a degree of  ferment at ion takes place, which being checked at, a critical time, by the cutting of the cure, preparatory to its being formed into cheese, is not renewed after it comes from the press; thus preventing the defect of the cheese being h oven or blown. The cut rd. is rapidly cut into pieces of not more than a fourth of an- inch square, with a machine invented by Albert Room is, Torringford, Connecticut, which Mr. N. prefers to any curdcutter he has seen. After being cut, the cure is put in a cheese l cloth, placed in warm water, and the temperature :gradually raised by pouring in water that is still warmer, till it reaches 105 degrees by the thermometer. This does not scald the cure, which, according to the practice of the best cheese makers in England and in this country, is, we think, discountenanced. The cure is next cooled, by adding cold water, to the temperature of 88 degrees, when the whole of the water is drawn from the vat, and the cure weighed: and salted with the finest kind of table salt, (four ounces of salt to ten pounds of end ;and after being well stirred, is put in the press, where it remains twenty-four hours, or a longer time, as is convenient, as it takes no hurt by remaining forty-eight hours. The cure is weighed immediately over the tub, being drawn up by a fully arid when this is done, is again lowered intotheltib, where it is saltedThe cheeses are pressed in moulds, made of sound blocks of oak timber 990 about twenty inches long and ten inches square. They are s awed length wise through the middle, and each half is carved or worked so as to give the general shape of a pineapple-one half in each part. :from the cavity to the upper end of the block, a groove is cut in each part, which, when the parts are placed together, makes a round channel of about two and a half inches in diameter, for passing, the cure into the mould. When the two parts of the block are put together, in such a manner h that he cavities match each other, and are strongly k eyed into a frame, they form the mould for pressing the cure. The pressure is applied by means of a screw, operating on an upright, round piece of wood, which fits the channel in the block, and, as it is forced down, compresses the cure in the mould. The presses are very compact and strong, and appear to answer the purpose well. He, had sixty-eight of them, and makes twenty-eight cheeses per day, weighing, when dried, five pounds each. When the cheeses are taken from the press, they are trimmed, then placed in nets and hung in water of the temperature of 130 degrees. This is to soften the outside, that it may receive the desired impression from the net, which is done by taking them from the water while enveloped in the nets, placing them in a frame and straining the nets tightly over them by means of screws. This intents the threads of the net into the cheese in such a manner as to give them the external appearance of the fruit from which they are named. After this operation the cheeses are hung up in the nets from three to five weeks, for the outside to hard en, and are then set on shelves having suitable hollows or con cavities for the cheeses to rest on. In the centre of each con cavity hole two inches in diameter is cut through the shelf, the more freely to admit the air, and allow any liquid that may come from it to run off. The nets used for the cheese are made of three threaded flax t wine, and the manufacture of them costs, exclusive of the material, about five cents each. They will last three or four years. Mr. Norton sells his cheese in New Work, Baltimore, and other southern cities. It usually nets him about ten cents per pound, after de ducting commissions. Now much greater are the actual profits derived from this kind of cheese than are obtained from other kinds, we cannot tell. Mr. Norton has evidently incurred great expense in his fixtures, and in the time and study he has spent in bringing the manufacture of the article to such complete perfection; and this ought, in justice, to secure him some corresponding advantages. He, however, makes no secret of any discoveries or improvements which his protracted and indefatigable labors have effected but, with a highly commend able liberality, freely permits the most minute examination of his systematic operationsCHESHI Of Cheese. The last Journal of the English Agricultural Society contains a prize essay, by Mr. White, of Barrington, on making cheese in Cheshire. Is we have not room in our pages for the whole article, we con dense and extract from it. In me the cheese was first made in Cheshirethe fame of the cheeses of Cheshire is of very ancient date at least as old as the reign ofHeinry I, (A. D. 1100.) The Countess On stance, of Chester, though the. 99 1 wife of Hugh Lupus, the kings first cousin, kept a herd of line, and made good cheeses, three of which she presented to the Archbishop of Banter bury. Giraldus Cambrensis bears honorable testimony to the excellence of the Cheshire cheeses of the day Quantity made in the county There cannot be less, upon a moderate calculation, than 12,000 tons made in that county annually; a considerable portion of which is of excellent quality. Art of cheesemakingThe art of cheese making consists in the complete extraction of the they, and in the proper compacting and curing of the cure. :the richness of the cheese depends upon the quality of the milk, or, in other words, on the proportion of cream which the milk contains. The cheese of Cheshire is professedly made from new milk, or milk front which no cream has been taken. It is, however, well known that in many fairies, in the morning, before cheese making, a small quantity of cream is s dimmed off the previous evenings milk; this cream is either churned by itself, or mixed with they cream, by which there is obtained a better quality and greater quantity of (so called) they butter. It may appear singular to some that any portion of cream should be found in they but such is the fact, and the means used in Cheshire for extracting it are very simple. :taking of butter from wheycreamThis varies very little from the process of making butter from the cream of milk. The cream is kept for three or four days, or until it has become clotted, (provincial ly termed called) Those who make the -best they butter have a s pilot and fauces to each of their cream mugs to let off the they, which in the course of a few hours settles at the bottom, and which, if allowed to remain, imparts a rank flavor to the cream, and consequently to the butter. The temperature of the cream, when put into the c turn, is generally ascertained by the had; but if a thermometer be used, the heat which I would recommend is G6chaving found that the best. If it be much higher than this, the butter may be expected not only to be soft, but inferior both in quantity and quality; and if much lower, the operation of churning will be prolonged, and indeed tedious. t hot this heat the time in churning will probably be about an hour and a half. It will perhaps be necessary in cold weather to put- hot water into the c turn, and in warm weather to put in cold water, in order toi attain this desirable object as to heat. From 100 gallons of milk there will not be less than 90 gallons of they, which should yield from 10 to 12 gallons of cream, or 3- to 4 pounds of butter. The quantity of they bitter per cow is about half a pound per week, taking the season through u but with that small portion of cream of the evenings milk added, the farmer often c burns as much as three quarters of a pound of butter per cow per week, or from 20 to 25 pounds per annum. One pound of salt is sufficient or. curing 37 pounds of butter, if for present use. Number of cows kept, and produce. -the number of cows kept for the purpose of a cheese dairy is seldom less than 8 or 10, or more than 70 or 8, and is of course regulated by the size of the farm: these average about 90 or 100 statute acres, upon each of which about 15 or 18 cows are kept. From 18 !a! ,cows, a cheese of from 36 pounds to 54 pounds weight is made daily 4 during four or five months of the summer. The annual produce of cheese per cow depends both upon the quality of the animal (with the mode f keeping her) and of the land, of  r rather the herb age. I a e known many: farmers sustain great loss by not feeding their cat le suffcicid127) tlcid127) well 9 92

The utensils in which- th-e milk is kept are usually portable shallow earthen ware vessels, called "pan rugs' and in some fairies leaden or zinc cookers. Most of the milk rooms have latticeor wire windows for the circulation of air, and the floors are laid in a sloping form for i the free escape of the cold water with whichd they are daily smiled throughout the summer months. If precautions of this nature be not attended to, there a is a risk of the evenings milk becoming sour i which case, whatever quantity of new milk be added to it in th morning, the cheese will be sour also, : am led to believe that a temperature of as near 50 :fahrenheit as could be maintained, would be the best for a milk house throughout the year. The dairy is generally situate near the milk house, and fitted up with two set pa is or boilers a: are one for scolding the they and a smaller one for heating ater. The "cheese presses" and screw" are kept within this room, and the operation of cheese making is here carried :on, :S ever pressing Poles, weights, and screws are now superseded by anew lever press The -advantages of this over the screw are, that it sinks, by its own action, .with e: cudaniy degree of pressure required can be applied and gradually increased, and less attention is necessary; whereas the pressure from the screw is sudden and uncertain, and, having no self action, requires the dairy maids assistance every five or ten minutes to render it effectual. Quantity f salt required and temperature of the milkAfarmner in South Cheshirewell known for his introduction of improvements in agriculture, has commenced the system of weighing his cure previous to salting it, and he says he uses i salt in the proportion of 1 pound to 42 pounds of cure. , He also informs me <he sets his milk together by a thermometer, and, asia temperature of: 76.0 ;or 7 70. , -quantity of cheese silk will give t has generally been considered that a ga lion of milkcid127supposinig little or no cream has ;bent taken from itwillprodiiCe, upon an average of th- season, pound of sale ab cheese; that is, ;hen the cheese is for or five months of.

The curdmillThisis of recent introduction, and it is only in a few diaries that it is met with :some i dairy- maids highly approving, others obs. 993jecting to it. I think it will soon be more generally adopted, as it effects a saving in time, and breaks the cure more regularly than it can be done by hand recipe for curing the may skins (stomach Procure the skins from the butcher the yet r previous to their being wanted; clean out the chylous matter, and every other apparent impurity; the inside is then turned outward on a table, and salted; the skins are then laid one upon another, with a layer of salt between each, in a deep earthen ware vessel similar to a cream mug; they are then covered over with salt, and have a lid of slate or flag placed on the top. They are taken out as wanted, about a month previous to being used, and the bring drained from them. They are then spread on a table, and fine salt is powdered on each side. In this state they are rolled with a paste roller, distended with a splint of wood, and hung up to dry. Rode of making men net from mawskinsThe men net, or steep, as it is commonly called, is next added. I have already stated, in the introduction, that this is an infusion made from the preserved stomach or may of sucking calves, thence called maLwskins, or bag skins. To define the quantity of men net sufficient for coagulating a given quantity of milk is a very difficult matter, as the may skins vary so much in quality. When the farmer is laying in a stock for the year, he generally calculates upon a dozen of skins to a ton of cheese, but the skins vary in size; (the price when cured is from is. to is. per dozen. In using them, it is the practice often to cut two skins at once. Three square inches taken from the bottom (or strongest part) of one, and one or two inches from the top (or weak est part) of the other, is generally found sufficient for sixty gallows of milk. These two pieces of skin are put into a cup containing about half a pint of luke warm water, with the addition of a teaspoonful of salt, some part of the day previous to being used. The water thus impregnated with the m awl kin is passed through a si eve into the milk; but the skin itself is generally, though not always, kept out. The men net cup is well scalded before being used again. I have been told that some farmers make a sufficiently large quantity of men net to last for several weeks, and find it to answer better than making a small quantity daily. The question is, will it keep sweet From the Albany Cultivatormanufacture Of Cheese. The following is an extract from the statement of Alonzo L. Wish, ofHerkimer county, who received the first premium of the New York Stateagricultural Society for the best cheese dairy, in 1844. Valves' men nets only are used, after being dried one year. There are less animal properties in them than in new men nets, and will not make cheese swell in warm weather; and, on shrinking, leave them (like honey comb) full of holes, with a rank flavor. Valves whose men nets are designed for cheese making are not allowed toss sick six cows, or those giving bad milk, but are fed a plenty of good milk from five to ten days old; twelve or fifteen hours after sucking when the gastric, juices are most abundant and pure, the men net is taken 3 994 out and stretched on a bow; as much fine salt is added as will adhere without draining, and hung in good air to dry. Milking is done in tin pails, and strained through a large tin s trainer into a tin vat, where it is not s dimmed nor moved till the cheese is made- The pails are set into a common sap bucket, which being light, and smaller at bottom than top, a little press on the pail will fasten the bucket to it so that it carries with the pail without any inconvenience. A light tap on the bucket will drop it, and leave the pail clean and not bruised. A tin vat, large enough to hold the milk, is set within a larger wool den vat, with one inch space between the sides and bottoms of the two to admit water, which is cooled by ice and heated by steam; which water cools the milk, to take out the animal heat, warms it to receive men net, remains and heats they, and scalds cure. It is discharged by a cock, to pass off into a tub, and scalds br a nor meal for slop feed when it is required. Called feed is required daily when the cows are milked on hay feed. A large reservoir is built of stone and cement, to contain fifty hogs heads of rain water from buildings, to discharge by a cock into the above described space, into a steam genera to r, or into a tub, or any other place in the lower rooms where it is desired. A pump affords water to this apparatus in case of drought. Thus the same water is made to perform three distinct offices, by no more labor than to turn three cocks with the thumb and finger. After the water in the reservoir is not wanted for cheese making, a pipe conducts it into the top of ice house, to freeze in solid mass in winter, for cooling milk the next season. To swimmer, pail, or dip per is required about this apparatus, only to milk in, as the cream which rises over night is not separated, nor no dipping of milk, they, or water. The heating is done daily by a handful l of chips or four quarts of charcoal, and all shift of apparatus can be made with one hand, while the other is employed in the milk or cure. A young man is hired at                                                               $11 per month, for eight months, to take the whole charge of nursing, feeding, making, and taking care of milk and cheese through the summer, and does no other business. He is required to keep a register, daily, of the variation (if any) of heat, salt, quality and effect of men net, number of cows milked, quantity of milk from which cheese is n made, condition of cure when put to press, when cheese is put on shelf, that it is weighed and numbered upon the bandage, so that, when cured, the result of certain variations may be known. An inch pipe passes from the steam genera to r, and discharges steam into water under the tin vat; in ten minutes the whole mass is warmed to ninety degrees, to receive men net. The cheese is then turned off (which would otherwise be lost) into a tub, which stands high enough to discharge into the cheese vat and scald it after the cheese is made. Not water is drawn at any time from the same to cleanse pails, cloth hoops, &c. Valves' men nets only are used, after being one year dry, they being less apt to make cheese swell in warm weather, and of better flavor. A piece of men net, to bring cure in forty minutes, is wounded fine in an iron mortar, and soaked a short time in warm water, mixed with a little anna to, drained, strained, and put into the milk. When come, the cure is cut in large pieces with a wood knife, thickest in the middle, to give it a slight pressure before there is much surface exposed to be rinsed y they; after standing ten minutes, the pieces are cut smaller with the same knife, then broken up by putting the hands to the bottom of the tub, bringing the om through to the top, with fingers spread, with a slow motion, to give it all a slight pressure without tearing fine, while tender. 
95Heat is kept as high as eighty-eight degrees while working, steam let on the motion and pressure with hands increased with increase of heat and tough ness of cure; heat is kept up to continue the action of the men net, as it is most active when warm; heat raised to ninety-eight degrees; the steam is then turned off; it is kept at that heat thirty minutes. The heating is now done; the water and they are discharged. One pound of fine salt to fifty of cure is added, while warm, to shrink the cure and prevent holes in the cheese. After getting cool, it is put to press; the pressure is from five to seven tons. In six hours it is turned into clean cloth; and again, in twelve hours more, it is taken out of the press and put upon the shelf, weighed, bandaged, greased with oil or they butter turned daily. To greater heat is ever used in the operation than the natural heat of milk, (ninety-eight degrees From the Albany Cultivator. Products Of The Dai Of. We intimated, in closing our remarks upon this subject last month, that we should make some suggestions as to " the means which should be adopted to secure the greatest increase in quantity and improvement in quality of dairy products." Before attempting this, however, let us first see what is the quantity now actually made in most of our fairies. Pont his point we have very little positive information, and must rely mainly on the opinions of dealers and persons who are well acquainted with the l airy business. Our intercourse with farmers and dairy men l has enabled us to judge perhaps with some degree of correctness, especially as we have hundreds of times asked the question, "now much butter or cheese do your cows average title season ?a" To this question we have received various answers; some putting the amount as high as 200 pounds, others at 150 pounds, and many nearly or quite as low as 100 pounds, of butter. We suppose that two and a half pounds of cheese are about equivalent to one of butter, so that the range in the average of cheese fairies would be from 250 to 500 pounds. Our own conviction, strengthened by the opinion of a number of dealers in dairy products with whom we have consulted, is, that the average production of butter cannot exceed 125 pounds per cow. The average product of cheese cannot much exceed 300 pounds. It is not asserted that these are the actual average products, but the amount here assumed will be found, on a careful inquiry, very nearly correct. The extremes, as before stated, are far above and below this amount. For the pp repose of showing what may be done with good cows and goodmntnagement, we now propose to give a few\ statements which have come under our notice, or been communicated to us by persons engaged in this business, and, to give our readers an opportunity of judging correctly in the premises, we shall accompany the statements, as far as practicable, with an account of the measures pursued to arrive at the results spoken of. A We will first give some extracts from the report of the committee on geese fairies to the New York State Agricultural Society, February 13, 1845. -from that report we learn that Mr. Abraham i All of Lloyd, One ida county, has made the past season, from forty cows, 23,427 pounds of -he the, and 200 pounds of butter. This is an average of five hunidred996 and eighty-five and five-eighths pounds of cheese per cow; and if we add the butter, we have equivalent to 598 pounds of cheese per cow. To accomplish this, Mr. H. informs us that he has 100 acres of pasture, (in addition to the cows, four horses and three dry cows are kept) of good quality, though not very abundant, and about fifty-two acres of meadow. Rows are supposed to consume about two and one-fourth tons of hay each, as they are fed in stormy weather in summer, as well as a full supply in winter. Was not fed sixty bushels of grain to cows. The they was all fed to twenty of the oldest cows, and Mr. All has no doubt that the twenty cows to which the they was fed have made full 700 pounds each. Rows come in from the first of April to the first of May. They have access to salt at all times, which is considered important. The cows are well selected, regularly mid  red, and attended to in every respect. The cheese is made with great care and attention, and brings the highest price in market, having been sent to Philadelphia for several years past; but the last year a considerable portion of it was shipped to England. Thereiwill hardly be spare room in this article to give the details of the process of manufacture. We hope to hear more from this dairy next year. From the same report to the State Society, we learn that Mr. Alonzo L. Wish, of Litchfield, I lerkimer county, has made during the last season, previous to the 17th of September, an average of 592 pounds per cow; and or. F. estimates the quantity for the season at 700 pounds. The average the last three years, from twenty-five cows, has been 590 pounds. Mr. Wish also feeds the they to his cows, and about the first of August commences feeding corns talks (raised broadcast) once a day, to keep up a full flow of milk. While giving milk in winter, the cows are fed four quart of shorts, or one peck of roots, per day. The dairy furniture and fixtures, buildings, &c, are convenient, and well attended to. Were is an annual product of              $41.40 from each cow for three ye I s in succession a handsome product truly in these times of low prices. Mr. Wish received the first premium from the State Society for the best managed cheese dairy. Mr. Misha Baker, of Bridge water, One ida county, made in 1843, between April 15th and December 1st, 10,000 pounds of cheese and 1,000pounds of butter, making an average of 500 pounds of cheese and 50 pounds of butter from each cow. In addition to hay and grass, the cows were fed two quarts of o at meal per day, mixed with the they from the dairy. The cheese was sold at five cents, and the butter at fourteen cents making thirty-two dollars per cow. We have thus glanced at some of the large stories from cheese makers which are sometimes doubted, and often pronounced false by those who have no idea that any one else can make more than they have done, and are unwilling themselves to make even an effort to go beyond t lie old mark. These cases might be multiplied to almost any extent, had we room. Suffice it, however, to say, that there cannot be the slightest doubt of the correctness of the foregoing statements, and that the amount stated i vas actually made. Met us now glance for a moment at the causes which have produced these results results so different from those in common fairies. In the first place, we find a good selection of cows, every one of which is capable of making as much as the best in many of our fairies. There is the dairy man who has not in his yard cows which will make nearly twice as much as others kept in the same manner, and treated precisely in the same way. 99 in all respects ?a? This has been our experience, and we have no doubt that it is so almost everywhere. Now, if we select, for our full number, cows of this character, the product will be at once greatly increased, without any additional allowance of feed. But where are these cows to be had All farmers cannot have the best, it is true, but nearly all may have better animals than they do, by proper selection, if purchased, or by more care in breeding if raised by themselves. The truth is, very little attention has been given to the breeding of dairy cows, and too many dairy men depend on keeping their number good by purchases from droves, which are picked up in sections where little attention is given to dairying, and driven intothe dairy districts to sell. Any of these are good animals, and many of our dairy men are good judges of cows, but we often hear them complain of the difficulty of purchasing good cows. We must raise more heifersexpressly for the dairy, with direct reference to their milking qualities. But we have been led from the legitimate train of our remarks, to glance at the subject of breeding dairy stock, which we have not time to pursue. Rows, to produce large quantities of milk, must have warm, well ventilated stables, and a full supply of suitable food. To important is the first point considered, that very few farmers now allow their cows to remain in the yard in cold weather; and when they are secured in good stables at the first approach of uncomfortable weather, and kept warm and well fed until they get a full bite of grass in spring, they will hardly fail toremunerate their owners for the extra expense. There can, however, be no extra expense in point of fact, for cattle kept warm will consume far less than when exposed to the inclemencies of the weather in this severe climate. In the cases of Mr. All and Mr. Wish, above referred to, very little grain or roots was fed, the principal addition to the usual food being the they, instead of feeding it to hogs, as is usually practised. These gentlemen, with many others with whom we have conversed, are of opinion that as many pounds of cheese may be made from feeding the they, as of pork, while the v lie of the former is usually greater than that of the latter. Mr. Baker fed about two cents' worth of o at meal, besides the they. For this he doubtless was well paid. The greatest secret, however, in managing cows, consists not so much in the amount of food given, as in the regularity with which it is given, and the care and attention bestowed upon them at all seasons of the year. They should of course be fed liberally in winter, and more especially in the fall and spring, and have during summer an abundance of suitable pasture, and plenty of pure water and salt. They should be milked regularly and quickly, by the same person, every day, if possible, and treated with gentleness and civility, (an important feature in dairy management, which many persons have not yet learned) so as not to worry anal disturb them, either in driving or in milking. We have given the product of several cheese fairies in which a little extra feed was allowed, and for the purpose of showing that large products may be obtained without extra feed. We now propose to give the product of a few butter fairies within our acquaintance, assuring our readers that we are acquainted with the individuals, on whose statements we depend, and that there cannot be the slightest doubt about their correctness. We do not intend here to give extravagant accounts, but suchs will show what may be done by good care and moderate feed. Mr. Porter, of Western, One ida county, has a dairy of twelve cows and998S
three heifersone of them three years old, and two of them two years old. From this dairy he has made, the last season, 2,600 pounds of butter for market, besides supplying a family of seven to nine persons during the year. This, it will be seen, is 17 8 pounds; and if we add the amount consumed in the family, the quantity can fall very little if any short of 200 pounds. Mr. P. says :a' We winter our cows on hay principally. After they come in, in spring, we allow them three quarts of o at meal each per day, until they are turned out to grass. In my opinion the whole secret about making a large quantity of butter is, to keep the cows well through the winter; keep them in warm stables, and feed a little grain in spring. They r must of course have an abundant supply of pasture, and an eye must be had to the management of the milk and butter." This may be set down as a good yield. Mr. Timothy . Oil cox, of New Hartford, informed us, early in November last, that lie had made, up to that time, from five cows, 1,135 pounds of butter. Mr. Oil cox expected to make up the ain out to 1,200 pounds before the close of the season. Besides this, milk was used in the family when wanted. One of these cows was two years old, one three years old, another four, and the others older.  Nothing but hay and grass was fed during the year. One remark made by Mr. W. struck us as important. I twas this : "I have milked these cows every time myself." Were, in our judgment, lies a part of the secret. (he hope that when Mr. W. sees this, he will go at once to the post of lice and subscribe for an agricultural paper. Mr. Trainerd, of Western, has made from sixteen cows, previous to the 1 5th of November, 2,720 pounds for market, besides supplying a considerable family. Were we have 175 pounds from each cow. This dairy was also kept on hay and grass alone, (except about 150 pump king in the fall but they were well fed and well attended to. It is unnecessary to multiply instances; but we will say, in addition, that our friend Lewis James, of See, has uniform* made from 160 to 180 pounds for market annually. The dealers in butter all agree that where such large quantities are made, the quality is uniformly good ;better than when small quantities are made. Good attention to one branch secures, in a great degree, success in the other. The remarks made in regard to selection of cows, and their management, for cheese fairies, apply equally well here; and we can only say that to equal, and even expel, the individuals we have named, farmers have only to procure good cows, give them good feed, both summer and winter, see that they are at all times protected from cold and stormy weather, have plenty If are water and free access to salt, are regularly milked by careful hands, and, finally, that the milk and the cheese or butter, as the case maybe, are properly managed. l These constitute the essentials in dairy management essentials which may be attained in almost every particular by all dairy men. It is easy to see, that while, in the usual method of managing cows, very little profit can be realized, the results arrived at by the individuals named (and there are scores of similar cases) cannot fail to afford a very handsome profit from their labor. It costs scarcely any more to keep a stock of cows in good order throughout the year than to let them get poor, and then, by extra feed, raise them again to good condition. Now, we hold that three-fourths of the dairy men in this country may, by simply having warm and Well ventilated stables, feeding and milking regularly, arid treating their cows gently, increase their products considerably, without one
dolioar of additional expense; and if a few bushels of grain or roots be added in the winter and spring, the profit will be greatly increased. Of the method of managing the milk and manufacture of butter and cheese, we have not room to speak in this article, but will endeavor to speak of some Points connected with that subject hereafter. The cases to which we have alluded are not extremes, but are frequent in many parts of the State; yet not one in a hundred reaches the amount named in these statements. The season for commencing dairy operations will on arrive indeed, the time for giving increased attention to dairy, cows is now at hand; and we appeal to all, so far to consult their own interest, if they have nos mercy for their animals, as to look well to the care of their stock during the coming spring. We also respectfully suggest to our agricultural brethren the propriety of endeavoring to increase the products of their dairy, as well as of all crops and productions of the farm, the coming season. We can i in prove in these as well as other branches of agriculture. Shall we ,not say that we will improve in these things ?a? Met us not bedisheartened by the assertion, so often thrust in our faces, that we now raise more than we need of agricultural products. Or if this is really so, let us keep fewer cows, and make from them the same quantity which we now make from a greater number. And so with our crops. Met our motto be, "the greatest amount of produce at the least expense." Profit is our object; and how shall we secure it, except by cheap ening the cost of production ?E. Comstock.

Her pasture was good through June. The first week in July it failed; so I took her out and put her in an old pasture with other cows for three weeks, to let my pasture grow. I then put her back again in my pasture, and kept her until the 24th day of August, when  put her, with another cow, in new feed. I commenced giving her, theS0th of August, one quart of I indian meal and one quart of rye meal every night. The had no meal, roots, or any thing, only what the pasture afforded, from the first day of June until the thirtieth day of August. Warren Averi Of. I Pswi Of, September 23, 1845. Of Butter.

Quali   Of Of Of  Of, &c. One good cow, full fed, is worth more for the dairy than four ordinarylalfstarved ones. As an illustration of the truth of the above e fact, we quote the following from an English publication: "cid127A farmer one years since. 100 1 kept eighteen cows upon a common, and was often obliged to buy butter for his family. The common was enclosed, which deprived the farmer of his pasture, and the same person supplied his family amply with the milk and butter from four cows -well kept in ordinary cow, fed on young c lover, should give, for the first three months after calling, from fifteen to eighteen quarts of milk per day, which will produce, if of good quality, 11 lb. of butter, or nearly 9 lbs. per week. There the number of cows is greater, the average will be less; because, where there are only one or two cows, a deficiency in one of them is immediately noticed : the cow is got rid of, and a better one substituted. The excellency of a dairy cow is estimated by the quantity and quality of her milk; and the quality of the milk is estimated by the quantity of butter that it will yield. Such depends on the quality of the food, but more on the animal. The writer has known one cow whose milk would not produce butter, and was never discovered while milked with the herd, but was soon apparent when separated and milked alone. There is a simple instrument, called the lactometer, used for measuring the relative qualities of cream which the milk of different cows, at the different seasons of the year, affords. It consists of a mahogany stand, supporting six glass tubes of equal length and diameter. These tubes a remarked ten inches 'from the bottom, and graduated down in tenths of an inch for three inches. Now, the milk from the different cows is poured into each tube, (which should be marked with the name of the cow) and filled to the upper or len inch line, and the number of degrees the thickness of the cream occupies in each tube indicates the per cent age. For example if the bottom of the cream stands at one inch, it denotes 10 per cent. cream. In a trial, with one of these instruments, of seven cows, six weeks after calling, in the months of March and April, we found they varied from 13 to 7 per cent. But of the seven cows, the milk of two produced, after standing twenty-four hours in a temperature of 48 degrees, thirteen percent. cream, one twelve, and another eleven per cent, in the same temperature another, at 46 degrees, 9 per cent; while two, at 40 degrees, stood at 8 and 7 per cent. The milk of four cows mixed, in a temperature of 48 degrees, marked 11 per cent. Now, it is well known, by those who have paid any attention to the subject, that temperature has considerable influence in raising cream, which may, in part, account for the low percentage of the two last named cows; but in other trials we have found they varied from 7 to 20 per cent. After comparing the accounts, given in a variety of places and situations, of the average quantity of milk which, a cow gives when kept alone, and well fed, as they generally are, with a full supply of food, such as they relish, to the extent of their appetites, the result is, that it greatly exceeds that of our best dairy herds, and the quantity of butter made from a given, quantity of ni ill is also greater. I am aware that high feeding of much cows on grain is not generally believed to be profitable; but I am satisfied that the cows would give milk nearly the whole year, be made good beef at the same time, and their calves would be much more valuable. If cows are ever allowed to fall away low during winter, in vain shall we hope to obtain an abundant supply of milk by bringing them into high condition in the summer; for, if a cow be lean at the time of calling, no management afterwards will ever bring her to yield, for the season, any 10 02 thing like the quantity of milk that she would have done had she been all the while in high condition. C. N. Bement. Ameri Can Hotbel, Albahny, august 1845. For the Louisville Journal and Collar Farmer. Descri Pti   Of Of The Large Dai Of Establi   Shments That Supplythe Pri Nci    Pal Of    Of   Of Of Great Bri Tai N Of Of Of  Of. Having read of late, with much interest, (in the eastern agricultural papers) an account of various well conducted farms, I am induced to think an abridged description of some of the great "lactarys" as they are fashionably called, of the old country, from notes taken several years since on a tour with the late Dr. At cliff the excellent and efficient secretary to the Farming Society of I re land" will be received with some interest by your readers, and it possibly may v be also instructive. My observation convinces me there is much in their management that could be well and profit ably adopted by our dairy men in this country. The two largest fairies in the world, containing the greatest number of cows giving milk at the same time in the same establishment, are in London, situated near and within sight of each other, at I sling ton, formerly a part of the suburbs, but now a well built and densely populated portion of that great city: the one established more than half a century ago by the later. Rhodes, and still conducted by his sons; the other established about thesametinme by the late Mr. May cock, and now in possession of his sons also. Rhodess, which I shall first describe, is the not complete of the two. The number of cows now kept there varies from seven hundred up to nine hundred. Mrs. Rhodes, who, after her husbands death, took the wholeman9ageient of the concern for some years upon herself, told me that she several times attempted to have one thousand cows milked, but that thenumirber was never completed in the morning; that, before night, death or some other accident occurred among them to prevent her accomplishing that desire. The ground on which the buildings are placed is a slope of some three or four acres, fronting the east. The sheds run with the slope for the drainage, and more easily wheeling off the manure, as well as forsuplfing water for the cows through small cast iron troughs, which are fixed in the walls at the heads of the cows, in such a manner that one trough nay be supplied fro in the other the whole leg th of the house. The sheds 'are tent your feet wide and ten feet high; tiled roof, with rising shutters for ventilation, and panes of glass glazed into cast iron skeleton times for light. The floor has a slight fall to a gutter along the centre ; a range of stalls, each seven and a half feet wide, for two cows to stand in, rut is along the sides, to which they are fastened by chains and rings running on upright iron rooms in each corner. A trough, formed of Each slate bedded in cement, its upper edge eighteen inches from the ground, is fixed at the head of each animal, to hold its food. The sheds are placed adjoining and parallel to each other, with openings in the walls opposite each to o6itahi the drinking water, calculated to serve two cows in different. 100 sheds, but opposite each other; which water is supplied from one large cistern by pipes. Each iron trough has a wooden cover, which is shut down during feeding time, to prevent the water being dirt ied. At the upper end of the shed is the dairy, consisting of three rooms : the one a measuring room, where all the milk that is sold and goes out is first measured; the other a scalding room, with boiler and fireplace; and the third, a room where all the surplus milk is strained up and set away for cream and butter. At the lower end of the sheds are two yards, surrounded by sheds also; the one for fattening the cows off when they become dry, and the other for store and breeding pigs. Are pigs consume the skin milk remaining on hand, which is kept in a well, made of brick, laid in cement, twelve feet deep, and six and a half in diameter, in which it soon becomes sour, and then fed to the pigs, as it is well known to be more nourishing when given in that state than when sweet. The principal stock of pigs are breeding sows, as the sucking pigs sold for roasting are found to be much the most profitable. The dung is all emptied into a pit for that purpose, off a platform at the bottom of the yards. Within the last ten years there have been constructed in the rear of the sheds several large pits ten feet wide, twelve feet deep, and twenty feet long, made of brick, bedded in cement, into which are packed several months supply of brewers and distillers' grains, which form the chief food for the cows, and which can only be had during the winter months. The grains are firmly tramped into those pits, and each layer, of about one foot in thickness, is well salted ; when filled, the top is covered over with boards, and on those is put a thickness of earth, compactly beaten down, sufficient to perfectly exclude the air as well as the frost. Trains packed in this way have been opened in four or five years, and found to be fresh and good food, and as eagerly eaten by the cows as those that had just been carted in from the brewery. There are also on the premises a large stock yard, sheds, and pits for roots and straw, a large room for cutting hay and clever into chaff, cart sheds, stables, a neat and spacious countinghouse, with a large, well ventilated room overhead, containing several iron bedsteads, with hair mattress and pillow to each, where the regular work hands belonging to the establishment, who are single men, sleep. The cows in this establishment are all bought, newly called, in the cow market, held in I sling ton every Monday. They are kept as long as they continue to give not less than two gallons of milk a day, and are then fattened off for the butcher on oil cake, grains, and cut c lover hay. All breeds are to be found here to some extent, but the short horns are preferred, and are greatly in the majority; they are generally found to be more abundantmilkers. The shortness of their horns, too, admits of their being placed closer together; and another reason is, because this breed is more frequently brought to market than any other. The Ayrshire breed was tried to some extent, and highly approved of, as giving very rich cream, fattening in a very short time when they left off giving milk. and particularly for producing a quantity of beef which sold much higher than that of the short horns; but the difficulty in procuring this breed was so great, that they abandoned the idea of keeping them. The length of time during which a cow, treated as in this establishment, continues to give milk, varies from six months up to two years, the large majority over going twelve months. The treatment in this establishment differs from that inmost others. The cows are never untied during the whole time they re 100 main in the house, having clean fresh water to drink, constantly before them. They are kept very clean ; the sheds are well ventilated by the openings in the roofs, which are certainly far preferable to the usual horizontal entrances for air, by holes through the side walls. The principal food of the cows, as in all other London fairies, consists of grains; that is, malt after it has been used by the brewer or the distilled. Distillers wash, which is the remainder, after distillation, of a dec action of ground salt and often meal, is also given to the cows, but more frequently to those that are fattening than to such as are in milk. The average price of brewers' grains is about four pence, or eight cents per bushel; distillers grains, on account of the meal which they contain, about double, or sixteen cents per bushel; the wash usually sells at six pence, or twelve cents for thirty-six gallons. Salt is given at the rate of two ounces to each cow daily in this establishment, mixed with the grains given before milking, at d clock in the morning, and about 2 o clock in the afternoon. A portion of green food or roots is supplied alternately with the grains ; and in winter, when takes or green grass cannot be procured, after the <a name="potatoes1459"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, turn is, or mangelwurtzel have been eaten, a portion of hay is given. The produce of Rhodess dairy is entirely milk and cream for private families and for public hospitals. A number of public institutions are supplied directly from this dairy by contract. Private families are supplied by milk dealers, who have what is called milk walks; that is, a certain number of customers whom they supply twice a day; they are thus enabled to ascertain the average of what their customers require, and they contract with Messrs. Rhodes for this average. The latter calculate the number of cows sufficient to give the dealer the supply wanted, and this number the dealer undertakes to milk twice a day at 3 o clock in the morning, and at 3.o'clock in the afternoon. The milk is measured to the dealer ; and should in have milked more than his quantity, it remains with the dairy; but should the cows be deficient in quantity, it is made up from the milk of other cows milked on account of the contracts of the establishment. Is the supply of the cows and the demand of the dealers are constantly varying, large quantities of milk remain on the dairy man hands, frequently as high as seventy to eighty gallons, which is strained up i in shallow .earthen vessels for cream. The cream is churned, the butter sold, and the skin milk, as well as the buttermilk, is put into the milk well for the pigs. The management of the whole is committed to three persons : a clerk, who keeps the books, collects the debts, and pays and receives all money sa man who super intends the feeding and treatment of the stock, and who has the general care of the premises; and a woman who measures the milk to the dealers, and super intends the dairy. The cows are all purchased and sold by a regular salesman. May cocks dairy is also at I sling ton, nearly on the opposite side of the way to Rhodess, but stands on a greater number of acres. The number of cows kept in May cocks is about the same as that kept by Rhodes, but in treatment they differ some little. I will notice only those particulars in which this establishment differs from Rhodess. The cows are fed in the same way, with the exception of not getting any salt on their grains, but the hay is salted when put in the rich. They are turned out once a day to drink from troughs in the yards, remaining out from half an hour to three hours, according to the weather and seas an of the year. From the end of June till Michaelmas, the cows are turned into the fields from 6 oclockDoc.  No. 140. 100 in the morning until 11, and from about 2 o clock in the afternoon until about 3 the following morning. The remaining hours they are in the sheds, for the purpose of being milked. The cows in this establishment are, on an average, kept in use longer than in Mr. Rhodess; those which become dry are fattened in the same way, with the addition of boiled flax seed, which is found to be a valuable assistant. The mode of using it was to me quite novel, as was its use at all for the purpose of fattening. It is boiled in a common boiler, and, when reduced to a pulp, let out into large wooden cisterns by tubes, where it was mixed with c lover chaff, roughly cut, and sometimes with grains; and, when cool, given to the cows, who eat it in this way with great aridity. In this establishment those cows which are good milders are allowed to take the bull, for which purpose eight bulls were kept on the premises. The usual period of keeping the cows is from four to five years. The calves are sold in Smith field cattle market, the market next after they are called, to those who make it a business to take them to the country and fatten them for the butcher. There are three extensive farms belonging to this establishment but a few miles distant, at one or other of which the cows in calf are kept when dry. The hair of the tails is kept closely trimmed off, to prevent the risk of dirty ing the milk, and their bodies are carried over once every day. The pigs, in addition, to sour milk, get also ground linseed and grains. In addition to this dairy establishment, Mr. May cock has a series of enclosed yards, about half an acre each in size, with open sheds sufficient to shelter from eight thousand to nine thousand head of cattle, which are appropriated to taking in stock for the nights previous to the days on whichSmithfield market is held, which are on Monday and Friday of every week in the year. For this purpose the situation is admirably adapted, lying on the great north road, and being within a short and straight drive of the market, which, singular enough, is situated in the very heart of the most thickly populated part of that immense city. Those layers and this dairy establishment may be considered as a central farm yard to the three hay farms, which they amply supply with immense quantities of the finest manure for top dressings. The whole is under the management of the two brothers, assisted by a clerk and a very active dairy maid. The proprietors of those, the two most extensive milk establishments in the world, are near and intimate friends and neighbors from their birth, are on the best possible terms, and have as free recourse to either establishment as though they belonged to the same person. They frequently compare notes as to the management and expenses, and they both still rigidly adhere to their own particular management, each contending for his superiority, and offering to prove it by a reference to his books. All I can say is, that both are managed with great care and attention, systematiced in every department. They have been carried on successfully and profit ably for more than half a century by the fathers, and subsequently by their sons ; and I have no doubt that, in a century from now, whoever lives to see it will find the same successful operation, and both under the management of the great grandchildren or immediate descendants of the original founders. The Metropolitan dairy is the next largest establishment of the kind inLbndon; it is situated in the Edgeware road, (the northwestern suburb of the city) and was founded some twenty-five years since by the late Mrlrhodes. It was sold by him, some few years after, to one of the bubble 100 6 companies of that day, from which its present name is derived. By them it was sold to Mr. Wilberforce, and is now his property. It stands on about one acre of ground, and is calculated to contain about four hundred cows. The cowhouses are in parallel ranges, twenty-four feet wide, and side walls eight feet high. The space allowed here for each cow is three feet mine inches, and the greater number of the cowhouses are without stalls. As in Mr. Rhodess establishment, the cows here are never untied, except to remove them to the fattening sheds, or to send them to the country to remain till calling time. A cow so treated seldom produces more than two calves, remaining, after each calf, an average of eighteen months in milk. The cows are milked at S in the morning and 2 in the afternoon, and the milk disposed of to dealers as before described. The food is principally grains, which, instead of being kept in pits in the open air, as atRhodess, are preserved in the cellar of a large building about fourteen feetcid127eep, and are covered, when packed down, to the depth of one foot with cow dung, to protect them from the influence of the air. Cry hay is seldom given in this establishment, the chaff of c lover hay being always mixed with the grains or wash. The cows are never turned out to water, but, from a large cistern, pipes are conducted to every cowhouse, and at certain hours each day the water is turned into the manger, which is on a perfect level; and it runs slowly past each cow, so that she drinks at pleasure. When any cow gets sick, she is bled, and is purged by giving her one pound of Bosom salts, with two ounces of flour of sulphur, and an abundance of warm water. The mode of treatment seldom or never fails, Your bulls are kept for the cows; and, as they become dry, or nearly so, they are sent out to a grass farm till calling time. The quantity of salt given the cows in their food here does not exceed one ounce daily, on account, as they assert, of its drying quality; a complaint I never heard made but in this establishment, and with which I cannot concur. The manure of this establish merit is disposed of in a singular and interesting manner : all the fluid part is discharged by skewers into a large brick cistern, laid in cement, and sold by the hogs head to the hay farmers in the neighborhood to manure their meadows with, which is done with the common watering cart used for the streets. The solid manure is compressed into small squares or cakes by an hydraulic press, and is all shipped toN6rfolk and to Yorkshire; the c amputation is, that a two horse cart load of dung is reduced to the size of a cubic foot by this means. There are many minor dairy establishments in and about London, none of which are worthy of notice, save one at Little Act on, about five milesfroinm y de Dark corner, under the sole management of a maiden lady, (mrs. Took) and stands on a farm of two hundred acres, the whole of which is e devoted to in meadow. There are two hundred and fifty cows in l three sheds, standing lead to head, with a passage of five feet between the troughs. The cows here are never untied except for about two months in the autumn a, when they are let out after each milking for about two (cid127ours, to fill themselves off to after grass. Later is supplied to them in their troughs at ice a day i through pipes from a fine spring adjacent. Trains, with roots And other green meat, arc the principal food of the cows; and Mrs. Took considers it much more economical to turn the entire of her farm to meadow, and with the extra produce to purchase the other food wanted for    fe cows, ra the ii than multiply her expenses and increase her own troubleqawd cares, in placing it under a system of agricultural courses; There is. 100 no doubt but Mrs. Looks establishment, for its size, returns, under her peculiar management, a better profit than any other in London or its neighborhood. Her cows are all milked by her own men, at 2 clock every morning and 2 every afternoon, and the produce sent in sixgallonblocktin cans, on a superior two horse "C" spring carriage, (with scarcely any motion to it) to a West end milk dealer in Edward street, Sort man square, who contracts for the whole. This establishment is characterized, beyond any other I have ever seen, by its great neatness and cleanliness, both as regards the premises, the cattle themselves, and all those who attend upon them. It is worthy of remark, that in no instance is there to be found a milk wagon used for the delivery of the milk to the families; it is always carried in tin cans, suspended from a wooden yoke that fits over the shoulder, by either women or men, who generally distribute in this way from twenty to twenty-four gallons within two hours. It is considered and with some truth too that jolting the milk in wagons has an injurious effect upon it; certainly tending to make it sour, and rendering it entirely unfit to set for cream. This mode of delivery causes the milk dealers to have a better understanding amongst themselves as to the distribution of their customers, the same person being generally found to serve with milk every house that takes any in the same street, and consequently rendering the labor much less. His communication, which is already longer than I intended, warns me to reserve for my next a description of Booths extensive feeding house, attached to his gin distillers, and of the Glasgow and Dublindairiesboth better managed than the London ones, I think as well as a glance at some of the Dutch fairies, which are under still better management than either. Wishing to contribute to the interest of your paper all in my power, I beg your acceptance of this communication, with the respect and goodwill of Farmer1008 a. Sappendi X No. 25. Scattle, &c From proceedings in the New York Farmers' Clubsoi Of   Of Cattle. Of. Edward C And -air: As to soiling, I understand it to apply to all green food that is raised for the purpose of feeding to stock in summer or winter the stock being kept up and fed on the same. I consider the root crop as one of the only sure means in our latitude of carrying out the principle through the season ; I therefore have been in the habit of raising roots for my stock for several years, and I do not think I could do well without them. I will therefore state, as nearly as I can, my mode of raising them, and feeding, &c. I will name them in the order in which I estimate them for feeding to stock. Parrots I consider the most valuable. I feed them to all kinds of stock, and consider them better for my horses than oats ; and for my much cows, in winter, they not only give the butter color, but flavor equal to summer made butter. I raise them in drills, the rows about 20 i niches apart, and the carrot in the row say from four to six inches ; mangelwurtzel in drills, two feet apart in the row, and one foot in the drill; sugar be et the same distance; rutabaga two feet apart in the row, and about nine inches in the drill; and common turn is I sow broadcast as follows: say in June, I find some pieces in my lots intended for mowing, that the grass has winter killed, or in some way is destroyed these pieces I plough up, taking care to turn them over as well as I can, sometimes before and sometimes after mowing, but always in time to sow and re seed with grass by the 20th July. I roll my land, and harrow it well the same way I plough it, and put on about 15 cords of manure to the acre, (barn yard manure) I harrow until all is well mixed; I then sow my turn is, say one half pint of seed to the acre; it is my wish not to have the seed nearer than nine inches of each other; in doing so, I give my grass seed a chance to take root. At the time of sowing my units, I sow a com post, prepared as follows : ashes, 15 bushels; bone dust, 5 bushels plaster, 1 bushel per acre; in this way I always raise good turn is, and, I think, at a trifling expense, as all that was done was with a view to re seed the land, &c. As to the other root crops, the same rule as to maturing will apply to them, but the ground must be made mellow to any depth you please the deeper the better. I use the same com post, in the drills, for all my roots, taking care at all times to apply it in a moist condition. I raised the last season the white Silesian carrot, at the rate of 9 60 bushels to the acre ; but I prefer the orange carrot. As to feeding roots, I feed them to my fat cattle, cows, horses, and hogs, in the raw state; nor do  think it advisable to cook them for any animal except the fitting hogs. I then boil them and mix provender, and feed when soured. Quantity per day : I feed to my cattle say three fourths of a peck, to be fed at two different times, say morning and evening; my much cows, one half bushel per day; my store hogs, of bees say three pounds per how, and one will of corn per feed. By feeding in this way, I have always found my stock to. 100 9 improve, and I never have had them to scour or be injured in any way from their feed on roots. I continue my feed on roots to my fat cattle until about the 1st of January; 1 then commence feeding on meal, made with corn and cob, and continue the roots, at discretion, in smaller quantities. I should not have thought it necessary to state the quantity I feed at a time, but for the reason that some gentlemen at your meeting, above alluded to, condemned the root crops; all I can now say is, that this is not my experience, nor do I believe it will be theirs, on a fair trial, With respect, I remain yours, Swm. Maki Nster' Middletown, Of, April 4, 1845. The Chairman bushel of carrots, well cut up by a proper root c utter, is as good as a bushel of oats for a working horse. I have tried the experiment fully and 'satisfactorily; I have fed twelve quarts of sliced carrots, instead of twelve quarts of oats, to a horse, the whole winter, and found no difference in the results. I gave hay with the carrots as we do with the oats. The carrots cost about ten cents a bushel, and the oats near thirty cents a bushel. For. Underhillthe general average price of oats is about thirty-five cents a bushel. The Chairmancarrots are beneficial to horses that have the heaves. Others have practised as I have with like satisfactory results. I have raised three hundred and twenty-five barrels of carrots on three-eighths of one acre. I manured with de composed pe at and ashes. I sub soiled the hill. The white carrot is good; gives rather greater yield than the orange carrot it grows more out of ground, and is easier to gather. I do not attach much value to the rutabaga ; it has, however, one advantage it may be sowed late, and upon any vacant spots in a field, and is so far clear again. From the Cultivator. Of Nter Food For Domesti   C Ani Mals. In most parts of the northern States, a very large portion of the year requires the feeding of dried or stored food to domestic animals. Uusuallyonehalf of the last month of autumn, the three winter months, and at least two of the spring months, must be passed without the aid of pasture, throughout the more northern regions of our country, amounting to almost half of the entire year. It hence becomes one of the most important of all questions in farming what are the cheapest and best kinds of food for the subsistence of domestic animals through this long and costly period The article which stands at the head of the list, as being the most largely used as well as the most important every way, is meadow hay. But auxiliaries are needed; not only because the hay crop is often greatly diminished by drought, but even when abundant, a mixture of other substances contributes to the health, comfort, and th rift of the animal. Greater cheapness, too, is attained by a portion of other kinds of food. An examination and comparison of these hence become a matter of considerable importance. .6 410 10 a. In addition to hay, may be mentioned (as among those substances which are either in common use, or should be) carrots, rutabagas, straw, bees, <a name="potatoes1460"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, and grain. The propriety of the use of these may be judged with tolerable correctness, by taking their respective nutrition values, together with their cost in raising, and comparing them thus with hay. In the following table we have taken a few of the more commonly cultivated roots, and deduced their nutrition value from the actual experiments of a considerable number of distinguished agriculturists, the mean or average of the results they arrived at being taken. The figures indicate the number of pounds of each needed, to be equal to 100 pounds of hay. Scarrots -276Rutabagas -300Mangelwurtzel -317 <a name="potatoes1461"><mark>Potatoes</mark></a> -20 Common turn is -494 t will be perceived that <a name="potatoes1462"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are the most nutrition, carrots next, then rutabagas and mangelwurtzels are nearly equal, while common turn is are far behind the rest. When as to the expense of raising. The same degree of fertility in soil will give about 250 bushels of <a name="potatoes1463"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, 50)0 of carrots, 600 of rut a bag as, and: 70 of in angel wurlzels. This is mere estimate, but is probably not far from the truth. The cost of seed and planting is greater for the <a name="potato1044"><mark>potato</mark></a> than the other crops, but the after culture rather less; on the whole, the expense of raising an acre of each will be nearly equal. The cheapness of seed and ease of sowing are in favor ofrutabagas, but on cloudy soils this advantage is more than balanced by danger from the turn in fly. It is understood, as a matter of course, that in these estimates the best culture is to be given that is, all the roots but the <a name="potatoes1464"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> are sown in drills, from two to two and a half feet apart not more; that they are hold as soon as they are up, or before two inches high, which not only greatly reduces the labor, but allows an early and vigorous growth; and that clean, well tilled, and fertile land is selected for them, and not rich waste land, loaded with the <a name="seeds135"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of millions of weeds, which, without the cost of much labor, get the ascendancy, and .choke down the young crop. Taking all these circumstances into account, it will be perceived that carrot, rotabagas, and mangelwurtzels stand nearly on equal grounds as to merit. But the far greater aridity with which horses will eat carrots, the excellent butter which results from their use when fed to cows, and the little injury they receive from frost, even when the crop or a part of it is left to winter in the ground where it grew, give this crop most eminently the preference. Now for the cheapness of roots as compared with hay. A ton of hay, according to the experiments already mentioned, is equal to 5,500 pounds of carrots, which, at 60 pounds to the bushel, would be 91 bushels. One acre of carrots, then, or 500 bushels, would be equal to 51 tops of hay. According to our own experience, such a crop may be easily raised and harvested for fifteen dollars, which would place the carrots as a cheaper food than hay, if the hay were only three dollars a ten. But the superiority of the condition of horses and cattle, when fed freely on carrots, with hay, is an additional advantage. Strawthle following shows the comparative nutrition properties of straw, by indicating the number of pounds needed, to be equal to 100 lbs* a. 1011.of hay. But it must be observed that these results will vary greatly with the ripe ness or freshness of the straw, and other circumstances connected with its growth or condition. New wheat straw -272 at straw -166 Barley straw -176 tea straw -169 lover hay -94 But as the quantity of straw is wholly depend ant on the quantity of grain raised, and is in fact only a secondary crop, the amount which each farmer possesses can only be controlled by economy in saving what he has, which cattle will eat freely if mixed with hay and chopped, or alone, un r chopped, if well salted. There is another item of cheap and nutritions food in the shape of corns talks, sown for fodder. The value of common corns talks, raised for the grain, depends greatly on the quality, and the amount which cattle can consume without refuse, depending on the size of the s talks, variety of corn, &c. But when the corn is sowed thickly for fodder alone, all is consumed, and a ton is probably fully equal to a ton of hay. Give tons at least (according to repeated trial of the writer) may be raised as follows, on an acre of respectable fertility say rich enough for 500 bushels of rutabagas. Slough and harrow as usual; furrow one way two and a half feet apart, with one horse; straw three bushels of corn. to the acid along these furrows, from a basket; cross harrow to cover the corn; pass the, cultivate or two of three times along the rows, but not he them ; and now with scythes, dry, and draw in. The whole expense, including interest on land, need not be more than twelve dollars; placing the corns talks, which are more pal a table for cows than any hay, at less than two and a half dollars pe i ton. There is no exaggeration about this but it is the result of repeated trial. An objection is made to the extensive use of roots, on account of the difficulty of keeping them and feeding them out through winter. But this objection must disappear at once if a good root cellar, close at hand, is constructed. The farmer must have a barn for his hay, and he must have a cellar for his roots; the latter need cost no more than the former. The objection, therefore, should vanish. Another objection is, that animals do not like roots will not eat them or it is hard to teach them to eat. This difficulty may be variously obviated. Battle scarcely ever refuse any kind of roots. Horses and sheep reject the nm at first; but perseverance, short allowance, or chopping up fine and mixing with meal, and then gradually returning to a coarser chopping, and a diminished quantity of meal, will usually do the work. We have taught old horses, which totally refused rutabagas at first to know down whole ones with great aridity, and a neighbor regularly wintered his store hogs mainly upon them without cooking. The comparison of different kinds of grain with hay, according to the before mentioned experiments, is as follows worn -52 Barley -53 Oats -67 seas -47 heat -a- -461 012 a. Eighteen bushels of corn will therefore be equal to one ton of hay. rThefarmer can judge, from prices, whether a loss or gain would result from a free or scant use of this grain. He can also apply the same rule to other kinds of grain. In reviewing these estimates, it will be perceived that the greatest loss which farmers usually sustain is from the neglect of the free culture of root crops, and of corns talks for fodder. An abundance of roots at hand would enable the farmer to save one half of the hay usually fed to cattle, or one quarter of the whole cost of feeding them. An equal saving would result from the use of corns talk fodder. Taking, then, these two articles together, and not forgetting the increased amount of butter and milk, and the improved condition of the animals, it is prop able that one half the expense of wintering cattle would be saved by an improved system; and perhaps equal advantages would result in the keeping of sheep and horses taking allowance for difficulties in introducing such a system in poor soils or unfavorable localities, and calling the gain only one quarter, what would be the total gain in the State of New York alone ?a? There are in the State, according to census, about 470,000 horses, 1,900,000 cattle, and 5000 000 sheep; the total expense of wintering them cannot be less than twenty millions of dollars, at a low estimate: one quarter of this would be five millions, saved every year in one State. The saving which we have made ourselves, and which we have seen successfully practised by others, satisfies us that these estimates are very moderate, and that this conclusion arrived at is not speculation, but positive and existing fact. The great assistance which such a system would lend to fertile and compact culture, instead of swimming and surface work, by increasing manure and fertility, should induce every enlightened agriculturists to labor assiduously for its general extension. a. 1013APPENDI X No. 26. Sheep, Wool, &c. From the Am. Agriculturists. Sheep Husbandry In Kentucky. I am highly gratified at the various indications I have observed in the American Agriculturists of a disposition favorable to an extension of sheep husbandry in the United States. This is a subject in which I have always taken a deep interest, because believe it will not only greatly promote the agricultural interest, but tend, in an eminent degree, to advance the wealth and prosperity of the whole Union. The difficulty of finding an adequate market for our rapidly increasing agricultural products, renders it necessary that we should avail ourselves of as many new sources for the profitable employment of land and labor as possible. Nothing, in our present circumstances, is better calculated for this purpose, than sheep husbandry. We have land in great abundance, whilst labor is comparatively scarce. Sheep husbandry requires much land, and is attended with the advantage of requiring comparatively few laborers, and, instead of exhausting, tends greatly to fertilizes the land thus appropriated. Sheep husbandry may be practised in almost every part of our extensive country; but doubtless some portions of it are better adapted to the business, and it can be carried on more economically than in others. Without pretending to speak disparagingly of other parts, allow me to set forth the claims of Kentucky as eminently adapted to this highly useful branch of agriculture. To illustrate its fitness for this purpose, suffer me to refer to my own practice in a small way. For some years after I commenced raising sheep (my cleared land and pastures being then very limited) I housed them during the winter months, and fed them with hay, sheaf oats, and occasionally with corn. But when my cleared land and pastures became more extensive, I found that I could winter my sheep to better advantage by suffering them to run on blue grass pastures, kept in reserve for them, hauling out, and scattering on the turf, corn fodder, when the grass became too short or was covered with snow his mode of feeding required less labor, and was less expensive than housing them; and experience soon taught me that my sheep passed through the winter in better condition than when housed and fed on hay and' grain. I have now about three hundred acres of cleared land, nearly one half of which is in meadow, c lover, and blue grass, (po a pratensis) and the other half reserved for cultivation in corn, wheat, hemp, &c; and one hundred and fifty acres in woodland, the greater part well cleared up and sown in blue grass. I have been taught by experience, recently, that sheep will do remarkably well on the rank est c lover, which will enable me in future to keep more of my blue grass pastures in reserve for winter feeding. During the last fall (the season being favorable) my c lover fields furnished my flock, of somewhat less than your hundred, sufficient pasturage till the month of January; and they have been since kept on my blue grass pastures, without the necessity of feeding, except some four or five days, when 1 014 the ground was covered with snow; and there is still grass enough to carry them through the residue of the winter. The low price of hemp, and agricultural products generally, has induced me to sow down much of my cleared land in c lover, which will enable me to keep double the number of sheep I now have, without interfering with my farming operations; and when I get the whole of my woodland cleared up, and set in blue grass, 1 expect to extend my flock to one thousand sheep. Thus you see we are neither under the necessity of incurring the expense of erecting buildings to shelter our sheep, nor of raising grain or hay for their food, nor even to employ laborers to feed them, except during the short time it may become necessary to haul out fodder for them when the ground is covered with snow. And in a single day enough may be hauled out on <a name="seeds136"><mark>seeds</mark></a> to last them a week or more. It is argued by some that our rich lands are too valuable to be appropriated advantageously to sheep husbandry. There would be much force in this objection if they were entirely appropriated to that purpose ; but not so when sheep husbandry is combined with large hemp and corn crops. Hemp has hitherto been a profitable crop, though now it is too low to justify its extensive culture; and large corn crops are necessary with a view of raising horses, mules, cattle, and hogs. There is no system of husbandry so well calculated to prepare our lands for large products of corn and hemp as feeding sheep on our c lover lands. I had supposed, till I made the experiment, that sheep would not do well on rank c lover* To satisfy myself on this point, I put about one hundred and fifty wet hers on a c lover field, when in flower, early in May. The c lover was at the time, nearly as high as the sheeps' backs, (Merinoes) I kept them on this during the whole summer, and in the fall they were fat enough for the butcher. It is true, they trod down much of the c lover ; but as I had an abundance of pasture, this was an advantage, as it left a thick mat of grass on the ground, inter mingled with the droppings of the sheep, distributed with much regularity. This thick covering prevented a loss of manure by washing rains, and rapidly brought on a second growth of c lover, which furnished my whole flock with an abundance of pasture till the early part of January. The season was, however, un usually favorable, and hence the c lover pastures lasted two or three weeks later than usual. In future, I intend to keep my sheep entirely on my c lover fields from the time they are in flower, and thus I shall be able to keep in reserve a greater supply of blue grass for winter feeding. But it is not upon our high price rich lands alone that we can carry on sheep husbandry to advantage. Kentucky has a belt of hill and mountain country, bordering on the Virginia line on the east, and on the rich lands of the State on the west, averaging about seventy five miles in with, extending from the Ohio river and Fig Bandy, latitude 38 30, to the Tennessee line, 360 30' north. The whole of this region is admirably adapted to sheep husbandry ; the most northern part but a few minutes north of my residence, and extending about two degrees farther south. The lands* Feeding sheep on c lover, especially when fattening them, is quite a common practice in Europe and in the northern States of America. They do extremely well u on it; and, if accustomed to it gradually, there is no fear of h oven, the only thing to id had from rank c over pa true. By good feeding, sheep may be pushed forward in their growth and breeding one year. They will, moreover, be larger and finer in the car cases, and produce a greater weight of wool, and that of a superior quality. a. 101 are very cheap the State price of those not yet appropriated only five cents per acre, and those purchased second hand, more or less improved, may be had from 25 to 50 cents per acre, and still less when un improved. This country in a state of nature furnishes, during the spring, summer, and fall months, a time range for sheep, and is susceptible of great improvement by clearing up and sowing the cultivated grasses for winter feeding. This whole country is finely adapted to the Spanish mode of sheep husbandry. Very large flocks might be driven to the mountain region, some thirty to sixty miles from the; rich lands, immediately after s hearing time, grazed till late in the fall, and then brought back to be sustained during the winter on the luxuriant blue grass pastures of the rich lands of the interior. A very intelligent friend, residing in the southern part of the above district of country, speaks of it in the following terms : " One of the strongest proofs of this region of country being favorable to the growing of sheep stock is, that we are situated in the same degree of north latitude with the sheep raising parts of Spainleone, Estremadura, Old A stile, &conly4that our mountains are more richly and abundantly clad with luxuriant wild grasses, and fera, pea vine, and shrubbery, than the mountain regions of Pain where they raise such abundant stocks of sheep. Hayne county, with a few adjoining counties, affords more fine water power than any country of the same extent that I have ever known; and for health and fine, pure drinking water, no country excess it on the face of the globe. Now is the time to commence the business, of sheep husbandry, whilst land can be got almost for nothing. It is worthy of remark that our sheep, which are suffered to roam and graze in the mountains altogether, produce about one-fourth more wool at a s hearing than the sheep that are raised and grazed altogether on our farms, and of much better quality." I nan other part of his letter he says: "the tops of the mountains of Pain are sterile, without verdure, producing no food for sheep, or other animals to graze on. Our mountains are quite different. They are thickly clad from bottom to top, and all over the top, with fine, rich wild grasses and shrubbery of every variety, for stock. to graze on. In the midst of our mountains are to be found a great abundance of salt water and stone coal of the finest quality, together with a great variety of mineral waters and pure springs Another friend, residing in Knox county, writes to me: " My sheep upon my farm, adjoining Barboursville, do not, thrive, even with pasture and winter food, like the sheep in the extremities of the county, which have either pastures nor winter food, except what they get in the woods. Without cultivated grasses of any description, sheep will live and do well all the winter, subsisting on the spontaneous growth of the country Another friend, residing in the northern portion of the above described mountain region, writes that " the counties of Garter and Lawrence, and thee eastern portion of the State, are admirably adapted to sheep husbandry. There are several flocks of sheep in this neighborhood that thrive and increase wonderfully, running at large, at little cost or trouble to the owners. Any flocks have no other reliance, during the winter, but what they get in the woods. The great advantages of this country for sheep husbandry are, the cheapness ,of the land, its adaptation to grasses, grain, and root sit- health fulness. Sheep delight in mountain or hilly land the natural evergreens and shrubbery upon which sheep can feed, and subsist on in winter; though it is not safe to rely altogether upon these 10 16 a. I could give many other extracts from letters addressed to me by highly intelligent gentlemen, residing in the mountain districts above described, to show its admirable adaptation to sheep husbandry, but I refrain from doing so, for fear of running this communication to too great a length. There is also a strip of low priced land bordering on the Ohio river, in the counties of Track en, Pendleton, Campbell, Fenton, and from thence to Louisville, finely adapted to sheep husbandry; but I have not space to go into a description of it. A few remarks as to the probable future market for wool will conclude my letter already, I fear, too long, The returns of the late census show that the number of sheep in the United States in 1840 was a fraction less than 20,00t0,000. Twice this number would probably not furnish more wool than would be needed by a population of 17,000,000, if we were to manufacture all our own blankets, carpets, and every other description of woolen fabrics. The period is not very distant when this will be done, with the exception of some very fine goods. We shall then need about100000000 pounds of wool for a population of 17,000,000, and in that proportion for home consumption, even supposing none should be exported. Now, as our population increases (as past experience demonstrates) at a compound ratio of three per cent. per annum, we shall have a population of 34,000,000 in the year 1864; 51,000,000 in 1878; and 60,000,000in 1888.* We shall need at these respective periods two, three, and four hundred millions of pounds of wool. If we estimate sheep, upon an average, to produce two pounds and a half of wool per head, we shall require, in the year 1888, (a little more than forty years hence) 160,000,000 of sheep. Iii is view of the subject, without looking to a foreign market, holds out a strong inducement to engage in sheep husbandry. A. Beatty. From the Nashville Agriculturists. Sheep In The Cumberland Mountai Of. After having spent part of the years '43 and '44 on different parts of the Cumberland mountains the part of Tennessee more particularly recommended by all writers in your journal, and others, for sheep walks have, since last fall, settled on a portion of them near Was per, Marion county, and will, as briefly as possible, give you the result of my experience, which will, I believe, fully remove any erroneous impression hitherto made. First, as to climate. The extreme salubrity of the mountains makes them the general refuge of the sick. Sheep here are remarkably healthy, and exempt from disease. T The temperature is very even, varying during summer seldom more than from 750 to 800 of Fahrenheit, nor m winter more than from 450 to 30. Now during the two winters, little as there was of it, never remained forty-eight hours on the ground. The forest, so far from being dense, seldom contains more timber, after cutting out the smaller growth, as dog wood, &c, than is desirable for woodland pasture. The rocks, as far as my rabbles have extended, are "few and See a table of population, by an annual in cement of three per cent, in I less Register, January 11, 1815, page 300. a. 101 far between." The better spots of soil (and there are enough to providecid127every farm with sufficient regenerating arable land, under a provide it and enlightened system of tillage) are covered with nutritions weeds, as pea vine, &c, which are nearly all greedily devoured by sheep and cattle, and on which they fare well. The poorer soil is covered with s edge grass, which my sheep have invariably eaten with aridity. When our herds and blue grass lands, which we are laying down, will be fit for past during, the cost of wintering will be greatly reduced, as the former yields good grazing in February the latter during the whole winter. Our young cattle kept in good condition on the winter range and two ears of corn per head per day. Although the wolves of our mountains are larger than those of the prairies, and may be more difficult to exterminate entirely, yet, thanks to our good hunters, their ranks have been already so thinned that they mostly prowl about alone, or at most in pairs, committing their depredations by night, on the sheep and hogs that are left to shift for themselves. In the two years that I have been here, I know of but two instances of their having attacked young stray cattle by night. By day, sheep are perfectly safe and I should presume that every good sheep master would have his flocks, for inspection, home at night, when any common fence will be an ample safeguard for them. C. F. Kramer. Woolverly Farm, Mari Of To, Tenn, June 24. Of. Flei Schmanns Account Of Wool In Germany. Of Enna, December 1, 1845. Dear Of  R: In a former letter I stated that I was present at the convention of German agriculturists which was held at Breslau in the beginning of September last. Being held at the capital of Russian Silesian, a country famous for the production of the finest Peri no wool, the subject of wool was rendered particularly interesting, on account of a large collection of flee ces and specimens of the best breed of Electoral rams and eyes being exhibited to the inspection of the members. The wool growers of the neighborhood of Breslau, and other places of russian and Austrian Silesian, Bohemia, Dora via, Hungarian, Russia, Meckienburg, and Saxony, sent several flee ces of their finest animals, for the purpose of showing the progress the above named countries are making in the improvement of their flocks. One of the largest balls of the university, where the meetings were held, was used for the exhibition of these flee ces. They were spread out upon tables provided with printed labels, which gave the age and sex of the animal, the weight of the flee ce, the stock from which they sprung, with the name of the proprietor, and country where they were sent from, in order to facilitate, by comparison, the examination of those interested in this branch of husbandry. These flee ces were the best which the above named countries could produce; and it was a rich treat to the connoisseur of wool to see the state and progress of that branch of industry in so many countries. They all differed in degree of fine ness, and more or less in the requisite character to 10 18 be pronounced perfect. Only two of them were considered as bearing all the signs of a perfect Electoral wool. They were all of a high degree of fine ness, but wanting in a "constant character" as the Silesian wool growers call it, or in weight, in the length of the wool hair, and in many of those demands which are made on a flee ce of ' constant and thorough character Those which were pronounced as answering all the qualities of Electoral wool came from Russian Silesian. This province has gained the reputation of producing not only the finest wool, but to be the only market where thorough blood can be obtained, and to which wool growers come from near and abroad to select and buy stock to improve their flocks. Saxony has lost its former fame, which arises from mismanagement, and from the increase of population, in consequence of which land becomes too valuable to be used for pasture. The high degree of fine ness to which wool has been brought by the most renowned wool growers of Silesian, can only be fully appreciated when wool from the present period is compared with that of the years when the firstMerinoes were introduced into Germany; which proves to Pain that it was not the climate, nor the rich and suitable pastures, but perseverance, and, above all, intelligence, which took from them the golden flee ce. Nature has done something for this province: its lands are high and dry the pasture has been improved by its high cultivation ; the climate is neither too cold nor too warm, so that a thick cover at any period of the year is inconvenient to the animal. The population of this portion of Germany is known for its superior degree of intelligence ; which, when added to the common virtues of the Teutonic character, industry and perseverance, gives them the advantage over other countries. Kuchelan, Hennersdorf, Cross Sterlitz, Chrzelitz, are the names of the places where the finest stock is raised, and to these places rush the wool growers of other countries from great distances, at the beginning of every year, when the surplus stock is sold, to obtain a few heads of these famous breeds. The prices for which some of these rams are sold seem enormous, and it will astonish some of our American farmers when they are told that a single ram is sold at from                                                         $1,500 to                          $2,000, and then the buyer considers it a favor to have obtained such a famous animal. The rich estate holders of Russia, Hungary, &c, &c, seem to pride themselves on having it said that they obtained a certain famous ram for a great sum of money. It is here as it is everywhere, sometimes more for the name than for the intrinsic value of the object; and a ram from another place, for one fourth of the price, would answer the purpose just as well. The flocks of Prince Lichnowsky have the reputation of being the finest, and of most thorough blood; as, for forty years, he has never relinquish ed for a moment improving his flocks. He has in Russian Silesian about 800) head, from which he sells every year the surplus number for the sum of 40,()00 six dollars; and it is he who obtains such high prices for single heads. Experience has shown that only thorough blood should be employed in the improvement of stocks of all description, and the wool grower is very desirous to obtain it from a flock of established character, where the wool has all those requisites which the manufacturer requires of Electoral wool. Sometimes inferior flocks produce animals having all the requisites desired ;I.  a. 101 but such an animal will produce lambs inferior to itself, and full of the faults of the parents. Such mistakes, which arise from want of knowledge or his applied economy in the purchase of stock to breed from, will retard a flock for years, and produce faults which are deteriorateing to the whole character of the wool. The selection of stock to breed from requires a well practised eye, to detect the injurious character of the wool upon the different parts of the sheep, and at the same time to select an animal which has the proper shape and strength to suit his flocks, the climate, and the local conditions. Several attempts have been made in the United States to raise fine wool, which could bring prices equal to those of the Silesian market; but it never succeeded fully. The first importation of Merinoes from Saxony was at an early period, when Saxony flocks had no constant character in their wool when a fine and fault less animal was scarcely to be got; and at that period the wool growers of Saxony had, neither, the experience to give advice to others. Those imported from Pain were of as coarse a nature as those of Saxony, and the whole business of crossing was not conducted with sufficient care. The importations made of late are of a higher degree of fine ness; but, as it is generally a matter of speculation on the part of those to whom the well meaning wool growers in trust the business of selecting and buying, the selections ate made from flocks of less thorough blood and imperfect character of wool, and the name of being Saxon or Silesian sheep must generally cover all the faults of the chosen stock. Those who know the country, the language, and are good connoisseurs, are made the dupes of the cunning speculator. Now easily, then, is it to deceive a stranger, from a foreign country, whose time is limited, and who has to trust to that which is told him. Nature has destined that the United States shall be the granary of the world, and that its extensive tracts of mountainous land shall raise the necessary material for clothing for its vast territories. The high Alleghanywill give to innumerable flocks of Merinoes an excellent pasture during the hot days of summer; and, when the snow covers the mountains, the spreading plains below the snowy summit will, nearly all the year round, yield sufficient pasture, especially in the more southern parts of the Union, where scarcely a hand full of fodder will be required to be laid in for winter. The luxuriant heavy grass of the prairies will answer for the English long wooled sheep, and for the hardy back el of Hungary, which furnishes also the most delicious mutton. I obtained, from the committee which was appointed for this branch, specimens from the different flee ces; and I flatter myself to be able to lay before you a collection of specimens rare and curious. I prolonged my stay in this part of Germany to obtain wool from the animal before it was shorn and washed, and shall visit for that purpose, yet, the most celebrated establishments of that kind. I made drawings of those rams and eyes which are considered as having the true character of Electoral breed, and hope to add some more such sheepish likenesses from the stock of the not celebrated flocks. I made also a collection of sketches of agricultural implements of the different countries I traversed, which, I think, will interest you, not only for their originality, but as a proof how a nation clings to the agricultural implements as well as customs of their forefathers, whereby we are enabled to trace the different races, in the most distant ratifications, with 100 certainty; and sometimes, when no trace has been left of their original language, the plough tells from where -they come. The plough is also the scale by which we can judge of a nation in regard to its intellectual it y and general state of social condition. We may fairly say, as is the plough so is the intellect, and so is their personal liberty. The United States proves fully this position: there it is that we find the best improved plough; there is it, also, where the farmer stands the highest in point of intellect and personal freedom, over all others of the globe. The farmer of the United States endeavors also to enrich himself with the knowledge of his noble profession. I hope the day is not far when they will take measures in order to accomplish this important object more fully that they will instruct their representatives, in State legislatures, to establish regular agricultural schools, in which their sons, after having passed through the ordinary schools, may receive at that school that information which enables them to husband their lands with more advantage, according to the rules deduced from experience; whereby the country will be enriched, love to the land of their fathers increased, and the main pillar of the republic strengthened. In my next, I shall say a few words on agricultural schools. I visited, among others, that of Moegelin, near Berlin, (russias first establishment of that description) which was intrusted to the wise direction of Her, a name so well known to the agriculturists of all countries. Your most obedient servant, Of. L. Flei Schmann. On. Edmund Burke, Commissioner of Patents. From Miller & Smiths European Times of January 4, 1846. Of   Verpool Annual Wool Report. The favor abe views we expressed in our last annual circular of the prospects of the wool trade were fully realized during the first six months of 1845. An extent of consumption, probably without precedent in the sameperibi of time, was accompanied by an unusual steaminess of price, and freedom from any appearance of speculation or over trading; and yet there has seldom been a period, with the elements of the trade so sound and promising, that has resulted in so little profit to those engaged, Whether importer, staple r, or manufacturer. This we principally attribute to the relatively high price of the raw material. The early months of the year were marked by unusual activity. The protracted winter gave an extension to the home trade, whilst the continental dam and, particularly from Germany, was good. Some inconvenience was experienced by the export houses from the navigation continuing closed to s: late a period. In many cases goods ordered arrived too late for the Leipsic Master fair, which may, to some extent, interfere with future orders. In June and July it was felt that the continued prosperity of the wool trade would much depend on the result of the approaching harvest. The general, feeling being favorable, imparted confidence to transactions, and led to an improvement in the value of most descriptions of. 102 1 wool. These anticipations having, unfortunately, not been realized, the wheat crop being reported as deficient in quantity and inferior in quality, with the admitted failure of the <a name="potato1045"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop to a serious extent, have, for the last few months, subjected the trade to feverish excitement, and much limited the amount of business ; other causes have contributed to this result. The large absorption of trading capital in railway and other schemes; the consequent increased value of money and restricted banking accommodation; and, more than all, the narrowed consuming power, arising from the large advance in the cost of subsistence to the great bulk of the population, have operated injuriously on the trade during that period. Notwithstanding these obstructions, we report a less depreciation in value than might have been expected. Stocks of goods are generally light, and of the raw material by no means excessive. We must not omit to notice the intense anxiety with which every section of the trade is awaiting the expected legislative action on the corn laws. Should it terminate in the total abandonment of all import duties on corn and provisions, the change will be of incalculable advantage to the wool trade at large; and we believe that no branch of it will reap more substantial benefit than the home wool growers. The growing importance of this place as a wool market is becoming more apparent every year, as shown by the rapidly increasing, imports and, from its continuity to the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire, Tales, and Scotland, it will, no doubt, before long, command a much larger share of the trade. Our receipts from Australia have hitherto been comparatively insignificant, Or ni on continuing to tale by far the greatest portion of colonial wool. We are surprised at this, when the many advantages of this port are considered. I to vicinity to numerous consuming districts is certain to insure a large attendance of the smaller manufacturers, who form, the chief support of the public sales. In London, the excessive quantities brought forward at one series (sometimes exceeding 30,000 bales) unduly limits the time for examination ; operates, even under favorable circumstances, against prices, and, in dull times, is disastrous in tendency. He are convinced that, if a more equal distribution of imports were established, the return to merchants would be more satisfactory. Australianthe total receipts from these colonies show a steady increase, which will be much extended by the enhanced value of sheep, having put a stop to the boiling down for tallow. The condition of the last clip has been generally satisfactory. By s hearing earlier, the burr was partially avoided, and the season seems to have been favorable for washing. Previously to the first arrivals, which were much earlier than usual, the stocks at home were nearly exhausted. The accounts from the Germanfairs stated an unusual demand for low and middling qualities for their own consumption, while the French were known to be operating largely in pain. These circumstances caused the first public sales to go off with great spirit. In October trade began to slacken, though the result of the public sales in London during that month was quite as favorable as could be expected. The large arrivals up to this date (which were, in fact, larger than apparent, owing to the increased six of the bags) induced the wealthy dealer and consumer to stock freely, under the impression, which we think well founded, ti fat the entire import will be required before next season. We are glad to notice throughout the year an improved demand for the better qualities, which will be encouraging to the growers who attend to their flocks. Combing wools have been little in request, owing to the 10 22 D .of. No. 140.depression of the worsted trade. This branch is beginning to rally, and promises a better demand in the spring. Gape of Good Hopethe shipments from this quarter show great improvement, amply testified by the high rates the best flocks have commanded during the season. This result of judicious management in selection and careful packing will, we feel assured, be sufficient encouragement to perseverance. It is only by such means that former prejudices can be overcome, The best parcels now take equal rank with those from Australia, and ate purchased by the trade with full confidence, whilst the more mixed and inferior kinds are an article of doubtful sale. The system of packing un washed and york y flee ces with the washed is most pre judicial, and cannot be too strongly pointed out. Spanishour market has not kept pace with the advanced rates paid for this description on the other side, occasioned by French competition. It has, therefore, been difficult to effect sales at regenerating prices to the importer. The demand of late has been chiefly confined to middle qualities. Portugalbest Is have been readily sale able. Most other kinds have been little sought after. Porto Mountainthe demand has been chiefly confined to the best combing parcels; other kinds have been comparatively neglected. United States -the import from this quarter affords a striking proof of the beneficial effect of the remission of the wool duty. It has excited great interest and surprise in the trade, and may be considered the greatest novelty of the year. The quantity received to this period, as an experiment, exceeds 3,800 bales, comprising a great variety of qualities. It is to be regretted that the unfavorable turn of trade has been against the operation. In washing and preparing the wools sufficient pains have not been taken and there is a want of discrimination in the selection of qualities. To far as used they have been highly approved; and we have full confidence that, if got up with care, they would be highly esteemed in this country. Theamerican prairies afford peculiar advantages for the growth of wool; and we believe this branch of the trade will become one of great and increasingimportanceieruvan t and alpacaTill within the last few months, the supply of sheeps wool was limited. It is now increased, but the demand is restricted, at rather declining prices of late. The imports of al papa have been rather large. There are no means of ascertaining the exact quantity, but a careful investigation leads us to estimate it at about 18.000 ballots, at 80 lbs. each. It must be borne in mind that, during 1844, great difficulties attended the shipment; and the apparent excess of 1845 e presents a portion of the previous years clip. For the first six months there was great activity, and consumers bought freely for arrival. The demand has since been heavy, at almost nominal prices. The high rates abroad render it probable that, considerable loss will attend the import. Due nos Tyres, tcGood clean parcels hair e been in fair request. Mlle other kinds have been rather heavy of sale, and at declining prices, in consequence of the expense and difficulty in getting them cleaned. The unsettled state of the trade on the other side will so doubt interfere with shipment, and may cause an improved demand. Last lndiaUnder this head we notice a considerable increase, and it is satisfactory to observe that the demand has fully kept pate with it, More. 102 3 attention has been paid to the assortment, which it is desirable should be persevered in. The increasing demand for low wools will enable the trade to take any quantity that can be furnished. Russiahere the increase appears considerable; but the imports have arrived much earlier than usual. The trade generally has been heavy, except for good combing parcels, which have throughout commanded full prices. The greater portion has been of an inferior description. Mediterraneanthe items under this head, including I italian, Greek, Smyrna, and the varieties of Turkey wools, have been dull of sale at pricesunremunerating to the importer. Some quantity of Egyptian wool has been received, a description which has not before found its way to this country. It is clean and well washed, and a portion is well adapted for combing, but there is a great deal of short mixed with it. Greater care is required in the assortment. The decline in English skin wools has affected its value. We doubt if it will answer except when English combing wools rule high. English, Scotch, and I rishNotwithstanding the depression in the worsted trade, the consumption has reached a full average. Prices have varied little throughout the year, the general range not varying to any material extent from this period last year. Stocks with staples and manufacturers are light, and not extensive with the farmers, who show more disposition to hold than give way at present. In exports, the principal feature is the increased amount of woolens sent to the east, which, we understand, form one of the most lucrative branches of the trade with China, the rising importance of which it is difficult to estimate. The exports of woolens to the United States, which have, for some years past, been diminishing, continue to recede; but the tone of the presidents message on commercial affairs leads to the expectation that this important market may again revive.

Appendi X No. 27. Hogsthei R Products, &c. From the Cincinnati Chronicle. Producti   Of And Trade Of Hogs In Europe And Ameri Of. The immense production of hogs in the United States, and the heavy trade in them at Cincinnati, demand something more than a mere superficial view of the transactions, at one point, in order to understand the magnitude and relations of the trade. We can furnish the commercial reader with some statistical facts, which will serve as landmarks in taking a broad view of the subject. In the year 1839 there were in the United States, in all, 26,301,293 hogs. Of this number more than one half of the whole were in eight States, viz Tennessee had -2926607Kentucky -2310533Ohio -2099746I n diana -1623608I illinois -1494254Missouri -a- -1271161Mississippi -1001201Alabama -1423873Total -a- -a- 14,151,983. The States of Virginia, New Work, and North Carolina, each, have more hogs than I illinois and Missouri ; but we have taken the States of the west and the southwest together to show the result. Now we want to draw two or three inferences from the number of hogs in the several States, before we compare the production with that of Europe 1. In the first place, hogs are fatted and nearly supported on maize and      indian corn. They exist, therefore, in the several States, just in proportion to the production of I indian corn. Now, Tennessee has the most. and the three States of Tennessee, Ohio, and Kentucky far more than any other three States, of both I indian corn and hogs. The twenty-six millions of hogs in the United States can scarcely consume less than two hundred millions of bushels of corn! They are, therefore, the greatest market for that article 2. If we suppose these hogs to average 180 pounds each, and to be worth as they are)                $3.50 per cut, then this animal alone is, in the United States, worth One Hundred And Of  Xtysfx Of  Lli   Ons Of Dollars, Or three times the entire cotton crop for the year 1845. The value of swine in the State of Ohio alone exceeds twelve millions of dollars 3. It is important to discover how large a proportion of swine is annually killed. There are two sorts of consumption for swine: one may be called the commercial, and the other the domestic consumption. One is. 102 for family use, and the other for commerce. Almost every farmers family kill one or more hogs. This is a constant drain on the increase. But, on the other hand, the increase of swine is so great that it will exceed, in one year, the original stock, unless checked. The main inquiry is, how large a proportion of hogs are fatted in order to supply the provisions of commerce? In the year 1845 there will have been killed at the various pork packing establishments of Ohio about 500,000 hogs. About 150,000 of these may be set down as from other States. It is fair, therefore, to assume that commerce consumes about 350,000 hogs in Ohio per annum. The present stock cannot be much, if any, under 2,500,000. It follows, therefore, that commerce consumes near about one-sixth part of the stock on hand. We believe that, in the United States generally, this is much too high an estimate; yet the figures, in the western States, will show this result very nearly 4. But suppose the total is really as great as the facts imply; then it follows (a fact of great moment to the packer) that no safe conclusion whatever can be drawn from the number of hogs killed in one year, of the real number of the stock that will be brought to market next year. This is obvious, if the reader will reflect that a given ,stock of hogs will nearly double themselves in one year, and that yet the number of hogs of commerce is only one-sixth "part of the original number! This is the great source of the constant errors made in calculating the number of hogs to be brought to. market, and the effects on the market. The truth is, the domestic or family consumption is the great fact, and that we cannot arrive at exactly. We shall proceed to show the number of hogs raised proportion ably in Europe and America. We have before us Micgregors Statistics, which contains a table of the agriculture and live stock of Europe for 1828. Since then the population of Europe has increased more than ten per cent arid if we add ten per cent. to the live stock, we shall have the full amount, for this species of stock does not increase in densely populated countries equally with that of other productions.

It shows that Russia, Austria, and Great Britain, having a population of one hundred and twenty millions of people, have only as many swine as the United States, with twenty millions651026 right western States, with a population of six millions, have as many swine as. Great Britain, France, Russia, and Bavaria, with Vseventyive, millions !a! The European" States have not enough I indian corn tofeedctk m upon. The proportion of swine between the United States and some of the European States is thus United States to Russia -6 to 1, " to Austria -9 to 1" ' to Great Britain -7 to 1 to France -10 to to Pain -16 to 1 Russia being a thinly populated country, and having the most mast, has the most swine; but, for the converse reason, the southern States of Europe have the least. The United States have six times as many, in proportion, as Russia. The same dis proportion extends, but in less proportion, to other animals, If the people of Europe were a meat eating people, they could not find a supply in their country. These animals would be killed off in half ar dozen years. But they are not a meat eating people. They live upon every species of vegetable, much as the animals do. In I re land they depend upon <a name="potatoes1465"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>: in Scotland, in no small degree, upon o at meal. Strange as it may seem, thousands of people in Pain and France live, in a great degree, on chestnut sa food which is scarcely fit for pigs to eat. In some countries they eat rye ; and in Russia they mix all the br an of grain, making a very coarse, rough bread. The pork of the western country is chiefly in demand at the Atlantic seaports, for our commercial marine, now. rapidly approaching the largest in the t World. The adventurous whale man, the hardy fisher for cod andmackerel, the thousand costers, who sail in every bay and in let from thePenobscot to the Rio Grande, all, more or less, eat pork. It serves both as butter and meat, with the fish and <a name="potatoes1466"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> which they have constantly on hand. Of   he demand for American pork is, on the whole, likely to increase; because, the class of people who eat it are increasing, and there is no othercounrryt to supply the demand.

A few days since we took a r amble up Beer creek.

But, however undesirable is the brink of this murmuring stream, the vale through which it runs is nevertheless a fountain of wealth. Among the establishments there is one which is a common receiver of nearly all the off al of the city slaughter houses. From it is turned out an immense amount of grease and inferior land. A large portion of the daily market beef legs and thanks is purchased by the proprietor; and, after the marrow and grease are extracted, the bones are sold for the various purposes of button making, whip handle finishing, the manufacture of Chinaware orporcelain, at id also ivory black. Of the latter, large quantities are used in the manufacture of shoe blacking; and a mill in this noted vale is expressly appropriated to the grinding of bone, with of horns, &c, for the manufacture of black. Of the small bone used for black and force lain, this house ships to foreign ports, mostly Europe, about 400,000 pounds per year; and of the large bone, which are principally used for the fe rules and butts of whip stocks, and the manufacture of buttons, about 130,000 pieces. These quantities are exclusive of the amount consumed here, which is very considerable, particularly of "he former kind. A few years ago, nothing of the kind was done here, and, as far as bone was concerned, was entirely a waste. The prices here are, for the small, 16 per ton, (a large contract closes with 1844, for export to Europe, at that rate, packages included) and for the latter,                                                                     $10 per 1,000 pieces. The price last year was        $8. Soap grease is the great staple of this Vesuvius, very large quantities of which are shipped to the eastern cities. Forty thousand dollars' worth was mentioned to us as the value of what is at this time on sale in New Work alone. The prices here now are, four cents for No. 1, and three and a half for No. 2. One of the other articles made to a great extent is neats foot oil, from the nether legs and hoofs. This sells, by wholesale, at 62 to 75 cents per gallon. Another is sausage skins, with which not only our own market is supplied, but shipments are constantly making to the south and cast. They sell here at (cid12710 per keg size, the common land keg. Dogs bristled are another thing prepared by this and other houses, or house in the city; and of this article large shipments are also made, both of the combed and tied, used by saddles, shoemakers, &c, and of the curled. The former kind sells at 30 to 35 cents per pound. The curled are used for the same purposes to which curled hair is applied mattress, cushioned chairs, sofas, &c. One other thing we learned in this our evening r amble, was, that we have with us a manufactory of Russian blue. The stock from which it is made is cattles hoofs and plucks, and the blood of hogs and cattle. The hoofs command                                                           $16 per ton. The manufacturer is a German. It is but a year or eighteen months since he commenced operations, and cannot be said to be fairly under way, but has sufficiently tested the experiment clearly to demonstrate the practice ability of successfully competing with the foreign article both as to quality and price, and he expects in a few years to be able to consume a very large portion of the blood to be obtained here. We were also told of an instance of a foreign demand for blood. The facts we have 1 028 Does.

Shall we cultivate the arts and sciences, and encourage skill and enterprise in our country From the Popular Record of Modern Science. The Value Of A Dead Horse In Pari S. The use to which dead horses are put may be gathered from a brief account of the establishment at Montfaucon, near Paris, consisting of what we should call knack mrs' yards. After the horses are deposited there, the hair of the mane and tail is cut off, which amounts to about a quarter of a pound; the skin is then taken away, which is disposed of to the manners, and used for various purposes. The shoes are sold as old iron ; the feet are cut off, dried, and beaten, in order to make the hoofs come away, or are left to put rely till they separate of themselves, when they are sold to turners, comb makers, manufacturers of ammonia and Russian blue. Very morsel of fat is picked out, collected and melted, and is used for burning by makers of enamel and glass toys, gr easing shoe leather an& harness, and manufacturing soap and gas. The workmen choose the best pieces of the flesh to eat, preferring those about the head, and sell the rest for dogs, cats, hogs, and poultry. It is also much used for manure and making Russian blue. The bones are disposed of to cutlers, fan makers, &c, and are often made into ivory black; and also occasionally serve as fuel for melting the fat, and for manure. The sinews and tendons are sold to the blue makers the small intestines are made into coarse strings for lathes, &c, or serve as manure. Even the maggots, which breed in great quantities in these yards, turn to account, for many are sold to the fisherman; and the rest, when developed into flies, attract such numbers of swallows, that the Parisians make a shooting ground of the neighborhood.

Poultryr The economy of poultry may be classed under three heads: first, in their natural state, which is the department of the natural ist; second, in their domestic state in the country, with a full range of the farm yard and fields, in which i the poultry keeper is concerned, for his profit; and, third, in their artificial state, in or near towns, in pens or yards, which will chiefly engage i my attention in the present article. The best and cheapest method of feeding l must leave to be detailed by those who keep poultry in large quantities. 'ShelterFowls should always be kept in a dry, warm, sheltered situation, (a southerly aspect is to be preferred) for they enjoy and benefit greatly by the " warms in the sun" as well as requiring protection from its scorching rays, and a secure (storm) shed for rainy weather. The roasting house and laying house, if separate, should communicate, that early layers may have early access to the nests, and also communicate with the storm shed, for the fowls to run in in security, if they should leave their roots early in the morning. The nests should be numerous, either in boxes or baskets not too deep, but room y; some situated high, some low, and as independent of each other as possible; each supplied with sweet, short, and soft straw, and a small nest egg or two of chalk, the size of a pigeons egg. If the nests be too deep, they break the eggs in jumping in and out; and if the nests are not room y, sitting hens have no room to turn easily, and consequently break the eggs by not being able to get to them softly. They then eat the broken eggs, which gives them the habit of doing so at other times. They should root warm at night; the perches high from the ground, and of easy access, by means of lower ones or ladders. The more light some the house, the better for promoting dry air and a free circulation; besides, fowls cannot see at all, being quite stupefied and helpless, in the dark; consequently the feathered tribe always retire to root before the sun goes down, Shutters to the glazed windows are unnecessary, except for better security, or to prevent fowls from leaving their roots too early in the morning, to disturb tick wish neighbors; otherwise they come out almost as soon as daylight begins to appear. The feeding places, if under cover, so much the better, as a precaution for wet weather, and as far as possible removed from the nests, that the hens which happen to be laying at the time, or which may be sitting, may not be disturbed and enticed off their nests and eggs at improper times. Being evidently natives of a worm country, they are scarcely yet perfectly acclimated in our variable and colder regions; although so widely diffused, from time immemorial, over the whole face of the globe, they have retained a peculiar susceptibilityof damp and chilliness most of their diseases arising from, them or catarrh catching colds. The lungs of fowls are particularly tender: the finer the species, the less is it hardy. Cleanlinessfowls, being cleanly by nature, thrive when regularly attended, but degenerate and sick en if neglected. In an artificial state of ex Doc. No. '140. iO11isteee they t require to be supplied by art fit hi what, in nature, they wuldolbtdin for t6rdimselves. For this purpose they should have a regular supply; in some coiiehient part of their shed, of if ted din de daily, to room in and cleanse themselves, and which should be stein ch and. This precaution will keep them entirely free from ver min of any description. Green food his being quite as necessary for health as corn, to supply this requirement of nature they should have daily a good supply of sweet and fresh green vegetables. Cabbage and let tube are the best, (turn in tops and water dresses) but on no account any sour plants, which scour them as do spina ch, the cuttings from grass plans, and most sorts of garden <a name="seeds137"><mark>seeds</mark></a>) as their instinct does not serve them to choose the wholesome from the noxious weeds, more than it does animals that happen to stray into ac lover field, or happen to receive too large a quantity into their stables. I have known them to burst. Green food, with fowls, is an astringentthevery reverse from what vegetables are with us. This fact will not appear so surprising when it is recollected that one takes them raw, and the other cooked. A plentiful supply of clean water daily, in well cleansed vessels, and wholesome food, is necessary. Frequent changes, and mixtures of corn, improve the appetite. Barley is decidedly their stay pie food in this country indian corn, or sometimes rice, mixed, for a change. Oats occasionally but, in too large a quantity, are apt to scour. Occasionally buckwheat and hemp seed, as a stimulant, mixed with the barley, for a change are very beneficial, particularly whilst mounting. One meal may be composed of boiled or steamed <a name="potatoes1467"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, well ma shed up whilst hot, with a portion of barley meal or o at meal for a change, but which must be allowed to remain till cold. Looks, copying errors from one another, make a great mistake in advising food to be given hot. It is unnatural: they have no good cooks amongst them in their own state; and it is decidedly injurious to their digestive organs, except when fattening, when they are doomed soon to be killed for table. Need twice a day at least, or three times, if not too fattening; morning, early, before the usual hour for laying, if possible ; at noon the noon tide meal may be the <a name="potatoes1468"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, as above directed) and before sunset not later than four o clock) that they may go to root by daylight, or they will go without their food. Regularity greatly tends to health, and disturbance of any sort is very hurt full. Vice occasionally, boiled in a cloth greatly increases its bulk, and they are very fond of it. Beaume R says that great economy is derived from sleeping or boiling the barley, to increase its bulk, when they will be satisfied with one third less quantity. But I cannot speak of this from my own experience, nor can I say that beneficial effects are produced by giving them much flesh, raw or boiled. But ft, as advised in books, produces scoutings; spiced or salted meats, and kitchen stiff, are certainly pernicious to their stomachs. In fattening for the table, when they are not required to live long, or show fine feather, this may not be of any consequence. Will some of your practical correspondents enlighten us ?a? They require in pens or small yards, in towns, to be well supplied with grit, sand, and small gravel; s lacked lime, and old mortar wounded, is very beneficial, and serviceable in assisting to make the pen or yard dry. I will add to the above, that there is no economy in keeping poultry in towns in small quantities, which is always exceedingly expensive, if well fed and taken care of; which, however, is compensated for to those who wish to make certain that the eggs are quite fresh and newly laid. All calcula1032 nations of expense must be erroneous, there being so many contingent expenses. As a source of trade, much depends upon rearing the best breeds, to be early in the season, laying in stock and store at proper times, having a ready sale for produce, and to ' buy cheap and sell dearKEEPI Of Poultryprofi Table Busi  Ness.

It is frequently asserted that poultry is more plague than profit. Butt his; like many other assertions, must be taken with proper qualifications. We contend, if you have a good breed of fowls, take proper care of them, and are near a reasonably good market, that the keeping of fowls is as profitable a business, for the amount of capital invested in it, as a farmers boy or the women of the family can be engaged in. To prove this, we will cite one example. When we were at the pleasant farm (last September) of Messrs. H. and J. Carpenter, of Poughkeepsie, their brother, Mr. Gerardcarpenter, showed us an account of the number of eggs laid by their hen sup to that time from the 1st of January. It was so exact and satisfactory, that we requested him to continue it to the end of the year ; which he has obligingly done, and now here is the result. 
1038He commenced, on the 1st of January, 1844, with 67 hens and 3 cocks. But of this flock were sold and lost, by the 1st of May, 7 hens; from that time up to the 16th of September, they lost two more. Since then we are not informed what the losses have been. It would probably be fair to set down the average stock of hens during the year at 60 head. These laid in the following months, all of which were consumed by the family or sold n Januaryfebruary -MarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctober -NovemberDecember191 eggs 400 "a- -89 2 "10 371 086 "700 "83 8 "S -7 40 "540 "113 "21 'none 65 58 "I n addition to this number, it is supposed full 300 were used for sitting, got lost, broken, or spoiled, which are not taken into the above account. The average price that the eggs brought at Poughkeepsie was                                                         $1 per hundred, which makes their value -a-    $65.58Chickens raised, 101 at 20 cents each -20 20        $85.78We suppose that this flock of hens may have consumed grain during the year equivalent to 70 bushels of corn. This is allowing three fourths of a will per day throughout the year to the flock of hens, and nothing to rear the chickens; but as, during the summer, hens that have the range of a farm need no feeding, this quantity of grain is considered ample for their support. At 50 cents per bushel for the corn, this would make the expense of their feed                 $35, which, deduced from the value of eggs and chickens, leaves a net profit of               $50.78. It is considered that the manure of the hens, and the insects they destroy during the season, are equivalent to taking care of them. The actual feed of the above hens was as much corn, mixed with a few oats, as they would eat; the grain being placed where they could always get at it. In the winter they had a little meat. They were not confined at all, and had access to lime and gravel while the ground was covered with snow. Their roasting place was comfortably enclosed under the barn. Appendi X No. 29. Culti   Vati   Of. From the Albany Cultivator. An interesting experiment, showing at the same time the benefits of stirring the soil, and also the danger of drawing false conclusions, is given by. Vernon War court, in the agricultural department of the London Gardeners' Chronicle. He had seen a statement that the tailings of wheat, called "chicken scraps" being in fact only the refuse of the grain, would yet produce a good crop of the heaviest, fullest seed. Disbelieving it, and being desirous of un deceiving the farmers by proving its fallacy, he proceeded to try the experiment. Accordingly, a small plat of ground was sown, one half with good wheat, and the other half with tailings. In returning home, after an absence of some weeks, in the spring, he was surprised to find the latter covering the ground as thick as the grasss on the meadow; but found, upon inquiry, that the person having charge of the experiment, considering the seed good for nothing, had sown five or six times as much of it as of the other. As this thwarted the design of a comparison, half the thick sown was directed to be hold out till of the same thickness as the other from good seed. The other half of the thick sown was left to take its chance. At harvest, the first twelve plants in one row of each sort were taken as a sample, and the produce weighed as follow strains. Average ears per plant 12 plants from good seed, weighed -92 6 6.612 plants from tailings, left thick, weighed -351 3.812 plants of the same, thinned, weighed -1 133 7,8I t is of course evident to every intelligent person that the increase in the product of the hold portion was owing to the cultivation by hoping, which is further proved by the meager supply from the united wheat from the railings. But the experiment performed under other circumstances, and with other seed, might have led to very erroneous conclusions. Account Of Of Experi Ment In Deep Ploughi Of. Of Rev. John Jaffray, Dunbar, East Lothi Of. The experiment was made upon a small field, which is sixty-five feet above the level of the sea. The soil is sandy, resting upon a sub soil of sand and gravel of great depth, and so thoroughly drained by the declivity of the surrounding lands, the want of moisture is its natural effect, There is but little difference between the soil and the stratum on which it rests beyond what culture and manure have made; but, from sinking of gravel, treading of horses, and pressure of the plough, year after year, and age after age, the Sub soil had become crusted, hard, and beaten, as a road. In short, a. 103 5 front show sloughing, there was but little of cultivated earth ; and, as on a al: such soils. in dry seasons, the crop was scorched and scanty. With a view to render this field fruitful in any season, it was sub soiled withrtheDeanston plough, eighteen inches deep, and sown with wheat for crop in 1837. The great vigor and luxuriant e of the crop attracted general notice ;and it must have yielded an extraordinary increase, if it had not been lodged by wind and rain shortly after the ear appeared. Therefore it gave only thirty-eight bushels of grain to the acre, but three tons of straw, which proved its great strength. To this crop, one of <a name="potatoes1469"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> and two of wheat succeeded ; but it is the culture of this field for crop in 1841, and the result, which chiefly constitute this report. It was all equally dressed with sea ware; and four acres of the same quality and description were measured and staked off. Two of these acres were ploughed twelve inches deep, with two horses, and two of them eighteen inches deep, with four horses. These two portions in all other respects were cultivated and managed exactly alike. They were planted with <a name="potatoes1470"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> of the On species in the last week of April, eight inches deep, twelve inches asunder, and in drills thirty inches wide, running at right angles to the furrows of the experimental sloughing. The <a name="potatoes1471"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were planted deeper than usual, therefore the shoots were longer in coming through the ground; but when they did appear, it was with great strength and regularity. They expanded their broad deep green leaves, and grew vigorously in the dry sandy soil, in a very severe and long continued drought. It was soon evident that the deepest ploughed portion had the advantage. The stems and branches of its plants were stronger, and they first covered the ground. The <a name="potatoes1472"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> were lifted in the last week of October, when it was found that the land ploughed twelve inches deep produced fifty-seven balls per acre, and the land ploughed eighteen inches deep produced sixty-nine bollspeq acre, being a difference of twelve balls per imperial acre, of four cut. to the ball* 4 c *a* 4 4 -a- *a* *the <a name="potatoes1473"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> from the deep tillage were larger, more of one size, had fewer small ones, and not so many of a green color as those from the other division. The quantity on the deep tillage is eighty-seven balls per Scots acre, which is a good crop for any year; and it will readily be granted that it is far above the average of the district this year, many fields not producing half a crop. *a* *a* *a* But though this is a greater crop for the season, it must have been still greater if the field had been less exposed, as it has no shelter; and three days of very violent wind in the first week of August broke down the plants, which, from their great luxuriant e, were then very tender, and checked their growth. The practical conclusions to be drawn from this experiment are First, that deep sloughing increases the produce. Next, that, as both portions of the land used in the experiment were opened up eighteen inches deep by the sub soil plough for crop in 1837, the full benefit of that operation is not obtained till the earth so loosened is again ploughed up. And the reason is evident; for it is then only that the soil is deepened, by an addition from the sub soil with which it is intermixed, and rendered more fruitful. Lastly: if deep sloughing increases the produce, it increases also the sup 10 36 ply of vegetable manure; and a greater portion of manure, added to improved culture, must produce a progressive increase of fertility and of produce. From the American Agriculturists. Benefi T Of Subsoi L Ploughi 4 farmer from Connecticut informs us that he has raised a field of corn the past summer, which he thinks will average 80 bushels to the acre, and that he selected half an acre of the best, from which he gathered 134 bushels of ears; all sound and well filled out. That while his neighbors' corn adjoining was withering with the drought, his was luxuriant; and he attributes the whole of his success to sub soil sloughing. Another fact he stated was, that the whole expense of planting, cultivating, and harvesting, after the ground was ploughed, did not exceed                $3 per acre; that he did not touch it with a he, but worked it with a harrow and cultivate or; and what few weeds were not reached with these, about the hills, were pulled up by hand before going to seed. We intend to visit his farm next summer, when we shall have something further to report. Newcastle County Agri Cultural Soci    Ety. To the Committee on Farmsgentlemen: In competing for the valuable premium offered by the society for the best farm, taking into consideration the former and present condition of said farm, I proceed to give as correct a statement as my memory and a few notes taken from time to time will permit. In the 4th of March, 1834, I removed to Heat land, which I had purchased of J. A. A yard, on a credit of ten years, in 1832. This part of the farm, which contained about 360 acres, is situated on Bohemia Manor, partly in It. Georges Hundred, Newcastle county, and partly about 30 acres) in Cecil county, Maryland. It was very poor at that time, having always been rented from the first settlement of the country which, by the gravest one of the original proprietor, Augustine German, was in 166 still the time of my purchase. Heat land, previous to my purchase, contained 524 acres, nearly all of which was till able, there being no wood or other waste land upon the farm. It had always been worked upon the three field system, one of which was planted with corn ; wheat was then sown in the standing corn after the fodder had been gathered; then, after the wheat came off, the stubble was pastured one year, without having any c lover or other grass <a name="seeds138"><mark>seeds</mark></a> own. The next year it was again planted with corn, and so on with thatimpoverishing course; for which a fixed rent was demanded of 700 bushels of corn and 125 bushels of wheat. To oats were allowed to be sown. The 700 bushels of corn, at the present price of 40 cents per bushel, would amount to                            $280; the 125 bushels of wheat, at the present price, (90 cents would be                                                                $112.50-together,                $392.50-and this for the farm before any was sold off ; but reduce it to the ratio of the present size of the farm, say about one third off, and you have a rent of                            $260, out of which the repairsDoco. No. 140 103 were to be paid. Such was the exhausted state of the land, that it scarcelyepai1 six per cent. (after de ducting for repairs) of            $4,100, the amount of, purchase money that I was charged with. For several years I got but poor returns for my labor, not having the means or energy to improve till 1837. In that year I concluded to run my face, and make an effort towards improvement with lime; and up to 1839, I had put on about 12,000 bushels, at a cost at the kills of 20 to 22 cents per bushel. By 1840, I had seen and felt the good effects of the lime, and determined to complete the first dressing of all my arable laids, las well as my Note Brilliant Arm (better known as Sum Rush) of 380 acres, which I had also purchased at a credit for less than        $8 per acre, and was situated near by, as Heat land, may homestead. In that year (1840 purchased 10,000 bushels of lime, at a cost of 17 cents per bushel delivered at the landing of the canal, distant about four miles from the farms. Were I again had to run my face; but this time Went to the limeburnerson Schuylkill, where I would advise all honest Delawarians, that have not limed, to go at once, for to this day honest Delaware faces are in good repute there. They are no repudiators. And while on the subject of lime, I will state that one lime burned, William To gee, has sold in Newcastle county, within the last six months, 145,000 bushels of lime, of which 90 000 bushels have been delivered. Previous to 1840 I had sown c lover and other grass <a name="seeds139"><mark>seeds</mark></a> pretty freely-one year as much as 45 bushels ; and the same year I purchased 20 tons of plaster. At first I got but poor return even for my lime suppose for want of vegetable matter; but when my c lover had grown so as to make a swash or lay for turning under, my crops began to increase even beyond my expectations. The crops for the year 1844, which closed with my late wheat crop, were all got out and sold by the 25th of July, 1845, producing the following results at crop light not many sown crop sold for                               $209-rental share                                                                      $104.50Corn tillage large 97 acres, including an orchard of 4 acres, not well tilled, produced 3,000 bushels rental share, 1,500bushels, at 40 cents -600 00 The wheat crop amounted to 2,820 bushels, exclusive of block or takings the rental share one half, or say 1,410 bushels, at 90 cents -1 269 001,973 50 his was grown on two fields, one of which, of 97 acres, ac lover let, well turned under, produced 1,872 bushels, exclusive of b rock, which would have made this field amount to over 20 bushels to the acre. Add 64 bushels of b rock, at 90 cents per bushel -57 60                         $2,031.10The other field of wheat contained about 60 acres. The product of this held was 94 8 bushels, exclusive of ra kings; or, had they been included, the yield would have exceeded sixteen bushels to the acre. This field had been hard cropped, for the wheat followed corn, which corn had followed wheat stubble of the year previous, without manure or c lover. I need, this field had produced nine crops in twelve years, with but littlei08S 
nmnuvre at any time, it being furthest from the farm yard; and may plan isn6vdt to haul manure to the, far side of the farm, whilst I l have poorlaindnear by. The principal help this field has had was 40 bushels of lime to the acre, put on in 1838, and two crops of c lover turned under; and on apart of the field a crop of oats was turned under that had been injured by the hail storm of 1840. The rental value of these three crops of oats, corn, and wheat, may then the set down at                          $2,031.10, the usage of this part of the country being one half of the grain for rent. In the upper Hundreds, near the manufactoridwg an additional amount in money would be obtained for the privileges of dairy, poultry, eggs, &c, The rental value, as above set forth, you will perceive at a glance, now pays an interest of six per cent. on a capital of                 $33,850. The riginacost of the farm, or investment, was, as you will also perceive,            $4,100, and that a credit. I will leave you, gentlemen, to calculate the yearly dividend son the investment. John Jones. From the Farmers' Monthly Visitor, Septeiiber 30, 1845,FRENCH Agri Culture. The Dress e published some extracts from a work presented to the agricultural congress, now sitting at the palace of the Luxembourgh, by the author, M. Latin eau Laroqhe, and entitled France and England compared with respect to agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial industry, and the consequences to be deduced from this comparison. It appears from this work that England, in comparison with the extent of its surface, possesses four times more cattle than France. And as it is not possible to pursue a judicious system of agriculture without manure, and as the feeding of cattle is the most productive of supplying manure, it follows that before France can compete with England in agricultural wealth, she must increase her stock of cattle; but in order to do so, she must increase her pasture lands or meadows. "france" says M. Earache, ' possesses but 4, 2000,00 hectares of natural meadows, or only one-sixteenth of her cultivated soil. From this calculation, it may be easily comprehended how insufficient is her supply of green food, and that it becomes absolutely necessary that she should substitute another to the triennial system at present in use." M. Earache concludes by stating that, " if the alternate system of cultivation pursued in England was introduced into France, the produce of corn would be doubled within twenty years. Fifty-five years since, the produce of Great Britain was estimated by Arthur Young at three millards.

Of Frofessor Justus Of   Ebi G, My attention has often been directed to the question whether, according to our experience and the present state of science, a manure might not be composed which could replaced the genuine gun no in its effects, and whether    could not, by a series of experiments, point out a way of preparing one equal to it in all its chemical and physical properties. You are well aware, sir, that we know with certainty all the elements of the gun no, as well 'of the urine and solid faces of men and animals. In like manner, it seecid127iato have verified the opinion which I have laid down in my work on agriculture, that the salts manufactured in the laboratory have the same effect on the growth of the plants, if they are embodied to the fields in the same forms in which the animals furnish them in their excrements. This must be evident to every one who knows that to produce these compounds in the laboratory, the same agencies and means are made use of which are employed by nature. The fabrication of a manure, equal in its composition and effects to the solid and fluid excrements of animals and men, seems to me one of the most essential demands of our time. *a* *a* *the following may be regarded as the essential constituents of a powerful manure, applicable to all sorts of soil swarthy phosphates The most important of these is phosphates of lime, which occurs in nature as a mineral called a petite. It is the principal element in the bones, which, it may be observed, have been found most efficacious, if calcined; consequently deprived of their animal matter. The rapidity of the effects of phosphates of lime on the growth of plants depends upon its greater or lesser sol ability. I to amount of blue (gelatin e diminishes this sol ability, if the soil is rich in vegetable matters, which furnish carbonic acid by their decomposition, and which acid is required for rendering the phosphates of lime so ruble in water, and introducing it intothe organism of the plants. In the calcined state, the bones are sufficiently quick; but in those soils in which this cause of sol ability is wanting, their action is slower. In my work I have recommended the addition of a certain quantity of sulphuric acid, both in order to render the bones moresoluble and to change the neutral phosphates of the bones into gypsy m, and into a phosphates which contains more super phosphates of lime. I have been informed that this advice has been most extensively adopted; that thesuperphosphate of lime has been found to be a most efficacious manure, and that it forms already a most important article of commerce. A second earthy phosphates, not less important, is the phosphates of magnetic, which, it is well known, enters, in a still larger proportion than the phosphates of lime, into the composition of the grain. The alkaline phosphates, although not originally found in nature, are important elements of the <a name="seeds140"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of grain, of peas, beans, &c. A rational farmer must: provide them in sufficient quantities to those plants which require them for their development, from knowing human excrements in 10 40 crease the produce in grain in a far greater proportion, because they contain alkaline phosphates, than the animal excrements, in which they do not exist. The alkalies (potash and soda) must be constituents of every rationally composed manure, because by them the original fertile condition of the fields is preserved. The soil which contains the alkalies in too small a quantity is, perhaps, fertile for grain ; but it is not necessarily so for turnipsor <a name="potatoes1474"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, which require a great quantity of all ali. By supplying an alkaline manure, fallows for the cultivation of those plants which are grown during the time of following become less necessary. Sulphate of potash is a constituent of all plants, although in small quantity, as well as common salt and chloride of potassium, which are found in milk in rather a large proportion. The salts of lime, especially gypsy m, is an important nourishment for the leg luminous plants. Salt is never wanting in all sorts of soils; it is a constituent of all rocks, by the decomposition of which all productive soils are formed, and the cereal in find it everywhere in sufficient quantity, and in a form capable of being taken up by the plants, if the alkalies are provided wherever they are present in too small quantity. Salts of ammonia t can be regarded as certain that the a note of the plants is derived either from the ammonia of the atmosphere, or from the manure which is provided in the shape of animal fluid and solid excrement, and that ago tic compounds exercise an effect on the growth of plants only in so far as they give up the a note, in the form of ammonia, during their decomposition and decay. We may, therefore, profit ably replace all theazotic substances with compounds of ammonia. Decaying vegetable matters, which contain carbon, are useful to the fields in so far as they provide a source of carbonic acid; but they are not quite indispensable in manure, if the latter be rationally combined, as the atmospheric air is an- inexhaustible source of carbonic acid, from which the plants draw their carbon, if in the manure the mineral substances are provided which are necessary for the assimilation of the carbonic acid. These are the substances which together give fertility to the soil; but although each of them may, under certain circumstances, (viz: where the soil is defective in it, or where it is not indifferent to the plant to take up one instead of the other, as, for instance, may be the case with soda instead of potash) increase the fertility, no one of them can be regarded as a manure, according to the common meaning of the word, for the simple reason that only all of them in certain proportions will fulfil the purpose for which the common manure is applied. This purpose is the restoration, or an increase of the original fertility, and by manure we must replace all the elements of the plants which have been taken away in harvest, or which are contained in the plants which we are desirous to cultivate. That, then, are the constituent elements of the soil which we remove by the straw, <a name="seeds141"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, tuberculous roots, s talks, &c, of our plants of culture ?I t is obvious that we must know these first, in order to restore them in sufficient quantities. To this we answer by giving the analysis of the ashes of plants and their <a name="seeds142"><mark>seeds</mark></a>.

From these researches, it appears that for s talks and leaves we require other elements than for <a name="seeds144"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. The former contain no alkaline phosphates, but they require for their development and growth a rich supply of alkaline carbonates and sulphates. In the other hand, the carbonates are entirely wanting in the <a name="seeds145"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, but the latter are very rich in phosphates. I tis sufficiently obvious that a rational farmer must supply both, as well as all the others. If he supplies only phosphates, and does not restore the alkaline carbonates, his soil will become gradually barren; it will be exhausted in those necessary elements for the development of s talks and <a name="seeds146"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, without which no formation of seed can be expected. If he supplies the alkalies, lime, and sulphates alone, in a given time he will get no more grain. All constituent elements of the manure, if they are supplied alone, have that great defect that by them the soil is impoverished in other equally important elements. To one of itself can maintain the fertility Keeping this in view, we may easily judge of the comparative value of artificial and natural manures, and all the various arc ana which have been praised as palace as for exhausted soils. It is not less easy to understand why the farmers have such different opinions on the relative value of the constituents of manures; why one whose farm is rich in phosphates produces an uncommon fertility by the application of nitrate of soda, or the supply of alkalies, while another does not see any favorable effect at all why bones (phosphates of lime) produce in many fields wonders, and are not of the slightest benefit to others, which are deficient in alkalies or alkaline salts. From the composition of animal manures it results, with certainty, that, by applying the latter, (solid and fluid excrements of men and animals) we supply to the soil, not one, but all the elements which have been taken away in the harvest. Fertility is restored to the field by a corresponding supply of this manure, and it may be increased by it to a certain limit. This will be the more intelligible if we, compare the mineral elements of the urine of horses and cattle with the mineral elements of herbs, straw, roots, &c, of our cultivated plants. It will be found that in their quality they are perfectly identical661042Carbonate of lime Carbonate of magnesiaCarbonate of potash Carbonate of soda Sulphate of potash Chloride of sodium. Urine of a horse1250946460910331304055Of another31001307Of oxen107693These salts in the urine of horses amount to nearly 4 per cent, in that of oxen to 2- per cent, of their weights. If we compare the composition of these different sorts of urine with the composition of the straw of peas, beans, and <a name="potatoes1479"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, of c lover and hay, it will at once be obvious that in stable dung we replace by the urine the alkaline carbonates which we have removed in harvest. That, in this urine, is wanting in phosphates, and carbonate of lime and phosphates of magnetic, forms the principal constituent elements of the solid excrements of animals : both together (solid excrements and urine) restore the field to its original composition, and thus anew generation of cultivated plants meet with the mineral ingredient s necessary for their development. If we further compare the gun no and the faces of men with the composition of the animal urine, the analysis shows reference, my book on agriculture) that both are entirely defective in alkaline carbonates. They contain phosphates and sulphates, as well as chloride of sodium, but no free all ali. They contain phosphates of lime and phosphates of magnetic. In short, their elements are in quality identical with the important mineral elements of the <a name="seeds147"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of wheat, peas, beans reference, the analysis) The urine of swine is in its composition intermediate between the urine of man and horses. Analysis of the urine of swine. Carbonate of potashPhosphate of soda Sulphate of sodaChlorideof sodium, Chloride of potassium, Phosphates of lime, Phosphates of magnetic, Traces of iron121119070531 The solidcontainS8 of lime excrements of swine principally phosphates hat the practical results of a &now ledge of the composition of these manures are, is clear. If it were possible to provide our fields with the dung of swine in sufficient quantity, we would replace by it, in a soil which contains s alicia and lime, all the remaining elements of the plants. The field might be made fertile for all kinds of plants. We have in it not only alkaline phosphates, the principal elements of the <a name="seeds148"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, but also alkaline carbonate, which are required by the leaves, s talks, and' roots. His purpose cannot be attained, however, by maturing with gun no or human excrements alone, but perfectly so by stable manure, from its containing alkaline carbonates. If I have said that stable manure contains the mineral elements of the nurtured of the plants, exactly in a state and condition in which they are furnished by nature that a field manured by it resembles the primitive state of America and Hungary this assertion will not be 40 33 77.289.02 13.300.30
. 103 found exaggerated. It is certain that stable dung contains no alkaline phosphates ; but nature does not furnish to the plants these elements even in the most fertile soil, although we find them in large quantity in all the <a name="seeds149"><mark>seeds</mark></a> of wild plants. It is obvious, notwithstanding their absence from the soil, that the phosphates are formed in the organism of the plants, and, that they originate from the phosphates of lime and magnetic and the supplied alkalies, by an exchange of the elements of both. The alkalies are necessary for forming alkaline phosphates, which cannot originate in the phosphates of lime alone. Both together are present in stable dung. In human excrements, and in gun no, the alkaline carbonates are entirely wanting. The practice of the farmer, in some places, of supplying to the field not pureguano, but a mixture of it with gypsy m, shows clearly that the phosphates of alkaline bases are really formed in the organism of the plants from the phosphates of lime and magnetic, because this mixture (gun no and gypsumcontains less phosphates of potash or soda than the gun no itself; or, in certain proportions of gypsy m, no alkaline phosphates at all, the so ruble phosphates in the gun no decomposing the gypsy m into phosphates of lime andmagnesia, and into sulphate of potash. I am far from asserting that we should not provide the fields with alkaline phosphates. The excellent effect of the gun no, and of the human excrements, is too well known to question it, and we perceive, from this fact, that plants are in this respect like domestic animals, which, with a normal food, are healthy and strong, but do not fatten. In the contrary, we know that if we prepare the food of these animals artificially, so as to render it more easily digested and assimilated, they are enabled to consume, in a given time, a greater quantity of it, by which all their parts increase in weight. The same happens with plants, if we give them their nourishment in a state most appropriated for assimilation ; their capability to attract the other elements from the atmosphere increases, and their development is accelerated. If we recollect that the favorable effect of gun no upon our fields depends on its amount of ammonia cal salts, of alkaline phosphates, and the other mineral constituents of the <a name="seeds150"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, but that it is defective in alkalies, the principal elements of the hers, straw, and roots, it is easily understood why the opinions of farmers on the value of gun no as a manure are so very different. In a soil which is defective in alkalies its effect is small; on a soil rich in them it increases the produce in a remarkable degree; but, as I have already observed, the continued application of gun no must gradually diminish the fertility of our fields for a number of plants, because the elements of those organs, of the leaves, s talks, roots, &c, without which the plants cannot be developed and cannot produce <a name="seeds151"><mark>seeds</mark></a>, are taken off in the harvest without any restoration of them. I think it, therefore, certain that the stable dung can replace to a certain degree, but not vice versa. A rational agriculturists, in usingguano, cannot dispense with stable dung. In the manufacture of an artificial manure, it must be kept in view that application of stable dung, of human excrements, and of gun no, is attended with a great loss, in consequence of the too great sol ability of their most efficacious elements; and this must be prevented by artificial means. His is evident, if we remember those countries from which gun no is derived. It is known that the collection and preservation of the excrements on the African islands, and the coasts of Peru and Phil i, depend upon the scarcity of rain in those countries. The best sorts of gun no contain, in fact, more than one half of their weight of so ruble salts, which, if exposed to the rain, 1 044 Doc. To. 140.are in exactly the same condition as, under similar conditions, a heap of salt, They dissolve in water, and are removed. Some months of rain would deprive those countries of all their riches. The remainder would have lost the greater part of its fe utilizing power. Such effects, however take place upon the gun no with which our fields are manured, Only a small portion of its efficacious elements produce the beneficial effect they are capable of doing, the greater part being carried off by the rain. The stable dung is, in this respect, in the same condition as gun no. I need, its principal elements are already in a dissolved state, and therefore are carried off more easily than those of gun no. A covering for those places in, which stable dung is preserved, in order to shelter it from the effects of the rain, has been regarded in Germany as essential for preserving its maturing power. In consequence of the experience that the so ruble elements of stable dung are the most efficacious, it has, in some cases, been drawn out with water, and it has been found advantageous to carry only this fluid to the fields. I need only refer to the foregoing analysis of the urine of animals in order to see upon which elements of it this effect depends The reason, why, in certain years, the influence of the best and most plentiful maturing is scarcely perceptible, is, that during the moist and rainy springs and summers the phosphates and other salts with alkaline bases, as also the so ruble ammonia cal salts, are entirely or partly removed. Art must find out the means of reducing the sol ability of the maturing substances to a certain limit; in a word, of bringing them into the same state in which they exist in a most fertile, virgin soil, and in which they can be best assimilated by the plants. I am occupied with a series of experiments, which lead me to hope that this problem can and will be solved. If it succeed, as I have no doubt it will, in combining the efficacious elements of manure in such a way as that they will not be washed away, their efficacy will be doubled. If in this manner the injurious consequences of the present system of draining be removed, agriculture will be based upon as certain principles as well arrangedmanufactories. Manufactories of manure will be established, in which the farmer can obtain the most efficacious manure for all varieties of soils and plants. When, no artificial manure will be sold whose exact amount of efficacious elements is not known; and this amount will be the scale for determining its value. I instead of the uncertainty of mere empiricism, all the operations of agriculture will be carried on with certainty; and instead of waiting the results of our labors with anxiety and doubt, our minds will be filled with patience and confidence. I am, sir, your obedient servant, Of. Justus Of   Ebi G. Of Essen, 1845. In Muspratts English Patent for I improvements in the Manufacture of Manure, communicated by Dr. Lie big, of I essen, Germany, th~nlethodproposed is thus described t" In making "manure according to the invention, I cause carbonate of soda or of potash, or both, to be fused in a reverberatory furnace, such as is used in the manufacture of soda ash, with carbonate or phosphates of lime, Doc. No. 140. 104 and with such fused compounds I mix other ingredients, as hereafter mentioned) so as to produce manures; and such composition, when cold, being ground into powder by edge stones or other convenient machinery, the same is to be applied to land as manure. And in order to apply such manure with precision, the analysis and weight of the previous crop ought to be known with exactness, so as to return the land the mineral elements in the weight and proportion in which they have been removed by the crops Two compounds are first prepared, one or other of which is the basis of all manures, which I shall describe as the first and second preparations." The first preparation is formed by fusing together two or two and a half parts of carbonate of lime with one part of potash of commerce, (containing, on an average, sixty carbonate of potash, ten sulphate of potash, and ten chloride of potassium or common salt, in the hundred parts) or with one part of carbonate of soda and potash, mixed in equal parts The second preparation is formed by fusing together one part of phosphates of lime, one part potash of commerce, and one part of soda ash." Both preparations are ground to powder; other salts or ingredients, in the state of powder, are added to these preparations and mixed together, or those not of a volatile consistency may be added when the preparations are in a state of fusion, so that the manure may represent, as near as possible, the composition of the ashes of the preceding crop. This is assuming that the land is in a high state of cultivation ; but if it be desired to grow a particular crop on land not in a high state of cultivation, then the manure would be applied in the first instance suitable for the coming crop, and then, in subsequent cases, the manure prepared according to the invention would, as herein described, be applied to restore to the land what has been taken therefrom by the preceding crop." Preparation of manure for land which has had a wheat crop grown on and removed therefrom Take of the first preparation six parts by weight, and of the second preparation one part, and mix with them two parts ofgypsum, one part of calcined bones, delicate of potash, (containing six parts of s iliac) and one part of phosphates of magnetic and ammonia And such manure is also applicable to be used after growing barley, oats, and plants of a similar character." Preparation of manure for land which has had a crop of beans grown thereon and removed therefrom Take fourteen parts, by weight, of the first preparation, two parts of the second preparation, and mix them with one part of common salt, (chloride of sodium) a quantity of delicate of potash, (containing two parts of s iliac) two parts of gypsy m, and one part of phosphates of magnetic and ammonia. And such manure is also applicable for land on which peas or other plants of a similar character have been grown and removed." Preparation of manure for land on which turn is have been grown and removed therefrom Take twelve parts, by weight, of the first preparation, one part of the second preparation, one part of gypsy m, and one part of phosphates of magnetic and ammonia And such manure is also applicable for land where <a name="potatoes1480"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> or similar plants have been grown and removed He remarks that other manures may be prepared for plants, " if the matters of which the plants are composed, and the quantities, are first ascertained, by burning the plants and analyzing the ashes, and then combining 10 46 the manure according to the analysis. The manure so made is to be applied to the land in quantities as great or greater than the quantities of the elements which have been removed by the previous crop. It should be stated that where the straw of wheat and other similar plants which require much delicate of potash is returned to the land as manure, that is considered to be the best means of restoring the requisite delicate of potash to the land; in which case the delicate of potash would be omitted Communicated for the New York Farmer and Mechanics, for publication. Ameri Can I Nsti   Tutefarmers' Club. Source of carbon and nitrogen in plants, as derived from the soil: by Fromborg, of the Agricultural Chemistry Association of Scotland. The opinions of under, of Utrecht, founded on great chemical investigation, are, that the organic constituents of soil namely, the humid, ulm in, get c, c relic, and apocrenic acids after being combined with ammonia, a retaken up and assimilated by plants, being all of them very so ruble in water, and possessing poly basic properties, by which they are enabled to form combinations with potash or soda, ammonia, lime, magnetic, and oxide of iron, in which several of those bases are present at the same time That ammonia is formed in the soil by the combination of the nitrogen of the air with hydrogen in its nascent state, as liberated during the decay of vegetable and animal substances in the soil. From careful experiments, Under establishes the following facts 1. Pain water and air are insufficient to support the life of plants 2. Pain water, wood ashes, and air, are equally so 3. That the aqueous extract of hum us contains too small a portion of matter to afford plants all they require 4. That ulm in acid from sugar is advantageous to their growth 5. That humid acid from garden mould is very useful in vegetation 6. That hum ate of ammonia from pe at is advantageous to the growth of plants. That charcoal and ashes are inferior to arable soil, or to the substances mentioned in Los. 5 and 6. Fromborg says the well known fe utilizing action of charcoal requires, indeed, no other explanation than its characteristic property of condensing gases. Under observes that a number of little plants were produced in solutions of <a name="potato1046"><mark>potato</mark></a> starch, ace tate of potash, nitrate of it to, binoxojate of it to, and even in chloride of calcium, sulphate of soda, and common alum. I have seen them in solutions of neutral t art rate of potash and of sulphate ofalumina. Nigel, of Rotterdam, the skilful botanist, examined these plants, and recognised them as being of the genus cryptococeous, u dvina, hydrococis, sirocrocis, and Septomitus. Professor Lie big says that traces of ammonia can hardly be detected in large quantities of rain water; and although he assumes that a pound of rain water contains one-fourth of a grain of ammonia, yet it is obvious that, in a continuous rain, only that part which falls first contains that. 10 47 quantity! What falls subsequently would soon be without ammonia at all. The minute quantity contained in the air, above a field, is far from being a sufficient source for all the nitrogen contained in the plants growing upon it. Professor Johnston says: The ammonia produced in the air from de composed vegetables and animals can but imperfectly be restored to the soil. The greater, part is washed down by rains into the sea, and is lost to the soil. What remains in the air will undergo a continual decomposition by electricity and by thunder stormsMulders theory is, that the ammonia in the soil serves as a medium to transfer the oxygen of the air to putrefying substances. Any think that the doctrine of aerial nutrition of plants is right, because it exhibits a degree of simplicity and beauty consonant with the other works. [head by H. Meigsthe result of a trial of various manures, reported in the Royal Agricultural Society S Journal, led to the following conclusions 1. Nitrate of soda, nitrate of potash and soot, have a tendency to increase the produce of wheat, both straw and grain 2. That common salt has a slight tendency to increase the produce of grain, and to decrease the weight of straw mark the weight of saw that it does not diminish the bulk) and that common salt increases the weight per bushel of the grain. Hence it may, from these properties, be advantageously used as an axillary to the other manures 3. That sulphate of soda has no visible effects upon the wheat crop. The slight variation in yield of straw may be fairly attributed to accidental circumstances, such as variation of soil, &c, as no two patches can be perfectly equal in every respect it a meeting of the American Agricultural Associationprepared Manures, And Thei R Effect Upon Crops.

What is long or partly un rotted I apply to hold crops; what is fine     mix with the eleven requisites, and apply as a top dressing. It may be advisable to apply the straw to the ground, and plough it when un rotted. To grow grains, give the soil straw of its kind; for <a name="potatoes1481"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, their vines grapes, their vines; to apples, their branches; and so of all. The droppings of cattle are the best material to grow grasses, as they feed on grass those of horses fed on grain, for the growth of cereals. Unions are grown year after year by only returning the tops to the ground. In Virginia, had the refuse of the tobacco plant been returned to the soil, she would not now be barren. The bad farmer is injured by the vicinity of well manured land, as manure has an affinity for oxygen, hydrogen, ammonia c, floating in the air, and attracts them to the provide it farmers land. Formerly, I applied com posts of various things, and had wonderful results; I dared not omit any one, as I knew not which had produced the 1 048 result. Now, science, by analysis, shows what is necessary. By' these com posts, I grew a s qu ash to weigh 201 pounds, the heaviest on record and a cabbage to weigh 44 pounds. By it I grew wheat to weigh 64 pounds, rye 60 pounds, oats 444 pounds. When Pringle made known his analysis, showing that eleven substances are necessary to all good soils, I found that my com post, by chance, had them all, and twenty other enriching ingredients. Previous to 1840, my orchard bore only every other year. Since then, I make them bear every year; and this year, a bad one for fruit, found my manured trees full, and those not manured barren. The drought of this year was fatal to fruit; yet my manured trees had abundant moisture, and were fruitful. I prefer the manure of delayed vegetable matter to the excrement of cattle, as the material that makes and supports the animal has been extracted, and the excrement is not so rich on that account. If the vegetable matter be rotted and its ammonia fixed by charcoal dust, all the chemical substances are present. Thus, rotted vegetable matter is more, beneficial than the dung of cattle, quantity and quantity alike. A most valuable manure is the liquid remaining after the boiling of bones. It is very offensive unless disinfected. When hot it is not offensive, but becomes so when cold. It is a jelly when cold. By the application of charcoal dust to the hot liquid, the jelly, when cold, is not offensive. In this state it may be made into com post with other substances. In that condition it is a most valuable manure. At present large amounts of the liquid are thrown into the rivers. I prevailed upon a grinder of bones to save his liquid by charcoal, and he now sells what formerly he hired carried away. I have used it with great advantage, both on arable and meadow land. Charcoal is one of the most valuable manures. It is the most powerful absorbent known. It takes from the atmosphere oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, ammonia, &c, and holds them while the weather is dry. During rain it absorbs eighty per cent. of water, and releases the gases to descend to the earth to fertilizes it. When the weather becomes dry it parts with the water, and absorbs from the air the gases again. This it continues almost perpetually, as it is nearly indestructible. When applied to the earth, the trees, plants, and grasses are found to have it adhering to their roots, ready to impart gases and moisture as wanted. Trees packed in it have remained green for eighty days, while others, without it, have died in like circumstances. Dams and salt meats are preserved perfectly when packed in it. I preserved apples in perfect condition for one year in it. If spread over com post heaps, barn yards, stable floors, in p rives, it absorbs the ammonia, prevents offensive smells, fixes the volatile gases, and thus makes a valuable come post. Ashes applied to sandy soils are valuable; and, on some soils reached are as good as unleashed. I have known land, too poor to grow eight bushel. of corn, made to produce forty-five bushels by ashes alone; and they are more valuable on a sandy soil than any other, except mary clay. They enable the sandy soil to retain its moisture a great point. They are Used to great advantage on Long I s land and in New Jersey. They stimulate growth, as does plaster. Down broadcast on grass, the effect is perceptible at a great distance. The yield the first year on sandy soils in grass, will pay the expense of applying forty bushels to the acre. They give to the soil delicate of potash, which is needed to form stems. 
04Ashes have two actions on soils, viz: Chemically, by all ali they neutralise acids; and mechanically, by rendering sandy soils more tenacious. Luck is made valuable by them, when mixed in com post; the acid of the much is destroyed by the all ali, and ferment at ion follows. Time has been used by me to great advantage. I prefer oystershelllime, as it contains no magnetic, which most stone lime does. I thinkoystershell lime has a tendency to lessen in growth the stem and leaves, and increase the fruit and <a name="seeds152"><mark>seeds</mark></a>. I put on barren or worn out land 300 bushels of oystefshell lime, and it grew wheat to a weight of 64 pounds per bushel: with the wheat I sowed one bushel of c lover seed and half a bushel of timothy seed per acre, and the next year cut 2 tons, and the second year 3 tons of hay per acre. I have found it of great advantage in <a name="potato1047"><mark>potato</mark></a> culture; the <a name="potatoes1482"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> do not rot in the ground, while neighboringunlimed ones all do. They are meal y and fine, and do not rot after gathering, and have been free of rot in dry, wet, and average seasons. I think it destroys the fungus or insect, if either be the cause of rot. One dust I have used, and find it most valuable, and advise its use, especially on soils long cultivated, destitute of phosphates of lime. It is the most efficacious manure that can be used on an exhausted soil, but will do better on dry calcareous soil than on such as contain alum in a. It should be mixed with earth to ferment before spreading. There should be used from twelve to twenty bushels to the acre. It seems best on turn is. I com post it is valuable, as it yields phosphates largely. It is said that in England, where, on lands, it had been applied twenty years before, its effect could be seen to a yard. I trust the exportation of bones from our country will soon cease. I have used gun no successfully and un successfully. Fixed with earth, and applied to plants in close contact, it was injurious; applied in weak solution to grass land and greenhouse plants, its effect was wonderful. By experience shows that its method of use will determine its value. In com posts 1 have found it very effective. Right soil is one of the most valuable manures. In this country, as well as in England, great prejudice prevails against its use in agriculture or gardening. For ages it has been used in Asia, and particularly in China. In France, in Belgium, Bohemia, Saxony, all the German confederacy, and Sweden, its destruction or waste is prohibited by law. In England and America it is thrown into the rivers, to be foul them, and the fish which devour it are eaten instead of vegetables grown by it. As manure, six loads of it have been found to produce 650 bushels per acre of <a name="potatoes1483"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, while, on the same ground, one hundred and twenty loads of horse manure yielded only 480 bushels n conclusion; I have to remark that the main stay of the farmer is his barn yard manure.

In the review of a work of Mr. Her nays, chemist, on the subject of manures, &c, the Dark Lane Express quotes the following method of preparing the farm yard heap: "' The importance and advantages of the arrangement and compilation of the manure heap are too well known to require any observation from us but we cannot lay by this practical work without giving the authors directions for preparing the farm yard heap." 'I t should be a rule to heap it on as small a space and as compact as possible. The ground on which it is placed should consist of a stiff clay, or be bricked over. It should commence about half a foot below the surrounding ground, and be situated so as to cause all the water from the manure to run into the tank. The conduct leading to the latter should be well covered in, so as not to allow spring water or rain water to collect in it. A layer of gypsy m is now to be spread on the flooring, and the heap is to be commenced by covering the whole bottom, with the exception of about half a foot on each side. In every foot height of manure a layer of gypsy m is to be spread, sufficiently thick to appear white. When the heap is completed, or before, the contents of the tanks are to be poured on by degrees, in quantity sufficient to moist en the head well, but so that little will run back into the tanks. By these means the following advantages will be obtained: Firstly, the cart age of the urine will be rendered unnecessary, and some labor and expense saved; secondly, the gypsy m of the farm yard heap will be dissolved; and, thirdly, by the addition and evaporation of the water of the urine, the decay of the manure will be hastened. If the method recommended of screwing the stable floorings with gypsy m be followed out, of course but a small quantity of it will be necessary. A thin layer may then be strewn on every two feet high of the heap; and when completed, the top and sides should be sprinkled with it. The heap itself should not be higher than six feet, for many reasons' "from the New England Farmer. Of Ssolvi Of Bones In Sulphuri C Aci    D. At a special meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, Mr. Use y, having averted to the great discovery of the economical and efficient employment of bones as manure, when dissolved by maceration in sulphuric acid, proceeded to read extracts from Mr. Anna ms prize essay on the subject, of which the following is a condensed statement n an experiment o ii turn is, the crop from dissolved bones was not only more abundant, but less attacked by insects than that dressed with un dissolved bones, and the plants far more rapid in their growth the first month, and a gain of a month in the end. The results of several experiments by or. Kann am were then stated, from which it appeared that 2 bushels of dissolved bones produced as good results as 16 bushels of un dissolved; that 8 bushels dissolved would greatly sur pass 16 bushels not dissolved; and that 4 bushels in a state of solution would be a proper quantity per acre, producing crops greatly superior to 16 bushels of un dissolved crushed bones, and the cost less in proportion to the effect produced. [he suspect the effect on the first crop only is here referred to. 1051The proportions used had generally been, of acid one half the weight of the bones, but one third or even one-fourth of the bones might be employed: the proportion of water had generally been 100 times the weight of the acid, but 50 or 25 times would serve the purpose efficiently. It must be understood that the more finely pulverized the bones are before mixing, the better. Mr. Thompson stated that he had last year found 4 bushels of dissolved bones, applied in the form of com post, fully equal to 20 loads of farm yard manure, there being no perceptible difference in the crop throughout the field. Mr. T. suggested, that as it was often difficult for a small farmer to find a vessel of sufficient capacity to contain the mixture, it might be found a simple substitute to form a sort of pond, huddled with clay, in which the mixture could be made. When the solution was complete, the clay might be mixed with the com post. A letter from Mr. Spooner, of Southampton, was read, in which he stated that he had last year used bones and sulphuric acid in com post, for turn is. He had prepared it by placing 13 bushel of finely ground bones in a tub, with half their weight of acid, diluted with four times the quantity of cold water. After some hours, a few bushels of fine mould and some coal ashes were added, so as to make the whole amount to 15 bushels of com post. The mixture was applied in the drills at the rate of little more than 2 bushels per acre, and, as Mr. Spooner states, successfully rival led 16 bushels of bones applied to an acre of superior quality. There seems to be some difference of opinion as to what constitutes thefertilizing principle of bones. Professor Lie big, in the third edition of his Agricultural Chemistry, says: " The efficiency of bones as a manure does not depend upon the nitrogen sized (organic) matter, as has been generally but erroneously supposed, but upon their phosphates of lime." Professorjohnston, and many ethers, attach much to the gelatin e, which slowly decomposes and affords to plants nitrogen. The gelatin e or organic part of bones is, chemically, like horn, hair, wool, and skin; and, as these substances are all known to be good manures, the gelatin e of bones must operate in the same way. The oil or fat in fresh bones, if applied to the soil without any preparation, I think cannot be of much use, as it consists entirely of carbon, and the elements of water oxygen and hydrogen. When buried in the soil, it is almost as indestructible as charcoal. If muscle, lean meat, and animal fat, are mixed in a heap, and exposed to the action of the weather, even in the hottest part of summer, the muscle (lean meat) is soon de composed, but the fat will run together and be converted into a substance resembling old cheese or spermaceti; the fat in bones will probably do the same. There are several ways in which a farmer may rake use of bones for manure, in the country, where there are no mills to grind the ri. He can break them up, and apply them to the soil in the broken state; they will in that way gradually give out nitrogen and phosphates of lime for at least" three lives They can be burnt, and then they are easily broken up, and can be dissolved in sulphuric acid ; the fire, however, drives off all the animal matter. Or they can be boiled in strong lye, and in a few hours they become disintegrated, and as fine as meal, By this process the nitrogen sized part, the gelatin e, is mostly driven off, and the air of a room in which they are boiling smells as strong of ammonia as the hold of a gun no ship; but the 10 52 soil and fat are converted into a kind of soap. The whole can be mixed with much or soil, and will make a first rate manure for the turn in crop. I have boiled some bushels of horn paths into a pulp, in three hours the harder bones require some longer time. Without doubt, if there was a portion of sulphuric acid mixed with the lye, the bones would come to pieces much sooner, and the ammonia would probably be fixed by the acid, and formed into sulphate of ammonia; unless it should combine with the potash of the lye, or the lime of the bone, as it has a stronger affinity for these. As stated near the commencement of this, rather more than one half of dry bone is phosphates of lime in the proportion of 51' per cent. of lime, and 48 of phosphorus acid. By mixing about one half the weight of sulphuric acid diluted with water, double decomposition ensues-one half the lime of the bone combines with the sulphuric acid, and forms gypsy m. The other part of the lime combines with a double equivalent of phosphoricacid, and super or biphosphate of lime is the result. Phosphates of lime is very insoluble; biphosphate is much more so ruble, and is readily taken up by the root lets of plants, especially by the wheat crop. About one half the ashes of the grain of wheat is phosphates of lime. Phosphates of lime and potash are found in the ashes of all our forest trees, but it is so very insoluble that it is not extracted in the process of le aching for soap making and, unquestionably, much of the value of spent ashes depends upon the phosphates they contain.

The Corn Crops Of Europe. We extract from the Gazette dAugsburg the following article on the crops of 1845 in Europe: " According to the custom we have adopted, we shall divide our account of the results of the last crop into two parts-one referring to the east, and the other to the west of Europe. For several years past the east threatened us with sterile ty. It first of all began in Russia, spread over Poland and Russia, and appeared even this year likely to diffuse itself in the east of Germany. Experience has generally proved that in the bore al latitude the rainy years are more sterile than the dry ones. This fact has again been confirmed during the last years. It was humidity that diminished the crops a few years ago in Russia, and which produced the like effect in Poland, Alicia, and Upper Silesian, in the course of last year. In Germany the humidity has not produced any unfavorable consequences, but in certain countries. There are others, on the contrary, which have suffered from want of rain. The results of the crops are, in the mean time, far from being satisfactory, and, from the calculations which have been made, will not suffice the public consumption." It is far from our intention to represent the situation of things in more dreary colors than belong to it; but we do not wish, and we ought not, to exaggerate the advantages of it, desirous as we are of attaining our present object, which is to furnish an exact appreciation of actual circumstances. We shall separately name the different countries, and indicate the supplies they stand in need or can dispose of Russia will have sufficient corn for the whole empire, without purchasing any foreign corn. I to governments are in a position to assist mutually each other, but it is very doubtful whether they can send much corn abroad The crops of Poland are not sufficient for its general consumption; and, unless it has been previously supplied, will suffer from a scarcity, or be obliged to receive corn from abroad. But whom can one have recourse to when ones neighbors have only had themselves but middling crops, and have not where with to supply the deficiency? Money also is scarce in Poland, and important sums cannot be sent abroad to purchase corn." The kingdom of Russia has greatly suffered last year and this from foundations, which have ravaged precisely its most fertile countries; and want, which is generally felt there, is on the point of transforming itself into actual famine." The news from Pomerania agrees in stating that the results of the last crops are very medico re." In the Grand Dutch y of Posen only a middling crop has been obtained, and anterior provisions can alone prevent a scarcity. The author does not remember having heard such numerous and general complaints, unless it be in the years 1804 and 1817. God grant that the unfortunate events of 1 056 that epoch be not again reproduced !a! There are in' this province whole countries where the usual corn sellers will be obliged themselves to make purchases the next spring. The situation of Alicia is still worse. The price of rye rose 60 per cent. immediately after the crops. It is still on the rise n Hungary, which is usually so productive, the government has been obliged to lay in large stores of corn to prevent a famine. The hope entertained of having good crops has been still more cruelly disappointed than in Silesian n. Austria, Dora via, and Bohemia, the results of this years crop are below those of the average ones, and must scarcely suffice for the general consumption." If we consider the west of Germany, we find, first of all, that the crops in Saxony have not precisely failed, although they are very far from being abundant. The same may be said of the provinces of Brandenburg and of Magdeburg." Bavaria, like other countries, has suffered greatly this year from hail storms and water shouts. The results of the crops have, in consequence, been diminished, as likewise by the state of the atmosphere, which has shown itself but little favorable to the cultivation of corn." Wurtemburg, the country of Laden, Westphalia, and the Cherish provinces, have been better treated; but the disease which has ravaged the <a name="potato1048"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop will be severely felt. Nevertheless, the <a name="potato1049"><mark>potato</mark></a> crop has been generally good throughout western Germany. It will supply many deficiencies in the crops of other places, although they are not so much grown as in other parts of Germanybelgium and Holland have had but bad crops; and the news from France sufficiently proves that this year has not been a productive one pain occupies but an inferior rank among corn growing countries still, reports from this country do not mention that the crops have beendeficientEngland, where the States of the European continent generally find a market for their surplus corn, appears today to be reassured on the wants of its internal consumption, or at least the alarming news which arrived from that country has been succeeded by much more favorable intelligence. Those who count upon corn supplies from the Baltic and provinces of the North Tea will be greatly deceived. The prices of these productions will first of all be very high ; and, in the second place, the quantities than can be supplied, very small. A great quantity of wheat has this year been struck by blight; and this disease, which has spread throughout Germany, Poland, and Hungary, has deteriorated the quality of the corn, as well as diminished the quantity. Further, it cannot now be accurately known whether at a later period England will not be reduced to supply itself from abroad, for it is well known that it is only in case of an abundant crop that enough corn can be grown for the country. In the contrary case, she will look to supplies from America, or from countries bordering on the Black Head n Scandinavia, that is to say, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the crops have not been satisfactory. In a few words, then, it may be said that for many years past there has not been so unfavorable a year as the present one; and if it be added that last year only furnished but indifferent crops in comparison with the preceding ones, this circumstance ought to give rise to measures being taken to prevent the danger which threatens us. 1057CURED Provi Of  Ons, And Cattle. A return of cured provisions imported in the half year, to the 5th of July, 1845, and of live cattle imported in the last three years, has been printed by order of the House of Commons, on the motion of Mr. Frog an, M. P. for Dublin city. It hence appears that the total quantity of cured provisions imported into the United Kingdom in the period above mentioned, was Of salted beef, 46,347 cut; of salted pork, 23,860 cut; of hams of all kinds, 2,423 cut; and of bacon, 16 cut. only. A very insignificant portion of these cured provisions was retained for home consumption, namely :2 363 cut. of beef, realizing a revenue (in the shape of duty) amounting to 40 11; 1,191 cut. of salt pork, producing a revenue of 4591.; 1,349 cut. of ham, producing a duty of 9921.; and 13 cut. of bacon, yielding an amount of duty of 201. The total quantities re exported as merchandise were: Of beef, 4,304 cut; of pork, 6,341 cut; and of ham, 470 cut. The rest was taken for ships' stores, including 44;672 cut. of salt beef, (june) 12,563cwt. of salt pork, and 525 cut. of ham. The greater portion of the salt ed beef was imported from the Gape of Good Hope, and the Hanseatic towns figure for 2,650 cut. The larger portion of the salted pork came from the gape of Good Hope, the An se Towns, and Russia, and half of the ham from the Hanseatic towns, the rest being distributed for the most part between Hanover, Oldenburg h, Holland, and the Peninsula, (including both Portugal and Pain) Of live cattle and other animals there were imported intothe United Kingdom in the year ended July 5, 1845, 6,466 oxen and bulls2503 cows, 118 calves, 3,969 sheep, 42 lambs, and 411 swine and hogs. In 184 344 there were imported 1,294 oxen and bulls, 531 cows, 60 calves 220 sheep, 12 lambs, and 322 swine and hogs. In 1842 43 there were imported 3,578 oxen and bulls, 1,193 cows, 86 calves, 7 27 sheep, 12 lambs, and 563 swine and hogs. From which figures it results that the importation of oxen and bulls has nearly doubled since the year 1842 43, that the import of cows has more than doubled itself during the same period, that sheep have increased from 7 29 to 3,969, that calves have remained steady, and that, lastly, swine and hogs have fallen off. Such are the effects of the new tariff, as illustrated by the return before us. From the American Agriculturiststaves. Since the late reduction of duty in Great Britain on states from the United States to 28s. per 50 cubic feet, they will become an article of considerable export. It is important, therefore, that they should be properly prepared for the English market. For the benefit of those farmers engaged in the state business, we sub join, from a circular recently received here, the principal directions to fit them for the British market. Sizethe standard to which states are now limited is 72 inches long 7 inches broad, and 3 inches thick, and it is always very desirable to get the states of this full length and breadth, length especially. By making them 72 inches long, they suit at once for the sides and ends of all luncheons for the West I india trade, and also for the sides of sugar hogs heads. For brewers' cases, both for the home and export trade, there is a large de671058 arm and for white oak states, 30, 37, and 47 inches long, 7 inches broad, and 11, 2, and 3 inches thick. The present standard thickness of Canada pipe states, viz: -l inch, is very suitable for coopers in general ; but I inch 2 inches, 21 inches, and 3 inches, are all used, although the thick sizes arecdcid127isidered less valuable, and scan things with large proportions of those in them do not take the market so well. Besides the full lent h of 72 inches, the only other sizes at which states should be cut are 42 inches and 33 inches. These lengths would answer the home cooper trade generally, and suit exactly for West I india cases, &c. The lengths of 30 inches to 33 inches are also the sizes required for beef tierces ; and if split at the proper thickness of an ind h, or rather less, or if they were of such thickness as would split into an inch, large quantities of them might be disposed of. These are what 'have hitherto been called pipe states. As regards small states, the only length it would be worth sending is that of 42 inches. Of these there are three kinds which require to be specified : 1st, rum luncheon ; 2d, molasses luncheon; 3d, sugar hogs head. Sum luncheon and molasses luncheon states are cut 42 inches long, and should stand at least 1 :inch thick in the rough state. A similar state, for spirit cases, &c, 45 inches long, and 1- thick, would generally find a ready sale. Some hogs head states are 42 inches in length and three quarters of an inch thick. Articular attention should be paid to make them stand about an inch more than the lengths stated, to allow for working them to the net size. From the Southwestern Farmer. Trade In Cornmeal. We see no reason why corn meal should not be a great article of export from this region of the Union to the West In dies, South America, and even England, (or, rather, we should say especially to England) for in that country corn cannot be raised. There are establishments in some parts of the country for preparing it by kill drying, in such a way that it can be kept sweet in tropical climates for many months. In Mississippi we have now corn in silk, (may 15th,) at a date when those who export to the West   n dies have not planted theirs. I f, then, we had the same enterprise among our people that our brother farmers have in I illinois, In diana, &o, we might have our mills, coopering shops, and packing machines, as well as the corn grower, all busily employed furnishing the foreign market with "fresh corn meal" before the I illinois corn is in tassel. In connection with this subject, we call attention to the following communication, copied from the New Orleans Bulletin. It is from the pen of a Horseman. Consumpti   Of Of Cornmeal In The West I Ndi A I Slands. The consumption of corn meal and other American produce throughout the British West I india islands, since the emancipation of their slaves, has considerably increased. The negro, formerly limited by law to a certain quality and quantity of food, has now his choice of both, as far as his means, Doc. N. 140. 10 59 obtained by labor, will admit; hence the consumption of pork, beef, butter, land, cheese, flour, bread, etc, etc, formerly luxuries, is now in general use, and increasing to an immense extent, while the consumption of corn meal, the only food during slavery, is again, reviving, and its use on the increase, from the following causes n the Until les, Jamaica, Barbadoes, and Trinidad excepted, the lands are too valuable, " under a protective system, and at the low price of lifes necessities in the United States" to produce corn, dams, canadas. or .9htersubstitutes for bread ; besides which, the operations of growing land manufacturing sugar cannot be accomplished without combined' la or; hencetiheltiorer, allured by the magic of money, which he can readily obtain frhis4abor, neglects even the small patch of ground on which, as a bondman, he was entirely depend ant for a few pennies to purchase a bit of pork or white bread" then luxuries Barbadoes consumes now from 20,000 ;o 25,000 barrels of corn meal annually; whereas, previous to the emancipation, not a barrel was imported. In this fact may be found the basis for my previous argument. Interior to the emancipation of slavery, a great many small farmers, called ten acre holders, existed by raising corn and ground provisions for the i use of the planter to feed the slaves; so abundant at times were their crops, that I have known corn to be shipped from Barbadoes to It. Thomas. The natural decrease in labor, since the emancipation, by the .mine number of hands, has, in order at all to approximate former crops, caused an increased demand for laborers, which has drawn this class of agriculturists from their former occupations, finding it more to their advantage to render services for ready money, supplying their wants in market. I de not for a moment pretend to say that Barbadoes is altogether depend ant on foreign imports of corn meal: 25,00) barrels per annum are but a small portion of sustenance for a lit boring population numbering at present 85,00 souls; bat I feel fully assured the same causes which have created the present demand are on the increase. Trrinidad has increased her population much since the emancipation of slavery. It has, however, as yet, for its extent of country and fertility of soil, a small population, raising within themselves a go o deal of corn, and receiving some supplies from South America. The consumption can at present only be computed at 10,000 barrels, while that ofDemrarar is about 15,000. Jamaica, with a laboring population of about 325,000 souls, consume s comparatively less than the former mentioned is lance: 30,000 barrels may at present be considered the extent. Large tracts of lands have, since the emancipation, become divided among the laboring classes, producing large quantities of substitutes for cheap bread stuffs. This circumstance, combined with the almost spontaneous growth of fruit and vegetables, makes the laboring classes at certain seasons less depend ant on foreign supplies but as the population is and must continue on the increase, so follows an increase of wants. It. Croix, It. Thomas, and It. John as are .permanent, being fixed by law to seven quarters of meal for each I laborer; which amounts, at It. Croix, according to a statement furnished me by .the Royal1danish Chamber of Commerce at Copenhagen, to 9,500 luncheons, oreqiuat 'o 38,000 barrels. It. Thomas and It. His consume about 6,000barrels. It Croix consumes but few other American provisions except flour, of which about 4,000 barrels of American; t lie balance of her consumption, "about 3,000 barrels of flour, large quantities of beef, pork, etc, are sup 10 60 plied by the mother country Denmark. Met that island, only 100 square miles, with a population of 34,000, employs yearly about 10,170 tons American shipping. For the general trade of the West In dies, meal in barrels is found most sale able. It. Croix and Porto Rico, however, require their supplies in luncheons, of 800 I is. net, (such as shipped from Brandywine mills) both on account of its better keeping, and use for the luncheons for rum and molasses. From the foregoing illustrations, I will now venture upon a general c amputation of the consumption of corn meal throughout the West In dies. Antigua, Dominican, Canada, Montserrat, He vis, It. Pitts, It. Julie, It. Vincent, Mob ago, Guadaloupe, Martinique, the Virgins, and Bahamas, with a population of 184,000 souls, must, in common calculation, consume Annually about 200,000 barrels, say -200 000 bals. Barbadoes, 25,000; Trinidad, 10,000 -35 000 (demerara -15000St. Thomas, It. Croix, and It. Johns -44000Porto Rico, 40,000; Jamaica, 30,000 -70 000 making 364,000 bals. corn meal annually. A branch of trade so easily a tour command has hitherto been neglected, or but partially and imperfectly commenced; whereas, with this article, the supplying of every other article of provisions from our port would follow. That such a trade is important to New Orleans, I will illustrate by a statement of the imports intoKingston, Jamaica, for three years, up to the 19th of this month, the day I left Kingston1843. 1844.

The average net price of corn meal for twenty years throughout the West In dies may be computed at                                                                $12 per luncheon, or                          $2.50 per bblaprice sufficient to recompense its manufacture. During my late visit to Jamaica, I had the mortification to be told of and see corn meal received from New Orleans unfit for that or any West I india market; the shippers having acted in their own wisdom, cannot, by their losses, judge of the market. But to avoid similar occurrences, I will again repeat that the meal must be equal to the best Philadelphia kill dried, made from the best yellow corn, packed in bals. of 196 lbs. net; and so packed, 
1061that, on opening the barrel, it is perfectly full. The barrels should be clean when shipped, have a plug for convenience of s ambling, well lined, and riveted. These regular i ties, so simple in their nature, properly attended to, place us at once in full and fair competition abroad; whereas otherwise, we will linger for years laboring under prejudices against this article, when received from New Orleans, as was formerly the case with our flour in the West I india markets, (and is yet in the Rio market) without any known cause but want of attention in its manufacture at the beginning.

Of   Verpool, January 3, 1846. Dear Of  R: The commencement of another year, the fourth since the opening of the trade, finds the American provision business established on a firm basis. Prejudice has almost entirely disappeared ; and most of the articles in the preceding prices current are judged only by their real merits comparatively with previous customary supplies. In curing, cutting; and packing, there is still something to learn. Neatness, cleanliness, and sight lines are continually requisite, as well as an adaptation as closely as possible to the uses and customs of our markets. Prices have been favorable to imports during most part of the yearanndthroughout have been safe for extensive operations until now, for it is feared much of the shipments on the way will result disastrously. The reports as to prospects of a supply of food in this country were and are certainly gloomy enough, but the unreasonable prices demanded, and, in too many instances, paid in the United States, cannot have much effect in brightening them, as the enhanced value puts them quite out of the reach of the laboring classes, which natural result appears to be overlooked by shippers. Beefthe imports of beef have reached a safe maximum, being abbot equal to a reasonable demand. Prices have opened high, and would easily retain present value were packers more careful to retain the reputation of their brands; but, out of the numerous parcels already received, only one has opened in equal style to previous shipments. The great error has been in curing with dirty pick le, insufficient in quality and strength; but some have so far forgotten their own interests as to place the coarsest iandroughest parts of their cattle in tierces marked L prime mess." The unprofitable results of such shipments will, perhaps, prevent a repetition of such management 10 64 a. Porkthere has not been a satisfactory business in pork. The imports have been to usual extent, of which more than one half are still in stock. The first arrivals of last season were entirely satisfactory, but the after imports were more carelessly handled, and could not compete with I wish or Hamburg. Some very superior has lately arrived, and held at a price beyond the best I wish. It would be well if this superiority could always be maintained, although, unless prices give way in the United States, a profitable business cannot be done at present, prices here showing a tendency to give way rather than advance. Ashesthe trade in pot and pearl ashes does not increase. The imports have been 1,921 barrels of the former, and 8 27 of the latter, which have nearly all gone into consumption, at about present quotations. The irregularity of quality prevents an increased business. Butterthe great scarcity of grease butter caused prices to advance to 50s. during the season, and there was none left over. The make and import of butter have been so much increased this season that we cannot look for such high rates to rule the coming year, although the quantity wanted will be very large. Utter for eating has not yet become an article of profitable import, nor will it until the duties are reduced. There are some small parcels here, and on the way, for which 60s, in bond, must be considered an extreme quotation. Cheesethere has been a pleasant trade in cheese throughout the year. Prices in New York have got above our level at present, and put a stop to extensive business, but this is believed to be only temporary. At or under present prices, the consumption of England has capabilities for even yet greatly increasing imports. The quality is generally un exception able. Seedsthe business in <a name="seeds153"><mark>seeds</mark></a> has been profitable during the past season when shipped with proper judgment. The imports of flax seed this year have been unusually early, and it is hoped will not continue to be so extensive the balance of the season. With a fair supply, the market promises well, but at prices reduced from the last season. Line c lover seed is expected to bring long prices, as the crops are short, and quality inferior throughout. Hempthe unequal and inferior quality of hemp has been frequently noticed. Until packers give this subject necessary attention, little good can be done in this market; but were once a character established, an immense consumption would be had in England, as in strength and length of fibre American hemp is unequal led. Woolthe same fault, though in a less degree, of irregularity in packing, has been found with American wool, which is rapidly assuming much importance in this country. An extensive wool broker in London, in writing to another part of the world, on this subject, uses language so well suited for the United States that 1 do not hesitate quoting it: " The remedy appears to us, on this side of the water, so easy, that we feel astonished at the growers being so blind to their own interests. The men who s hear the sheep can be told to cast aside any black or gray sheeps coats, and pack them separately And the wool from sheep shorn in the grease can surely be kept apart, and packed separately" And the very coarse, half bred, and low, kempt, native flee ces can surely be packed separately. 1065And the white, good, fine, and clean flee ces can be packed by themselves ll f the care which we have been advocating were taken with your wools, the grower or dealer would, in making out his in voice, classify his produce as follows: "A 1 to 10, 10 bales, all fine clean flee ces, eyes, &c 11 to 12, 2 " clean lambs 0 13 to 15, 3 " native flee ces." B 16 to 17, 1 " greasy e we flee ces 17, 1 " greasy lambs' flee ces 19, 1 " black and gray, lambs and flee ce." G 20, 1 " locks and pieces picked up and shaken from the straw after s hearing." We have no hesitation in saying, that, if the farmers can be induced to operate upon these remarks, and sort their wool properly, giving a faithful representation of the contents of the several packages, as above, their wool will acquire that popularity in the market to which their improved growth already entitles them; and, in short, their full value will be secured The imports of wool have been over 3,500 bags, but only a small portion has found buyers, the bulk of the arrivals having come in during December, when there was a total disinclination for business among all classes, and it is too early in the year to note any increased demand. Ridesduring the first six months of the year the market was generally heavy, and prices declined fully I d. per pound, but they have since experienced some slight improvement in value, although the demand is far from brisk, and the sales of last month do not exceed 800 hides, at 3d for New Work, and 31d. to 3rd. per pound for Philadelphia; leaving the present stock 7,300 hides, against 1,900 at this period last year. I mport36970, against 31,500 in 1844, and 17,300 in 1843. Sole leather Since the abolition of the customs' duties on leather, there have been some considerable imports from the United States, (estimated at about 25,000 sides) the greater part of which, being manned with hem lock bark, was exceedingly difficult of sale, although offered at very low rates that portion manned with oak bark found buyers; but the prices obtained were generally unremanerating to the shippers. Lardwithin the last week we have had large arrivals of land from New Orleans, previous to which we had had heavy receipts from Philadelphia and New Work. The price is, therefore, down at least is. below highest value of the season. The demand for c urinary purposes is still limited, but is enough, unless further arrivals interfere, to clear off present stock without much further reduction. Any packages injure the land so as to unfit it for eating purposes, by being charred inside when reasoning. The land, consequently, is smut ted. Tallowthe imports continue to increase, and the quality of many bands is now standard. At a price equal to Russian, any quantity can be placed; but this will not afford a profit at prices now ruling in America. There is a poor prospect of any advance. Only one third of the consumption of tallow in Great Britain is imported in the average of years, so that any increase of the home supply, and with the present consumption of meat in England it must be materially added to now, has a serious effect on p rises of foreign. Stavesthe importations of the year are equal to 516 M., chiefly of 1 066 a. W. It luncheon. The sales during the month are limited, and stock isaccumulating. Good W. O. pine have been sold at 14 15s. to 15 per. The best demand is found for those suitable for cleaving into sugar hogs head states of red or white oak. If an article for that purpose could be introduced, so that the states would cost 7 10s. to 8 per M., this market would take off a large quantity. Flour and breadstvffsI n all business matters the last few weeks have been anxious and perilous. The resignation of Air Robert Feel, the advent of Word John Russell, and the recall of Air Robert Feel, following in such sudden succession, are so full of meaning, that trade (suffering at same time by the panic in the money market) has been paralyzed; and, until the opening of Parliament shall have put us in possession of the real intentions of government, we cannot look for a prosperous revival. That an important change is about being made in our corn and provision laws all parties are agreed, and that the change will be a final settlement of this long vexed question is also fully believed; but its extent and conditions no man out of the government can tell, and speculation is various and useless. The guess which will be found nearest the truth, perhaps, is one which says a fixed duty on wheat, commencing at 12s, and falling yearly to a minimum, will be proposed, accompanied with the compensation to land holders of taking from land one of its peculiar burdens, the poor rates, and j making them payable out of the general taxation of the country. Whichever way this great question is settled, so it he settled, the Unitedstates will reap immense benefits. Another month will give us full particulars. To small a portion of the railway schemes have reached maturity, that all fear for their effect on the money market has disappeared, and discount shave become comparatively easy. Flour has been sold to a considerable extent at 28s. to '29s, in bond, which is is. to is. under highest price a few weeks since. The duty has advanced a step. I indian corn is not easy to sell at 34s, in bond, although it is generally believed it will be admitted free of duty. Black eyed peas are known here as kidney beans, and are free of duty since 1st of June, 1845. With compliments of the season, I am, respectfully, James Mhenry1067

The commencement of the past year was ushered in by the p respects of the greatest commercial prosperity, and the realization of those continued steady with us for eight months, when the first rumors of a bad harvest came on us in such a form as not to be mistaken or trifled with; and with the past experience of the evil working of our corn laws, prudent men, foreseeing the certain result of an export of bullion to pay for foreign corn, immediately decided on contracting their engagements, and preparing for that tightness in the money market which was sure to follow. This, joined to the immense amount of capital invested or promised for all kinds of railway stock, produced a panic which has now continued for three months and though it certainly has caused much individual suffering, still the general tone of commercial matters is healthy, and trade, though in some measure paralyzed for a time, is not. seriously injured, as may be evidenced by the fact that money is becoming more easy, discounts lower, manufacturers in full employ, the working classes in the receipt of large wages, and the consumption of all produce unusually great; along with this, the agricultural population, as a whole, are in a more prosperous state, the shipping interest regenerating the owners, and the formation of railways over the three kingdoms giving ample occupation to every one disposed to be employed. If our recent political changes were once arranged, the corn laws fixed on a permanent and just basis, and the general policy of our government known, commercial confidence would be at once restored; and enjoying, as we do, peace with all the world, we have reason to look forward with good hopes for the year on which we have entered. As to our trade with the United States, we have not much general news to communicate since our last. The usual dullness which generally prevails at this season of the year, with the rumors, in every case greatly exaggerated, of the almost certainty of a collision between the governments- -10 70 of Great Britain and the United States on the Oregon question, all tended to keep us in a state of disquiet use, and to limit operations. We are glad, however, on the receipt of the Presidents message, to see that, though in some points rather warlike, still it showed some disposition for an amicable settlement; and while with one hand the President displays no disinclination -for war, he as evidently with the other offers the branch of peace in the form of a decided modification of the tariff; thus following in our rapidly extending sound principles of, free trade, the light of which appears to be gradually spreading over the most anti quoted nations of Europe. Cotton has experienced some variation in prices during the month, owing solely to the impression that difficulties might arise with the Unitedstates; but there is so much good feeling for peace and conciliation rising up among the intelligent commercial community of both countries, that this impression cannot be used to force up prices, and sales have gone on at a full average to meet the current demand of the manufacturers, without a variation of more than one-fourth pence per pound. Woolwe continue to receive small shipments of wool, which is andwillconiinue to come more into favor. The quality of the staple of some considerable portion is very good; but the Americans, so far, do not sort it properly, but mix all qualities together without due care thus injuring the general character of the whole shipment. The sales made in last month have been very trifling, at rates under our December quotations. Beef n this article e e must do the cures the justice to say that they have all but monopolized our market for the supply of our commercial navy. It is true that some cures have, partly from inattention and partly from design, no doubt been induced to pay less attention to cut, cure, and, regularity of packing; they must, however, be told that this is bad policy for their own interests. The expenses on good and bad are equal, and inferior brands will be always looked on with suspicion, and realize lower prices, perhaps, than their actual value quality with us, in every case of food, being the first object. The sales of the month past have been very trifling, at our prices noted above; but in this article, as in all others, we expect a decided improvement. Work does not improve. We find a growing dislike for this article though offered fully 12 per cent. below I wish, yet it does not sell. This is owing to the soft nature of the pork itself, and partly to the want of that neatness and care which characterize the I wish brands of this article. There have also been a number of true complaints that it does not do for long voyages, and that the extra waste is more than equivalent to the difference between it and I wish. Cheesethe arrivals of cheese have not been large, and yet, s range to say, fully equal the demand. We can account for this most satisfactorily from two causes. The first is, that we have a very heavy make of English, "which has been pressed I re ely on the market; and, secondly, the price ofAmericap has so advanced as not only to equal, but in reality to be higher the our own make; and though the quality has no doubt much improved and is good, yet the large mass of the consumers naturally prefer home i take when to be bought at as low or lower rates.

oAPPENDI X No. 33. James Bogarduss Patent Eccentri C Uni Versal Of  Of. A patent was granted fourteen years ago to James Bogardus, of the city of New Work, for a mill called the " Eccentric Universal Will" which, on account of its importance, has been extended for fourteen years more, by special act of Congress. From the great importance of this invention to every branch of industry, it is deemed advisable to notice it in this report for, although patented fourteen years since, the entire change which it introduces in the operation of grinding has delayed its successful introduction, and many parts of the country are not yet acquainted with its advantages. The discovery of this simple principle has opened a new field to scientific inquiry. Mr. Bogardus has freely communicated its advantages to other arts for instance, the polishing of dies, and the plan wishing of stone, glass, or metallic plates. Nothing is ventured in the prediction that the time is not far distant (when its practical application is better understood when the special of telescopes will, by its means, be constructed with as little expense as ordinary mirrors. But, however difficult its scientific investigation, the practical working of these mills has already resulted in the following facts and advantages 1. In other mills, power has to be applied not only to grind, but also to throw out, by centrifugal force, the substance ground. In this mill the peculiar motion of the plates will of itself discharge the ground substance thus saving all the ordinary waste of power 2. From the relative motion of the two plates, there is much less friction between them, and consequently much less direct power is required to turn the mill." This mill of Mr. Bogardus is of that class of invention of which but few are made in centuries. Hills are nearly the oldest machinery on record, and yet all others, however various their form, have been constructed on one uniform principle, namely, one stone or plate being stationary, and the other revolving, which, by its rapid revolution, communicates a centrifugal force to the substance introduced between the plates, and thus subjects it to their grinding action; whereas, in Mr. Bogarduss mill, the principle is entirely new, and unquestionably his original invention." In this mill, both plates revolve in the same direction, (with nearly equal speed) on centres, which are apart from each other one inch, more or less the centre of the one, or axis thereto affixed, resting on' and revolving upon a stationary point; whilst the prime m over, by means of a belt or hearing, communicates motion to the other plate. The circles which are cut in the plates act like revolving s hears, cutting every way, which, when in operation, causes a peculiar cutting, wrenching, or twisting and sliding motion, admirably adapted for every species of grinding. From the position of the two centres, it is named the Eccentric Will. The beautiful and singular motion of these mills, which originated with himself, he has now brought to perfection, after years of study and experiment and if the statements of those by whom these mills have been already. 1 145 used are to be regarded, they must eventually supersede all other mills for all purposes of pulling, cutting, and grinding The following are some of the advantages of mills worked on this principle : " 1. The peculiar motion of the plates will, of itself, discharge the ground substance, so that many substances can be ground thereby which would altogether choke other mills r . In other mills a given point in one of the plates continually describes the same circle on the other; but in this mill it traverses on the other plate, at an infinite variety of angles, every point within two concentric circles apart from each other, twice the distance of the centres of the plates, thereby rendering the wear and tear of the plates uniform, and preserving the grinding action of every point 3. In other mills, the grinding power of each point increases with its distance from the centre ; but in this mill, every point from the centre to the circumference has the same grinding power. A considerably smaller mill will, therefore, effect a given purpose, and the Eccentric Will is therefore more portable than other mills 4. The ever changing action of the mill, and the quick discharge of the substance ground, prevent it from becoming heated, so that the Eccentric Will may be profit ably employed in grinding substances which, in other mills, would be either spoiled or deteriorated in quality or, by 'their melting, be impossible to be ground. If other mills were driven with that speed which can be safely applied to the Eccentric Will, they would be made red hot in a few minutes These mills have been successfully introduced for the following purposes : " Pulling rice, coffee, and olivesGrinding grains of all kinds; paints of all kinds, in water or in oil iron, zinc, copper, and gold oars, plumb ago and manganese, bones for manure and bones for refining sugar, flint and quart z, charcoal, plaster, putty, printers' inks, drugs and dye stuffs, snuffs, mustard, coffee, spices, loaf sugar, starch, gums, resins, asphaltum, I india rubber, fix seed, and oil cake, &c, &c." Of the substances enumerated, some cannot be ground at all by other mills. In short, the Eccentric Hills are more economical in the power required to drive them, and in the labor of tending them ; they are less costly for the work they do, and more portable; they are capable of being applied to purposes for which other mills are useless; and the wear and tear is trifling Directions for using Bogarduss mill for dry substances. The mill should run to the right, and make not less than three hundred revolutions per minute. Nearly any quantity can be ground by increasing the speed. The mill is regulated to grind fine and coarse, by the under screw, on which the end of the shaft revolves ; turning the screw to the left will bring the plates together and cause the mill to grind finer. The regulating screw is held firmly in any position, by a small screw placed against its side. There are three reservoirs, which should be well supplied with oil. The first is on the top of the upper plate: two or three table spoonfuls of oil should be poured into this reservoir, through a small hole made in the top of the mill for that purpose. The second reservoir is the box, 1 146 through which the main shaft passes; this is just under the spot of the mill. This reservoir should be filled with tallow, so that it may supply itself. There is also a small hole in the back part of the mill, through which oil can be poured into this reservoir, if requisite. The third reservoir is the step in which the main shaft revolves that may be filled with oil. The feeding is regulated by a shoe, acting against the tube of the upper plate, which causes the shoe to vibrated; this, with the slide in the hop per, regulates the quantity fed into the mill. Screw holes are made round the rim of the hop per, for the purpose of extending its size to any dimensions required. The mill can be taken apart, cleaned, and the plates changed if necessary) in a few moments. Bogarduss eccentric mill, for pulling and grinding dry substances. a. 1147For grinding paints and liquid substances. The mill should run to the right, and make from one hundred and fifty to two hundred revolutions per minute. The belt passes from the back of the mill, running over the front part of the pulley, leaving the front of the mill clear : the scrape r must be placed just where the plates coincide with each other, so as to scrape both plates at the same time. The reservoir or step for the under plate should be well supplied with oil. A small syringeBogarduss eccentric mill, for grinding liquid substances 1 148 may be used for that purpose, or the under plate may be taken out, (this is done in a moment by lowering the screw) and the reservoir filled with oil. Poles are made in the screw for the purpose of putting in a french, by which the screw can be turned backward or forward. Turning the screw to the left will bring the plates together, and cause the mill to grind finer. After running a few hours the plates become faced, and the mill may then be set to grind as fine as desired1149

Wages Of Labor. From an instructive article on the subject of agricultural labor in different countries, its wages, and the comparative condition of the laborer, in the London Dark Lane Express, we con dense the following facts : I your estimates we have called the shilling sterling 22 cents, though its value is a trifle less; and the comparison, though instituted with the English laborer, can be easily made with those of this country, In England, the average rate of agricultural wages for an able man, with a family, is 9 shillings, or                                                         $1.98, per week. From this is to be deduced cottage rent at 85 cents per week, being                                                         $1.63 per week to provide himself with the necessaryes of life. 6 in France, a laborer in the same situation receives                                                         $1.04 per week; in Russia, 66 cents ;in Germany,                                                         $1.02 per week; in Holland and Belgium,                                                         $1.20; in I talk and the Austrian States,                                                         $1.15. It will be remembered that these averages are those of the common laborer shepherds, car men, and mechanics receiving rather more. The food which the wages named above will purchase in the several countries, is stated in the Express as follows n England the laborer can obtain for his 163 cents, or his weeks wages, either 39 lbs. of bread, or 11- lbs. of meat, 7 lbs. of butter, 12 les. of cheese, or 174 lbs. of <a name="potatoes1486"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In France, with his 104 cents, he can buy either 46 lbs. of bread, 13 les. of meat, or 261 lbs. of <a name="potatoes1487"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. In Russia, with his 66 cents per week, the laborer can buy either 3Glbs. of bread, 16 lbs. of meat, or 8- lbs. of butter. In Germany, with 102 cents he obtains either 43s lbs. of bread, 18 les of meat, 11 lbs. of butter, 24 lbs. of cheese, or 54 quarts of beer. In Holland and Belgium, 120 cents will buy either 58 lbs. of bread, 224 is. of beef, or 460 lbs. of potatoes731154 a. In I talk and the Austrian States, the laborer, with his 115 cents, can buy either 50 lbs. of bread, 22 lbs. of beef, 8 lbs. of butter, 8 lbs. of cheese, or 168 lbs. of <a name="potatoes1488"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>. This table is interesting, as showing not only the prices of labor in the countries named, but also the price of bread, meat, butter, cheese, &c. It is true, the bread is stated by the pound instead of grain by the bushel but, as the flour of a bushel of wheat, say 40 lbs, will make from 63 to 65 les. of bread, an estimate may easily be made of the quantity of wheat or flour a man in any of the countries named would receive for a weeks work. The laborer in this country, who receives his bushel of wheat a day, or other articles in proportion, will readily conceive the meager fare, and slender chance of "laying by anything" which must attend the foreign agricultural laborer. In all these countries it will be seen the value of provisions is at least as great as here, and in some instances much greater. It is only by the comparisons which such authentic statements enable them to make, that the free laborers, the farmers or mechanics of this country, can fully appreciate the advantages of their position. a. 1156APPENDI X No. 35. Curi Of Provi Of  Ons, &c. From the Cultivator. Of The Curi Of Of Provi Of  Ons For The Bri Of   Of Market. Having obtained the cattle, (averaging between 600 and 800 lbs) our next care must be to have them properly killed; and not only the blood of each animal should be well and thoroughly drawn, but every animal should be allowed sufficient time to rest off its journey, say from 24 to 48,hours, according to circumstances, so as to allow the fever consequent on driving any distance to subside before you kill it. The business of packing is divided into two parts. The first is to cure the meat. The second is to preserve it when cured. In the packing house the first preparation that should be made for business is the making of the bring in which the beef is to be cured. Either Kanawha, Panes ville, nor loose creek salt should be allowed to touch your meat, either directly by mixture with other salt, or indirectly through the medium of bring; for so sure as any of these salts are used, so sure will your meat become slim like fish, and be imperfectly cured. The best salt I know of, for curing, is the Liverpool coarse sack salt, as it is called. The bring should be made for at least ten or fourteen days before it is required ; it should be made in large vats or hogs heads, with a sufficient quantity of finely powdered saltpeter added, to give the beef that red color which so pleases the eye, from long habit; it should be allowed to settle down and refine, and when drawn off into the tubs where the beef is to be cured, it should be clear, and entirely free from any sediment or impurity. The strength should also be tested, which, in the absence of a regular bring tester, may be done accurately enough by placing the half of a hogs head, weighing from seven to eight pounds, in the bring, which must float perpendicular ly, the snout two inches above the surface, before the bring can be pronounced strong enough. The next operation in the packing house is the cutting up of the beef into eight pound pieces, about which it is impossible to give any specific directions, as the number of pieces must entirely depend on the size, weight, and thickness of the animal. This department of the business must be guided by the hand and eye of the practical tradesman, and directed solely by his good judgment. One thing may here be remarked that it is always well to leave two prime pieces of every car cases, say off the standing ribs, whole and uncut, to weigh from thirty-two to thirty-eight lbs, and cured in that way, for two reasons : first, when cut up to the proper size after they are cured, it leaves a freshness and bloom on those pieces for the heading, which gives to the purchaser, on opening the tierce for inspection, a certain guarantee that the meat was handled by a tradesman; and, secondly, it will facilitate the sealing of the meat much; as, should thirty-seven pieces, be in the scale, wanting one piece more to weigh eight or ten pounds, more for less, that piece can be cut off this larger one to a great nice ty, and avoid the delay and trouble of tossing a pile of meat over to hunt up one piece from the many, of the exact weight wanted. In sealing your meat it is not1156
necessary to put more than the exact weight (504 pounds) in, as beef, when cured and put into tierces, will regain fully 5 per cent. of the 10 percent. it will have lost in the process of curing. As your beef is cut, the coarse pieces of the fore quarter, such as the clouds, stickings, and shoulder pieces, should be selected and well rubbed with dry salt, and put into picking tubs by. themselves; the round, rum p, and jump pieces of the hindquarters should in like manner be selected, well rubbed with dry salt, and put into picking tubs by themselves; and then your prime parts, such as ribs, sir loins, plate, and brisk et pieces, should be selected, and put into the picking tubs by themselves, and with but being rubbed. Those pieces, being the most tender and least vein y parts of the beef, will cure more easily and quicker than the coarser parts; but after remaining a week in the bring they should be drawn, and if the bring has not sufficiently stricken, then, and not till then, should those pieces be rubbed with dry salt. The coarser pieces should be drawn and examined every fifth day at least; and if the salt should not have sufficiently stricken, and the impure ties be not well extracted, then they should be gently rubbed a second time, and the air t allowed to act for an hour or two at least on the meat and salt, before they are returned into the bring : the whole of the meat in the curing tubs must be well covered with bring, and the air entirely excluded from it. Under a good state of the atmosphere, and with proper handling of the meat, it will be cured and ready to put into the tier ces in from fourteen to sixteen days ; but of this the practised eye and hand of the tradesman can alone be the judge, for I know of no words to explain the feel and look of meat when cured, or when not sufficiently cured: practice and comparison alone, aided by close observation, is the only certain way of arriving at that judgment. The propriety of sorting the meat of the three qualities, as pointed out, and having each quality cured separately, I shall endeavor to explain so as to be understood and appreciated by every person possessed of any commonsense and experience. First, the finer or middle pieces of every animal, it is well known, are much more easily cured than the coarser pieces of the extremities of either the fore or hind quarter; hence the propriety of keeping them separate, as, nine times out of ten, it is wholly unnecessary to do more to them (the finer pieces) than simply to place them in the bring, where they will cure without any rubbing, while it is necessary to rub the other pieces once at least, and sometimes oftener, with dry salt, in order to extract thoroughly those impure ties which the lean of every animal contains in a very much larger proportion than the father part of the same animal does and it is, for the same reason, right and necessary to separate the pieces cut off the extremity of the fore quarter from those cut off the extremity of theihindquarter, because the meat of the fore quarter contains more of thoseimpurities which must be extracted before it is cured, than does the meat of the hind quarter, and consequently the meat of the fore quarters requires more care and handling, in order to cure it, than does the meat on any other part of the car cases of the animal; hence this classification will diable the, cure r to give to each sort of meat the required handling necescid127y fr 'its preservation, without interfering with the other parts, which f if treated in the same way, (I now speak of the finer pieces) would have their fntural4ifes :extracted, become hard, and what is commonly y tit riroeoutiycalled: over cured. There is also another reason why this classification should be made it is this: that it saves much time and labor, when the. 1 157 meat is selecting for the scale, by having each quality in separate bulk :the s elector has but to go to either in order to lay his hand at once upon the particular piece he wants, without losing time or wasting labor in tossing over a pile of meat promiscuously cured. When your meat is cured, the next process is the packing it away for preservation into the tierces, about which I deem it unnecessary to say anything; because, when the meat is selected and scaled, the packing it is a mere mechanical process, in which a man can alone become a proficient by practice and experience. It may be well enough to remark, that when your meat is taken out of the curing tubs it should be washed, and rid of the impure ties extracted by the salt, and generally in a greater or less degree deposited on the surface, and which can be best and most easily done with the aid of water and a good hickory broom; the packer should always have by him a knife, and whenever he observes an incur station of those impure ties on the meat, which the washing had not taken off, he should use his knife to scrape it off; and if scraping does not affect it, he should cut it off. When your tierces are packed, they must then be headed and thoroughly driven down in their z wooden hoops, rolled (by, and each tierce have itsbunghole bored, and then bribed with pure, clean bring, made and tested in the way before described, except that no saltpeter should be put in it. It is of the utmost importance that this bring should be made several days before, in order that not only the impure ties of the salt, but those of the water also, should have time to settle down into a sediment, and this sediment should not be disturbed when the bring is drawn off. The want of this precaution has been the .cause of much complaint and injury to the meat when exposed (or sale, from the fact that when the bring was put on without first being allowed to clear itself, the impure ties of both the salt and the water settled upon the meat, and made it both slim y and dirty. The tierces should remain at least fourteen days in this state, with the lungs open, and whatever the cases may have absorbed of the bring should: be replenished once, if not twice, every day, and this continued until the cases will absorb no more, and the bring remains as stationary and un diminished, when filled, as though it stood in a glass bottle. The necessity for this precaution is obvious: first, if your states are not in this way allowed to become saturated with bring, and the bring replenished before the cases are finally coopered and shipped, you can have no guarantee for your cases not leaking on the voyage; and, secondly, should this absorption be allowed to take place on the voyage, your tierces in a short time will become half empty of bring; and wherever your meat then comes in contact with the state, it will extract from the wood its coloring matter it will become stained and dis colored, and, for the want of bring, the meat will become bard and ran did, and perhaps mould y too. Your tierces, after standing at least fourteen days, will take no more bring. They are then ready for the lungs, which should be put in with a coarse cloth around them, and tightly driven; over each hung apiece of tinsliould be nailed on, but great care must be observed that the tracks with which it is fastened are so short as not to go through the state; as, if they do, a leakage will take place that may do much harm. When comes the finishing stroke to the whole the putting on of your iron hoops, and the final coopering of your tierce. As few coopers are in the habit of doing such work in the United States, I shall explain the115
process, so that all may understand, and perform it, if they will. In the first place, care should be taken to clear your house of all salt and bring, in order that the hoop iron may be kept as free from it as possible, to prevent rust and cor riding. The tierce up ended, the cooper takes off the three first wooden chime hoops; he then takes his hoop iron and bends it around the place of the first hoop, and takes its accurate measure; there, he then cuts it to the length, and rivets it, which can only be well done on the face of a small and il, or on the side of a metal half hundred weigh the then puts this hoop on, (having eased it, by a few blows on the inside of one edge, to the shape of the case) and drives it to the berth of the second wooden hoop, leaving room for a wooden guard hoop on the outer edge of the chime; he then strips that end of the tierce of all the remainder of its wooden hoops, and takes his hoop iron and measures around the berth of the third wooden bulge hoop, cuts, rivets, and shapes it, and then puts it on and drives it down to the place of the second bulge hoop; this done, he then puts on his wooden guard bulge hoop, which passes over the iron one, and drives it to its place, and then drives on the remainder of his wooden hoops, finishing with a guard chime hoop outside the iron one, and so proceeds on until the whole is coopered. It is necessary here to remark, that no iron driver, used perpendicular ly, as cooper s use their wooden drivers on wooden hoops, will ever drive an iron hoop to its place. There is a proper driver, without which the hoops cannot be driven. It is thus b, the handle; a, the head on which the blow is given; and c, the bite which catches the edge of the hoop: this, used with a 7 pound hammer to strike with, will drive any iron hoop to its place; but without it, the hoop cannot be stretched and driven, and consequently must remain, imperfect. Was Apprenti   Ced Packer. Loui Svi Lle, Of, November 4, .1845. Salti   Of Beef And Pork. Mr. R. H. Stranger, of Grenville, informs us that he has for several years pursued the following method with success : " In packing down pork, I sprinkle .in four quarts of rock salt to a barrel, then make a pick le of warm water sufficient to cover all the meat, as strong as can be made with salt, and when cold, pour it on; when the pick le becomes much colored with the blood of the meat, draw it off, boil it, take off the s cum till it becomes clean, and apply it again; in this way pork will keep sweet throughout the ensuing summer, and will be free of rust. Of  n salting beef, take four quarts of rock salt, wounded fine, eight ounces of saltpeter, and five pounds of brown sugar; mix them well together, and with these ingredients pack the meat down very closely, so as that they will of themselves cover the whole with bring. The next spring, draw off the bring, clarify it as before mentioned, adding a little salt to it, and apply it again, and the beef will keep very sweet and fine tasted during the whole summer following or . J. R. Fuller, of Went, Connecticut, says : (<I n looking over the Oc
1159tdber number of the Cultivator, I saw some remarks on the subject of preserving pork, with a request that if any one had practised the same method, to inform you of the result. I have for more than twenty years, with very few exceptions, cut and packed my pork and hams the evening after butchering, and always pour on the bring boiling hot, the same evening, or the next morning. The barrel should be left open until the bring gets cold. I have never known any one that has tried that method, who was not satisfied with the result. I can, therefore, with the fullest confidence recommend that method. From the New York Farmer. At a meeting of the Farmers' Club, the president, Dr. Rhinelanderread the following from the practice at Cincinnati: "to one barrel of 150 pounds, four quarts of salt, two pounds of sugar, and one pound of saltpeter, wounded fine, and rolled together until they are thoroughly mixed; each ham is thoroughly rubbed with that compound over the entire surface, and as far around the bone as can be reached; the hams are then placed in a barrel for two weeks ; then put in six quarts of wood ashes, with ten gallons of water, and boil about two hours; let stand until set fled, at the same time making a strong bring; nine gallons of bring to one gallon of lye; pack in this, and let them lie four weeks or. Woodhullto a barrel of hams, one gallon of molasses, two ounces of saltpeter, and cover with a strong bring; take them up in ten or twelve days, and re pack them. Mr. Wdltersfor every one hundred of meat, two quarts of molasses and four ounces of saltpeter, with a strong bring. From the American Agriculturists. Packi Of Prqvi Of  Ons For The Engli   Of Market. Mr. Notch, writing us from London, says: "the early attention you asked of your readers to the English mode of 1 putting up provisions begins already to manifest itself in the very improved manner in which they are now brought to this market, and the improved prices they command." Bacon for the London market must not be enveloped, as for the country consumption, with a thick coat of fat; on the contrary, it should have but little fat, and its muscle or lean parts must be well marbled with it However, as yet, bacon is not cured to any extent in the northern States. Tongues have been sent here, but have been so badly trimmed, so bloody, and so slovenly put up, that they did not sell for more than half price. Properly put up, they would have sold at from is. to is. 6d. apiece; for here they are sold at is. 6d. to is. 6d, when cured as they should be. From the Collar Farmer. Curi Of Hams. We re publish the following method of curing hams. There is noneetter1160 a. For every one hundred pounds of meat, take five pints of good molasses or five pounds of brown sugar) five ounces saltpeter, and eight pounds rock salt; add three gallons of water, and boil the ingredients over a gentle fire, swimming off the f roth or s cum as it rises. Continue the boiling till the salt, &c, is dissolved. 'have the hams, nicely cut and trimmed, packed in cases with the thank end down, as the pick le will thus strike in better. When the pick le, prepared as above, is sufficiently cool, pour it over the hams. They may lie in pick le from two to six weeks, according to the size of the pieces or the state of the weather more time being required in cold than in warm weather. Beef or mutton hams, or tongues intended for smoking and drying, may be cured according to this mode, and will be found excellent. The Albany Cultivator adds the following n that excellent and agreeable work entitled " Farming for Ladies, "we find the following directions for preparing the celebrated ' Hambropickle" which is said to be equally applicable to beef, pork, tongues, &c." To each gallon of water, put one pound and a half of common salt, a quarter of a pound of coarse brown sugar, and one ounce of saltpeter boiled, arid to be carefully s dimmed. After standing in a proper vessel until quite cool, the meat may be immersed, and will be fit for use in ten days, and improve for months; but it must be carefully kept pressed down by means of a cover, and a clean heavy stone. The pick le must be watched, and, when i any s cum begins to rise, the meat must be taken out and the liquor re boiled, and s dimmed and cooled as before; at the same time half a pound more salt must be added, but no raw salt is to be applied at any time. The meat is to be returned when the pick le is quite cold, say after ten or twelve hours. Tongues will require a month at least, and are improved by the addition of an ounce of bay salt added to the above. Oneclove of garlic, half an ounce of al spice, and as much whole pepper, boiled with the ingredients, much improve it From the American Agriculturists. Davi Dsons I Nventi   Of For Curi Of Provi Of  Ons. The whole apparatus is perfectly simple. It consists of a large cylinder, made air- tight. It has a mouthpiece, through which the meat is put into. The cylinder. In this mouthpiece is fitted a lid, with its surface so adapted to the mouthpiece that no air can pass. Strong screws bind it close to the mouthpiece. In the lid are two vents, with screws to open and close them. This cylinder, mouthpiece, and lid are made of the best of iron, with a thickness proportional to their size. There is also a large vat to hold bring. This is made of wood, and is elevated above the cylinder, and connected with it by a pipe. Through the pipe the bring passes from the vat to the cylinder. There is a lifting pump attached to the cylinder. By it the bring is pumped from the cylinder into the vat. The meat, being first cut, is placed in the cylinder and the bring admitted. When the cylinder is filled with the bring, the lid is closed down on, the mouthpiece and screwed fast. The pump is then put into action, and the bring carried back to the vat. When the bring is all removed from the cylinder, the meat is in a vacuum; this is obvious, for the bring had of. 11jicourse expelled r; t air; the cylinder and closed lid being air tight, did not permit the air to return when the bring was withdrawn. The meat being in a vacuum, parts with all the blood, air, and gases which may be contained within it; these escape into the vacuum of the cylinder. The bring is now again introduced, and when the meat is covered, the air events in the lid are opened, and the bring drives out all the air and gases which had escaped from the meat. When the cylinder is full of bring, the airventsare closed, and the bring is pumped into the vat, and the meats are again in vacuum. Again, blood, air, and gases escape into the vacuum. Thebrine is again introduced, and the meat covered; the air events are then opened, and the air and gases escape from the cylinder, and the cylinder is filled with bring. The bring is withdrawn and returned again and again until the operation is completed. The interval of withdrawing and returning is short at first; but when the blood, air, and gases are expelled from the meat, the bring is allowed to remain on the meat for some hours say four to eight. After the blood, air, and gases are expelled, and the meat has remained in the bring for six or eight hours, it is cured. The whole process will require about twelve hours. The principle on which the method acts is that of a pressure upon the meat in the vacuum. In its ordinary condition the meat is filled with blood, air, and gases; when immersed in bring, in the ordinary process, these, by their resisting power, prevent the bring from entering the meat; the blood has an affinity with the bring, and leaves the meat to unite with it. The pressure of the water and its specific gravity being greater than that of the air and gases, the air and gases rise to the surface and escape, and the bring takes their place. To do this, however, takes time, and about six weeks are found necessary to accomplish it. When, however, the meat is in a vacuum, the blood, air, and gases escape at once; being escaped, the bring exerts its pressure, and the meat is charged at once. This pressure, in the ordinary method of curing, is nothing more than that which arises from the weight and pressure of the quantity of bring necessary to cover the meat. In the cylinder, the meat, when the blood, air, and gases have been separated from it in the vacuum, can be subjected to an illimitable amount of pressure. To do this, nothing more is necessary than the elevation of the vat. Connected as is the vat, by a pipe, to the cylinder, the pressure is in proportion to the elevation of the vat. By means of the vacuum the meat is freed from all the means of resistance to the entrance of the bring; and the pressure of the bring may be carried to any extent that the meat will bear without collapsing. When in vacuum, it is swollen, its fibre distended, and pores open, and it readily admits the bring, even at. the simple pressure of the mere quantity of bring which the cylinder will hold. In this matter, experience has taught that the pressure of a single atmosphere is the most effective; a greater one tends to close the pores of the vacated meat, and a triple atmospheric pressure completely closes them, to tie exclusion of the by in e. The whole secret of the action of this i method is, that the vacuum fits the meat at once t admit the bring, and the pressure, if not too great, at once forces the bring into the vacated pores; and this done, the meat is cured. By the use of the vacuum, the natural process is shortened from weeks to hours, and the meat is cured at least as peectlyindeed, far more perfectly. The advantage of a rapid curing of meat in a perfect manner is obvious 1 162 to every one. But there are numerous advantages besides. Met me enumerate them :all meats, salted and cured in the ordinary method, require two packings to pass inspection, and for family use. When the meat is cured, which will be at the end of six weeks or two months, the bring is bloody and foul. In the large packing and inspection establishments the meat is repacked, and the first bring is thrown away. With the vacuum process, the meat, when cured, at the end of twelve hours is free from blood, and ready to receive its final packing, fit to pass inspection, or keeping for family use. In the process of curing, pork increases in weight ten or eleven per cent. In the ordinary process, two months are necessary to gain this; and, of course, the interest, storing, and insurance for that period are lost to somebody. In the vacuum process the meat is cured in twelve hours, and the ten per cent. gain is obtained at once, and there is no loss of time, interest, storage, or insurance. In the ordinary method the packer cannot sell profit ably until after two packings and two months of time; in the vacuum process he may sell in one day, reaping the gain of the increase. The longer the meat is in curing, the more the natural juices are extracted by the bring. Hence, when the meat is cured equally well as to its being saved, its quality will be better in the short process, for its juices are not lost in the bring. These advantages apply to all seasons of the year; and by the vacuum process there is a great gain, even in the winter, when meat can be cured by the ordinary process. But there is yet another advantage, and it is this :seat, by the vacuum process, may be cured in the summer as well and as perfectly and safely as in winter; once in the cylinder, it is safe. The cylinder will make it so at once, under any circumstances; but, if necessary, the cylinder may be enclosed in a wooden box, (a non conductor and the space between the case and cylinder filled with powdered charcoal. This at once makes a refrigerator, and with the bring, a temperature approaching freezing point may be maintained during the whole time of curing. In the west, less capital for the purchase of meat will be necessary if the vacuum process be adopted; for time, interest, storage, and insurance will be saved. But to the west it will give yet another advantage: it will enable them to commence packing earlier. Not unusual is it for them, at Cincinnati and It. Louis, to be closed up in December with ice, and a stop put to shipment. If packing can commence in October, the loss of cold weather in feeding and the staying power of ice will be obviated. A honor a be eve is fatted more easily in v arm than in cold weather. But neither can be killed and cured in warm weather by the ordinary process: by the vacuum process they may. To pack in the ordinary way you must feed longer, and that even with a scarcity of food, to get to the cold weather, that you may safely cure; and by no means can you meet a present demand or a rising market. By the vacuum process you obviate long feeding, warm weather, (and that may occur even at midwinter to spoil meat cured in the ordinary mode) and you may meet a present demand or arising market, without loss of interest, storage, or insurance. It may be objected that there is an expense in the vacuum process not incurred in the ordinary one. In the ordinary process you cure and wait two months, and then re pack for inspection, or to keep for family use. In the vacuum process you cure and pack, and are done; and the two packings of the. 1 163 ordinary mode are more expensive than the curing and packing of the vacuum process. Hence there is economy in capital and out lay, in time and expense subsequent to the firs packing. To this is to be added, that the meat is better on account of the retention of its natural juices in a greater degree. Were all comparison between the two methods ends. The advantages of the vacuum process, besides, are all its own. Hitherto, when meat got skippered or painted, it was lost; now, it can be saved. If skippered when placed in a vacuum in the cylinder, the skippers come to the surface of the meat, and perish for want of air. The meat is then taken from the cylinder, the skippers removed, and the meat returned to the cylinder and again charged with pick le, and is again perfect. If meat be painted, it is placed in the cylinder and charged with a weak solution of lime; taken out, dried, and returned to the cylinder, and again charged with pick le; and then it is difficult to distinguish it from sound meat. Dams and bacon, old, blackened, and spoiled in appearance, will not take in pick le by immersion : subjected to the vacuum process, they may, and in a few hours be restored to fresh appearance, and after smoking be equal to new ones. Seat just killed and warm may be put, in midsummer, into the cylinder, and cured in twelve hours perfectly. By sleeping, it cannot be cured a all in warm weather; in vacuum, it may be at all seasons. Beef cured in the vacuum is done and packed in a day, and has gained its full increase. Cured by sleeping, it at once loses five per cent, and takes months to regain its loss and add the usual gain arising from packing. In hot climates, meat cannot be cured by sleeping at any season; by the vacuum it can in any climate at all seasons. In ordinary packing, sugar, spices, or acid may be added to the bring but in 'he vacuum process they will be more perfectly taken up, and the meat more highly favored. The vacuum process is applicable to all kinds of meats; and all kinds of fluids may be in fused into meats by it. A variety of antiseptics besides salt will preserve, if they can be injected into the meat; but before the meat could take them by sleeping, it would be spoiled in any weather but the cold est, and in the cold est would be stale first. By the vacuum these may be injected at once, and the meat favored by these peculiarlypreservative fluids To the west it offers great facilities and economies, as the west is now i great meat grower and packer But this invention is truly a great boon to the people of the south. Theyiniw bring their pork and beef from the west. Hereafter they may cure it for themselves. Now, they cannot, with a certainty of keeping, even in winter. With Mr. Davisons process they may cure at all seasons. Hereafter they may cure with safety and economy. They may thus become not only their own pork and beef growers, but they may add pork and beef to their exports. I need, in time, it may fairly be predicted that the region of country on the gulf of Mexico will be the only country that can export pork and beef profit ably. Her climate will grow it without expense, for her pastures are ever green; and her fields may ever be filled with pork fattening esculents. In no region does a good how do better than in a 1 164 warm one. In the 'cotton and sugar region every planter may himself make all his bacon, for he is now able to cure it. To families of farmers, living in the country, it offers the means of having fresh meat during the summer Without waste; for, what cannot be eaten fresh can be packed, and will be the best pickled meat, as it will be recently cured. There is yet another view in which this invention will wonderfully serve farmers and planters. By it they can impregnated wood with salt, and the wood will be indestructible; or may turn it to stone, measure ly, and it shall yet be flexible, and can never rot, and only be lost by wear. By it singles for houses, and posts for fences, may be made indestructible. To do this it is only necessary to impregnated them with bring thoroughly. But it may be carried still further, and the wood turned wholly to stone and thus : The wood is first charged with salt, then with sulphate of iron, and dried, then charged with a solution of m urate of lime; this latter, coming in contact with the sulphate of iron, decomposes the wood and forms an insoluble compound sulphate of lime, or gypsy m. The wood then becomes stone, and yet retains tough ness. The chief merit of this apparatus is its extreme simplicity and the economy with which it operates. The solution of salt, or bring, which is used in most cases, both for curing meat and wood, is not costly. To more of it is expended than the meat or wood takes up; the balance is returned to the cistern, and serves for another or other operations. If a little sweet ening matter or spices be added, the cost is not greatly increased; and for the other operations contemplated upon wood the same applies, for most of the required solutions are made from the cheapest ingredients. The apparatus, constructed of metal, will last for centuries. If it should get out of order, the rude st mechanics in the country can put it to rights. A boy of fourteen years of age can work it as well as a man. In fine, although many of the principles involved are not new ones, yet it so happens that no other apparatus heretofore invented rendered them of public utility, on account of great expense, while, by this one, they can be made practically, cheaply useful. A. S. New York, December 16, 1845. From the American Agriculturists. Davi Sons Patent Process For Curi Of Meat. The undersigned is authorized by the patentees to sell patents for the using and sale of Davisons apparatus for curing meats, and preserving timber, and also for the sale of rights for States. By this process, all kinds of meat can be perfectly cured in twelve hours, and in warm weather as well as cold. It leaves all the juices in the meat, and of course it makes a better article. Bacon cured in it may be put to smoke in two days. It is just such an article as every planter in the south should have. Applications for rights and single machines may be made to the subscribe r. The price of the machines is from      $75 to                    $300, according to size, A. B. Allen, 187, Later street, Leg Work,

Dear Of  R: In my last from Berlin, I mentioned that I intended to assist the convention of German agriculturists at Breslau. I arrived a day before the commencement, entered my name as a member, and assisted the opening of the first meeting. There were upwards of a thousand agriculturists from the different parts of Germany; each State was represented by some deputies from their respective monarchs, and it was highly interesting to hear the debates on the different subjects of agriculture, in which the princes, counts, &c, joined with the rest and they took as much interest and evinced as much knowledge as most of the ordinary farmers themselves. These conventions, which have been held for nine years, (every year at another city of Germany) have already had a very beneficial influence the farmer sees that his occupation is not only respectable, but worthy, and important to the attention of every member of the society. The questions were debated in separate sections, and to me that of wool was of the highest interest. Silesian has now the reputation of raising the finest wool. Samples of wool were exhibited in a large room, from all parts of Germany, also Hungary, Russia, New Holland, and some of thealpaca. I spent most all my time in that room, to examine into the different characters of wool from the different countries, and especially those which resemble ours the most in regard to climate and treatment. I obtained a collection of wool which can nowhere be got except at such an occasion, and I was told this was the only exhibition of that kind ever seen. A new species of <a name="potatoes1489"><mark>potatoes</mark></a> was exhibited, of which I obtained some bulb. It is an early <a name="potato1050"><mark>potato</mark></a>, and ri pens the middle of June; it is different from any I ever saw; they look like cochons, of the size of an egg. The samples of flax and hemp were beautiful, and Silesian tries to sustain its reputation as a flax growing country; it was its staple article for centuries, and it will ever be such. I had various conversations with the principal flax and hemp growers in regard to the treatment, and hope to lay before you such communications as will be interesting and useful for our country. I saw several new machines for breaking hemp, one of which proved very useful and practical, of which I made a sketch. The citizens of Breslau (a city of 100,000 inhabitants) exerted themselves to make their guests during the time as pleasant as possible. All the different clubs opened their establishments for us. A rich count, of the name of Meckel, gave a splendid ball and supper at his palace, where all the beauty and grandeur of the country around, and of the city, were assembled; diamonds, orders, ri bands, stars, medals, &c, and all kinds of distinctions of honor, were passed together. The city struck a medal in honor of the occasion, one of which I shall bring, you. The King gave a great dinner at the chateau; and on Monday there. 116 was a cattle show, distribution of prizes for the best breed of horses, cows, and sheep, a horse race, and a great procession, in which the different agricultural occupations were exhibited the country people all in their national costume; and, after all was over, and the assembly of more than 100 000 people had dispersed, the city gave us (in a beautifully decorated and illuminated garden) a supper, and closed with splendid fireworks. Saturday evening a piece was performed in the theatre, written for the occasion by a poet of Breslau, in which Teres shows the importance and beauty of agricultural occupation. The agricultural implements cannot be compared with those of America they are clumsy, and against all rules of mechanical science : here lies the fault of Germany. Science is taught at the universities, with great care and perfection, but the practical results have not yet found their way down to the common man. The system of common school education throughout Germany is excellent, but the preparatory schools for the different branches of occupation, as trade, commerce, &c, are wanting. I recommend myself to your friendship, and remain your obedient servant, Of. L. Flei Schmann. On. E. Burkep. Of called on the director of the I imperial Holy technical School, Mr. Prechtl, who very kindly initiated me in all the details of the Austrian patent laws, which are the most liberal I have learned yet. I shall have all the laws, information, and forms of their patents, which will beat your command. He also laid before me the yearly publication of expired patents, in which an extract of the specification, or, where the specification is of importance, the whole is given, with drawings; there are only three volumes now, and I consider it very important for our office. I intend to procure it, and all such works as I find interesting, and send it hem on to Washingtonrules of German convention of farmers, and subjects for discussion from London Gardeners' Chronicle, omitted for want of roomS168
. Appendi X No. 38. Charcoal Road. The process of making such a road is described by a writer in the Cleveland Herald, as follows : "timber from six to eighteen inches through is cut twenty-four feet long, and piled up length wise in the centre of the road about five feet high, being nine feet wide at the bottom and two at the top, and then covered With straw and earth in the manner of coal pits. The earth required to cover the pile, taken from either side, leaves two good sized ditches, and the timber, although not split, is easily charred; and, when charred, the earth is removed to the side of the ditches, the coal raked down, to a width of fifteen feet, leaving it two feet thick at the centre and one at the sides, and the road is completed road of this kind is now being made in the Cotton Good swamp, nearB1isfield, in Michigan. From the writer above quoted we learn that about seventy rooms are completed, twenty of which have been used for the last seven months, and the balance for three months; and as it is on the great thoroughfare west, and as, in addition, on an average, sixteen heavy loaded teams to and from an a sherry pass over it daily, it has been very well tried during the winter and spring, and yet there is no appearance of ruts, but it presents an even, hard surface. The company making the road pay the contractors at the rate of    $660 a i le. The road is said to become very compact, and to be free from mud or dust. On. Misha Whittlesey, and Mr. Newton, an engineer who  inspected the Bliss field road above mentioned, state that they passed over it the morning after a rain." At each end of the different sections of the coal road the mud on the cause way was fellow deep where there was that depth of earth, and nearly or quite half axle tree deep where the logs were broken; when, on the coal road, there was not the least standing, and the impress of the feet of a horse passing rapidly over it was like that made on hard washed sand, as the surf recedes, on the shore of the lake. The water is not drained from the ditches, and yet there are no ruts or inequalities in the surface of4hecoal road, except what is produced by more compact packing on the line of travel. We think it is probable that coal will fully compensate for the deficiency of limestone and gravel in many sections of the west, and, where a road is to be constructed through forest land, that coal may be used at a fourth of the expense of limestone too. No. 140. 1169APPENDI X No. 39. Nati   Onal Conventi   Of Of: Farmers And Of  Of Culturi Sts. Mr. Robinson, of In diana, from the committee to prepare and dress to the people of the United States, reported that they had agreed upon the following address, which they now submitted to the convention for itsconsiderationTo the friends of improvement in the science of agriculture, horticulture, and silk culture, in the United Statesthe convention of delegates representing these important interests, now holding their third annual meeting under the call of the American  institute of New Work, address their brethren who have not the good fortune to be with us upon this occasion, to congratulate them upon the fact that the course of improvement in the cultivation: of the earth is still onward. And why should it not be so? We possess a country of rich soil, and a climate reaching from the line of tropical plants to that of a region so cold that man must resort to other means for support besides cultivating the earth. But, with all our advantages of soil and climate, there appears to be a conceded opinion among all the cultivates of the earth, that they do not enjoy the advantages and comforts enjoyed by other classes of society, who never knew what it was to earn their bread by the sweat of the brow. The cotton planter of Mississippi tells us that he cannot support his laborers upon the product of his plantation, because the. price of cotton is too low. But would not a more careful management, and a more diversified culture, obviate his difficulty ?a? Preis not required to raise cotton alone his soil and climate are equally adapted to raising wool; tobacco, also, of the finest quality, will grow where cotton: will, and no part of the country can except his section of the Union for raising fruit. The remedy for over production and low prices of cotton must be a more diversified culture and greater amount of home productions of all the things for which the cotton region is now tributary to the north. We are gratified to learn that the cultivates of sugar do not complain of their present prospects -in all the cane growing region. We do not hear of any extended operation in the manufacture of sugar from corns talks. We regret to learn that throughout several of the southern corngrowingStates there is a great failure in the crop, owing to the excessive drought which has prevailed in nearly all parts of the United :states during the last summer. For this we cannot suggest any remedy, except that, in all our cultivation, we aim to guard against a state of drought i which prevails through all our country to a far greater extent than the contrary during the crop growing season. We hear of the same drought prevailing in Ohio, to so great a degree that' there is not foliage enough to carry the stock through the winter in the northern part of the State. T he soil here is astifficlay, and, from the personal observation of one of the committee during the last summer, he is convinced that the use of the sub soil plough upon741170 this soil would greatly tend to lessen the tendency to loss of crops from t drought. From Paine we hear of an almost total loss of the staple crop of our friends in that cold region of the Union, from that mysterious and very serious disease among the <a name="potatoes1490"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, that has not very in aptly been likened to the cholera in its ravages. It is of the utmost importance that all the information ending to cure this hitherto incurable disease should be concentrated, and for that purpose we recommend that the members of the corresponding committee in the several States, which have been appointed at this meeting, communicate to the committee in this city all valuable facts that they can obtain upon this subject. From the southern part of the wheat growing region we hear great complaints of the ravages of the weevil. The convention are anxious to gather information upon this subject. We learn that the destruction of the crop from this cause has been prevented in some regions by mixing about one bushel of lime with one hundred bushels of wheat, in the barn, which has to be win no wed out before grinding. Unless some discovery is soon made to obviate the difficulty of the weevil, the cultivation of wheat in the southern parts of In diana and I illinois, and in all States south of' that, must be abandoned. The most abundant crop of all that we are informed of, during the present year, is that of peaches in the State of Delaware. To great has the crop been, that we hear of one individual chartering a large steamboat to take the fruit of his own and sons farms to market. The production of wheat the past year, generally speaking, has been over an average crop, and of excellent quality. The crop of corn in the great corn region of the west seems to be very abundant. We also have evidence before us that tends to show that the culture of silk is now beginning to be adopted in families, where we think it may be profit ably confined, while it is abandoned as unprofitable by joint stock companies. We are pleased to learn that wool growing is found to be profitable in all parts of the United States, and that there is an immense field open for the extension of wool growing upon the great prairies of the west, and that the business would be more profitable even than that of cotton in the southern States. But, notwithstanding all the bountiful productions of some crops, there is evidently a general depression of the agricultural class pe reading the whole country. It is one of the objects of this convention to seek out a way by which the condition and character of the cultivates of the American soil can be elevated and improved. For this purpose we recommend the extensive formations of farmers' clubs, and largely increased reading of agricultural papers and other valuable publications, which have, of late years, been so extensively multipled for the farmers use. We also recommend most earnestly to all our common as well as higher schools to adopt, as an unvarying branch of education, subjects calculated to impress upon the minds of the young the necessity of applying science to the cultivation of the earth, and that it is the original and most honorable, as well as the most happy and healthy of all employments. We also recommend that an earnest appeal be made to Congress to adopt at once the recommendation of our father, Wash. S171ington, and establish a " Some Department" for the encouragement and support of the agricultural interests of our country. In aid of these views we offer the following resolutions :resolved, That the American I institute, by whose cooperation this convention was called, be requested to continue their noble efforts in the cause of agricultural improvement, by adopting measures to have this matter brought before the next meeting of Congress. Resolved, That the members of this convention will look upon it as an act of great respect to this body, if the American I institute will again take it upon themselves to publish to the world the proceedings and views of the convention. Resolved, That the alarming situation of a great part of the world at this time, in consequence of the disease called the rot in <a name="potatoes1491"><mark>potatoes</mark></a>, requires the most active, prompt, and untiring exertions of all the producers of this -most important production, to subdue, if possible, the frightful ravages of this disease, and to prove, by successful experiment, that the country which originally produced this invaluable root, one of the most sustaining sources of subsistence to the population of Europe as well as our own country, can provide a remedy to prevent its extinction.
